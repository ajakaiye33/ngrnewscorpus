          "title": "Subsidy: Nigerians to spend N6.7tn on fuel in 2022, NLC, Senate fault N5,000 palliative",
          "text": "Nigerians to pay additional N3.4tn annually on petroleum consumption\n\nNigerians will spend about N6.732tn on the purchase of Premium Motor Spirit, popularly called petrol, within a period of 12 months once the Federal Government stops subsidising the commodity from February next year, investigations have revealed.\n\nThis came to the fore on Wednesday as the Nigeria Labour Congress described government\u2019s plan as a \u201cpenny wise-pound foolish\u201d gamble.\n\nThe Senate and economic experts also faulted the Federal Government\u2019s plan to pay N5,000 each to 40 million Nigerians to cushion the effect of fuel subsidy removal.\n\nThe Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited, Mele Kyari, had on Tuesday announced at a World Bank event in Abuja that petrol would sell for between N320 and N340 per litre from February 2022.\n\nThe current pump price of petrol at filling stations is between N162 and N165/litre, although the product is mostly sold at the upper N165/litre rate due to recent challenges in the downstream oil sector.\n\nThe N165/litre price is basically because the product is being subsidised by the Federal Government through the NNPC.\n\nGoing by the latest revelation of the NNPC boss that subsidy on petrol would end in February and the price jerked up to N340/litre, findings showed that Nigerians would spend about N18.7bn daily for the over 55 million litres of petrol consumed each day across the country.\n\nUsers of petrol would spend about N561bn for the average of 30 days in a month, while in the 12-month period, consumers would pay about N6.732tn.\n\nIn its most recently published monthly operational and financial report, which was for April 2021, the NNPC put the daily petrol consumption in Nigeria at 55.79 million litres.\n\n\u201cTo ensure continuous increased PMS supply and effective distribution across the country, a total of 1.67 billion litres of PMS translating to 55.79 million litres per day were supplied for the month in the downstream sector,\u201d the oil firm stated.\n\nWorking with 55 million litres daily consumption figure and the current price of N165/litre, consumers of petrol are estimated to be currently paying N9.075bn daily and about N277.25bn monthly.\n\nBy increasing the cost of petrol to N340/litre and matching it against the 55 million daily consumption rate, Nigerians would be paying N18.7bn daily for PMS, while their monthly spending would be N561bn.\n\nThis means that the annual fuel consumption bill of Nigerians will be in the region of N6.732tn.\n\nFrom the foregoing, it implies that Nigerians would pay an additional amount of about N283.75bn every month on petrol when the new N340/litre price for PMS comes into effect.\n\nTherefore within a period of 12 months, Nigerians would spend about N3.4tn extra on the current N3.3tn for the purchase of petrol should the Federal Government halt the subsidy regime.\n\nBut the government promised on Tuesday that it had plans to cushion the economic effect of the planned subsidy removal, as it announced plans to replace fuel subsidy with a N5,000 monthly transportation subsidy to the poor.\n\nAccording to her, a monthly transport subsidy in the form of cash transfer of N5,000 will be given to between 30 and 40 million Nigerians.\n\nThe NNPC, being the sole importer of petrol into Nigeria for the past four years, has been subsidising the commodity and has been incurring humongous cost as subsidy.\n\nThis development had severely depleted the oil firm\u2019s remittances to the Federation Accounts Allocation Committee, hence, reducing the monthly allocations to the three tiers of government consistently.\n\nSubsidy removal a tricky issue, it must be well-managed to prevent social backlash \u2014 Experts\n\nBut experts called on the government to be cautious in handling the removal of fuel subsidy considering the harsh economic climate in Nigeria.\n\nA renowned economist and Chief Executive Officer, Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise, Dr Muda Yusuf, told one of our correspondents that the government must be tactical in handling the tricky nature of subsidy removal.\n\nHe said there was a need to creatively manage the transition from the current pricing regime to a fully deregulated arrangement.\n\nThis, he said, was a tricky issue which could pose a serious challenge to government if not tactically managed.\n\nYusuf, who is a former director-general of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, noted that if the policy transition was not properly managed, the risk of a social and political backlash could be quite high.\n\nHe stated that there was no doubt in the sound economic and business case in favour of fuel subsidy removal, \u201cbut the social and political contexts are equally critical.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cCertainly, the subsidy is not sustainable, which is why there is need to accelerate engagement with the relevant stakeholders to come up with a policy transition strategy that is sustainable, realistic and pragmatic.\u201d\n\nA professor of Economist at the University of Uyo, Prof Leo Ukpong, said removing the fuel subsidy would make life harder for Nigerians as there would be increased inflation.\n\nHowever, Ukpong added that removing the fuel subsidy is the right thing to do.\n\nHe stated, \u201cEconomically, it is the right thing to do. You can\u2019t pay lower than what it costs to produce goods. It would end the corruption. Our problem is not the fuel subsidy, it is the corruption around the subsidy.\u201d\n\nHe further described the plan to give Nigerians N5000 as a waste of money, which would not reduce the negative impact of fuel subsidy removal.\n\nHe said, \u201cGiving Nigerians N5000 monthly is a waste of money. It would not help alleviate the negative impact of removing the fuel subsidy.\u201d\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer of Financial Derivatives Company, Bismarck Rewane, on his part, said that while the removal of the fuel subsidy would lead to lesser consumption due to increasing prices, the government would have extra funds to trigger economic growth.\n\nRewane, however, questioned the process and essence of the distribution of the N5,000 transport palliative to 40 million Nigerians, which would likely cost about N2.4tn in one year \u2013 an amount that is N600 billion short of the N3tn for fuel subsidy.\n\nHe said, \u201cN5000 times 40 million is about N200bn a month. It is N2.4tn in one year. This means that the government wants to save N3tn to spend N2.4tn. Now, who are the 40 million people? For instance, I buy petrol but I am not among those who will get N5,000 a month. So, who are those 40 million to get this money? And how will it be disbursed?\u201d\n\nA professor of Economics and Public Policy at the University of Uyo and the Chairman of the Foundation for Economic Research and Training, Prof Akpan Ekpo, said the government needed to provide a form of mechanism that would help reduce the effect on the poor.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere should be a gradual phased-out removal of the fuel subsidy. The removal will make all prices go up. There would be structural inflation because the economy depends on oil and the whole structure of the economy would be affected by the removal of the subsidy.\u201d\n\nFuel subsidy putting pressure on govt revenue, its removal becoming unavoidable \u2013 LCCI\n\nThe Director-General of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Dr Chinyere Almona said that the removal of subsidy was becoming more unavoidable looking at the pressure it placed on government revenue.\n\nShe said the chamber had always advocated the need to have a fully deregulated oil and gas sector in Nigeria with cost-reflective pricing for the oil products. Spending up to N250bn monthly on fuel subsidy at a time when the debt to revenue ratio was above 73 per cent, according to her, was not economical.\n\nShe said that an immediate implication of removing the subsidy would be the increase in transport and logistics which would translate into higher costs for goods and services, rising inflation, increased poverty from diminishing purchasing power, and a likely rise in the unemployment rate.\n\n\u201cHowever, with more money freed for other purposes, the government should be able to spend more on utilities to cushion the effects of the removal. With cost-reflective pricing, smuggling of the products to neighbouring countries will reduce due to reduced margins.\u201d\n\nAlmona also raised a concern about the plan of the Federal Government to disburse N5,000 to 40 million poor Nigerians.\n\nShe said, \u201cOn the proposed N5,000 to be given to some people, we always wonder how the selection is made and from what database or register. What is the guarantee that the money will end up with the right people needing the intervention? One of the biggest problems with our social investment programmes is that we do not have a systematic methodology on how beneficiaries are selected.\u201d\n\nCost of doing business will increase, fuel-induced inflation inevitable \u2013 MAN\n\nThe Director-General of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria, Mr Segun Ajayi-Kadir in a statement said, \u201cRegardless of the arguments back and forth on the issue, PMS remains a commercial product. It is therefore not insulated from the laws of demand and supply.\n\n\u201cFrom an economic point of view, and that is the area I am comfortable to talk about, it should not come as a surprise. The rise in the price of crude oil should signal the inevitable increase in the landing cost of PMS in the country. You have oil marketers importing the fuel with the need to recover their costs and make a profit. Taken together, it is inevitable that the pump price of PMS will increase.\n\nHe however, said fuel-induced inflation might arise. \u201cThe increase in the cost of transportation \u2013 and the multiplier effect on other costs \u2013 that will accompany the more than 100 per cent increase will erode the disposable income of the average Nigerian.\u201d\n\nHe said it would also increase the cost of doing business for manufacturers and small business owners.\n\nOn his part, the Deputy President of the Nigeria Labour Congress, Joe Ajaero, described as illogical the planned payment of N5,000 palliative after the removal of petrol subsidy.\n\nAjaero, however, told The PUNCH that the matter would be discussed by the NLC at a larger meeting.\n\nNLC rejects subsidy removal, says it\u2019s a foolish gamble\n\nAlso, the congress in a statement on Wednesday by its President, Ayuba Wabba, rejected the planned fuel subsidy removal.\n\nIt said the government\u2019s thoughts on the move was cloudy, describing it as a \u2018penny wise pound foolish gamble.\u2019\n\nThe congress described the move as a recipe for aggravated hyper-inflation.\n\nIn a statement titled, \u2018Nigerian workers refuse to take the bait,\u201d the congress said, \u201cThe contemplation by government to increase the price of petrol by more than 200 per cent is a perfect recipe for an aggravated pile of hyper-inflation and astronomical increase in the price of goods and services.\n\n\u201cThis will open a wide door to unintended social consequences such as degeneration of the current insecurity crises and possibly citizens\u2019 revolt. This is not an outcome that any sane Nigeria wishes for.\u201d\n\nWabba said the discussion between the Federal Government and the World Bank is a monologue, adding that the NLC would continue to insist on its rejection of deregulation based on import-driven model.\n\nThe NLC President said it was difficult to convince Nigerian workers why the country is the only nation among the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries that could not produce its own refined petroleum products and thus adopts the neo-liberal import production model of refined petroleum products.\n\nHe added, \u201cWe wish to reiterate our persuasion that the only benefit of deregulation based on import-driven model is that Nigerian consumers will infinitely continue to pay high prices for refined petroleum products.\n\n\u201cThis situation will definitely be compounded by the astronomical devaluation of the naira which currently goes for N560 to US dollars in the parallel market. Thus, any attempt to compare the price of petrol in Nigeria to other countries would be set on a faulty premise as it would be akin to comparing apples to mangoes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe wish to warn that the bait by government to pay 40 million Nigerians N5,000 as palliative to cushion the effect of astronomical increase in the price of petrol is comical, to say the least.\n\n\u201cThe total amount involved in this queer initiative is far more than the money government claims to spend currently on fuel subsidy. Apart from our concerns on the transparency of the disbursement given previous experiences with such schemes, we are wondering if government is not trying to rob Nigerians to pay Nigerians? Why pay me N5000 and then subject me to perpetual suffering\n\n\u201cClearly, government thoughts on the so-called removal of fuel subsidy is cloudy and appears to be a \u201cpenny wise-pound foolish\u201d gamble. It is clear that the palliative offered by government will not cure the cancer that will befall the mass of our people who suffer the double jeopardy of hype-inflation while their salaries remain fixed.\u201d\n\nThe Senate also faulted plans by the N5,000 to 40 million Nigerians as transportation expenses.\n\nBut the Chairman, Senate Committee on Finance, Senators Solomon Adeola, told journalists on Wednesday that there was no provision for N5,000 for the said monthly stipend for 40 million Nigerians, in the 2022 budget currently before the National Assembly.\n\nHe said the executive would have to bring the proposal to the parliament for approval before it could start its implementation.\n\nHe said there is no way the executive would take a unilateral decision on a programme that would gulp N2.4tn without getting the approval of the parliament\n\nHe also queried the criteria that the executive would use to determine the beneficiaries of the transportation allowance.\n\nHealth workers under the aegis of the Joint Health Sector Union also cautioned the Federal Government over the proposed increase in fuel prices.\n\nThe spokesperson for JOHESU, Olumide Akintayo in an interview with one of our correspondents advised the Federal Government to look for other alternatives to solve the issues surrounding the fuel subsidy.\n\nMeanwhile, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Dr Zainab Ahmed, has revealed that with zero remittance from the Nigerian National Petroleum Company to the federation, the Federal Government can no longer sustain petroleum subsidy costs which are currently about N250bn monthly.\n\nAhmed disclosed this while briefing State House Correspondents on Wednesday after the week\u2019s Federal Executive Council meeting presided over by the President, Major General MuhammaduBuhari (retd.), at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.\n\nBy Sunday Aborisade, Friday Olokor, Adelani Adepegba, Okechukwu Nnodim, Amarachi Orjiude, Sami Olatunji, Dayo Adenubi, Deborah Tolu-Kolawole, Stephen Angbulu and Solomon Odeniyi\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Gov. Nyesom Wike of Rivers State, on Tuesday urged the Federal Government to disregard sentiments in establishing more campuses of the Nigerian Law School.\n\nWike stated this when members of the Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters, led by its chairman, Sen. Michael Opeyemi Bamidele, paid him a courtesy visit at the Government House in Port Harcourt.\n\nWike said approval for any new campus of the Nigerian Law School in the country should be based on needs assessment and not on political sentiment.\n\nHe noted that with the paucity of funds to the Nigerian Law School by the Federal Government, States with capacity to build new campuses of the institution should be encouraged to do so based on the model provided by the Council of Legal Education.\n\nThe Governor explained that due to the current insufficient carrying capacity of the Nigerian Law School, there had been clamour for proliferation of more campuses across the country, but cautioned that this must not be done on the basis of political sentiment.\n\nWike stated that two years ago when he attended the call to bar ceremony at the Abuja campus of the Nigerian Law School, he was appalled by the decrepit infrastructure in the school.\n\nAccording to him, this was what spurred the Rivers State Government to build 900-bed space hostels and 1,500 capacity auditorium for students in Yenagoa campus, and then, the subsequent construction of a new campus in Port Harcourt.\n\n\u201cFrom the record I checked, Nigerian Law School has never gotten more than N61 million to fund the Law School yearly. And I made a special appeal to support to Council of Legal Education to rehabilitate the campus in Abuja, and the Director General said no, we have more problems in Yenagoa, leave Abuja.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll never allow your slave to attend the campus in Yenagoa. And I want to thank the DG for being a true Nigerian. As I speak to you today, Rivers State government is investing not less than N5.1 billion on the Yenagoa campus. What is our interest? Our interest is to contribute to the development of legal education in Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nWike suggested that based on the Federal Government\u2019s inability to sufficiently fund the Nigerian Law School, any state government that desires to have a campus should approach the Council of Legal Education for approval.\n\n\u201cI will appeal, in solving this carrying capacity problem, let\u2019s not also create other problems. It is a professional school and so we must be guided. If any state wants to have a Law School there must be a model,\u201d he said.\n\nWike explained that the construction of Nabo Graham Douglas campus of the Nigerian Law School in Port Harcourt will cost the Rivers State government N16 billion.\n\nHe said that everything that is supposed to be in a Law School will be in the Port Harcourt campus when completed early next year.\n\nThe Governor also disclosed that once the project is completed and handed over to the Council of Legal Education, the State government will also provide subvention to the Council to run the campus for the next four years.\n\nIn his speech, Sen. Bamidele, the Chairman, Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters, said they were in the State to assess the progress of work at the Port Harcourt campus of the Nigerian Law School.\n\nBamidele commended Gov. Wike for his intervention to build a befitting campus of the Nigerian Law School in Rivers State. (NAN)",

The growing trade relationship is commendable but we need to improve on it so that we can benefit from your technological advancement in agriculture sector particularly.\n\n\u201cWe need to introduce a lot of technology so that we increase and enhance our agricultural performance in many areas including the mechanisation of our system here for better and improved output.\n\n\u201cIn the areas of commerce and other businesses, we have a lot to benefit from you just like you also have a lot to benefit from us. I believe that what we want and need more from South Korea is technology that they have been able to develop.\n\n\u201cSo we need an adaptation of some of these technology and we need so much investments from the Korean business community here in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cNigeria has a very big population and we believe that we can provide a good market instead of always importing from other countries which is inimical to our balance of trade.\n\n\u201cWe believe that countries like South Korea should be able to locate very appropriate places within our country and bring some of these technology to be adapted in our country.\n\n\u201cThe relationship between the two countries has been so good. I believe we can take our relationship as parliaments especially the Senate and South Korean parliament because whatever we do, we need to make it more susteanable and enduring and when we develop the relationship that we hope to develop, we also need to see areas of agreement where the countries will have mutual benefits and that is where the parliament will be of immense help because the parliament can enact laws that will support the kind of agreements that we can reach between the two countries,\u201d Lawan said.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nNigeria\u2019s national airliner, Nigeria Air, is expected to take off by April 2022, the Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika, has disclosed.\n\nHe made the disclosure while briefing State House Correspondents on Wednesday after the week\u2019s Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting, presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari, at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.\n\nAccording to Sirika, the national carrier will be run by a company in which the Nigerian government will hold a 5% stake, Nigerian entrepreneurs holding 46%, while the remaining 49% will be reserved for yet to be assigned strategic equity partners, including foreign investors.\n\nThe minister who said the Council gave approvals for the new national carrier, said the national carrier, when operational, will create about 70,000 jobs for Nigerians.\n\nSirika recalled that over 400,000 Nigerians participated in choosing the name which was launched in 2018.\n\nHe said, \u201cToday (Wednesday) in Council civil aviation presented two memoranda. The first one is approval for the award of contract for the provision of Automated Civil Aviation Regulatory Equipment, including software support and training, which will be located in Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport.\n\n\u201cIn summary, this is a software that will allow all of the activities of civil aviation regulation to be done electronically on one platform, including payments, including follow ups on personnel licensing, the medicals, the economic regulation of airlines, safety regulation of airlines and all other businesses within the envelope of civil aviation will be monitored by this single software.\n\n\u201cIt is called \u2018the truth machine\u2019 in quotation in Europe, because all of the truth of regulation of civilization will appear on this platform, it\u2019s an extremely important software that the world has now come to terms with.\n\n\u201cThe contract was given to Messrs. Arif Investment Nigeria Limited, who are representatives of Empik GmbH. This Empik are the creators of this software, one of its kind in the world, at the sum of N1,492,520,325, which will be including 7.5% VAT and completion period of six months. So that\u2019s the first memoranda.\n\n\u201cThe next one also is approval of the outline business case for the establishment of the national carrier and this is the sixth time the memorandum appeared before Council. The sixth time, we got lucky to be passed by Council.\n\n\u201cThe structure of the proposed airline; government will be owning not more than 5%. So 5% is the maximum equity that government will take, then 46% will be owned by Nigerian entrepreneurs. So, if you add that, it\u2019s 51%. So, it\u2019s 51% majority shareholding by Nigerians and then 49% will be held by strategic equity partner or partners that will be sourced during the procurement phase, which is the next phase.\n\n\u201cThis airline, if started, and within the first few years will generate about 70,000 jobs. These 70,000 jobs are higher than the total number of civil servants that we have in the country. Its importance had been well discussed so, I\u2019ll not go back to it. You had discussed it separately also on various fora as to the need for it.\n\n\u201cBut one important item is the AU agenda 2063, which speaks to integration of Africa, which speaks to the cause and trade within Africa that is intra-Africa and to which also another flagship project of AU agenda 2063 called the Single African Air Transport Market (SAATM).\n\n\u201cNow, the only way, the quickest way that you can integrate Africa is by air because if you want to interconnect all the 54 nations of Africa, via rail or road, or waterways, which is even impossible, the quantum of money that you need to do all of these, the time it will take to develop this infrastructure, as well as the maintenance cost, is almost prohibitive.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s doable, it\u2019s time-taking, but with aviation, within a year, once the right policy is in place, like SAATM, you can connect Africa and then of course, the needed integration will happen. Part of AU agenda 2063 So, these are the two memoranda that were submitted, and gladly they were passed by Council.\n\n\u201cThe name is Nigeria Air which of course, if you remember back in time, this was subject to national debate and 400,000 people participated, choose the name, the colour, the logo, everything and it was produced that time. It was launched also in Farnborough as far back as 2018.\n\n\u201cSo, the business case is a public document. It will be on our website, you can download it and we can give you copies. This airline will pick up and start, by God\u2019s grace, on or before April 2022.\u201d\n\nAsked if the April date was sacrosanct, he said: \u201cWell, the best case is that the airline will pick up that period, April 2022 all things being equal.

          "text": "From Adetutu Folasade-Koyi, Abuja\n\nThe Federal Government has rejected the report of the Doris Okuwobi panel of inquiry set up to investigate the attack on unarmed EndSARS protesters at Lekki toll gate on October 20, 2020.\n\nLast year, Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, set up a Judicial Panel of Inquiry on Restitution for Victims of SARS Related Abuses and Other Matters, to investigate alleged massacre of Nigerians at the toll gate. On Monday, November 15, 2021, the committee submitted two reports, including one on shootings by security agencies at the tollgate, to the governor and almost immediately, its contents as well as recommendations leaked online.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nThe governor set up a four-man committee to examine the reports which would culminate in a White Paper to be considered by the Lagos State executive council.\n\nBut, the Federal Government is insisting that security agencies did not massacre Nigerians at the tollgate last October, reiterating that Lekki massacre is \u2018fake news\u2019.\n\nMinister of Information, National Orientation and Culture, Lai Mohammed, disclosed at a press conference in Abuja, yesterday.\n\nReminded that the United States of America\u2019s Secretary of State, Anthony Bliken, who met with President Muhammadu Buhari, in Nigeria, last week, had urged government to ensure accountability and address the grievances of the victims and their families, against the backdrop of the panel\u2019s report, Mohammed replied: \u201cIf it was set up by a panel in the US, would it pass the test?\u201d\n\nAsked why he was also speaking on a report which the state government had yet to issue a White Paper on, even after the president told Bliken that the Federal Government would wait \u2018for the steps taken by states\u2019 and would not impose its ideas on them, he replied: \u201cI\u2019m only commenting on a document which is circulating in public domain, of which many media houses have written editorials; a document of which many have commented freely and it\u2019s only fair government puts across its own side. This briefing has nothing to do and would not prejudice what Lagos State would bring out in its White Paper\u2026\u201d\n\nOn demands for his resignation, the minister said: \u201cThere have been clamour for my resignation since the day I resumed this office, so, I take it in my stride.\u201d\n\nOn the report, he said: \u201cThe submission happened while I was out of the country on national assignment. Unlike many commentators and analysts, we took our time to read and digest the report, and we are now well placed to respond.\n\n\u201cWithout mincing words, let me say never in the history of any judicial panel in this country has its report been riddled with so many errors, inconsistencies, discrepancies, speculations, innuendoes, omissions and conclusions that are not supported by evidence. What is circulating in public space is simply a rehash of the unverified fake news that has been playing on social media since the incident of October 20m, 2020. It is simply incredible that a judicial panel set up to investigate an incident has submitted a report laden with allegations, the same allegations it was set up to investigate in the first instance. Instead of sitting for one year, the panel could have just compiled social media \u2018tales by the moonlight\u2019 on the incident and submitted, saving taxpayers\u2019 funds and everyone\u2019s time. That report is nothing but the triumph of fake news and the intimidation of a silent majority by a vociferous lynch mob\u2026\n\n\u201cLet us, however, point out some key highlights of such discrepancies, errors, omissions, etc. The report threw away the testimony of ballistic experts who testified before it. The experts said, inter alia, in their testimony: \u2018The team finds that from the medical data examined, including the timeline of arrival at medical facility and the nature of the injuries sustained by the victims, who were taken to the five medical facilities, that no military grade live ammunition (high-velocity) was fired at the protesters at Lekki toll gate on October 20, 2020, within the timeframe of reference (18.30- 20.34hrs).\n\n\u201cThat the GSW (Gun Shot Wounds) injuries (four in number between 19:05 and 19:45 hrs), which were examined by the team, can be safely identified as being discharged by either low velocity calibre and/or artisanal/12-gauge firearms (artisanal firearms are locally-fabricated weapons). What is, however, certain is that had the military personnel deliberately fired military grade live ammunition directly at the protesters; there would have been significantly more fatalities and catastrophic injuries recorded. This was clearly not the case.\n\n\u201cThe same panel that said it deemed as credible the evidence of the Forensic Pathologist, John Obafunwa, that only three of the bodies on which postmortem were conducted were from Lekki and only one had gunshot injury went on to contradict itself by saying nine persons died of gunshot wounds at Lekki.\n\n\u201cThe man whose evidence (that he counted 11 bodies in a military van where he was left for dead before he escaped) was found to be crucial by the panel never testified in person. Rather, the video of his \u2018testimony\u2019 was played by someone else. It did not occur to the panel to query the veracity of the testimony of a man who said he was shot and presumed dead but still had time to count dead bodies inside a supposedly dark van at night.\u201d\n\nOn CNN and other foreign media reports on the report, Mohammed said: \u201cThe CNN has been celebrating the leaked report of the panel. In its rush to claim vindication, CNN apparently didn\u2019t even read the report before rolling out the drums in celebration. By that action, CNN has celebrated prematurely and has now committed a double faux pas: First, by relying on unverified social media stories and videos to carry out an investigation of the October 20, 2020 incident at Lekki, where it did not have a correspondent on ground. CNN goofed in its report on the findings of the panel, which fell below the main standards of journalism.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo, yesterday, urged the newly launched Yoruba World Centre (YWC) to champion the return of artefacts that were plundered, looted or illegally taken away from Yorubaland to any part of the world.\n\nHe gave the charge at the launch of International Centre for Yoruba Arts and Culture, initiated by the International Centre for Yoruba Arts and Culture (INCEYAC) in collaboration with the Institute of African Studies, and Yoruba Language Centre, University of Ibadan, held on the campus of the institution.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nOsinbajo said: \u201cYou must join in the global movement to champion the return of artefacts that were plundered, looted or illegally taken away from these shores. Indeed, the centre could serve as a home for such returned items where the immediate provenance or circumstances in which the items were taken is not clear or not known.\u201d\n\nThe vice president said the centre has \u201cinitiated a place that will give context and depth to our understanding of our past, our place and role in the present and hopefully our preparation for the future. A place that will help tell a fuller, deeper and richer story of a proud, creative and colourful people but also of the rich tapestry of cultures, races, ethnicities and faiths of which they are a part.\n\n\u201cAt a more reflective level, we will through this repository and the traditions embedded in the art works and cultural artefacts imbibe the triumphs, challenges, inventions and spiritual heritage of the Yoruba people. We know that well before contact with the Western world, the Yorubas had a fine artistic tradition that was rendered through sculpture and architecture, using wood, bronze, stone, terracotta and brass.\n\n\u201cBut beyond and yet inherent in the splendour and beauty of artworks and the genius of artists, are the histories and stories of our people. The forced relocation of Yoruba people by slave dealers to the Americas and the Caribbean and other unspeakable degradations and atrocities of slavery, and the ways in which Yoruba culture adapted and survived in the dehumanising humiliation, and suffering in those distant and hostile environments. And how here at home, Yoruba culture also had to adapt to the onslaught of colonialism, in Nigeria by the British and in Benin and Togo by the French.\u201d\n\nGovernors Seyi Makinde of Oyo State, Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State, and Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo States, represented by their deputies, Rauf Olaniyan, Noimot Salako-Oyedele, and Lucky Ayedatiwa, respectively, advocated preservation of Yoruba culture, urging the centre not to engage in distortion of fact of history, should not dabble into politics. The centre, according to them, must be used to promote the unity of Yoruba race, national unity and nation building.\n\nAlaafin of Oyo, Oba Adeyemi, who chaired the programme, said the YWC should be a focal point of return and restitution of stolen archives and artefacts by the colonialists, alleging that some archives, which recorded the rich history of the Yoruba were taken away by the colonialists, thereby depriving the younger generation of Yoruba race opportunity to read about their rich history. The archives, he said, now exists in some developed countries.\n\nAare Ona Kakanfo of Yorubaland, Gani Adams, in an interview with newsmen, said: \u201cWe need to document our history, brand our culture and we need to bring pride to our heritage because if you don\u2019t write your history, the enemy will write it in a wrong way and it will affect your pride.\n\nYoruba is one of the most important races in the world. This is a race that has been in existence for more than 15, 000 years. We have a lot of things to document so that the global village can know our importance and where we are coming from.\n\nThe convener of the project, Alao Adedayo, who is the publisher of Alaroye Newspaper, said the idea was first conceived in 2014 with the desire to create a place where researchers could conduct and complete their works on the history, arts and culture of the Yoruba people.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "From Fred Itua, Abuja\n\nGovernors elected on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have upped their pressure on President Muhammadu Buhari not to sign the recently-passed Electoral Amendment Bill into law until contentious areas are resolved.\n\nMany of the governors, who are at loggerheads with senators and members of the House of Representatives from their various states, are not leaving anything to chance in ensuring that the decision by the National Assembly to yank off indirect primaries from the Electoral Act is frustrated.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nOn Monday, APC governors, represented by the caretaker committee chairman of the party and Governor of Yobe State, Mala Buni, met with the president.\n\nOthers present during the meeting were Governors Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi and Abubakar Badaru of Jigawa states respectively.\n\nThough the governors did not speak on the ongoing controversy trailing the removal of indirect primaries from the Electoral Act by members of the National Assembly, sources in the APC, told Daily Sun that the issue featured prominently during the meeting the president.\n\nThe source said the three APC governors, who represented their colleagues, urged the president to return the Amendment Bill to the National Assembly to reflect some of the concerns raised by stakeholders.\n\nThe source said National Assembly leaders, who until now, refused to listen to concerns raised by governors, may lose out in the ongoing power play.\n\nIt said many APC lawmakers were already aggrieved that governors have already hijacked the structures of the party ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\nIt said lawmakers believed that direct primaries would raise their chances of returning to the Assembly if allowed to scale through.\n\nSimilarly, President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan on Monday, met with President Buhari on the same Electoral Amendment Bill. While briefing newsmen, he frowned at politicians lobbying the president not to sign the Bill into law.\n\nUnlike Lawan who kept mum on the issue of indirect primaries yanked off from the Bill, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, last week, during a visit to the President, made a strong case. He explained why the inclusion of direct primaries was good for the country\u2019s democracy.\n\nAnother source said APC governors and leaders were sharply divided on the issue. It said southern leaders, especially those from the South West, believed it was a ploy by their northern counterparts to gain undue advantage in 2023.\n\nIt said the Speaker of the House of Representatives, who is the arrowhead behind the removal of indirect primaries from the 2010 Electoral Amendment Act is also under fire from his South West leaders for taking a decision without due consultations.\n\nAlready, PDP governors and National Assembly members elected on the platform of the party, have voiced out their opposition to the removal of indirect primaries, warning of dire consequences if the decision is not reversed. Unlike the divided APC leadership on the issue, the PDP is united in its call to have the decision rescinded or the entire amendment discarded by President Buhari.\n\nIt was gathered by Daily Sun that governors from the APC and the PDP may meet soon to take a common position on the issue and send a delegation to the President to veto the Bill.\n\nThe source said Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, who is expected to advice the president on the next line of action is siding with governors on the issue.\n\nBut Malami, speaking through his special assistant on media and public relations, Umar Gwandu, said he had no plans to advice the president against assenting to the Bill.\n\n\u201cIt is not true that the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, advised Mr. President for or against the amended Electoral Act.\n\n\u201cThe Honourable Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice has not offered any legal opinion to Mr. President on the matter.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the development, Senate spokesman, Ajibola Bashir, told Daily Sun that it was no longer within their powers to take any decision since the Bill has been transmitted to the president for assent. He said if he returned it, the Senate, vis-a-vis, the National Assembly, would decide on the way forward regarding the contentious issues.\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates).

          "text": "\u00b7 Kyari: NNPC may start invoicing the federation to maintain subsidy\n\n\u00b7 Finance Minister reveals plan to introduce transport grant for vulnerable Nigerians\n\nEl-Rufai: Despite oil prices rising globally, there is no windfall\n\nObinna Chima in Lagos and Ndubuisi Francis in Abuja\n\nThe World Bank yesterday sounded the alarm bells to Nigeria, saying further delay in removing the fuel subsidy which had been described as a major drain and waste on the economy could see the federal and state governments unable to pay salaries from 2022.\n\nThe Lead Economist, Nigeria Country office of the World Bank, Marco Antonio Hernandez, painted a gloomy picture of Nigeria if the country decides to continue with the controversial fuel subsidy, while unveiling the Nigeria Development Update (NDU), a bi-annual report of the multilateral institution, at an even that held in Abuja as well as virtual.\n\nAlso, the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kyari, during a panel session at the event, lamented the huge burden the continuous retention of the subsidy on petrol had been to the corporation, warning that going forward, \u201cthe NNPC may have to start invoicing the federation to be able to maintain subsidy.\u201d\n\nThis is just as the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, reiterated that the government was working on introducing measures that would cushion the impact of fuel subsidy removal on vulnerable Nigerians.\n\nSpeaking further, Hernandez, in the report, urged Nigeria to remove subsidy on petroleum motor spirit (PMS) in February 2022, as prescribed by the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), warning that further delay could worsen the precarious revenue situation confronting the country.\n\nThe report also warned that the present fiscal condition of the sub-national governments would take a turn for the worse in 2022 with 35 of the 36 states unable to meet their financial obligations.\n\nHernandez stated that a situation where N250 billion goes into fuel subsidy monthly was unsustainable as the paucity of revenue confronts the country, especially the sub-national governments.\n\nHernandez who provided insights into the NDU report, titled \u201cTime for Business Unusual,\u201d stated that should the current revenue challenge continue till 2022, only Lagos State would be able to meet its financial obligations.\n\nThe report pointed to mounting fiscal pressures due to lower-than-expected revenues in 2021 and the rising cost of PMS subsidy.\n\nIt stated: \u201cBecause most states rely heavily on inter-governmental transfers, diminished revenue inflows to the Federation Account are jeopardising fiscal sustainability at the state level.\n\n\u201cFor example, in the oil-producing State of Bayelsa federal transfers account for 91 per cent of revenues, and declining transfers caused a 22-percent drop in Bayelsa\u2019s revenues per capita during the year.\n\n\u201cEven in the state of Lagos, which relies the least on Federal transfers, transfers accounted for 29 per cent of revenues in 2020. Most State expenditures cover salaries and administrative expenses, and given their rigid (i.e., nondiscretionary) nature, State-level expenditures are difficult to cut.\n\n\u201cConsequently, lower revenues are likely to intensify pressure on states\u2019 debt stocks and undermine their fiscal sustainability.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, in contrast to past periods of high oil prices, the Nigerian government has this time not been able to fully benefit from the oil boom because oil production has fallen below Nigeria\u2019s estimated capacity and the Organisation of Petroleum Countries (OPEC) quota due in part to rising insecurity and the higher cost of the PMS subsidy.\n\nIt stated: \u201cIn 2022 the federal government plans to spend about 3,000 naira (US$7) per person for health, while the cost of the PMS subsidy for next year could reach 13,000 naira (US$32) per person. Not only is the PMS subsidy costly, but it mainly benefits richer households.\n\n\u201cNigeria has the opportunity to establish a \u201ccompact\u201d with citizens that eliminates the subsidy and uses the savings to provide targeted cash transfers to lower-income-households, invest in job-creating programs, and improve its fiscal position.\u201d\n\nIt stated that the insufficient supply of foreign exchange (FX) issues related to the predictability of exchange rate management, the unsustainable subsidy on premium motor spirit (PMS), burdensome trade restrictions, and the sizeable fiscal deficit financing by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) are undermining the business environment, compounding underlying constraints on domestic revenue mobilisation, foreign investment, human capital development, and the delivery of public services.\n\nThe report noted that despite a strong initial recovery and resurgent global oil prices, Nigeria\u2019s pre-crisis challenges were threatening its post-crisis recovery, highlighting the need to depart from business-as-usual policies.\n\n\u201cEven though Nigeria\u2019s economy exited a pandemic-induced recession, several challenges persist including double-digit inflation, declining incomes, and rising insecurity.\n\n\u201cWhile the government took bold policy measures to mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis, the reform momentum has slowed which hinders Nigeria\u2019s ability to reach its growth potential,\u201d World Bank Country Director for Nigeria, Shubham Chaudhuri said.\n\nThe report prescribed policy options for Nigeria, including addressing fiscal pressures.\n\n\u201cUrgent priorities for the next three to six months include reducing inflation, improving exchange-rate management, mobilising additional oil and nonoil revenues, eliminating the PMS subsidy and redirecting expenditures towards targeted cash transfers and other priority investments, fostering competitive markets, and improving infrastructure.\n\n\u201cWhile Nigeria\u2019s macroeconomic projections have been updated since the previous edition of the NDU, the government\u2019s fundamental policy challenges remain unchanged,\u201d it added.\n\nIn his contribution, Kyari, pointed out that while all over the world, subsidies are introduced to bring cost control and less pains to citizens, in Nigeria, fuel subsidy has become a major fiscal burden that must be eliminated.\n\nThe NNPC boss explained: \u201cToday, we are evacuating about 60 million litres of gasoline from all the depots in the country. It is not national consumption and it is very understandable because of issues such as cross-border smuggling.\n\n\u201cAs long as you have arbitrage, traders don\u2019t see it as a crime, they just take advantage of that and exploit it. What we are dealing with is about N243 billion of fuel subsidy monthly. So, there is no magic around that.\n\n\u201cThis is the reality that we are facing. Going forward in 2022, we simply cannot afford this, we just don\u2019t have the resources. As a matter of fact, the NNPC may have to start invoicing the federation to be able to maintain subsidy.\n\n\u201cWhen you take out N243 billion from your total income every month, you are not able to fund your operations and so you can\u2019t meet your other fiscal obligations. Clearly, there is a challenge in the ability to pay. So, there is a reform going on, particular in the energy sector and no one can stop.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Governor of Kaduna State, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai wondered why the country would continue to allocate more monies to fuel subsidy compared with the allocations to education, roads and the health sectors.\n\n\u201cIs subsidising petrol more important than our health as even in a year we spent significant amount on health due to the pandemic, the budget for subsidy was still higher? Does it make sense?\n\n\u201cIs subsidising petrol about thrice as educating our children and preparing them for the future more important? The capital budget for roads is five times less than our budget for subsidy. We have to ask ourselves as Nigerians whether this makes sense at all,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to El-Rufai, \u201cthis is the first time in Nigeria that oil prices are rising globally, yet, there is no windfall. In fact, we are getting less. Why? Because according to Kyari, subsidy is taking N250 billion per month.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that this month, what the NNPC paid to the federation account, as part of its contribution to the amount to be shared by the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC), was only N14 billion as against the N120 billion stipulated in the budget, and, \u201cwith the threat that next month they would ask the federation account to give them a cheque to cover subsidy.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, we have to ask ourselves if this subsidy still makes sense. Who is benefiting from it other than the smugglers and neighbouring African countries and some rich people? We have to stop this thing that will bring Nigeria to its knees,\u201d the state governor added.\n\nEarlier, in her opening remarks, Ahmed expressed optimism that recent developments in the oil sector, such as the Petroleum PIA 2021, the full reactivation of the four public refineries in the country, and the completion and coming on stream of the three private refineries under construction in 2022, would significantly boost contribution from the sector to economic growth.\n\nAccording to her, subsidies\u2019 regime in the sector remained unsustainable and economically disingenuous.\n\nShe disclosed that ahead of the target date of mid-2022 for the complete elimination of fuel subsidies, the government was working with its partners on measures to cushion potential negative impact of the removal of the subsidies on the most vulnerable at the bottom, which she estimated to be 40 per cent of the population.\n\n\u201cOne of such measures would be to institute a monthly transport subsidy in the form of cash transfer of N5,000 to between 30 \u2013 40 million deserving Nigerians.\n\n\u201cAs a government, we remain committed to our broad objectives of stimulating broad-based growth through diversification and the active participation of the private sector to ensure that our growth is inclusive.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to prioritise investment in critical infrastructure needed to unlock production and supply constraints, to create adequate productive employment and preserve jobs, and to ensure macroeconomic stability and promote poverty reduction and equity.\n\n\u201cI agree with the Report that with the expansion of social protection policies during the pandemic, the government has an opportunity to phase out subsidies such as the PMS subsidy while utilising cash transfers to safeguard the welfare of poor and middle-class households.\n\n\u201cTowards this end, we intend to accelerate our structural reforms, particularly in the power sector, in governance, in business environment to unlock the huge potentials of the economy, scale up social safety net and deepen financial inclusion to reduce poverty and inequality gaps. We will carefully calibrate the sequencing of these reforms to manage their attendant political fallouts,\u201d she added.\n\nAhmed pointed out that digital revolution was looming in Nigeria and waiting to happen spontaneously.\n\n\u201cI agree that Nigeria\u2019s digital economy can transform economic activities by unleashing new productivity gains, offering new services, and improving the government\u2019s efficiency. We see enormous opportunity for our theming youth population in this sector which has largely remained unharnessed with isolated progress and possibilities.\n\n\u201cWe need greater investments in newer and competitive technologies to be made for the provision of critical infrastructure in the telecoms sector to unleash potentials.\n\n\u201cTo protect such investments, government has been mobilising national security outfits, and even local \u2018vigilantes\u2019 to provide added layers of security for the infrastructure, while at same time engaging local communities towards addressing the likely root causes of cases of infrastructure vandalisation,\u201d she added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Maintains stance on Lekki incident\n\n\u2022Panel concocted \u2018massacre in context,\u2019 Lai Mohammed insists\n\nEmmanuel Addeh and\n\nOlawale Ajimotokun in Abuja\n\nThe federal government yesterday officially reacted to the report of the Lagos Judicial Panel of Inquiry (JPI) set up by the Lagos state government to probe the October 20, 2020 #EndSARs protest, insisting that there was nothing in the document to compel it to change its stand on the matter.\n\nThe government which had long held that there was no evidence of the killing of protesters, who among others, were demanding an end to police brutality, dissolution of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) and harassment of young people, stated that the report was based on social media \u201ctales by moonlight\u201d.\n\nSpeaking through the Minister of Information and Culture, Mr. Lai Mohammed, in Abuja, the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration maintained that the report was riddled with errors, inconsistencies, discrepancies, speculations, innuendoes, omissions and conclusions that were not supported by evidence.\n\nThe report which was leaked last week, had revealed that at least 11 persons were killed during the peaceful demonstration at the Lekki Tollgate.\n\nThe report had described as, \u201catrocious, the maiming and killing of unarmed, helpless and unresisting protesters, while sitting on the floor and waving their Nigerian flags and singing the National Anthem , stressing that the act could be equated to a \u201cmassacre in context.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, aside the 11 confirmed dead, four others were presumed dead, while in all, 48 were casualties of the Lekki incident which shook the entire country last year.\n\nIn the 309-page report, the panel had also stated that of the 48 casualties, 24 sustained gunshot injuries, while 15 others were assaulted by soldiers and police, and specifically indicted the army and the police for shooting directly at fleeing protesters who had run into the shanties and the Lagoon.\n\nBut Mohammed, in his assessment, argued that what had been circulating in the public space remained simply a rehash of the unverified fake news that had been playing on social media since the incident last year.\n\nHe posited that it was simply incredible that a judicial panel set up to investigate an incident had submitted a report laden with allegations, the same allegations it was set up to investigate in the first instance.\n\nThe minister opined that instead of sitting for all of one year, the panel could have just compiled social media stories on the incident and submitted, saving taxpayers\u2019 funds and everyone\u2019s time.\n\n\u201cThat report is nothing but the triumph of fake news and the intimidation of a silent majority by a vociferous lynch mob,\u201d he maintained.\n\nIn what he said was a \u201ccritical analysis\u201d of the document, Mohammed alleged that the panelists threw away the testimony of ballistic experts who testified before it.\n\nQuoting the experts, he said the team had told the panel that from the medical data examined and the nature of the injuries sustained by the \u201cvictims\u201d, no military grade live ammunition (high-velocity) was fired at the protesters at Lekki Tollgate on 20th October 2020, within the timeframe of reference, which was 18.30- 20.34 hours.\n\nFurthermore, the minister maintained that the panel did not consider the experts\u2019 position that gunshot wounds sustained, four in number, between 19:05 and 19:45 hours, which were examined by the team, were identified as being discharged by either low velocity calibre and/or artisanal/12-gauge firearms.\n\nHe pointed out that the team of experts had told the panelists that had military personnel deliberately fired military grade live ammunition directly at the protesters; there would have been significantly more fatalities and catastrophic injuries recorded.\n\nThe minister added that the same panel that said it deemed as credible the evidence of the Forensic Pathologist, Prof. John Obafunwa, that only three of the bodies on which post mortem were conducted were from Lekki and only one had gunshot injury went on to contradict itself by saying \u201cnine persons\u201d died of gunshot wounds at Lekki.\n\nHe contended that the man whose evidence that he counted 11 bodies in a military van where he was left thinking he was dead, before he escaped, was said to be crucial by the panel, never testified in person.\n\n\u201cRather, the video of his \u2018testimony\u2019 was played by someone else. It did not occur to the panel to query the veracity of the testimony of a man who said he was shot and presumed dead but still had time to count dead bodies inside a supposedly dark van at night.\n\n\u201cThe panel said trucks with brushes underneath were brought to the Lekki Tollgate in the morning of October 21, 2020, to clean up bloodstains and other evidence, but still found bullet casings at the same site when it visited on October 30, 2020.\n\n\u201cIt said soldiers picked up bullet casings from Lekki Tollgate on the night of October 20, 2020, yet claimed that policemen came to the same spot to pick the same bullet casings on October 21, 2020!\n\n\u201cThe panel was silent on the family members of those reportedly killed, merely insinuating they were afraid to testify. Even goats have owners who will look for them if they do not return home, not to talk of human beings.\n\n\u201cWhere are the family members of those who were reportedly killed at Lekki Tollgate? If the panel is recommending compensation for the families, what are their identities and addresses? Who will receive the compensations when no family members have shown up to date?\n\n\u201cHow did a man who reported seeing the lifeless body of his brother himself ended up being on the list of the panel\u2019s deceased persons? How can a judicial panel convince anyone that the names of some casualties of the Lekki Tollgate incident listed as numbers 3 (Jide), 42 (Tola) and 43 (Wisdom) are not fictitious names.\n\n\u201cWhy did the judicial panel feel compelled to concoct a \u2018massacre in context\u2019 as a euphemism for massacre? A massacre is a massacre. What is massacre in context?\u201d he queried.\n\nAccording to him, the report never mentioned cases of police personnel who were brutally murdered or the massive destruction of police stations, vehicles, e.t c during the EndSARS protest, arguing that it is possible the panel didn\u2019t consider policemen and women as human beings.\n\nIn addition, the minister stated that the report never made any recommendation on the innocent people whose businesses were attacked and destroyed during the protest in Lagos, \u201cbecause it was too busy looking for evidence to support its conclusion of \u2018massacre in context\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is clear, from the ongoing, that the report of the panel in circulation cannot be relied upon because its authenticity is in doubt. Besides, the Lagos State Government, being the convening authority, has yet to release any official report to the public. Neither has the panel done so.\n\n\u201cThe cowardly leakage of an unsigned report to the public is not enough. Assuming the report in circulation bears any iota of genuineness, it is basic knowledge that the report of such a panel is of no force until the convening authority issues a White Paper and gazette on it.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore too premature for any person or entity to seek to castigate the federal government and its agencies or officials based on such an unofficial and \u2018unvalidated\u2019 report,\u201d he posited.\n\nThe minister also took on the CNN for what he said was the celebration of the leaked report, insisting that in its rush to claim vindication, CNN apparently didn\u2019t read the report before rolling out the drums in celebration.\n\n\u201cBy that action, CNN has celebrated prematurely and has now committed a double faux pas: First, by relying on unverified social media stories and videos to carry out an investigation of the October. 20th 2020 incident at Lekki, where it did not have a correspondent on ground.\n\n\u201cCNN goofed in its report on the findings of the panel, which fell below the main standards of journalism. Secondly, CNN rushed to the air to celebrate an unsigned and unverified report that is riddled with inconsistencies, errors, discrepancies, innuendoes. That\u2019s double faux pas by a news organisation that is eager and willing to compromise standards just to claim vindication,\u201d he emphasised.\n\nThe minister added: \u201cThere is absolutely nothing in the report that is circulating to make us change our stand that there was no massacre at Lekki on October 20, 2020. For us to change our stand, a well-investigated report of the incident that meets all required standards and will withstand every scrutiny must be produced and presented to the public.\n\n\u201cThe report in circulation does not meet those requirements. We also appeal to the families of those allegedly killed in Lekki to speak out. It\u2019s untenable to say that some families did not come out because they are afraid. Any parent who is afraid to testify about the death of his or her child is not worth to be called a parent.\n\n\u201cWe reject the notion that our soldiers and policemen massacred innocent Nigerians at Lekki on October 20, 2020. That conclusion is not supported by the weight of available evidence. Indictment for murder is a very serious issue that cannot be done on the basis of allegations and corroborations, as the panel did.\n\n\u201cSuch allegations must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The report in circulation is calculated to embarrass the federal government and its agencies without fool-proof evidence.\u201d\n\nMohammed maintained that the federal government had never condoned the abuse of the rights of Nigerians by security agencies under any guise, hence it disbanded SARS and encouraged states to set up the panels to investigate reports of human rights abuses allegedly committed by the disbanded personnel.\n\n\u201cThe 37 policemen and six soldiers who died across the country during the EndSARS protest are also Nigerians and should not be forgotten.\n\n\u201cThose who have engaged in premature celebration of the report in circulation should now go back and read it thoroughly and tell Nigerians whether it can pass any serious scrutiny.\n\n\u201cWe are saddened that anyone died at all during the Endsars protest as the life of every Nigerian and indeed every human is sacrosanct. As we have disclosed many times, 57 civilians, 37 policemen and six soldiers were killed across the country during the protest, and we commiserate with their families,\u201d the minister stressed.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says it\u2019s time to pay back as economy recovers\n\n\u2022Urges customers to challenge discretionary bank charges\n\n\u2022Leaves MPR unchanged at 11.5%\n\nJames Emejo in Abuja\n\nThe Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, yesterday foreclosed further extension of the regulatory forbearance on its intervention facilities instituted by the apex bank to cushion the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on companies and businesses.\n\nHe said the global economy has since opened up with lockdowns lifted while companies and businesses have witnessed improved revenues, hence the need for borrowers to start repaying their loans.\n\nEmefiele, while addressing journalists after the two-day meeting of the CBN\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) in Abuja, said he does not envisage a likelihood of loan default resulting from the forbearance programme.\n\nThis is just as the MPC yesterday resolved to leave all monetary policy parameters unchanged, retaining the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) otherwise known as the interest rate at 11.5 per cent with the asymmetric corridor of +100/-700 basis points around the MPR.\n\nThe MPR is the rate at which the CBN lends to commercial banks and often determines the cost of borrowing in the economy.\n\nThe MPC also voted to maintain the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) at 27.5 per cent as well as the Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent.\n\nEmefiele said the existing policy stance had so far supported growth and recovery and expressed satisfaction at the moderation in inflation rate which had declined for six consecutive months.\n\nIn an effort to ameliorate the adverse effects of the pandemic on Nigerians and businesses, the apex bank and other financial institutions had reeled out forbearance packages for companies to help them weather the storm.\n\nPart of the programme was the restructuring of the loan repayment plans, moratorium as well as the CBN reducing interest rates on all its intervention programmes to five per cent from nine per cent till March 2022.\n\nThe CBN had extended the moratorium twice following threats posed by the Delta variant of the virus.\n\nHowever, as the forbearance regime draws to a close in March next year, the CBN governor, citing improvement in economic activities, urged businesses to resume loan repayment.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf you recall from our standpoint, we granted a forbearance regime from just two areas.\n\n\u201cOne primarily had to do with the fact that we said all loans that companies and businesses that are impacted adversely by COVID-19, that they should be given about two years, we first started by saying one year, from 2020 to March 2021 and by February 2021, we extended it by one more year when the Delta strain of the pandemic continued. That made it two years that would expire by March 2022.\n\n\u201cAnother aspect had to do with the fact that we said for CBN interventions, that there is a need for us to reduce the interest rate from nine to five per cent. Indeed, another aspect of the intervention or forbearance is that because we knew that the adverse consequences of COVID-19 were resulting in a reduction in the revenue-generating capacity of businesses and companies, we also granted the banks an opportunity to allow their customers to ask for a restructure of their facilities. Maybe if it\u2019s a two-year facility, it would be extended to four years so as to reduce the burden of the cash flow on them.\u201d\n\nEmefiele added: \u201cAnd those were the periods when there was unprecedented lockdown of the global economy. All countries with no exception were on lockdown. Travels came to zero, people were not allowed to leave their homes and in Nigeria, this persisted for about three to four months.\n\n\u201cNow, from around September/October 2020, Nigeria began a process of easing the lockdown and notwithstanding the fact that we still saw that around February/March of 2021 that the Delta strain now reared its head. We still said that businesses should have this forbearance.\n\n\u201cAt this time, we believe that the global economy has opened up; the lockdowns have been lifted and of course, we know the economic damages and fatalities that were caused as a result of the that and I am so sure that not too many counties if at all will in the midst of this pandemic want to embark on a wholesome lockdown any longer.\n\n\u201cParticularly because most countries are all administering vaccines that they think should assist in reducing the impact of the strain of the virus.\n\n\u201cSo we believe that in Nigeria, businesses/companies are back to business, revenues have improved and if revenues have improved then companies or businesses that took loans. If we say the loans for intervention facilities moved from five to nine, if we see that the moratorium of two years expires in March 2022 and of course, the restructure that you have benefitted remains, then naturally we should expect that companies should be able to pay back their loans.\n\n\u201cSo as a result, we do not see any likelihood of an increase of NPLs. Indeed, we have worked so hard to bring the NPLs down from as high as nine, ten per cent about two years ago to the level that it is today which is 5.3 per cent and we are gratified that we are aggressively working NPLs down to the maximum threshold that has been set by the CBN. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any need for anybody to worry at all.\u201d\n\nAlso commenting on the concerns over the arbitrary transaction charges by banks, the CBN governor urged bank customers to study the Guide to Bank Charges- and challenges any discretionary deductions which are not in tandem with the guide.\n\nHe said: \u201cTalking about bank charges, the CBN insists that consumers of bank services, in this case, customers must insist and indeed, if it\u2019s not on CBN website, I am going to ask that we place it on our website- the Guide to Bank Charges- go and read your guide to bank charges.\n\n\u201cYou should not allow any bank to just pass on any discretionary charges on your account that is not contained in the guide to bank charges. Hold it as your bible as you deal with the bank. If you find any that is not consistent, raise an alarm.\n\n\u201cWe have our consumer protection department and we have always advertised our hotlines and emails where you can always reach us and indeed, we have been cases in the past where people have raised an alarm and it has resulted in hundreds if not billions of naira reversal back to customers\u2019 accounts.\n\n\u201cSo, I can say that if you are being charged by any bank for transactions that did not happen or charges that are not inside or stated in the guide to bank charges, you have to ask the bank to reverse it because it is not meant to be there.\u201d\n\nHowever, Emefiele, who read the committee\u2019s communiqu\u00e9, explained that the MPC was gratified that its policy actions in the past had started to yield positive results given the remarkable improvement in GDP which stood at 4.03 per cent during Q3 of 2021 and the 6th consecutive month moderation in inflation to 15.99 per cent in October 2021.\n\nHe said given the level of its conviction about the efficacy of its actions on macroeconomic variables, MPC felt that whereas tightening would further help to rein in inflation aggressively, it nevertheless feels that tightening will increase the cost of funds and constrain output growth.\n\nHe said on the other hand, whereas loosening will lower policy rates, ease liquidity pressures, and stimulate additional credit creation which will boost output growth.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cMPC also thinks that loosening will further widen the negative real interest rate gap and compound the price distortions in the money markets which could fuel inflationary pressures. As for whether to hold its existing stance, MPC believes that the existing monetary policy stance has supported the growth recovery and should be allowed to continue for a little longer for consolidation to achieve the MPC mandate of price stability that is conducive for sustainable growth. The Committee also feels that a hold stance will enable it to carefully appraise the implications of the unfolding global development around policy tapering and normalisation by advanced economies.\u201d\n\nHe said the CBN\u2019s Targeted Credit Facility (TCF) was particularly highlighted by the Committee for its contribution to alleviating poverty at the grassroots adding that the MPC urged the bank to continue its support through the TCF to ensure that more people benefit from this programme.\n\nHe also said that with the announcement to commence monetary policy normalization by the US Fed and impending interest rate liftoff by central banks in some advanced economies, the MPC called on the federal government to intensify its drive towards a counter-cyclical fiscal policy in view of the imminent tightening of external financial conditions.\n\nCommittee members, therefore, noted with concern that the gradual normalisation of monetary policy by this group of economies would dampen the recovery of several emerging market and developing economies in the short to medium term due to the sharp reversal of capital flows.\n\nThe committee also evaluated the developments in China relating to the reoccurring pandemic, power outages and crisis in the property market, noting the likely impact these could have on Nigeria as a major trading partner.\n\nThe committee, therefore, called on the CBN to ensure that the necessary buffers are put in place to shield the economy from the downside risks associated with these developments.\n\nIn general, members expressed confidence in the ongoing policies of both the monetary and fiscal authorities which in their view was the hallmark of the current recovery and restoration of macroeconomic stability in the country as well as called on both authorities to look beyond the current position and plan towards attracting sustainable investment flows to Nigeria.\n\nWe are Excited Investors Are Scrambling for First Bank Shares, Says CBN Gov\n\nAlso, responding to a question about the ongoing development at FirstBank Nigeria Limited, Emefiele in commenting on tussle for majority stake in the bank, said the financial institution was too big to be owned by a single individual.\n\nHe also expressed satisfaction that, \u201cpeople are scrambling today for the shares of First Bank,\u201d which he said had been deserted six years ago, largely because of the burden of non-performing loans.\n\nThe CBN governor said, \u201cI think it\u2019s good for us to cast our minds back to the position of First Bank six years ago.\n\nSix years ago, when the CBN started its programme of looking at the bank to reposition it; let\u2019s not forget that FBN remains the oldest bank in Nigeria \u2013 1894. It is a strong, aggressive, domestically important bank in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIf anything happens to First Bank, it means something has happened to the Nigerian banking system. And that is why we are taking our guidance on how to get the bank back afoot very seriously. Six years ago like I said, because of the aggressive build-up of non-performing loans in the books of First Bank, the share price of First Bank was about N2 per share.\u201d\n\nContinuing, Emefiele said: \u201cWe took it on \u2013 everybody was running away from the shares of First Bank. But because we have cleaned the bank\u2019s balance sheet now, the NPLs have dropped significantly, people are seeing that this money making machine, First Bank is back again on the race for profitability and they are now competing for the shares of First Bank.\n\n\u201cSo, why should I quarrel that people are competing for the shares of First Bank? The last time I looked at it, it was N11.55 kobo during the weekend and I was happy to see that they are competing for the shares.\n\n\u201cBut of course, they should all know that First Bank is so big that not one person can say he owns First Bank.\n\nThey are just one and they should see themselves as representing others in running the bank. I have read the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) clarifies the issue of shareholding percentages\u2026and indeed they are the people that are supposed to do so. Our examiners have also continued to look at it.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cAnd I think we should take SEC\u2019s position because SEC is the regulator of the capital market. We will take their position and they would give guidance on this subject but of course, as it affects the running and operation of the bank, we would take preeminence in ensuring that the right things are done.\n\n\u201cNaturally, returns are sent to the CBN about people and individual shareholders and of course, if our position is not in tandem with the position of SEC, we will talk to SEC about it and we will also advice the public but so far, I will say that we should take the position of SEC as a regulator of the capital market because regulating share price, ownership is the sole responsibility of SEC and we would not want to override SEC the regulator on these issues but we would continue to work with them and we have very good relationship with them.\n\n\u201cI would just say that I am very happy that people are scrambling today for the shares of First Bank.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",
          "summary": "Emefiele, while addressing journalists after the two-day meeting of the CBN\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) in Abuja, said he does not envisage a likelihood of loan default resulting from the forbearance programme.\nHowever, as the forbearance regime draws to a close in March next year, the CBN governor, citing improvement in economic activities, urged businesses to resume loan repayment.\nHe said: \u201cIf you recall from our standpoint, we granted a forbearance regime from just two areas.\nHe said: \u201cTalking about bank charges, the CBN insists that consumers of bank services, in this case, customers must insist and indeed, if it\u2019s not on CBN website, I am going to ask that we place it on our website- the Guide to Bank Charges- go and read your guide to bank charges.\n\u201cYou should not allow any bank to just pass on any discretionary charges on your account that is not contained in the guide to bank charges.",

This is retribution for my principled opposition to the anti-student and anti-worker policies of the University administration in my capacity as a leading member of the Education Rights Campaign (ERC) and a renowned student activist on campus,\u201d Nurudeen wrote in a press release.\n\nERC is a platform of activists organised on Nigerian campuses to campaign for free education.\n\nHis arrest has been described as contentious as it was carried out by officers of the State Security Service (SSS), also known as the Department of State Services (DSS) in a Gestapo-like manner.\n\nSeveral organisations and unions, including the Socialist Workers\u2019 League and the Lagos State University Student Union, condemned Nurudeen's arrest, describing it as excessive.\n\nNurudeen has been described as a passionate advocate against the anti-student\" and \"anti-worker\" policies of the school with the way he was not afraid to criticise the school management.\n\nHe was also said to have got married six months before his death, leaving behind a three-month-old child.",

          "text": "Zainab Ahmed, minister of finance, budget and national planning, says the government can no longer sustain petrol subsidy payments which currently stand at about N250 billion monthly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBriefing state house correspondents after the federal executive council (FEC) meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday, Ahmed said the payments were no longer sustainable.\n\nThe finance minister explained that the federal government will end fuel subsidy by 2022 and replace it with a N5000-a-month transportation grant to the poorest Nigerians.\n\n\u201cSo the Petroleum Industry Act has a provision that all petroleum products must be deregulated. And in the 2022 budget, we made a provision to assume that at the maximum by the end of June, we must exit subsidy,\u201d Ahmed said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo this last FAAC, the subsidy cost to the federation was N243 billion. So if we look at a cost of about 250 billion per month, and it has been increasing consistently. So we\u2019re expecting something around N120 billion per month from NNPC. And now we\u2019re getting to a point where NNPC is remitting near zero.\n\n\u201cAnd if we don\u2019t stop we will get to a point where they will tell you: \u2018Pay me this for managing the fuel provision in the country\u2019.\n\n\u201cSo if you take 250 billion times 12 months, that is about N3 trillion. If we don\u2019t remove that, that is what it is costing us. This is money that we can use to apply to health and education.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe intervention we want to provide, it\u2019s for between 20 to 40 million people and there is still a lot of work going on. We have a committee that is chaired by His Excellency the Vice President, state governors and a few of us ministers as members. So we have to have a landing as to the exact number between 20 to 40 million.\n\n\u201cWe already agreed it will be N5000 and we have also agreed that the remittances have to be done digitally. So the eNaira will help but so also will the various payment platforms that are currently available. What we will not do is paying people in cash.\n\n\u201cSo, the transfers that people will receive through one kind of electronic money or the other and it\u2019s meant to be for a period of six, nine or 12 months.\n\n\u201cSo, these are things that we are still in negotiation because it\u2019s still money that would have to come from the federation account. So everybody that is a member of FAAC will have to agree on the numbers. The maximum will be 12 months, the minimum will be six months.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe finance minister also said she briefed the council on the third quarter gross domestic product (GDP) report for 2021.\n\nShe affirmed that the result showed an improvement from the contraction witnessed in 2020.\n\nAsked why the growth does not impact Nigerians, Ahmed said that the impact of the economic growth being recorded will not be felt until it surpasses the population growth rate.\n\n\u201cLet me say that, again, the Nigerian economy is growing. And right now we witnessed, four consecutive quarters of GDP growth,\u201d Ahmed said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe also said that we aspire to continue to push this growth to the point where the growth supersedes the growth in our population because that\u2019s the time that people will feel the benefits.\n\n\u201cSo, we\u2019re pushing the bar at the third quarter of 2021. The average annual growth is now 3.3%. Our population growth is roughly about 3.2%. So, we still need to do a lot more for people to feel this.\n\n\u201cBut the fact that the service sector is not in positive territory, it also means that people will begin to feel the difference because it is the service sector that has the first direct impact on people.\u201d",

          "title": "Bolt partners with MAX to expand its vehicle finance scheme in Nigeria",
          "text": "In Nigeria, insufficient purchasing power among middle-class citizens, coupled with limited or no access to vehicle financing, puts car purchases out of reach for over 90% of the population. Also, most taxis and public transport buses in Nigerian cities are leased by drivers, who have to deliver rental fees to the owners periodically.\n\nThat means ride-hailing companies such as Uber and Bolt that launch in Nigeria are likely to face a shortage of driver-partners, especially if they\u2019re looking to cover all of the country\u2019s major cities.\n\nEarlier this year, Bolt launched a vehicle financing programme that offered drivers a flexible plan through which they could purchase their own vehicles. The scheme allows drivers to own a car or motorbike with low equity repayment for about four years and no interest.\n\n\u201cAs we expand our presence into more cities across the country, it is important to provide solutions that ensure working with Bolt is more flexible and profitable for drivers,\u201d Bolt\u2019s Country Manager, Femi Akin-Laguda, said at the time.\n\nAfter a pilot phase, which Akin-Laguda tells TechCabal \u201cenjoyed great success\u201d, the company has now partnered with Metro Africa Xpress (MAX), a Nigerian mobility company with a fintech play, to expand the program in the country.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nMAX originally started out as a motorcycle-based operator for delivery services. With its mobile app, users could order pickup riders who could fulfil deliveries quickly in the congested city of Lagos. By 2017, MAX had expanded into bike hailing, becoming the first company to pioneer the innovation in Nigeria. But in February 2020, the Lagos government\u2019s restrictions on passenger motorcycles threatened the company\u2019s growth in Nigeria\u2019s largest city.\n\nIn an interview with TechCabal, MAX\u2019s CFO, Guy-Bertrand Njoya, explains that the company has had to double down on its other mobility solutions since the ban. One of these is a subscription platform for low-to-zero emission vehicles in five cities across Nigeria, and Ghana. The subscription product includes credit and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) services, which the more than 13,000 drivers on its platform opt into.\n\nFor the partnership with Bolt, the company\u2019s alternative credit-scoring technology will allow access to proprietary performance and revenue analytics to underwrite the Bolt car loans for drivers.\n\n\u201cMAX is a renowned vehicle subscription platform with the capacity to support a truly wide placement of this type of partnership,\u201d Akin-Laguda said on Bolt\u2019s preferred car financing partner in Nigeria. \u201cTheir approach and insight to meet our goal of empowering drivers suited our desired proposition.\u201d\n\nMAX motorcycle riders.\n\nThe car financing programme is currently open only to drivers in Lagos and Abuja, with Bolt planning to expand the offer to all active drivers across Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Bolt, an agreement can be reached for up to 100% of the purchase, both for new and used cars, within 24 hours of signing up. This is given that drivers have provided all the information required. They can choose to pay back their loans using a percentage of the weekly revenue generated while driving on Bolt for up to five years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking to expand our commitment to helping those on the Bolt platform to earn more and at their own pace, either driving full-time or part-time,\u201d Akin-Laguda said. \u201cImproving the earnings of drivers is fundamental to our business operations.\u201d\n\nFor drivers, Bolt\u2019s loan repayment process is more flexible than what traditionally exists in the market. Loan tenors from Nigerian banks often don\u2019t exceed two years whereas Bolt\u2019s repayment duration ranges from two to five. In the long run, Yamaha-backed MAX plans to add electric vehicles to the financing mix.\n\nIn addition to extending the lease-to-own framework to more e-hailing drivers, the partnership is expected to enable drivers access value-add services provided by MAX. These include licenses and permits, insurance, health coverage, and other financial products.\n\nThe low rate of vehicle ownership in Nigeria is similar across Africa, a continent with the lowest per capita vehicle ownership in the world.\n\nWith the majority of Africa\u2019s more than one billion population having limited or no access to vehicle financing, the continent recorded fewer than 900,000 new vehicle sales in 2019, compared to more than 17 million in the United States alone.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Ex-DealDey managers reunite to launch ThankUCash deals",
          "text": "The collapse of DealDey, a Nigeria-based online deals aggregator, three years ago, laid bare the difficulty of operating an internet-based commerce business in the country, especially with the similar failures of Efritin and OLX at the time.\n\nMuch like Groupon, DealDey connected customers with merchants that offered goods and services at slashed prices, a proposition that appealed to a largely low-income population. In some cases, consumers could purchase items at discounts of more than 90%.\n\nFounded in 2011 by Sim Shagaya, DealDey was a precursor for many e-commerce platforms in the country. And at its peak, the startup could claim to be sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s largest online deals platform.\n\nIt had more than 400 employees, over one million users, 15,000 active merchants, and 20,000 verified listed businesses, raised millions in equity funding, and looked set to play a big role in the Nigerian e-commerce space for decades to come.\n\nThat was before things went south. As Nigeria\u2019s 2016 economic recession bit hard, DealDey cut over 60% of its staff and reportedly owed merchants for months. In less than a year, the platform was sold to Ringier Africa Deals Group reportedly for $5 million, rather than the $75 million at which it valued itself, before eventually shutting down in late 2018.\n\nSo much has changed in the country since then. For one, more Nigerians now shop online, and arguably, younger populations in urban areas have more spending power. Interestingly, some of DealDey\u2019s former managers\u2014including Mohammed Abubakar, Juwon Ajao, and Joy Amadi\u2014now have an opportunity to take another shot at building the continent\u2019s largest online deals platform, but this time under the ThankUCash brand.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nA multi-merchant rewards platform\n\nSince its founding in 2018, ThankUCash\u2014a service that helps companies grow customer loyalty and increase revenue with data analytics and customer rewards\u2014has become a household name among bargain hunters.\n\nThe platform is the brainchild of Connected Analytics, a company founded by Simeon Ononobi (CEO), Suraj Supekar (CTO), Madonna Ononobi (COO), and Harshal Gandole (Senior VP). The founding members of ThankUCash, a kind of rewards platform hardly seen in African markets, were inspired by the need to address a significant market gap Simeon Ononobi and his team observed: the lack of consumer data and loyalty among businesses.\n\n\u201cWe saw that there were no records on buyers, which affected customer retention as people only bought what they needed and never came back. So we moved to solve this problem, and that\u2019s what brought about ThankUCash,\u201d he told TechCabal. \u201cWe also realised the need to make consumers happy and excited about spending.\u201d\n\nThankUCash enables merchants to give rewards (in the form of cashback, discounts, and points) seamlessly to their customers via a data analytics-powered reward system. Within the ThankUCash app, customers can use the rewards to buy deals, airtime, pay for utility bills, and cable TV subscriptions.\n\nBy giving such rewards, the startup hopes to help build customer loyalty and increase revenue for merchants while also collecting customer data for analytics, targeting, and decision-making purposes.\n\nIn this sense, Connected Analytics generates revenue by using one of the most common business models available: being a middleman. It charges a 30% commission on customer rewards, a monthly SaaS fee from merchants using its predictive analytics platform, and an upfront partnership fee for partners looking to use the platform, and commissions on future transactions.\n\nAs of March this year, ThankUCash had over 500 merchants it was helping to grow their businesses. These include Trebet, Dana Airlines, Gleeword, ENYO Retail, MedMart, PriceRite, Choplife, and CET Energy, among others. The startup claims to have also secured strategic partnerships with major banks and financial institutions in the country, such as UBA, Sterling Bank, First City Monument Bank (FCMB), and Wema Bank.\n\nWith 734,000 users, 90,000 of which are active monthly, the multi-merchant rewards platform has clearly gained significant traction across key indicators so far. But Connected Analytics is not resting on its laurels as it plans to add a new segment to its business offerings: Groupon-like deals.\n\nJuwon Ajao, Mohammed Abubakar, Simeon Ononobi and Joy Amadi.\n\nSucceeding where DealDey struggled\n\nBy expanding its service to include daily deals, Connected Analytics is stepping into a territory where very few Nigerian companies play, ever since the collapse of DealDey three years ago. Some platforms currently offer deals but not on the same scale as the pioneering startup did.\n\nThe decision to re-assemble the DealDey team, according to Simeon Ononobi, was necessitated by the need to tap their experience in achieving the startup\u2019s goals. \u201cWe realised we couldn\u2019t do this on our own and resorted to bringing on the team that had done it in the past,\u201d the CEO said.\n\nBut how does the company plan to avoid the pitfalls that brought down DealDey after seven years of operations?\n\nDealDey\u2019s collapse was based largely on the economic downturn of 2018 when the country\u2019s budget was approved late and consumers\u2019 buying power was affected. Customers wanted to get the same price points and same value. \u201cWith thin margins, we needed to sell more to cover overhead, and at that particular time, it was a tall order,\u201d Abubakar said.\n\nThankUCash intends to leverage its existing analytics capabilities in order to do things better now, according to Simeon Ononobi.\n\nAbubakar, who was the city manager at DealDey, and now serves as ThankUCash\u2019s deals manager, believes the surge in online commerce activity among Nigerians bodes well for the foray into daily deals by Connected Analytics.\n\n\u201cThings are different now compared to when DealDey shut down. More people are inclined to shop online and e-commerce numbers are increasing,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, there are many online platforms doing food delivery, event ticketing, hotel bookings, and other professional services that were not there three or four years ago.\u201d\n\nConnected Analytics plans to hire even more ex-DealDey staff and has also poached top employees from companies like KPMG, Jumia, and Econet Media.\n\nAccording to Simeon Ononobi, some failed businesses could have had better chances of survival if they had a better knowledge of their customers and leveraged that data to make decisions. ThankUCash\u2019s analytics platform solves this problem, and with the addition of the daily deals vertical, it can help businesses, from banks to airlines and hotels, boost sales.\n\nTake a hotel with a 70% occupancy rate during holidays, for instance. Instead of having vacant rooms while overhead costs remain constant, the company could salvage some revenue by offering discounts on bookings via ThankUCash.\n\nSimeon Ononobi is bullish on ThankUCash\u2019s chances of becoming a super aggregator of such deals, helping businesses grow and consumers access bargains. \u201cIt\u2019s huge,\u201d the CEO said of his company\u2019s ambitions in the online deals space. \u201cWe\u2019re planning a lot of things and intend to cover a wide range of product categories like DealDey did.\u201d\n\nFor Abubakar, he and his former (and now current) colleagues have a chance to \u201cfind our mistakes, fix them, and then innovate more\u201d at ThankUCash.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "A few streets away from Eko Atlantic City, the doors to the exhibition halls of Gallery B57 are open, revealing a black and white portrait of Instagram Influencer, Sanchan.\n\nPortrait of Instagram influencer, Sanchan\n\nLast year, during the global lockdown, Nigerian-born international visual artist, Ade Adekola, made an open call on Instagram for people who were interested in having their photographs turned into portraits. He opened a sign-up form with a commitment to do 30 portraits, but when he opened the form two hours later, the number of requests had exceeded 80. He had to close the call immediately to avoid being overwhelmed.\n\nDuring the process of creating the portraits\u2014all 80 of them\u2014he was able to improve his creative process, developing new techniques that helped him optimise the way he worked. He took the original photographs shared by interested persons, stripped them of all colours, turning them into black and white. He then turned them into engravings, before shading, cutting, and colouring them. Optimising this process, coupled with the overwhelmingly positive feedback he received from his 80 selected muses, encouraged him to create more portraits.\n\nIn the end, Adekola created 700 portraits, but there are only 40 portraits with striking designs and a collage of all 700 portraits on display at the exhibition halls of the gallery.\n\nThe allure of the 40 portraits on display, chosen by Adekola for their unique poses, circumstance or personal resonance to the subject, was elevated by presenting it in lightboxes.\n\nNow titled Lockdown Portraits, his project would go on to form a part of his exhibition titled, Dislocation &\u2026 alongside Anthology of an African Wedding and Diaspora Axis.\n\nOpening up conversations for dislocated people\n\nDislocation &\u2026 is an exhibition featuring NFT art, 3D textiles and augmented reality and events that feature creators from Tokyo, Israel and Singapore on social media and other digital collaborative platforms.\n\nThe artworks in the exhibition were conceived, executed and completed during the year-long lockdown, exploring and amplifying the effects of dislocation on humanity.\n\nIn Diaspora Axis, Adekola took a blend of various nationalities and used it to create a textile design. Ade set out to give agency to people with double or more nationalities, who were confused about their \u201ctrue identities\u201d.\n\n\u201cSo, the inspiration for the anthology series, from that disability perspective, are people who had an emotional roadmap, and that roadmap was truncated. I just open up the space for you to enter and think about what may or could have happened.\u201d\n\nThe design was adopted by an Israeli company to create and display dresses. Using 3D, over 70 design patterns are shown to consumers. \u201cSo, when you buy it, they send the physical garment to you, all cut,\u201d Adekola explained.\n\nA pandemic is a form of dislocation to Adekola, who said, \u201cI\u2019m trying to explore the different kinds of dislocation forces. So, the pandemic is a kind of dislocation where people are in isolation\u2014a prolonged one.\u201d\n\nBuying African emotional entanglement\n\nA scene from Anthology of an African Wedding\n\nAnthology of an African Wedding collection explores dislocation from the angle of emotional entanglement in Yoruba wedding cultures. The Yoruba nation hails from the southwest region of Nigeria, and their wedding culture is colourful, vibrant, and in many ways, extravagant.\n\nViewable using augmented reality, Anthology of an African Wedding collection brings viewers a step closer to experiencing a Yoruba wedding with its traditional gowns, headgear and rings.\n\nAdekola has evolved his art using Photoshop for over 20 years, creating over 20,000 texture designs that he used to create Anthology of an African Wedding.

          "title": "Poor quality produce, ports keep non-oil exports in limbo",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s failure to deal with recurring export rejection, port congestion and high cost of product registration is putting the country\u2019s diversification quest at risk, experts have said.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest economy has had the opportunity of quelling a ban on its agricultural produce and addressing lingering issues in the last five years when it turned to agriculture for economic diversification, but the government has instead allowed it to recur year after year.\n\nThe ban placed on Nigeria\u2019s beans, hibiscus, smoked catfish and groundnut, among others, owing to poor standards has shrunk market access for exporters, and slowed investment and threatened export drive targets amid acute foreign exchange (FX) shortages, according to experts.\n\nSimilarly, the lingering congestion at the port, infrastructural deficits and high cost of product registration have made the country\u2019s agricultural products uncompetitive, thus making proceeds from agriculture exports abysmal.\n\nWhile Nigeria earned N165.3 billion ($403,170) from its total agricultural exports in Q2, 2021, South Africa earned $626, 585 from citrus export alone in the same period, data from both countries\u2019 statistics office show.\n\nRead Also: Nigeria urged to increase non-oil exports to Germany\n\nThis indicates that Nigeria\u2019s total export for the period is still lower by 35.7 percent when compared with South Africa\u2019s proceeds from citrus export.\n\n\u201cThe structures to drive growth and diversify the economy through agriculture are lacking,\u201d said Kola Adebayo, professor of agricultural extension and rural development at Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta Ogun State.\n\n\u201cIf we are truly serious about our non-oil and proceeds from agriculture, the government will ensure that every encumbrance to international trade is resolved quickly,\u201d Adebayo said.\n\nIn 2020, the European Union extended its ban on Nigeria\u2019s dried beans export till 2022 for the third consecutive time over poor standards. Similarly, the US and Mexico are yet to lift their bans on hibiscus and smoke catfish over quality issues as well.\n\nCurrently, Nigeria does not have a food safety plan that controls and streamlines food production as well as a strengthened legal and regulatory environment that can build the fundamentals for quality production of food products, according to experts.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government is lacking in the area of food safety in the country and the situation is getting worse daily,\u201d noted James Marsh, managing director, James Marsh, and Associate.\n\n\u201cThere are no regulations on the use of agrochemicals and pesticides on the farms; even products banned in other countries are found in the hands of farmers in Nigeria,\u201d Marsh said.\n\nNigeria\u2019s non-oil export has come under serious threat owing to the congestion at the Apapa and Tin Can ports. The government is yet to find a lasting solution to the problem, despite its implication on export.\n\nIt cost an average of N1.5 million for the movement of a twenty-foot equivalent unit from Tincan Port to Mile 2, according to a February communiqu\u00e9 issued by the African Centre for Supply Chain.\n\nObiora Madu, former chairman, president/CEO of Multimix Group, said, Nigeria does not have effective agricultural infrastructure, stating that the country\u2019s export drive can only be successful with adequate infrastructural facilities such as storage, good road networks, among others, stressing that the lack of it has made cost of food production higher.\n\n\u201cThe costs of logistics are also very high. It is cheaper to transport a commodity to Europe than to transport the same commodity within the country,\u201d Madu said.\n\nSimilarly, Prince Samuel, chairman and managing director, Vegefresh Group, said the country\u2019s food products are not competitive globally owing to high production costs.\n\n\u201cFarmers are not producing at the price processors are willing to buy to be able to compete favourably with imported products. This is why there is high importation of agricultural products into the country despite local production,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to experts, diversifying Africa\u2019s largest economy away from oil would require paying more attention to establishing agriculture, which constitutes the bulk of the country\u2019s non-oil exports, and value-addition.\n\n\u201cOur diversification focus is just talk and no action,\u201d Rotimi Oloye, president, Catfish and Allied Fish Farmers Association of Nigeria (CAFFAN), said from his Ibadan farm in a telephone response to BusinessDay.\n\nAgricultural growth slowed to 1.22 percent in the third quarter of 2021 \u2013 the lowest since the second quarter of 2018, according to data from the country\u2019s GDP report.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s fiscal position is deteriorating resulting in higher debt and shrinking investments in human capital and infrastructures, the World Bank Group has said in a new report on Wednesday.\n\nThe total public debt stock of Africa\u2019s largest economy stood at N35.5 trillion as of June 30, data from the Debt Management Office indicated.\n\nFederation revenues will be significantly lower in 2022 than in 2020, mainly due to lower net oil and gas revenues, the World Bank said.\n\nIt also said that federal government revenues will be hard hit particularly in 2021 and especially in 2022, adding that transfers to the states are projected to decline in 2022.\n\nAccording to the report, 35 out of 36 states are likely to see transfers from the Federation fall (in nominal terms) from 2021 to 2022, with the average decline projected to be about 11 percent.\n\nIn the case of many states, this will mean that transfers from the federation will not be enough to cover even salaries, and certainly not recurrent costs, which are growing in nominal terms.\n\nResponding to the World Bank\u2019s statement, Jimi Ogbobine, head of Consulting at Agusto Consulting, a pan-African credit rating agency said the impact is that time is running out on Nigeria to take some decisive fiscal decisions.\n\nRead also: Ecobank warns FMN against Honeywell acquisition deal\n\n\u201cWe have missed out on various windows of opportunities to review our fiscal position particularly on knotty issues like the fuel subsidy,\u201d Ogbobine said.\n\nHe said the most recent window opened in the second quarter of 2020 when crude oil prices dropped to historic lows.\n\nHowever, with the unsustainability of the subsidy payments currently estimated at over a trillion annually, Nigeria has been pushed once again to dire fiscal straits.\n\nOn the issue of subsidy, the report said Nigeria is the only country in the world that subsidizes only PMS, the cost of which is massive and unsustainable; as a result, Nigeria is sacrificing critical investments in physical and human capital.\n\n\u201cMost of the PMS subsidy benefits richer Nigerians, and fuel smugglers. The poorest 40 percent consume less than 3 percent of the total PMS consumption in Nigeria. By creating a large price differential between Nigeria and its neighbours, the PMS subsidy is incentivizing smuggling,\u201d the World Bank said.\n\nThe domestic price of PMS is allowed to have cost-reflective\u2026 \u2026eliminating the PMS subsidy will cost the federation over NGN 3 trillion a year in foregone revenues and mostly benefits the rich and those who smuggle PMS to neighboring countries, the report said.\n\n\u201cHigher oil prices won\u2019t get us there\u2026only policy reforms can boost growth to the levels Nigeria needs. What this means over the next 3 years, business unusual,\u201d the report said, adding that a business unusual scenario would prevent 6 million additional Nigerians from falling into poverty during 2022-2024.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, the priority for the next 3-6 months include reducing inflation, addressing fiscal pressures, catalysing private investment to boost job creation and protecting the poor and vulnerable.\n\nAlso, there is a need to enhance the flexibility and predictability of exchange rate management, fully reopen land borders to trade, remove FX restrictions on imports of staple foods and medicines, signal the CBN\u2019s commitment to price stability as the primary goal, and reduce CBN overdrafts for deficit financing to their legal limit, among others.",

          "text": "Nigerians are facing tough times as average price for refilling a 12.5kg cylinder of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (cooking gas) has risen by 62.8 percent over the past one year. Analysts say it could get worse next year.\n\nAccording to the October 2021 Cooking Gas Watch report by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the average price of 12.5kg of the commodity increased by 62.8 percent to N6,638.3 in October 2021 from N4,078.7 in October 2020. While on a month-on-month basis it rose marginally by 7.7 percent to N6,164.9.\n\nThe report notes that states with the highest average price for refilling 12.5kg cooking gas were Oyo (N7,718.2), Abuja (N7,660.0) and Imo (N7,655.6). While states with the lowest were Borno (N5,133.3), Nassarawa (N5,764) and Niger (N6,000).\n\nAccording to some LPG distributors, the hike in price is expected to continue into next year.\n\n\u201cThe soaring cooking gas prices may continue till March next year, as winter in Europe will increase the demand for natural gas for heating,\u201d Emmanuel Uwandu, founder of GAS360, a local gas distributor, states.\n\nSimilarly, Ogboji Sunday, a sale representative at Sungas Company Limited, says it is possible for the price to keep increasing till January based on the current challenges facing the sector.\n\nNigeria imports more than 60 percent of domestic gas while the Nigerian LNG supplies the rest.\n\nExperts blame the price hike of cooking gas on the dearth of infrastructure, global shortfall in gas supply, inadequate local production, and shortage of Foreign Exchange, devaluation of the naira, logistic hitches and the recent introduction of VAT charges on imported gas by the Federal Government.\n\nDamilola Adewale, a Lagos-based economic analyst, says this situation means tougher times lie ahead for consumers.\n\n\u201cIt is unlikely that gas prices will trend downwards in the near term considering inadequate local supply of the commodity, foreign-exchange induced pressure on importation and the fact that petroleum products will remain on the high-side for a while,\u201d Adewale states.\n\nFindings reveal that LPG price, which has increased five times in the last two months, adds to the difficulty consumers, already stretched due to inflation and low incomes, are facing.\n\nRead also: Nigerians grumble as Cooking Gas price keeps rising\n\nIn order to cope with the rising cost, some Nigerians are switching to dirtier alternatives like charcoal and firewood, while others have started rationing the use of cooking gas to save cost.\n\n\u201cI alternate between cooking gas and firewood because I have to factor into the business my children\u2019s school fees. The current rising price of cooking gas now allows me to consider it as an option,\u201d Eunice Okon, a fruit seller and resident of Lagos State, said.\n\nShe says, \u201cThe little I make from my rice and beans sales are channelled into different responsibilities. With N200 firewood, I will prepare food for my customers for two days and channel other money for the needs of my children.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Marian Godei, a mother of five, says before she used to fill her 12.5kg cylinder full but now she just fills it halfway, saying, \u201cI also had to minimise the amount of food that I cook now.\u201d\n\nThere are concerns that the price of LPG may jump to N10,000 soon unless urgent steps are taken to increase local production and improve supply to the market.\n\nRecently, Bassey Essien, executive secretary at Nigerian Association of Liquefied Petroleum Gas Marketers, said the re-introduction of Value Added Tax meant most businesses had no option than to increase their prices in order not to run at loss. He warned that Nigerians might soon end up paying more than N10,000 for a 12.5kg of cooking gas.\n\nIn September, Mele Kyari, group managing director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), said poor supply of gas was still a major challenge in Nigeria\u2019s domestic market.\n\n\u201cToday, this country is under-supplied with gas. I can tell you that we are having difficulty feeding our network across the country with gas. Every day, it is troublesome to deliver gas. Once your supply is weak, it will affect pricing,\u201d Kyari said.\n\nTo solve the problem of galloping prices of domestic LPG, analysts at CSL Stockbrokers advise the government to actively collaborate with the private sector and provide incentives to elicit investors\u2019 participation in the LPG infrastructure that would enhance local production of gas.\n\n\u201cThe government, on its part, needs to implement policies aimed at removing existing unfriendly tariffs and taxation of the product and its associated equipment so as to attract the much needed private sector investment,\u201d they say.",

          "text": "Journalists and media experts met Wednesday in Abuja to discuss the role of the media in ensuring public accountability in Nigeria.\n\nThe experts spoke at a media dialogue and award ceremony hosted by the International Centre for Investigative Reporting (ICIR) in Abuja.\n\nIn his opening remark, the ICIR Executive Director, Dayo Aiyetan, said the programme was necessary because \u201cthe media is not an island.\u201d\n\nIt operates in a corrupt environment, he said. \u201cThough we have had some bad experiences, we have also had wonderful stories to tell since we started.\u201d\n\nMr Aiyetan lamented the difficult conditions journalists operate in to do their job. In their effort to expose corruption, he said, journalists face different forms of threats by government officials \u201cwho are using the institution of state to harm the media.\u201d\n\nHe added that government officials should see journalists as \u201ccomplimenting their work rather than see us as competitors.\u201d\n\nIn his keynote speech titled \u201cthe political economy of press freedom in Africa\u2019s most populous country,\u201d Martin Onoja, the Managing Director and Editor-in-chief of the Guardian newspaper, said the role of the media as clearly spelt out in the constitution is \u201cto monitor governance and hold public officers to account.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201conly good and independent journalism can deliver this tough job.\u201d\n\nBut, Mr Oloja said, good and independent journalism costs a lot of money to do. \u201cYou also need good capitalization to do investigative journalism.\u201d\n\n\u201cOrdinarily, good journalism should be one of democracy\u2019s safety valves. Without it, journalism can become sterile and barren,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Oloja added that: \u201call the good newspapers in the world have a good capitalization and their economy is robust.\u201d\n\nBut in Nigeria, \u201cWe always depend on the wicked and the criminals who have brought down the country to also have capitalization. Most of the proprietors do not have money on their own. They depend on the system we are monitoring and the people we are to hold to account. We depend on them too much for revenue,\u201d he told PREMIUM TIMES in an interview on the sideline of the event.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t practice robust journalism here. We are doing public relations not journalism and it is only good journalism that can improve the governance system of a country to hold people to account and to monitor them until they do something in the interest of the larger society,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, Kole Shettima, the Country Director of MacArthur Foundation in Nigeria, spoke on the importance of independent journalism in any democratic country.\n\nHe said the overall goal of his organisation is to improve the quality of life. \u201cAnd I am glad that the media is improving the lives of the citizens through accountability journalism.\u201d\n\nMr Shettima added that while it is important to support independent journalism through grants, it is equally pertinent that journalists have a business model. \u201cThat is, the media should develop independent sources of revenue rather than relying on government advertisements or donor partners.\u201d\n\nIn his submission, Edetaen Ojo, the Executive Director of Media Right Agenda, said that \u201cunless the media contributes to sanitizing itself, it cannot begin to hold the government to account.\u201d\n\nParts of the challenges we face is that the media sector is rotten, he said, adding that \u201cthere is no nice way to say it.\u201d\n\nAlso, Abigail Ogwezzy, a lecturer at the University of Lagos, submitted that \u201cif we don\u2019t understand why there should be accountability, we may not drive or push for it.\u201d\n\nMs Ogwezzy, a professor, noted that \u201caccountability is at the core endearment of all human rights. And it has two main components: Addressing past grievances and correcting systematic failure to prevent future occurrence.\u201d\n\nAt the event, the PREMIUM TIMES\u2019 Editor-in-chief, Musikilu Mojeed, said journalists in Nigeria \u201cimpoverished\u201d their own companies because of their complicit behaviour.\n\nSpeaking on generating revenue for media organisations, Mr Mojeed said there are many instances where \u201cthe money that would\u2019ve been used to advertise in a media company will be given to reporters and it passes just through individual pockets.\u201d\n\nHe conceded that the system is bad but journalists are also complicit.",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nSome Indigenes of Ikirun town in Ifelodun local government area of Osun State under the eagies of \u201cConcerned Indigenes of Ikinrun\u201d have expressed disapproval over the newly selected monarch, Prince Yunusa Olalekan Akadiri from Obaara ruling house.\n\nThe concerned indigenes alleged that the selection process is faulty, describing it as undemocratic and negating due process.\n\nThe aggrieved people who converged at the NUJ Correspondents\u2019 chapel in Osogbo, Osun State capital in their numbers on Wednesday, called on the State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola to look into the matter.\n\nAddressing newsmen, their spokesperson, Oluwafemi Olawale from Obaara ruling house appealed to the government not go ahead with the planned installation of the Akirun-elect but wait for the position of the judiciary since the matter is still in court.\n\nOlawale said: \u201cWe feel that the purported selection process of the new Akirun which according to the Eesa of Ikirun, Chief Lawal Adetoyese Kareem, is faulty. This is so because the Eesa who doubles as the Head of the Kingmakers was unable to reach his colleagues 72 hours prior to the purported selection. He also claimed that they usually meet on daily basis to make decisions on how to govern the town and the way forward but they were unavailable two days to the purported selection process.\n\n\u201cAs Concerned Ikirun Youths, we believe the act is undemocratic and negates the due procedures of selecting who fills the vacant stool. In addition, the mood of ikirun people does not favour the person that was allegedly selected. It should therefore be noted that we know Mr Governor for his humility and forthrightness and as someone who will not allow anyone to tarnish his image which everybody in our town and the entire state admires him for.\n\n\u201cThe residents of Ikirun plead with Mr Governor to intervene on this matter so as to sustain the peace and order enjoyed in the town and the state at large.\u201d\n\nThe indigenes, who described the Akirun-elect as uneducated, said at this age, Ikirun is too blessed to be led by an uneducated person and a man of questionable character.\n\nOlawale stated that the process that produced the Akirun-elect should be declared null and void.

          "text": "Minister of Aviation Hadi Sirika has said the country\u2019s national air carrier, Air Nigeria, is expected to take off April 2022.\n\nThe minister said this while briefing State House correspondents at the end of the weekly Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nHe said the national airliner would be run by a company in which the Nigerian government would hold a five percent stake, Nigerian entrepreneurs 46 percent and the remaining 49 percent for yet to be assigned strategic equity partners, including foreign investors.\n\nSitrika said, when it becomes operational, the national carrier would create about 70,000 jobs for Nigerians.\n\nThe minister said over 400,000 Nigerians participated in choosing the name unveiled 2018.\n\n\u201cToday in Council, civil aviation presented two memoranda. The first one is approval for the award of contract for the provision of Automated Civil Aviation Regulatory Equipment, including software support and training, which will be located in Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport.\n\n\u201cIn summary, this is a software that will allow all of the activities of civil aviation regulation to be done electronically on one platform, including payments, including follow-ups on personnel licensing, the medicals, the economic regulation of airlines, safety regulation of airlines and all other businesses within the envelope of civil aviation will be monitored by this single software.\n\n\u201cIt is called \u2018the truth machine\u2019 in Europe because all of the truth of regulation of civilization will appear on this platform. It\u2019s extremely important software that the world has now come to terms with.\n\n\u201cThe contract was given to Messrs. Arif Investment Nigeria Limited, who are representatives of Empik GmbH. This Empik is the creator of this software, one of its kind in the world, at the sum of N1, 492,520,325, which will be including 7.5% VAT and a completion period of six months. So that\u2019s the first memoranda,\u201d the minister said.\n\nHe further said: \u201cThe next one also is approval of the outline business case for the establishment of the national carrier and this is the sixth time the memorandum appeared before Council. The sixth time, we got lucky to be passed by Council.\n\n\u201cThe structure of the proposed airline; the government will be owning not more than 5%. So, 5 per cent is the maximum equity that government will take, then 46% will be owned by Nigerian entrepreneurs. So, if you add that, it\u2019s 51%.\u201d\n\nSirika added that with a 51 per cent share, Nigerians will own the majority while 49% will be held by strategic equity partners that will be sourced during the procurement phase.\n\n\u201cThis airline, if started, and within the first few years, will generate about 70,000 jobs. These 70,000 jobs are higher than the total number of civil servants that we have in the country. Its importance had been well discussed so; I\u2019ll not go back to it. You had discussed it separately also on various fora as to the need for it.\n\n\u201cBut one important item is the AU agenda 2063, which speaks to the integration of Africa, which speaks to the cause and trade within Africa that is intra-Africa and to which also another flagship project of AU agenda 2063 called the Single African Air Transport Market.\n\n\u201cNow, the only way, the quickest way that you can integrate Africa is by air because if you want to interconnect all the 54 nations of Africa, via rail or road, or waterways, which is even impossible, the quantum of money that you need to do all of these, the time it will take to develop this infrastructure, as well as the maintenance cost, is almost prohibitive,\u201d Sirika explained.\n\nThe minister expressed the confidence that the target is \u201cdoable, it\u2019s time-taking, but with aviation, within a year, once the right policy is in place, like SAATM, you can connect Africa and then, of course, the needed integration will happen. Part of AU agenda 2063 so, these are the two memoranda that were submitted, and gladly they were passed by Council.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe name is Nigerian Air which of course, if you remember back in time, this was subject to the national debate and 400,000 people participated, choose the name, the colour, the logo, everything and it was produced that time. It was launched also in Farnborough as far back as 2018.\n\n\u201cSo, the business case is a public document. It will be on our website; you can download it and we can give you copies. This airline will pick up and start, by God\u2019s grace, on or before April 2022.\u201d\n\nRelated\n\nNo tags for this post.",

          "title": "2022: Minister reveals full fuel deregulation plans as FG removes subsidy provision from budget",
          "text": "Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning Hajiya Zainab Ahmed has said the federal government cannot sustain the current N250 billion monthly petroleum subsidy.\n\nThe minister stated this while briefing State House correspondents Wednesday in Abuja at the end of the weekly Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nShe said the costly monthly subsidy was making the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC)\u2019s remittance almost zero to the federation.\n\nThe minister\u2019s position came 24 hours after the Group Managing Director Mele Kyari said legally the fuel subsidy regime would come to an end February next year.\n\nMinister speaks\n\nAnd speaking along same line Wednesday, Minister Ahmed said: \u201cThe Petroleum Industry Act has a provision that all petroleum products must be deregulated. And in the 2020 budget, we made a provision to assume that at the maximum by the end of June, we must exit subsidy. So this last FAAC, the subsidy cost to the Federation was N243 billion.\n\n\u201cIf we look at a cost of about 250 billion per month, and it has been increasing consistently. So we\u2019re expecting something around N120 billion per month from NNPC. And now we\u2019re getting to a point where NNPC is remitting near zero. And if we don\u2019t stop we will get to a point where they will tell you pay me this for managing the fuel provision in the country.\n\n\u201cSo if you take N250 billion times 12 months, that is about N3 trillion. If we don\u2019t remove that, that is what it is costing us. This is money that we can use to apply to health and to education.\n\n\u201cThe intervention we want to provide is for between 20 to 40 million people and there is still a lot of work going on. We have a committee that is chaired by His Excellency the Vice President, state governors and a few of us-ministers as members. So we have to have a landing as to the exact number between 20 to 40 million.\n\n\u201cWe already agreed it will be N5, 000 and we have also agreed that the remittances have to be done digitally. So the e-naira will help, but also are the various payment platforms that are currently available. What we will not do is paying people in cash.\n\n\u201cThe transfers that people will receive through one kind of electronic money or the other and it\u2019s meant to be for a period of six, nine or 12 months. So these are things that we are still in negotiation because it\u2019s still money that would have to come from the Federation account. So, everybody that is a member of FAAC will have to agree on the numbers. The maximum will be 12 months, the minimum will be six months,\u201d she said.\n\nGDP report\n\nShe said the third quarter GDP report for 2021 which was released Thursday last week by the National Bureau of Statistics shows an improvement from the contraction that was witnessed in 2020.\n\nAsked why the growth does not impact on Nigerians, she said: \u201cLet me say that, again, the Nigeria economy is growing. And right now, we witnessed four consecutive quarters of GDP growth. We also said that we aspire to continue to push this growth to the point where the growth supersedes the growth in our population, because that\u2019s the time that people will actually feel the benefits.\n\n\u201cSo, we\u2019re pushing the bar at the third quarter of 2021. The average annual growth is now 3.3%. Our population growth is roughly about 3.2%. So, we still need to do a lot more for people to feel this. But the fact that the service sector is not in positive territory, it also means that people will actually begin to feel the difference, because it is the service sector that has the first direct impact on people.\n\n\u201cWe entered into a recession technically and then exited recession by the fourth quarter of 2020. This report shows that we now have four consistent quarters of growth from Q4 2020 to Q3 2021. The GDP third quarter report shows a growth of 4.03% in the third quarter 2021 compared to a contraction of minus 3.62% in the third quarter of last year.\n\n\u201cPart of the economic activities that were the major drivers of growth within this reporting period is services which grew by 8.41%. Growth in the service sector was largely driven by better performance in the rail transport sector, pipeline sector, air transport, financial institutions, road transport sector, water transport as well as crude.\n\n\u201cAgriculture also grew by 1.22%. This is a slight dip compared to the 1.3% in the second quarter of 2021. And the reason for the dip has to do with a slight slowdown in agricultural activities in some parts of the country due to security.\n\n\u201cThe growth in agriculture that is reported in this quarter is largely driven by crop production. The growth in industry has been consistent, but we have seen a slight slowdown compared to the last quarter 2021 and the contraction of the industry is driven by the poor performance of the crude oil and natural gas sectors, coal mining, quarrying, minerals as well as oil refinery.\n\n\u201cThe Q3 GDP report indicates that the oil sector\u2019s contribution to the GDP today stands at 7.49% while the non oil sector contribution to the GDP stands at 2.51%. This indicates that the Nigerian economy is truly very diversified with the oil sector contributing just 7.49%.\n\n\u201cSo, factors that are responsible for this growth include the commitment of the government to continued containment of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the implementation of fiscal and monetary measures to support businesses contained in the Economic Sustainability Plan.\n\n\u201cIt includes the improvement that we\u2019ve witnessed in the rail transport sector, pipelines, air transport, road transport, as well as water transport. It includes improvement in the transportation and the free movement of people as well as goods as the containment measures have been really improved.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen also improvement in the financial services sector with higher supplementary incomes compared to 2020. There\u2019s been improvement in electricity generation and distribution during this quarter as well as improvement in water supply, sewage and waste management and remediation activities.\n\n\u201cThere is also indication of higher trade activities which have significantly improved compared to 2020 because of the containment measures that slowed down trade significantly. Also reported is the inflation numbers for the month of October 2021 at 15.99%.\n\n\u201cThis is consistent with the decline that we have seen in inflation from April 2021 to date. We expect this decline to continue through the rest of the year and also throughout the year 2022. On the other hand, we have seen an adjustment that has been done in the inflation largely caused by the improvement in the food basket in the inflation mix. And this is largely due to the agricultural harvest which constitutes 50% of the basket and inflation,\u201d she said.\n\nProvision not in budget \u2013Senate\n\nBut, Chairman Senate Committee on Finance Olamilekan Adeola (APC Lagos West) has said no provision was made for N5, 000 monthly stipend for 40 million Nigerians as transportation allowance in the 2022 budget.\n\nPut together, he said this would amount to N2.4trillion.\n\nHowever, the lawmaker also disclosed that there was provision for subsidy in the Appropriation Bill.\n\nHe spoke to journalists Wednesday shortly after submitting the committee\u2019s report on the Bill.\n\nAdeola explained that before the Executive can embark on such intervention, the proposal must come to National Assembly because it is going to cost N2.4 trillion, even as he wondered what criteria would be used to determine the beneficiaries of the transportation allowance.\n\nThe proposal according to him, is still a rumour since the required documents on that is not before the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to go into details, if there is something like that, a document needs to come to National Assembly. And how do they want to identify the identities of the beneficiaries? This is not provided for in 2022 budget proposal which is N2.4 trillion\n\n\u201cFor us, we still believe it is news because this budget we are considering contains subsidy and if we are passing a budget with subsidy in the fiscal document, we can\u2019t speak because that is the document that is currently before us.\n\n\u201cThe Minister of Finance, budget and National Planning was quoted as saying that 40 million Nigerians will be paid N5000 as transportation allowance, in lieu of the fuel subsidy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to go into details for now. I believe that if such proposal is to come to pass, a document to that effect must be sent to National Assembly for us to see how feasible it is and how do we identify the 40 million Nigerians that are going to benefit from this process.\n\n\u201cThere are still a lot of issues to be deliberated upon and looked into if eventually this will come to pass. And how do we raise this money to pay these 40 million Nigerians because I know that even the revenue being raised and monies that are coming in from this so-called oil and other sources of revenue to the Federal government cannot guarantee that?.\n\n\u201cSo, this is not provided for already in the 2022 budget. We don\u2019t have anywhere in the budget where 40 million Nigerians will collect N5000 monthly as transportation allowance totalling N2.4 trillion.\n\n\u201cI know that there must be a budgetary provision for this for us (National Assembly) to consider. That is why I said it is still a news out there until it formally comes to the National Assembly for either a virement to the budget or reordering of the budget. For now, I still want to take it as a rumour and as a news until, it is formally presented before the National Assembly,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "France and Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema has been found guilty of conspiring to blackmail a fellow French footballer with a sex tape.\n\nA judge handed Benzema a one-year suspended jail term and ordered him to pay a \u20ac75,000 (\u00a363,000; $84,000) fine.\n\nBenzema, 33, was one of five people put on trial last month over an attempt to extort Frenchman Mathieu Valbuena.\n\nThe scandal has stunned the football community in France and both players lost their national team places.\n\nThe case dates back to June 2015, when the two footballers were at a French training camp.\n\nAt the camp, Benzema put pressure on Valbuena to pay off the blackmailers, whom he had conspired with to act as an intermediary, prosecutors said.\n\nBenzema has always denied the allegations and insisted he was only trying to help Valbuena get rid of the compromising video.\n\nBenzema has since returned to the France team and is expected to start for Real Madrid on Wednesday night when they play FC Sheriff Tiraspol in the Champions League.\n\nBenzema was not present in court in Versailles for the verdict, nor was Valbuena, who plays for Greek club Olympiakos.\n\nFour of Benzema\u2019s co-defendants in the trial were also found guilty on Wednesday. They were handed jail sentences ranging from 18 months suspended to two-and-a-half years in prison.\n\nBenzema\u2019s lawyers said they would appeal his conviction. \u201cThe reaction is ultimately an angry one to this judgment which is perfectly contradictory,\u201d his lawyer, Sylvain Cormier, told reporters outside court.\n\nBut when delivering the verdict, the judge said Benzema had \u201cimplicated himself personally, through subterfuge and lies, to convince his teammate to submit to the blackmail\u201d.\n\nBenzema made a surprise comeback to the French national team in May, five years after he was exiled from the side when the allegations first surfaced in 2015.\n\nBut last month, the French football federation said a guilty verdict would not necessarily jeopardise Benzema\u2019s position in the national side.\n\nSince being called back by France manager Didier Deschamps, Benzema has been in prolific form, scoring nine times in 13 games for his country. He\u2019s also scored 10 goals this season for his club, Real Madrid, who are yet to comment on the verdict.\n\nFor his performances on the pitch, Benzema was named a candidate for the Ballon d\u2019Or footballer of the year award which will be announced next week.\n\nAnalysis by BBC Sport\u2019s European football expert Guillem Balague:\n\nThere are two ways of dealing with the private lives of footballers and we have seen that in the case of Benzema. The story hasn\u2019t been given much importance in the sports media in Spain, but it has been hugely prominent in France.\n\nIn France, Benzema will be questioned professionally because of his behaviour off the pitch, much more so than in Spain. In France, private lives are more relevant, not just in sport but also in politics.\n\nBenzema \u2013 who is of Algerian descent \u2013 has suggested there was an element of racism in this case. He felt that, had he been a white player, he would have been treated differently.\n\nBut none of it affects his status at Real Madrid, at all. In Spain, there is a view that your private life is your private life, and there has even been a strong campaign in the Madrid media for him to win the Ballon d\u2019Or.\n\nBACK STORY\n\nThe case began in 2015 when Valbuena, now 37, asked a man in Marseille, Axel Angot, to upload the contents of his mobile phone to a new device.\n\nMr Angot found sexually explicit material on the phone. He and another defendant in the trial, Mustapha Zouaoui, were accused of trying to blackmail Valbuena by threatening to make the tape public.\n\nMr Zouaoui told reporters he had shared the tape, but there had never been an attempt to extort money.\n\nValbuena described being approached by another defendant, Younes Houass, who told the court he had warned the player about the issue without asking for money.\n\nMathieu Valbuena and Karim Benzema (right) were both playing for France until the case emerged\n\nWhen the footballer went to the police, they set up a sting operation involving an undercover agent.\n\nProsecutors said another defendant was then brought into the scam \u2013 Karim Zenati, who is a childhood friend of Benzema. At this point, Benzema was asked to act as a \u201cmiddleman\u201d in the scheme, prosecutors said.\n\nIn October 2015, Benzema approached his fellow France player in his room at the national team\u2019s training camp.\n\nBenzema said he had merely tried to help his teammate dispose of the x-rated video, warning him: \u201cBe careful, Math, they\u2019re big, big thugs.\u201d\n\nHe then offered to put him touch with someone he could trust \u2013 his childhood friend, Mr Zenati.\n\nFrance\u2019s forward Karim Benzema (L) celebrates with teammate midfielder Mathieu Valbuena\n\nPolice were by now tapping their phone calls and recorded Benzema telling his friend: \u201cHe\u2019s not taking us seriously.\u201d\n\nMr Zenati is said to have replied: \u201cWe\u2019re here to sort it out; if he doesn\u2019t want that he\u2019ll have to deal with the piranhas.\u201d\n\nGiving evidence at the start of the trial, Valbuena said he had never considered handing over money to stop the video getting out.\n\nUnlike his former teammate, Valbuena has not played for France since the scandal began.\n\nTestifying during the trial, Valbuena told the court that football was his life.\n\n\u201cI knew if that video got out it would make things difficult with the French team,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Ethiopia\u2019s Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has gone to direct the war effort from the front lines, state-affiliated media reported.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Demeke Mekonnen Hassen will take charge of routine government business in Abiy\u2019s absence, Fana news outlet said on Wednesday.\n\nGovernment spokesman Legesse Tulu detailed the transfer of some routine duties in a news conference, the report from Fana said.\n\nAbiy announced late on Monday he was planning to personally direct the fight against Tigrayan forces and their allies.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s meet at the war front,\u201d he wrote \u201cThe time has come to lead the country with sacrifice.\u201d\n\nLast month Tigrayan forces and their allies threatened to march on the capital Addis Ababa; they have also been fighting fiercely to try to cut a transport corridor linking landlocked Ethiopia with the region\u2019s main port Djibouti.\n\nOn Tuesday, US Special Envoy Jeffrey Feltman said the Ethiopian military and regional militias had been able to hold back Tigrayan attempts to cut the corridor but Tigrayan forces had been able to move south towards Addis.\n\nEthiopia\u2019s military spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nTens of thousands of people are estimated to have been killed and hundreds of thousands pushed into famine conditions since November last year when the prime minister ordered a military offensive against the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF), which dominated the central government for decades before Abiy took office in 2018.\n\nThe Tigrayan forces have continued to press towards Addis Ababa, claiming control of the town of Shewa Robit, just 220km (136 miles) northeast of the capital by road.\n\nMuch of northern Ethiopia is under a communications blackout and access for journalists is restricted, making battlefield claims difficult to corroborate.\n\nAt least one prominent distance runner \u2013 marathoner and Olympic silver medallist Feyisa Lelisa \u2013 has joined thousands of ordinary Ethiopians keen to follow Abiy\u2019s lead.\n\nWorld powers have voiced alarm about a military escalation that could scuttle efforts to broker a ceasefire, as rebels claim they are advancing towards the capital Addis Ababa and foreign governments tell their citizens to leave.\n\nOn Wednesday hundreds of new army recruits took part in a ceremony held in their honour in the Kolfe district of Addis Ababa.\n\nAs officials corralled sheep and oxen into trucks bound for the north, the recruits broke into patriotic songs and chants.\n\n\u201cI was amazed when I heard\u201d Abiy planned to join soldiers in the field, one of the recruits, 42-year-old driver Tesfaye Sherefa, told AFP.\n\n\u201cWhen a leader leaves his chair\u2026 and his throne it is to rescue his country. His focus is not to live, but to rescue this country, and I sobbed when he said \u2018follow me\u2019 and went to the front line.\u201d\n\nAbiy announced on Monday night his plan \u201cto lead the defence forces\u201d from the front, but officials and state media have not provided details on his movements since then.\n\nThe recruits in Kolfe nevertheless took his statement to heart, sporting T-shirts emblazoned with a picture of Abiy in uniform and the words \u201cWe have a historic responsibility to defend the free name of Ethiopia.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel proud and I stand with him,\u201d 25-year-old Esubalew Wale, another recruit, told AFP.\n\nFeyisa, the distance runner, told state media the rebels\u2019 advance presented \u201ca great opportunity\u201d to defend the country.\n\nThe marathoner gained political prominence by raising and crossing his arms as he finished the marathon at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro \u2013 a gesture of solidarity with fellow ethnic Oromos killed while protesting abuses committed during nearly three decades of TPLF rule.\n\nIn the state media interview which aired Wednesday, Feyisa said he would relish the chance to fight the TPLF himself.\n\n\u201cWhen a country is violated, there is no way I will stand by and just watch,\u201d he said.\n\nA separate state media report quoted Ethiopia\u2019s most famous distance-running champion, Haile Gebreselassie, as saying he, too, would fight at the front.\n\nBut footage of the interview did not air and AFP could not independently verify it.",

          "text": "Magdalena Andersson has been approved by Sweden\u2019s parliament as the country\u2019s first ever female prime minister, after replacing Stefan Lofven as leader of the centre-left Social Democrats.\n\nSweden is the only Nordic country never to have elected a woman as national leader before.\n\nMs Andersson, who\u2019s currently finance minister, did not win Wednesday\u2019s vote.\n\nHowever, she was elected because under Swedish law she only needed a majority of MPs not to vote against her.\n\nA hundred years after Swedish women were given the vote, the 54-year-old Social Democrat leader was given a standing ovation by sections of the parliament, or Riksdag.\n\nHer election at the head of a minority government followed an 11th-hour deal with the opposition Left party, in exchange for higher pensions for many Swedes. She also secured the support of coalition partner the Greens as well as the Centre party.\n\nOf the 349 members of the Riksdag, 174 voted against her. But on top of the 117 MPs who backed Ms Andersson, a further 57 abstained, giving her victory by a single vote.\n\nA former junior swimming champion from the university city of Uppsala, she began her political career in 1996 as political adviser to then-Prime Minister Goran Persson. She has spent the past seven years as finance minister.\n\nHowever, she faces a tough job from the outset, with opposition parties on the right saying they\u2019ll reject the government\u2019s 2022 budget later on Wednesday. The Centre party, which backed her for the job of prime minister, says it will not support a finance package from a government \u201cmoving far to the left\u201d.\n\nWith a self-labelled \u201cfeminist government\u201d, and a brand tied to \u201cgender-equal\u201d policies like shared parental leave, it is a paradox that Sweden hasn\u2019t had a woman as prime minister until now. All the other Nordic nations currently have or have had women in charge.\n\nNorway was first with Gro Harlem Brundtland in 1981.\n\nIt is hard to say why Sweden has lagged behind its neighbours, since women have long had a strong political presence. Around half of all MPs are women. Including Ms Andersson\u2019s Social Democrats, six out of eight parties in parliament currently have female leaders.\n\nCurrent Finance Minister and Social Democratic Party leader Magdalena Andersson arrives for a press conference after being appointed to new Prime Minister after a voting in the Swedish parliament Riksdagen, 24 November 2021\n\nOne factor may be that the Social Democrats have had long spells in government, and parties in power can be less likely to replace leaders as regularly.\n\nTragedy may have also played a role.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Foreign Minister Anna Lindh was seen as a likely candidate to take over from Social Democrat Prime Minister Goran Persson, but she died after a stabbing attack. Mona Sahlin led the party from 2007 to 2011, but there was low confidence in her leadership and she lost the 2010 election.\n\nAs well as the uphill task of getting a budget passed, Ms Andersson faces other big challenges as she takes on the role.\n\nAlthough Sweden has a relatively low rate of Covid-19 infection, there are concerns that infections will peak next month.\n\nThe government announced on Wednesday that third Covid vaccinations would be rolled out to everyone over 18, and that vaccination passes would be required for any public gathering involving over 100 people from 1 December.",

          "title": "Missouri Man Exonerated in Three Killings, Free after 42 Years",
          "text": "A Kansas City man who was jailed for more than 40 years for three murders was released from prison Tuesday after a judge ruled that he was wrongfully convicted in 1979.\n\nKevin Strickland, 62, has always maintained that he was home watching television and had nothing to do with the killings, which happened when he was 18 years old. He learned of the decision when the news scrolled across the television screen as he was watching a soap opera. He said inmates began screaming.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not necessarily angry. It\u2019s a lot. I think I\u2019ve created emotions that you all don\u2019t know about just yet,\u201d he told reporters as he left the Western Missouri Correctional Center in Cameron. \u201cJoy, sorrow, fear. I am trying to figure out how to put them together.\u201d\n\nHe said he would like to get involved in efforts to \u201ckeep this from happening to someone else,\u201d saying the criminal justice system \u201cneeds to be torn down and redone.\u201d\n\nJudge James Welsh, a retired Missouri Court of Appeals judge, ruled after a three-day evidentiary hearing requested by a Jackson County prosecutor who said evidence used to convict Strickland had since been recanted or disproven.\n\nWelsh wrote in his judgement that \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d was presented that \u201cundermines the Court\u2019s confidence in the judgement of conviction.\u201d He noted that no physical evidence linked Strickland to the crime scene and that a key witness recanted before her death.\n\n\u201cUnder these unique circumstances, the Court\u2019s confidence in Strickland\u2019s convictions is so undermined that it cannot stand, and the judgment of conviction must be set aside,\u201d Welsh wrote in ordering Strickland\u2019s immediate release.\n\nJackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker, who pushed for his freedom, moved quickly to dismiss the criminal charges against him so he could be released.\n\n\u201cTo say we\u2019re extremely pleased and grateful is an understatement,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cThis brings justice \u2014 finally \u2014 to a man who has tragically suffered so so greatly as a result of this wrongful conviction.\u201d\n\nBut Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt, a Republican running for the U.S. Senate, said Strickland was guilty and had fought to keep him incarcerated.\n\n\u201cIn this case, we defended the rule of law and the decision that a jury of Mr. Strickland\u2019s peers made after hearing all of the facts in the case,\u201d Schmitt spokesman Chris Nuelle said in a brief statement. \u201cThe Court has spoken, no further action will be taken in this matter.\u201d\n\nGov. Mike Parson, who declined Strickland\u2019s clemency requests, tweeted simply that: \u201cThe Court has made its decision, we respect the decision, and the Department of Corrections will proceed with Mr. Strickland\u2019s release immediately.\u201d\n\nStrickland was convicted in the deaths of Larry Ingram, 21; John Walker, 20; and Sherrie Black, 22, at a home in Kansas City.\n\nThe evidentiary hearing focused largely on testimony from Cynthia Douglas, the only person to survive the April 25, 1978, shootings. She initially identified Strickland as one of four men who shot the victims and testified to that during his two trials.\n\nWelsh wrote that she had doubts soon after the conviction but initially was \u201chesitant to act because she feared she could face perjury charges if she were to publicly recant statements previously made under oath.\u201d\n\nShe later said she was pressured by police to choose Strickland and tried for years to alert political and legal experts to help her prove she had identified the wrong man, according to testimony during the hearing from her family, friends and a co-worker. Douglas died in 2015.\n\nDuring the hearing, attorneys for the Missouri Attorney General\u2019s office argued that Strickland\u2019s advocates had not provided a paper trail that proved Douglas tried to recant her identification of Strickland, saying the theory was based on \u201chearsay, upon hearsay, upon hearsay,\u201d\n\nThe judge also noted that two other men convicted in the killings later insisted Strickland wasn\u2019t involved. They named two other suspects who were never charged.\n\nDuring his testimony, Strickland denied suggestions that he offered Douglas $300 to \u201ckeep her mouth shut,\u201d and said he had never visited the house where the murders occurred before they happened.\n\nStrickland is Black, and his first trial ended in a hung jury when the only Black juror, a woman, held out for acquittal. After his second trial in 1979, he was convicted by an all-white jury of one count of capital murder and two counts of second-degree murder.\n\nIn May, Peters Baker announced that a review of the case led her to believe that Strickland was innocent.\n\nIn June, the Missouri Supreme Court declined to hear Strickland\u2019s petition.\n\nIn August, Peters Baker used a new state law to seek the evidentiary hearing in Jackson County, where Strickland was convicted. The law allows local prosecutors to challenge convictions if they believe the defendant did not commit the crime. It was the first time \u2014 and so far the only time \u2014 that a prosecutor has used the law to fight a previous conviction.\n\n\u201cEven when the prosecutor is on your side, it took months and months for Mr. Strickland to come home and he still had to come home to a system that will not provide him any compensation for the 43 years he lost,\u201d said Tricia Rojo Bushnell, executive director of the Midwest Innocence Project, who stood by Strickland\u2019s side as he was released.\n\nThe state only allows wrongful imprisonment payments to people exonerated through DNA evidence, so Strickland doesn\u2019t qualify.\n\n\u201cThat is not justice,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we are hopeful that folks are paying so much attention and really asking the question of \u2018What should our system of justice look like?\u2019\u201d",
