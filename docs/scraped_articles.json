          "title": "Zamfara bandit boasts about exploits in trending video",
          "text": "In a video which went viral on Saturday, a notorious bandit operating within the precincts of Zamfara forest boasted about his operations and exploits against the Nigerian military.\n\nThe bandit, identified as Dankarami (meaning \u2018Small\u2019 in Hausa), was seen holding a rifle while surrounded by a crowd and granting an interview to some persons.\n\nIn the video which lasted four minutes and 40 seconds, the dreadlocks-wearing bandit was seen boasting about some of his exploits, especially ambushes against military convoys.\n\nIt was not clear when the video was shot but it is believed to have been shot a few months ago.\n\nThe amateur video is believed to have been taken in Zurmi forest, where Dankarami holds sway.\n\nHe told his listeners, \u201cMy strength and that of Allah gives me success. Fire! Anyone who touches it knows that it\u2019s not sweet. I swear, they left us alone. That is why I came here.\n\n\u201cI called the Emir, who was removed and now lives in Gusau. I told him to let us live in peace. I told him I did not come back home for terrorism.\n\n\u201cI came home to live in peace with my parents. If he hears there is trouble anywhere and I\u2019m involved, he should call our parents to speak to us, but his reply was that he could never live with a terrorist. Was that not so?\n\n\u201cI switched off my phone, removed my SIM card and since then, I only use the phones of my boys to call.\u201d\n\nDankarami further said, \u201cAfter three months, they brought in soldiers and took them to Dumburum. I allowed them. My house was under the road they passed; I let them.\n\n\u201cI relocated my wives and stayed alone with my boys. One evening, on the fourth day, on their way from Gusau, I dealt with them (soldiers).\n\n\u201cThey sent another team and I killed half of them. Another evening, they ambushed my brothers who were bringing me supplies and seized their motorcycles. They joined forces with Niger State. I dealt with them. I\u2019m still here till tomorrow.\n\n\u201cNo one can arrest me unless I let them. Whatever they (my boys) want to do, they won\u2019t do until I say so. The other day, they went to Zurmi and kidnapped children, small children. I was sleeping at home; they said there were 40 people. I took them back. Since our parents pleaded with us to return the children, did we collect a single naira? Did anyone give us anything?\n\n\u201cSo, if I give my word to a person, if the person rejects or accepts it, it\u2019s fine, I don\u2019t care. I can only say this: no love exists between me and those people across the road to the North. Everyone knows, I have no business with them. My boys don\u2019t operate along Jaja, where they kill innocent people. We don\u2019t kill innocent people.\u201d\n\nIt was not clear if Dankarami\u2019s claim of some children was in reference to 40 children kidnapped alongside 160 others from a school in Niger State in May 2021.\n\nFor the past five years, the northwestern part of Nigeria has become engulfed by attacks carried out by bandits, who have carried out vicious attacks on local communities, killing scores of people, and kidnapping as many as they can for ransoms.\n\nZamfara, Katsina, and Kaduna states are the epicentres of the growing crisis.\n\nIn the first half of 2020 alone, at least 1,126 people were killed by bandits in northern Nigeria, according to Amnesty International.\n\nIn the last six months, hundreds of students have also been kidnapped in at least five separate incidents. In some cases, students have been killed by their kidnappers even after ransoms were paid.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Bandits on the rampage, attack air force patrol in Zamfara, Kogi Assembly",
          "text": "Suspected bandits went on the rampage during the week, attacking at least three hallowed institutions in the country: the Kogi State House of Assembly Complex; Olusegun Agagu University of Science and Technology, Okitipupa, Ondo State; and the Nigerian Air Force in Zamfara State.\n\nIn Zamfara State, bandits on Thursday attacked a patrol team of Operation Hadarin Daji, comprising operatives of the Nigerian Air Force and Police Special Forces, in the Bundugu area of the state.\n\nAn encounter between the troops and the bandits left two security operatives, a police inspector and a NAF operative identified as James Okpu, dead. Seven bandits were also reportedly killed during the gun duel.\n\nSunday PUNCH learnt that the incident occurred at a time the no-fly zone directive ordered by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd), to curtail the activities of bandits in the state was still in force.\n\nOkpu\u2019s family and friends have since taken to social media to mourn him.\n\nHis brother, Maro Okpu, who posted the pictures of the deceased, wrote, \u201cWhy now, brother? You never planned to \u2018let go\u2019 in such a hard way. (You are) always in our heart, kid brother. Rest on.\u201d\n\nAnother family member simply identified as Paul also wrote on Facebook, \u201cGone too soon, my own James Azabanabhelam Egbogba Okpu.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, one of Okpu\u2019s relatives, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said a military officer close to the family first broke the news to him.\n\nThe relative claimed that the commander of the deceased\u2019s unit later called to commiserate with the bereaved family.\n\nThe source said, \u201cOn Thursday, I got a call from someone who claimed to be the deceased\u2019s commander. He asked after my well-being and asked if I heard what happened to my brother. I told him I heard. He then said, \u2018Take heart. I am sorry. May his soul rest in peace.\u2019 I hit my phone against the floor and began to weep.\n\n\u201cThe deceased was a young man. He had been the pillar of our family ever since we lost our parents. He joined the Air Force to fend for the family. One of my brothers met me crying. He picked up the phone and called the commander.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t tell me much about what they discussed. All he just said was that we should go to Abuja. I called the commander\u2019s number on Friday with the elders of the family being present to get information on how he died. The commander said I should call back, but since then we have not been able to talk.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted, the Director of Public Relations and Information, NAF, Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet, confirmed that a patrol team of Operation Hadarin Daji was attacked by bandits at Bundugu in Zamfara State.\n\nGabkwet said the troops killed seven bandits but lost two personnel, including a NAF operative.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere was no attack on the NAF base in Zamfara State. Instead, a patrol team of Operation Hadarin Daji, comprising members of the armed forces and Police Special Forces, came under attack by bandits at Bundugu.\n\n\u201cAs usual, our troops waded off the attack and killed seven bandits. Sadly, we lost one of our gallant airmen and a police inspector.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Gabkwet debunked reports that armed men attacked the Air Force base in Kaduna on Saturday.\n\nHe said this in a statement titled, \u2018No attempted attack on NAF Base in Kaduna.\u2019\n\nThe statement read, \u201cMerchants of fake news are at it again. This time round, their focus is on the premier Nigerian Air Force Base in Kaduna, which they claimed came under terrorist attack in the early hours of June 26, 2021.\n\n\u201cMembers of the public should please disregard the news as it is entirely false. There was nothing of such as the inhabitants of the entire base are going about their normal business without any threat whatsoever.\u201d\n\nReferencing Saturday\u2019s attacks, the Nigerian Army said troops of Division 8 neutralised several suspected bandits in Talata Maraf Local Government Area of Zamfara State.\n\nThe army said the bandits and troops engaged in a fierce gun battle during their patrol along Mayanchi-Dogo, Karfe, and Fagantama villages in the state.\n\nIn a statement, the Director of Army Public Relations, Onyema Nwachukwu, said troops also killed five bandits and injured others in a separate operation in Bungudu in Zamfara State.\n\nThe statement was titled, \u2018Nigerian Army troops neutralise scores of bandits in fierce encounter, recover arms and ammunition.\u2019\n\nIt read, \u201cIn the fierce encounter that ensued, the bandits were overwhelmed by the superior firepower of the troops.\n\n\u201cThis led to scores of bandits being neutralised. The troops also recovered one PKT rifle, large cache of ammunition, and a motorcycle.\n\n\u201cRelatedly, troops have neutralised five bandits in another encounter at Bingi village, in the Bungudu Local Government Area of Zamfara State. During the gun duel, the bandits withdrew in disarray, having sustained severe gunshot wounds. The gallant troops recovered one AK-47 rifle, one motorcycle, and three mobile phones from the routed criminals.\u201d\n\nBandits invade Kogi House of Assembly\n\nIn a related development, bandits on Friday raided the Kogi State House of Assembly Complex and carted away property worth millions of naira.\n\nThe Speaker of the Kogi House of Assembly, Mr Matthew Kolawole, who confirmed the incident in an interview with one of our correspondents, said \u201csome armed bandits invaded the Assembly on Friday and made away with armoured cables, TV sets and other office valuables.\u201d\n\nKolawole expressed concern over the development, saying that the bandits\u2019 invasion had exposed the porous security at the complex.\n\n\u201cSecurity men attached to the Assembly Complex should sit up in the discharge of their duty or would be made to face interrogation over their lapses in the protection of lives and property at the House of Assembly Complex,\u201d the Speaker warned.\n\nKolawole appealed to the security agencies in the state to ensure arrest of those who invaded the Assembly to avert future occurrence.\n\nHe, however, expressed joy that no life was lost during the attack.\n\nOndo varsity shut as hoodlums, rob, rape students\n\nMeanwhile, the management of the Olusegun Agagu University of Science and Technology, Okitipupa, Ondo State has ordered the closure of the institution for two weeks following the spate of insecurity on the campus.\n\nThe development followed a protest embarked upon by the students last Thursday to register their displeasure over the incessant robberies at their hostels, rape of female students by hoodlums, and threats to their lives and property.\n\nA source told one of our correspondents that about four female students were raped by hoodlums in the last two weeks.\n\nThe President of the school\u2019s Students\u2019 Union Government, Damilola Okunomo, confirmed the raping of some students, saying they were tired of the level of insecurity in the school environment.\n\nApart from the rape of female students at gunpoint, Okunomo also said many students had been dispossessed of their valuables such as phones, laptops, and other gadgets.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are tired of insecurity. Hoodlums usually come to our off-campus hostels, rob students at gunpoint, and rape our female students.\n\n\u201cThe school management is not doing enough as we are the ones securing ourselves by working as vigilantes most times. The situation is terrible.\n\n\u201cWe urge the school management to do its best in securing us and complete all the uncompleted hostel accommodations on the campus.\u201d\n\nHowever, in a reaction, the Dean of Student Affairs, OAUSTECH, Mr Ilemobayo Oguntimehin, stated that the school management was doing its best to secure the lives and property of the students.\n\nSimilarly, the university\u2019s Public Relations Officer, Mr Abdulazeez Adebayo, said the school had already taken steps to ensure the safety of the students\u2019 lives and property.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is true that the students staged a peaceful protest, and the school has been shut. The management will be meeting with all the traditional rulers and other stakeholders in the communities over the students\u2019 security.\n\n\u201cIn few days from now , the school will organise a security summit that will involve all the stakeholders in the area.\u201d\n\nDestroy terrorists\u2019 enclaves, COAS charges troops\n\nMeanwhile, the Chief of Army Staff, Major General Faruk Yahaya, had charged troops of Sector 2 Joint Task Force North East, Operation Hadin Kai, to destroy all Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province\u2019s enclaves in their various locations.\n\nAccording to a statement by the Director of Army Public Relations, Nwachukwu, the COAS stated this while addressing troops in Yobe State on Saturday.\n\nThe statement was titled, \u2018Destroy all Boko Haram terrorists enclaves in your locations, COAS charges troops in Yobe.\u2019\n\nIt read in part, \u201cGeneral Yahaya further commended the troops on the several successful operations conducted within Sector 2 area of responsibility, which he enumerated to include operations Ayiso Tamunoma, Katana Jimlan, Fire Ball, and Tura Takaibango.\n\n\u201cHe enjoined the troops to use their wealth of experience and lessons learnt from the series of operations to destroy the remnants of marauding terrorists within their various locations.\n\n\u201cHe assured them of improved welfare and a new reward system for troops who perform gallantly in any operation.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": ".\n\nBy Kingsley Omonobi\n\n\n\nAn entrepreneur, Mr Henry Dakpokpo, has challenged Nigerians for support in bridging unemployment gap in the country by looking for ways to create jobs for the teaming number of unemployed youths in the country.\n\nDakpokpo made the call during the opening of his multi-purpose business centre called the \u201cPlatterz\u201d on Saturday in New Karu Local Government Area of Nasarawa State.\n\nHe said the need to create jobs and contribute to the economic development of Nigeria was a major factor that led to establishment of the centre.\n\nHe remarked that the business complex known as the \u201cPricipal Arena\u201d, comprise of restaurant, lounge, laundry, barbers and beauty saloons.\n\n\u201cThis is the first outlet and our projection is that within a space of 12 months we should have at least three or more outlets within FCT.\n\n\u201cI feel sad. The government alone has not been able to bridge that unemployment gap and we need to task our entrepreneurs to think outside the box and even those looking for jobs can become job creators as well.\n\n\u201cThe thing is that we have taken 60 employees now and we are probably going to take a hundred as time goes on.\n\n\u201cIf more entrepreneurs take a hundred employees each, we will definitely get a lot of people off the street and the less the number of unemployed the less the rate of crimes.\n\n\u201cThis is because people commit crimes because they want to eat,\u201d he said.\n\nDapokpo said the idea behind setting up of the place was borne out of the need to bring comfort close to the people at a lower level just like we have in Maitama and Wuse 2 axis.\n\nHe said that the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) space in Nigeria had been difficult, adding that an entrepreneur needed to be dogged to be able to operate a business.\n\nHe added that the hike in price of food items would pose further challenges to SMEs in the country.\n\nAs part of Police community relations support, Engr Dakpkopo built and donated a toilet facility to support the Area B Police Station located st Abacha Road as a way of giving support to boosting the security of lives and property in the area.\n\nSpeaking while inaugurating the business outlet and the toilet facility for the police, Pastor Dipo Fisho of Christ Embassy, Jabi, said the setting up of the business place and the donation to the police was a demonstration of God\u2019s word.\n\nHe said it was a blessing for young people to invest in the society and help young people to grow.\n\n\u201cI am glad and I congratulate the Dakpokpo family for what they are doing and what they have done because many young people will get employed and have a means of livelihood.\n\n\u201cIt is something for everybody to emulate by being a blessing not just to your locality but to Nigeria in general,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Divisional Police Officer, CSP Abayomi Philip, said he was delighted that God brought Mr Dakpokpo to the area to support the station, adding that the provision of the toilet facility would serve as encouragement for them to discharge their duty.\n\nPhilip assured the residents of the commitment of the police to ensure safety of their lives and property.\n\nThe DPO urged the youths to get engaged in profitable ventures so as to shun crimes.",

Our great Church, The African Church, has made her impact known virtually in all sectors of life.\n\n\u201cI want to put it on record that The African Church has made mark in the Political, Educational and Health sectors of this nation-Nigeria.\n\nAkinsanya said that \u201cThe Church previously had several institutions; Primary School, Secondary Grammar Schools, Teacher training Colleges andColleges of Education, and Health Centres and Maternity Homes, among others.\u201d",

He was a herald of the Gospel and agent of transformation, economic empowerment and spiritual liberation. He is known by the Christian community here in the United States and around the globe as a man of prayer, prophetic insight, a dynamic teacher, philanthropist and humanitarian.\n\n\u201cFor over 25 years, he has been a great source of inspiration through televangelism which has broadly impacted the religious heritage of many nations. His life reflects the words of the Apostle Paul in Philippians 1:21-23 \u2013 \u201cFor to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain. If I am to go on living in the body, this will mean fruitful labour for me. Yet what shall I choose? I do not know! I am torn between the two: I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is better by far.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was indeed a 21st-century prophet who has completed his assignment and has made his transition to join our great prophetic ancestors including Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, John the Baptist and Zechariah. Several scholars have listed him among the world\u2019s most famous prophets.\n\n\u201cIt was always our desire to have Prophet T.B. Joshua to minister at our gathering here in Washington DC but God had other plans for him in this time and season. We thank God for the thousands of lives that were delivered from spiritual, social and economic bondage through his ministry. He has fought a good fight; he has finished his course and he has kept the faith. May his soul rest in peace and light perpetual shine on him\u201d.\n\nTB Joshua served God, humanity with passion \u2013 Goodluck Jonathan mourns",

          "title": "Face to face with alleged murderer of super tv CEO",
          "text": "By Chioma Okezie-Okeh And Kate Halim\n\nChidinma Adaora Ojukwu, the 21-year-old girl and 300-level student of Mass Communication, University of Lagos, suspected of murdering Usifo Ataga, Chief Executive Officer, SuperTV, has, in an exclusive interview with Saturday Sun, opened up on her life trajectory that led into the heinous crime.\n\nOjukwu who spoke to our reporters at the State Criminal Investigation Department, Panti, Lagos, where she is currently being held pending the conclusion of investigation into the alleged murder and her formal charge to court, revealed, not only how she dropped out of school because of poverty but also the fact that she comes from a broken home. Asked about her mum, she said: \u201cMy dad raised me. I don\u2019t have contact with my mom. We don\u2019t talk. I have an older sister and a younger sister.\u201d\n\nOther things she told Saturday Sun include how she went into the life of drugs. Her fellow students who spoke to our paper expressed shock over her involvement with the cold-blooded murder of the TV entrepreneur. But the girl who regrets her action advises other ambitious girls to learn from her mistake.\n\nWhat Chidinma told Saturday Sun\n\nWhen the suspect was interviewed, she revealed that the last time she visited campus was before the coronavirus pandemic lockdown. As she explained, this was because there was no money for her to go back to school to continue her education pursuit.\n\nShe was also asked what the so-called \u201cRoofies\u201d was. She had taken the substance, along with Ataga, and that spiked up the man\u2019s libido and made him to start pursuing her all over the place, including around the kitchen cabinet and demanding for another round of sex, even when she was too tired to engage in such act. She revealed that it is a street lingo for Rophynol. She confessed that she started taking drugs at a party she attended one year ago. \u201cThe first time I took it, I wasn\u2019t myself. But I continued taking it because my body later got used to it. It makes me feel high\u201d, she added.\n\nAsked what the drug Rohypnol is used for, she said that it makes one feels high so much \u201cyou can do things you have never done before.\u201d\n\n\u2018Roofies\u2019 at a glance\n\nDuring her confession, Chidinma alleged that the deceased gave her Roofies about an hour before the unfortunate incident. Experts contacted by Saturday Sun confirm that roofies is a street name for Rohypnol. It is also known as \u201cForget-me pill,\u201d \u201cMexican Valium\u201d and date rape drug.\n\nBut as a tranquilizer, it is about ten times more potent than Valium. The drug is available as a white or olive-green pill and is usually sold in the manufacturer\u2019s bubble packaging. Users crush the pills and snort the powder, sprinkle it on marijuana and smoke it, dissolve it in a drink or inject it.\n\nRohypnol, they say, has been used to commit sexual assaults because it renders the victim incapable of resisting, giving it the reputation of a \u201cdate-rape\u201d drug. Its users often describe its effects as \u201cparalyzing.\u201d The effect starts 20 to 30 minutes after taking the drug and peaks within two hours. But it may persist for eight or even 12 hours. A person can be so incapacitated (made unable to act), that they collapse. They lie on the floor, eyes open, able to observe events but completely unable to move. Afterwards, memory is impaired and they cannot recall any of the things that happened. The person may experience loss of muscle control, confusion, drowsiness and amnesia. The drug is sold in Europe and Latin America as a sleeping pill, but it is illegal in the United States and Nigeria.\n\nThe real me\n\n\u2013Chidinma\n\nBut the suspect, who looked sober, also took the opportunity to talk about herself when she is not under the influence of drugs. She described herself as an introvert who goes to clubs to unwind once in a while. She was raised in Ilasa, Lagos by her uncle and aunty, she said. She attended Government Primary School.\n\nFor her secondary school education, she attended Alagomeji Secondary School, Yaba, Lagos, but initially stopped at Junior Secondary School 2 owing to paucity of fund. She later went back and continued from Senior Secondary School 1 but also stopped again due to lack of finance. She later managed to complete her secondary school education. She wrote SSCE and UTME and gained admission into the University of Lagos where she was studying Mass Communication before the incident.\n\nChidinma revealed that her dad is an accountant while her mom is a trader. Her parents are not together, she informed our reporters. They have been separated for a long time. Looking downcast, she talks about deeply regretting her action. She said that she wouldn\u2019t have done what she did if she had the opportunity to go back in time.\n\nShe advised young girls to face their education and try to live a good and modest life so that they don\u2019t end up with the wrong crowd like she did. Questioned further on her love life, she said she doesn\u2019t have a boyfriend and remarked that right now she is afraid of her future, given the consequence of her action in the face of the law.\n\nThe mood in her neighboourhood and department\n\nWhen our reporters visited her neighborhood at Alagomeji, Yaba, Lagos, where she lives with her father, they found everywhere quiet and seemingly deserted. Some of the neighbours who spoke to them stated that they were shocked to learn about her involvement with the alleged murder of the TV boss.\n\nAt the Mass Communication Department, University of Lagos, where she is a 300 level student, some students were seen going about their lectures while others were seen sitting in groups and discussing the development in hush tones.\n\nOne of her course-mates who identified herself as Anita told Saturday Sun how shocked she was to learn that the innocent-looking girl she described as \u201ccool and soft-spoken\u201d is now being linked with the murder of someone. She said although the accused has admitted committing the crime, she is still finding it difficult to believe that she did it, given all that she knows about her.\n\nAnita\u2019s words: \u201cWe don\u2019t talk much. We just say hi to each other whenever we meet in the department. She is so gentle and doesn\u2019t seem capable of hurting a fly. She doesn\u2019t interact with many people because she keeps to herself a lot.\u201d\n\nA young man who identified himself as Godwin Udoh also said that the alleged action of Chidinma who he said has not been to class for some time came as a big shock to him. \u201cWhen I read the story, I couldn\u2019t believe that a soft-spoken, gentle and shy girl like Chidinma could kill a man stronger than she is,\u201d he said. \u201cI just think she\u2019s not telling the whole truth.\u201d\n\nHer father is also shocked, Saturday Sun learnt. According to a police source, when detectives arrived his residence to arrest her, her father, believing that someone somewhere was either trying to frame her innocent daughter for murder that it might be a case of mistaken identity, tried to stop them from carrying out their duty. He put up stiff resistance. But somehow the operatives overpowered him and later had him arrested and taken into custody for trying to obstruct justice. But he has since been released.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "\u2022Says crisis-ridden party back to life\n\n\u2022Dates for congresses at all levels ratified\n\nDeji Elumoye and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has granted another six months tenure extension to the Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nThe President gave the approval yesterday morning after a closed-door meeting with members of the Committee at the State House, Abuja.\n\nSources said the Buni-led committee requested for another six months tenure extension after doing 12 months, to enable them \u201cput the party in very good shape and conduct a seamless elective National Convention.\u201d\n\nThe Caretaker Chairman and Governor of Yobe State, Buni presented a summary of the Committee\u2019s progress report to the President at the meeting.\n\nThe Chairman was accompanied to the meeting with the President by other members of the committee \u2013 Governor Isiaka Oyetola of Osun State, Governor Abubakar Sani Bello of Niger State, Ken Nnamani, Abubakar Yusuf, Akinyemi Olaide, Mrs. Stella Oketete, Dr. James Lulu, Chief David Lyon, Abba Ali, Prof. Tahir Mamman, Ismail Ahmed and the committee\u2019s Secretary, John Akpanudoedehe.\n\nAkpanudoedehe, in a statement after the meeting, said the President approved the tenure extension after a detailed consideration of the progress report, the schedule of outstanding activities with regards to congresses, the National Convention and the forthcoming Anambra State Governorship election.\n\nHe said by virtue of the extension, the tenure of the caretaker committees at each level from wards, local governments, states and national, would end immediately elections were held at their respective levels with officers immediately take oath of office, terminating with the National Convention.\n\nThe secretary recalled that at its last meeting, the National Executive Committee (NEC) conferred on the Committee, the power of the National Convention, \u201cwhich is in line with powers provided in Article 13.3 of the party\u2019s constitution.\u201d\n\nAkpanudoedehe stated: \u201cPresident Buhari on Friday approved the review of the timelines available to the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC).\n\n\u201cThe President also approved the timetable for APC Ward, Local Government and State Congresses. Ward Congresses will hold 24th July, 2021 followed by Local Government Congresses on 14th August, 2021 and State Congresses on 18th September, 2021.\u201d\n\nAkpanudoedehe noted that Buni informed the President that the Committee had during the period under review, led the party to contest in several elections and bye-elections, with an overall success rate of 95 per cent.\n\nOn the peace and reconciliation efforts, he said the Chairman informed the President that the committee commenced its assignment with the desire to foster genuine reconciliation on solid foundation, by giving all issues and every aggrieved member fair hearing and objectively placing party interests above individual interests.\n\n\u201cI am pleased to state that the party is now more peaceful, more accommodating, and more united with greater prospects than when we came on board,\u201d Akpanudoedehe quoted Buni as telling Buhari.\n\nOn the Anambra governorship election, the secretary stressed that the chairman notified the President that 14 aspirants indicated interest to contest the election through purchase of expression of interest and nomination forms, and that all of them had been cleared by the Screening Committee as eligible to contest.\n\nHe added: \u201cAmong other achievements in the CECPC\u2019s administration of the party, the National Chairman informed the President that \u201cthe CECPC inherited liability of unpaid legal fee to the tune of N340 million, but successfully negotiated and brought down the fees to N179 million which is now fully paid.\u201d\n\nThe secretary added that the Chairman informed the President that the Committee had been very cautious and meticulous in making arrangements to conduct credible, transparent, flawless and generally acceptable congresses and convention for the party to produce a strong leadership that will enjoy the support, trust and confidence of all members.\n\n\u201cAt all times, we have enjoyed the confidence of Mr. President and enjoyed your leadership. In developing the timetable for the congresses and convention, the support to conduct a credible election cannot be over-emphasised; this will also justify the successes recorded and the status of the new APC that we have all dreamt of,\u201d Akpanudoedehe quoted Buni as telling the President.\n\nDuring the meeting at the State House, President Buhari took a holistic look at the activities of the APC in recent times and concluded that the party, which was crisis ridden, had been revived and now fully back to life.\n\nHe, therefore, congratulated the Mala Buni-led committee for its task to return the party from a comatose state to proper reorganisation at all levels.\n\nThe President said the APC had been revived, energised and repositioned for its forthcoming national convention and future elections.\n\nAccording to him, the fortunes of the party had been brightened by the re-organisation and reconciliation of members across the party, saying \u201cwith the work done by the committee the party has bounced back to life.\n\n\u201cI have listened with great interest to the remarkable job you have done so far. We are all witnesses to the crisis that engulfed the party leading to litigations and presented a picture of selfishness and division,\u201d said the President.\n\nPresident Buhari said the party\u2019s structure was disturbed by the conflicts that preceded and followed various elections, noting that the secretariat had been witnessing a beehive of peaceful activities after the reconciliation.\n\nThe President said: \u201cIt is gratifying to note that with the coming of the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee and its effective management of the affairs of the party and the pursuit of its mandate, the party has bounced back to life and the National Secretariat of our party has once again become a beehive of activities, as it used to be in the good old days before the crisis.\u201d\n\nThe President told members of the committee that they would continue to enjoy the support of all party stalwarts and members to complete their assignment with the actualisation of the convention and leave an \u201cindelible footprint\u2019\u2019.\n\nHe said: \u201cI wish to assure you that your committee will continue to enjoy my support and that of other stakeholders to ensure that the conduct and outcome of the congresses and National Convention are done in a manner that conforms with our desire to leave indelible footprints of all-round development and a lasting legacy for future generations.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the Chairman of APC Caretaker Committee said they approached their duty with commitment and dedication to rescue the party from imminent collapse.\n\nThe Yobe State Governor noted that all issues and members were given a fair hearing, and an open-door policy was created to accommodate all those that were aggrieved, leading to withdrawal of cases in court and peaceful settlements.\n\n\u201cWe are currently witnessing high powered decamping to our party, including governors from the PDP. The party is now more peaceful, orderly and accommodating than what we met on the ground. Although there was initial fear, the mobilisation and sensitisation was able to allay the fears of members,\u201d Buni said.\n\nThe Yobe State governor said the registration and revalidation of members across the country recorded more than 40 million members, and an appeal committee was also set up to hear all matters related to the process so that no member gets disenfranchised.\n\n\u201cWe have observed that youth and women constitute huge population of the voting group. We had a youth and women committee, and also people with disability,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to him, a Contact and Strategy Team had been set up in every state to come up with an acceptable template that would ensure transparency, credibility and acceptability of the internal electoral processes.\n\nBuni also said the committee had instituted a process to review the party\u2019s constitution and look into loopholes that usually fan conflict and litigations among members, with more than 500 memoranda already received.\n\nHe told the President and other party members that 14 party members had indicated their interest to contest for the Anambra State elections, assuring that the primary elections will be free, fair and transparent.\n\nThe Yobe State governor said huge legal fees were inherited, and the committee had worked with members to settle all the outstanding, after scaling them down, noting that payment for the APC National Secretariat had been completed.\n\n\u201cThe party members have agreed to name the secretariat, Muhammadu Buhari House,\u201d he added.\n\nWhile thanking the President for his support and insight, Buni noted that a National Conference for the Youths was organised recently as part of the bottom-up approach to strengthening the party and ensuring relevance of all stakeholders.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says Nigeria will continue frontline advocacy for a just transition to zero emissions\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo is worried about the global clamour for green energy and the looming reduction in funding for gas and fossil fuel projects, especially in developing countries, by international bodies and institutions.\n\nAs a result, he summoned a virtual meeting on the subject last Thursday, with other top federal government officials in attendance; including the Ministers of Environment, Dr. Mohammad Mahmood Abubakar; Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama; Minister of State, Environment, Sharon Ikeazor; Minister of State, Power, Goddy Jedy Agba, and the Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Petroleum Resources, Bitrus Bako Nabasu.\n\nAt the virtual meeting, Osinbajo maintained his position that the funding for gas and fossil fuel projects in Nigeria and other developing countries be sustained during the global transition to net-zero emissions and said Nigeria would continue its frontline advocacy for a just transition to zero-emission.\n\nHe also asserted that Nigeria would play a critical role with other gas exporting countries to stop the defunding of gas and fossil fuel projects in developing countries.\n\nThe Vice President noted that it was vital that the Forum of Gas Exporting Countries (GEC) join forces to prevent the defunding of gas and fossil fuel projects, especially from developing countries, by international bodies and institutions.\n\nAccording to the VP, concrete steps should be taken by the GEC Forum to stop further plans by international bodies and Western countries on defunding of gas/fossil fuel projects as it does not benefit developing countries especially.\n\nHe noted that it was vital Nigeria plays a significant role in achieving a consensus with the GEC Forum on these issues, even as the 26th United Nations (UN) Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) scheduled to hold later this year approaches.\n\nIn the same vein, the Vice President asked the Inter-ministerial committee on Climate Change, led by the Federal Ministry of Environment, to finetune Nigeria\u2019s position for COP26, while the Federal Ministry of Petroleum Resources would focus on strengthening the country\u2019s strategy, particularly in its initiative to use gas as a transition fuel.\n\nBoth the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources and Minister of Foreign Affairs were directed to work together, to ensure the GEC Forum reaches a consensus that reflects Nigeria\u2019s advocacy on defunding of gas projects.\n\nBefore now, Osinbajo had, at different forums in the past months, raised the issue of financing of gas projects in developing countries, especially Nigeria, advocating a just transition and more effective engagements since the campaign for the net-zero emission by 2050 resumed.\n\nIn March this year, at a meeting with a delegation from the European Union (EU), led by its Executive Vice President, Mr. Valdis Dombrovskis, the VP reaffirmed Nigeria\u2019s commitment to the global green energy initiative, but called for a just transition to zero-emission.\n\nAt another meeting held in February with the British Member of Parliament and COP26 President-Designate, Mr. Alok Sharma, Osinbajo restated Nigeria\u2019s support and commitment to the Climate Change agreement, but cited the planned restrictions on financing of gas projects in African countries as a potential setback.\n\nAt the UN Dialogue on Food Systems, also in February, the Vice President stressed the need for the international community to consider, as an option, the use of gas and other more environmentally friendly fuel sources, as against what he termed \u201cdefunding gas projects\u201d based on gas not being environmentally friendly enough.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Charles Ajunwa in Lagos and Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nThe Kaduna State office of the Department of State Services, DSS, yesterday invited and questioned controversial cleric, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi, over his recent allegations, during an interview on Arise Television that some security agents were aiding and benefiting from bandits ravaging communities in the North.\n\nAt the DSS office, sources close to Gumi said he was questioned on his statement during the interview, \u201cand the cleric clarified his declaration, saying he did not accuse the entire military and other security agencies of aiding bandits but \u201cthe bad eggs in the security agencies.\u201d\n\nThe sources said the cleric was subsequently cautioned on his utterances by the DSS detectives and allowed to go home.\n\nSpokesman of the DSS, Dr. Peter Afunanya, confirmed the invitation of Gumi by the service, adding, \u201cIt may not be unconnected with his claim that security agencies were colluding with bandits in the spate of kidnapping for ransom afflicting the nation.\u201d\n\nAfunanya said further: \u201cGumi was invited as a person of interest. The service invited Sheikh Gumi. It is not out of place for it to invite any person of interest.\u201d\n\nDuring the Arise TV interview last Wednesday, the cleric, who is known to have access to the bandits, said: \u201cThese bandits, if you don\u2019t know, are cooperating with a lot of bad elements in our security system. This is a business. So many people are involved, you\u2019ll be so surprised.\n\n\u201cThey were caught in Zamfara; they were caught everywhere, how do these big weapons cross our borders? How can these big weapons cross our borders and get into the forest without the cooperation of some bad element of the security operatives assisting them? It\u2019s not possible. If I give you the same amount of guns, can you take them to the UK? You can\u2019t because the security is alert.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian Army kicked against the cleric\u2019s claims and warned that it would not condone acts sabotaging its efforts.\n\nOnyema Nwachukwu, the Army\u2019s spokesperson, said: \u201cIt is essential to remind ourselves that this same military, being accused of connivance, are the ones who recently put their lives on the line to rescue abductees of the Government Secondary School, Birnin Yauri, from kidnappers.\n\n\u201cWhile the Nigerian Army will not attempt to excuse the possibility of black sheep amongst its fold, it must be stated unambiguously that it will not condone any form of sabotage or aiding and assisting the enemy by any personnel.\u201d\n\nAlso, Gumi\u2019s spokesman, Tukur Mamu, in an interview with the VOA yesterday, dismissed the allegation against Gumi, saying there was nowhere in the TV interview when the cleric categorically accused the entire military of aiding bandits.\n\nThe spokesman explained that what Gumi said was \u201cwhat people have been saying and even the soldiers have been saying is that there could be some bad eggs among them.\u201d\n\nGumi: I was Never Quizzed By DSS\n\nBut the Kaduna-based cleric yesterday evening debunked reports that he was either quizzed or invited for questioning by the DSS over his remarks on security agencies.\n\nSpeaking after presiding over a Jummat service at the Sultan Bello Mosque in Kaduna State, Sheikh Gumi said all his interventions with bandits inside the forest were done in collaboration with the support of the government and security agencies, hence he did not commit any offence.\n\n\u201cNobody Invited me for questioning or any arrest, I can say that categorically,\u201d the Sheik said, adding, \u201csince I ventured into the forest, I went there with full security, the police, with the knowledge of the DSS, traditional rulers and the Fulani leaders, I never went alone\u201d.\n\nHe also insisted that he never made any disparaging remarks against the military during his recent live interview on national television.\n\nAccording to him, there was nowhere in the TV interview that he categorically accused the entire military.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Nigerian businesses face an avalanche of losses as the Twitter ban continues",
          "text": "On Saturday the 5th of June, Wunmi*, a digital marketer lost a gig worth \u20a6600,000 ($1,200). The marketing campaign was to start the next day but she got a call from the client telling her they couldn\u2019t proceed anymore due to \u2018orders from above.\u2019 She was dumbfounded.\n\nThat same day, about 39 million Nigerians woke up to realize that they couldn\u2019t access Twitter except via VPNs. Internet Service Providers (ISP) in Nigeria like MTN and Airtel had blocked all access to Twitter.\n\nWhen Peju, owner of Abebi Organics, describes the day the ban was enforced, she recounts how the jokes kept coming until one by one people found that they could not tweet anymore.\n\nIt\u2019s been more than two weeks since and the effects of the ban have been anything but humorous for businesses like hers who built their customer base on Twitter.\n\nThe ban happened a day after the Nigerian government announced an indefinite Twitter suspension. The minister of information had stated that the reason for banning Twitter was because the social media platform has \u201cconsistently made its platform available to those who are threatening Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\u201d\n\nWhile still mourning the loss of the first job, Wunmi lost another one for the same reason.\n\n\u201cEverything felt like a waste. What was worse was another \u20a6700,000 ($1,400) deal ended up in the mud. The client paid \u20a6150,000 ($333) at least for the little job I had done,\u201d she said.\n\nThe effect on businesses\n\nFor many Nigerians, this ban has affected how they stay informed, build relationships and get opportunities. Businesses on the other hand have experienced a decline in engagements and sales.\n\nIn the case of Nifries, an online food delivery service that relies on Twitter to reach its audience, its customers aren\u2019t responding as they used to.\n\nFeranmi Ajetomobi, the founder of Nifries, explained that the Twitter ban has affected anon (short for anonymous) sales which drive about 20% of sales at Nifries. Anon sales happen when people surprise strangers or friends by buying goods for them without revealing their identity.\n\nHi @TereSagay_, Anon just opened a tab of N15,000 for you to pick whatever you want from our Menu! \ud83d\ude0d\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nKindly visit https://t.co/rmQIkQXPkD and send a DM of what you want \ud83d\udc9b \u2014 Sexy Suya Burgers \ud83c\udf54 (@ni_fries) June 15, 2021\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve realised that when we reach out to a few people and there\u2019s no response, It\u2019s either because they\u2019ve taken a break or the Twitter ban has affected them. How we know it\u2019s the ban is because when these people we reach out to come online, they attribute their absence to the fact that using VPN is confusing,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Habib who runs Smiley Socks, a clothing company that also thrives on the \u2018anon sales\u2019 phenomenon, sales via Twitter have been affected. He\u2019s also noticed that engagements with tweets have reduced.\n\nThis has made him turn to other channels. He\u2019s had to pay more attention to his Instagram page and work on his SEO for his e-commerce website to maximise conversations.\n\nHe\u2019s also started experimenting with TikTok and so far, the results have been astounding. One day after he opened a new TikTok page, it already had 100 followers. The few videos he\u2019s posted already have at least 500 views, with the highest being one with over 4,000 views.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy when you think about the fact that it\u2019s a new page and we are not following anyone. Despite the engagement, there\u2019s a bigger question of how we\u2019ll convert these numbers into sales. For now, we\u2019ll just do more influencer marketing and affiliate marketing as we figure out what works,\u201d said Habib.\n\nWunmi* who has lost two deals worth over $2,500 is now considering focusing on unexplored channels like IG Reels and TikTok.\n\n\u201cFor clients that do not mind me using VPN, I go ahead and use Twitter. Unfortunately, those clients are very few. No one wants to offend President Buhari at this time for fear of being blacklisted by the government or worse, getting forcefully shut down. Clients think of many negative scenarios of how the government can strike back, they sometimes seem hilarious, but can you blame them?\u201d she said.\n\nComparing Twitter to other platforms\n\nCharles Isidi, a growth marketer and digital consultant, agrees with the need to pivot to other digital marketing channels but has a word of caution. He has experienced the effect of the decline first-hand on his personal account. With followership of about 17,000, his monthly impressions have gone from as high as 3.8 million, to under 500,000.\n\nCharles\u2019 Twitter Analytics for April\n\nCharles\u2019 Twitter Analytics for May\n\nCharles\u2019 Twitter Analytics for June\n\nHe says the ban will affect advertising spend and results across other digital marketing channels because Nigerian Twitter users who are using VPNs will also have their locations skewed across every other app.\n\n\u201cIf your most valuable audience is in another country that you do not know, then how can you reach them?\u201d he said.\n\nHe also raised the question of whether people know how to use VPNs safely.\n\n\u201cQuite a lot of people use free VPNs. In the next six months, we might start experiencing a lot of theft. We\u2019ll have to be looking at how much we\u2019ve lost due to cybercrimes.\u201d\n\nBusinesses might need to move to other social media platforms but Twitter offers more favourable returns in terms of marketing efforts.\n\nCompared to other advertising channels, Twitter is a cheaper and less stressful channel.\n\nHe\u2019s been trying to run a billboard campaign for the past 3 months and has been stuck waiting for Lagos\u2019 paid advertising approval. For digital adverts, in less than an hour, the advert is approved and has started delivering value for the business.\n\n\u201cUnlike other social media platforms, take Facebook as an example. A typical page with 10,000 followers reaches 3% of your audience with a post. Meanwhile, on Twitter, an organic post can be retweeted. In terms of shareability and virality, there\u2019s a reason why people love Twitter. I can say something and even if I have just 100 followers, 3 million people can see that tweet.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s difficult on Instagram where you have to make the explore page or use a hashtag that people love to get a similar kind of result.\n\nHow much is being lost\n\nCiting a scenario, he said, \u201cIf you\u2019re currently managing a brand that has 20,000 followers, it\u2019ll get 1-3 million impressions on average. To be conservative, at a 0.1% conversation rate, the brand will have an average of 1,000 \u2013 3,000 new customers.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we put the average transaction value per customer at $3 dollars per month, that\u2019s an average of $3,000 \u2013 $9,000 dollars lost due to the ban. Let\u2019s put it across all the businesses in that range and you see that the number is massive.\u201d\n\nWith the Twitter ban, Nigerian businesses that have previously relied on the massive reach of the platform now face an avalanche of losses if the decision is not reversed soon.\n\nAnd if we were to be a little hopeful and imagine a world where the ban is lifted, how much irreversible damage has been done to the potential audience reach these businesses used to have? We\u2019ll find out soon enough.\n\n*Name changed to protect their identity.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Google, this week, announced the launch of two new initiatives to support African-founded startups and women-led businesses in underserved communities on the continent.\n\nThe programs include a $3 million Black Founders Fund for African startups and a $3 million Google.org grant to help women in low-income communities develop entrepreneurial skills and access funding.\n\nThrough the latter, Google is looking to support access to economic opportunity for women in sub-Saharan Africa with a $3 million grant to the Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF). The foundation will then provide entrepreneurship training, mentorship, coaching, and access to networks and key markets for at least 5,000 women via its annual entrepreneurship program.\n\nIn addition, seed capital in the form of one-time cash grants will be given to 500 African female informal business-owners in rural and low-income communities across Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, and select francophone countries.\n\n\u201cWe believe this will enable and prepare these women who otherwise wouldn\u2019t have had the opportunity to navigate their independent business journey through the critical start-up and early growth phase,\u201d Google said in a statement on its website.\n\nBlack Founders Fund debuts in Africa\n\nThe Google for Startups Black Founders Fund provides grants and technical assistance to early-stage startups led by black and diverse teams, with a goal of advancing the black community.\n\nLaunched in 2020 as part of a series of racial equity commitments to close a funding gap experienced by black entrepreneurs, the program has seen proven success in the United States, Brazil, and Europe, according to Google.\n\nThe U.S. tech giant has now expanded the initiative to Africa, a continent where indigenous startups are faced with insufficient starting capital and a lack of angel investors, and also find it difficult to secure financial support.\n\nAccording to Bosun Tijani, CEO of Co-Creation Hub (CcHub), which is partnering with Google on the Black Founders Fund Africa, the shortage of funding for African startups is driven by several factors.\n\n\u201cOn the demand side, there is an increase in the number of ventures emerging to solve the pervasive challenges that exist. As the number of ventures increases, the requirement for funding increases,\u201d Tijani told TechCabal.\n\nHe adds that while there has been improved investor confidence as a result of the success stories that have come out of the ecosystem, investors remain sceptical about the potential for huge exit opportunities. \u201cThis highlighted risk often dampens the quantum of funding commitment the ecosystem gets.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the number of African venture capital firms closing their funding rounds is not growing as quickly as the number of emerging ventures; institutions with long-term liabilities (such as insurance companies, pension funds, endowments) that match the VC asset class are not willing to support the development of the ecosystem because it\u2019s still nascent; and there are not enough government incentives required to encourage investments into the tech ecosystem.\n\nIn light of these challenges, Google plans to allocate the $3 million non-dilutive fund across a pipeline of 50 investable startups in Africa, with each firm receiving up to $100,000 in equity-free cash awards. Each selected company will also receive $220,000 in Google Cloud Credits and Ad Grants, as well as mentoring, technical, and scaling assistance.\n\nThe company is working with the CcHub, a leading tech community hub with a presence in Nigeria, Kenya, and Rwanda, to distribute the funding to the 50 selected companies across Africa.\n\nThe CcHUB team will be actively involved in the process providing insight and technical support from the selection process through to the final deployment of the capital, according to Tijani. \u201cWe will monitor and evaluate the performance of the companies that benefit from this catalytic funding,\u201d he said.\n\nWhich startups can apply?\n\nApart from having a black founder, the Black Founders Fund Africa (BFFAfrica) is looking for a startup that is headquartered in Africa or has a legal presence on the continent; building for Africa and a global market; creating jobs, has growth potential to raise more funding, and making an impact; has proven early traction (product in the market / pilots / MVP live / early revenue).\n\nThe founding team should be diverse, with at least one black C-level founding member; directly supporting the black community, and has the relevant expertise on board to be successful (either through their background or an assembled team).\n\nIn addition, Google is looking for technology startups with a live product in the market or businesses where technology is core to their ability to scale (not for consultancies or not-for-profits) as well as compatibility with Google products.\n\nThe inaugural funding for Africa is open to startups in 13 countries \u2013 including Botswana, Cameroon, C\u00f4te D\u2019Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe.\n\n\u201cWe welcome all startups in these countries that meet the criteria to apply. Female-led startups that meet the criteria are also strongly encouraged to apply,\u201d Tijani said.\n\nApplications for the Fund are currently open until July 7th and eligible startups can visit goo.gle/BFFAfrica now to apply.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Jesse Forrester started an e-mobility company in Kenya after deciding against going to university",
          "text": "My Life In Tech is putting human faces to some of the innovative startups, investments, and policy formations driving the technology sector across Africa.\n\nIf you were to look at three different pictures of Jesse Forrester today, you will notice the same unmistakable red cap.\n\n\u201cIt was given to me by a dear friend and for me, it has just come to represent the people that have supported me and I carry them with me wherever I\u2019m going,\u201d Jesse said.\n\n\u201cI also think it\u2019s really cool.\u201d\n\nJesse Forrester and the Mazi Mobility team. Spot his red cap.\n\nHe pointed out how the hat contributes to his very pan-African life.\n\nJesse grew up in Nairobi, Kenya. After high school, he travelled to South Africa where he finished his A-levels at the African Leadership Academy (ALA).\n\nHis journey at ALA exposed him to several things including a wide network of pan-African thinkers.\n\nHis red cap has often gotten him mistaken as Nigerian, something he does not shy away from. But he never fails to remind people that the cap is actually from Tunisia in North Africa.\n\nAfter ALA, Jesse took up a fellowship. It was his first stab at being employed and he quickly found that it was not something that he fancied.\n\nThe idea of going to university didn\u2019t thrill him either. So he did something he\u2019d always wanted to do \u2013 he started his own business.\n\nToday, his company Mazi Mobility is backed by global venture builder, Satgana, and is aiming at implementing an electric vehicle ecosystem in Africa. To this end, they recently launched a new fleet of electric bodas or motorcycles.\n\nWhen he speaks of Africa and the possibilities that exist in the space of e-mobility, his excitement is almost palpable.\n\nHe started his company without a university degree and he is now preparing himself to dominate the African e-mobility space.\n\nHis name is Jesse Forrester and this is his life in tech.\n\nIf you look back, you see it\n\nJesse grew up in Huruma flats in the Eastlands. He lived with both his parents but more time was spent with his mother.\n\nAs a child, he wanted to be a pilot but his interests varied. On some days he wanted to just sit by the television and watch a NatGeo documentary on exotic animals in the thick Amazon and on other days his PlayStation 2 was all the entertainment he needed.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t an exact time when he decided he didn\u2019t want to be a pilot anymore. It was just one of those things that\u2019s there one day but slowly faded away with time \u2013 like a puddle drying in the sun.\n\nHis varying interests expanded to include his small businesses in school \u2013 selling lemonade and sweets. He also enjoyed tinkering with things \u2013 pulling them apart and putting them together.\n\nMazi Mobility, Jesse\u2019s startup, is making it easier for boda riders to own and use electric vehicles that help save the planet by reducing CO emissions.\n\nTo pinpoint when in his life he got the inspiration to want a cleaner Africa, you would need to consider two things; a minister who did his job and a matatu\u2019s smoke cloud.\n\nIn 2004, a man named John Michuki was the Minister of Transportation in Kenya. During that time, the state of buses, or matatus, in the country was terrible. These vehicles had no speed governors, seat belts and would often carry more passengers than they were supposed to.\n\nMichuki established the \u2018Michuki Rules\u2019 which served as a game-changer for the transport sector by providing strict guidelines for matatus at the time. But one thing they inadvertently did was inspire a prepubescent Jesse.\n\n\u201cI actually saw a meaningful change that had a huge impact. And according to my mum, I said I wanted to become something in transport like transport minister.\u201d\n\nFast forward to 2018 and Jesse was back from studying in South Africa and living in Nairobi again.\n\n\u201cI was walking around the city, just going on my errands, this massive matatu cuts me off and just as it\u2019s leaving and I have a mouth full of swear words, the thing just blows a huge amount of smoke in my face.\u201d\n\nSet 14 years apart, these two events paved the way for the creation of Mazi Mobility but also helped inform the decisions of a young man who really cares about his environment.\n\n\u201cJesse, meet Tech\u201d\n\n\u201cMy foray into tech really happened in secondary school, where I learned a lot about what actually makes up a game and how to actually make it,\u201d Jesse told me over our WhatsApp call.\n\nHis introduction to tech came in the form of MIT\u2019s Scratch Blocks. The program allowed people to develop programming skills by using blocks to code visually.\n\nHe didn\u2019t just explore software, his tinkering came in handy when he got a chance to work with Arduino motherboards which allow people to create complex computer systems from scratch.\n\n\u201cI wanted to be a good engineer, that was kind of my path because it would mix hardware and software.\u201d\n\nJesse\u2019s tango with tech did not end in high school. It followed him right into ALA.\n\nIn 2017, when bitcoin was still worth only $2,000, blockchain was primarily known as the technology behind bitcoin and not much else. For Jesse, it became an interesting tool.\n\n\u201cI was part of a blockchain club. I was running for treasurer [in student government], and the decision was to have the elections on the blockchain.\u201d\n\nHe would go on to win the elections and also create a project that would win his school $100,000.\n\nThe journey to Mazi by way of ALA\n\n\u2018Mazi\u2019 was not always \u2018Mazi Mobility\u2019. At one point, in the time before Jesse got into ALA, it was a photography collective \u2013 one of Jesse\u2019s many interests.\n\nBut getting into the Africa Leadership Academy was not the smoothest ride for him.\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing you must know, it is that Jesse Forrester sets high expectations for himself. He first heard of the Academy when he turned 12 and he knew he wanted to attend but the minimum age was 15 so he decided to wait.\n\nAt 15, he was in the middle of his high school education and decided not to apply until he was done. In his final year of high school, he finally applied.\n\n\u201cThey waitlisted me. So I had a chip on my shoulder where I had to prove that I\u2019ve got the leadership potential to get into the school.\u201d\n\nWhat followed was the creation of Mazi \u2013 a photography collective with a focus on creating discourse around the environment, speaking at a TEDx talk, and getting networking certifications.\n\nAnd what did he do with all these things? He sent ALA an update. They needed to know that he was meant to be there.\n\nThis time they listened. He was accepted and resumed in South Africa for his 2-year course.\n\nAt ALA, Jesse was a part of the team behind \u201cThe Living Machine\u201d a water treatment system that won them the $100,000 Zayed Sustainability Prize in 2019.\n\nAfter his encounter with the smoky matatu in 2018, Jesse decided he wanted to start a company that provided electric matatus.\n\n\u201cI wanted to start with putting solar panels on matatus but I quickly realised that was not smart because you need like 60 of them for one matatu.\u201d\n\nWith a few calls, he was able to connect with his co-founder and founding investor Troy Barrie.\n\nWhile they discussed kicking off the business, Jesse had to leave the country briefly to present a report on The Living Machine in Abu Dhabi. During this trip, he also got a chance to interview musician and investor, Akon.\n\nJesse with Akon\n\nWhen he returned and settled down, he quit his job and focused full time on Mazi. They made plans to begin getting investors. This was March 2020.\n\nBuilding Mazi through a pandemic and looking to the future\n\n\u201cSo now we are back to running a hardware business, in Africa, in a pandemic?\u201d Jesse laughed when he said this. It was ridiculous to even think about.\n\nThe potential investors all seemed to say the same things: \u201cSo we\u2019re focusing on our portfolio companies right now. Let\u2019s touch base in about a year.\u201d\n\nAnd who could blame them, 2020 was a weird year.\n\nBut he needed to raise money and to most people, Jesse just seemed crazy. While Jesse dealt with the anxiety and despair that came with 2020, he also had to get enough money to match his founding investor\u2019s investment.\n\nA $15,000 fund from ALA helped turn things around and in February the electric motorcycles landed in Kenya \u2013 sort of.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe thing is, when you import something from China, especially these bikes, you have no manuals whatsoever. So we had no way of knowing what to assemble because there was a huge language barrier, so it was incredibly challenging.\u201d Jesse said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really happy that one of my chief engineers is a really smart guy and a biker.\u201d\n\nFor the next month, the team would spend time figuring out the bikes and how to assemble them. They were working \u201cfrom eight to eight\u201d.\n\nA deadline for a prototype bike was fast approaching and during our call, Jesse reminisced about what it felt like at the time.\n\nThey were just four men in his living room, trying to put an electronic boda together. It was a Saturday when they decided they were going to have to work all night to figure it out. That night, they had ugali and eggs for dinner.\n\nBy 6 am on Sunday, with none of them having slept a wink, they had built their first product, by themselves, in Jesse\u2019s living room.\n\n\u201cAnd right now I\u2019m really proud to say that all the bikes we have are fully assembled here in Kenya, by Kenyans. And we have the capacity to assemble \u2013 with a really small team \u2013 over 200 bikes, a month from parts all the way up. Without investment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always tell investors, \u2018You guys give us X cash, you can imagine what we can do.\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nI asked Jesse Forrester, as I always do with these interviews, to tell me what plans he has for the future.\n\n\u201cThe total estimated addressable market right now stands at about $12 billion in East Africa, for electric motorbikes alone, and I say hey we want to capture a fraction of the market so I want to do over 1000 bodas by the end of next year. I want to get to over 5000 bodas by the end of 2023 with up to 200 tuktuks and 100 matatus.\u201d\n\nFrom your mouth to God\u2019s ears, Jesse.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "After months of uncertainty regarding regulations, Chaka has received a license from Nigeria\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to operate its digital platform for buying and selling stocks.\n\nChaka becomes the first to acquire the digital sub-broker license introduced by SEC in April of this year. As part of a major amendment to its Consolidated Rules and Regulations, SEC recognised sub-brokers who use digital platforms to serve multiple brokers.\n\nTosin Osibodu, the startup\u2019s CEO, said on a call on Wednesday that the acquisition took \u201ca tremendous amount of effort\u201d and is the fruit of frequent engagement with the capital markets regulator.\n\nOn the 19th of December 2020, the SEC published a statement that effectively barred Chaka from offering its services in Nigeria. SEC\u2019s complaint was that Chaka operated \u201coutside the regulatory purview of the Commission and without requisite registration, as stipulated by the Investment and Securities Act 2007.\u201d\n\nSEC ordered Chaka to stop advertising to users, justifying it as a need to prevent \u201cunscrupulous actors\u201d from harming the investing public. Though the order was particular to Chaka, it was the first major signal that regulation was coming to the investment-tech sector.\n\nThat December warning enabled Chaka to take the lead and open talks with the SEC. With the license now acquired, Osibodu says it affirms Chaka\u2019s commitment to full regulatory compliance and provides clarity to the market.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve built a great relationship [with SEC] that we think will be beneficial for the whole ecosystem moving forward,\u201d Osibodu said.\n\nHe said the license also means Chaka could now enable other stockbroking firms who want to have a digital presence. \u201cWe want this benefit to accrue to as many stockbrokers as possible.\u201d\n\nUntil now, Chaka\u2019s operations were based on a partnership with Citi Investment Capital Ltd, a Lagos-based broker licensed by the SEC. An official license now places the startup directly under SEC\u2019s supervision.\n\nChaka\u2019s app hosts over 4,000 stocks from publicly traded companies in Nigeria and the US. Founded in January 2019 by Osibodu with Olaolu Ajose as the chief technology officer, the startup bills itself as an \u201cinvestment passport\u201d which powers borderless investing for users.\n\nAnyone with an internet-enabled smartphone can download the app, sign up and begin investing with $2 or \u20a61,000. Chaka is only available in Nigeria at the moment.\n\nOsibodu did not specify what Chaka did, in terms of fees or filings, to receive the license.\n\nBut according to the SEC\u2019s recent amendment (pdf, page 3), a sub-broker license for digital platforms involves a minimum capital of \u20a610 million and a Fidelity Bond covering at least 20% of the minimum capital.\n\nOther requirements include four separate fees totalling \u20a6500,000, a number of SEC forms, company documents and other documentation about people involved with the company.\n\nDigital sub-brokers are also required to fully describe the technology that their infrastructure is built on, including details about security, backup and recovery processes.\n\nThey should have adequate Know Your Customer processes and have documented policies for managing technology risks. Also, they are expected to show how they assess the capacity of potential customers to use its platform for transactions, plus clear explanations of the features, risks, responsibilities, obligations and liabilities that come with using the app.\n\nIt is not clear if this license officially permits Chaka (and other fintechs in the sector) to offer stocks listed in foreign markets \u2013 like Tesla and Google \u2013 to Nigerians. In April, SEC sounded a warning that seemed to declare such offerings as being illegal.\n\nOsibodu\u2019s coy response was that Chaka is committed to SEC\u2019s objectives for financial inclusion in Nigeria by, among other things, increasing retail investor participation in the financial markets.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it to a whatsapp group or telegram channel.\n\n.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "title": "How technology is helping this AC technician scale his business",
          "text": "Have you ever walked into a room and immediately started sweating bullets? Have you spent time in a room with air-conditioners that blow hot air?\n\nThen you would quite understand why I was happy when last year, after a lot of convincing and back and forth, my mom finally agreed to get two air-conditioners installed in the house. But, unfortunately, it gets incredibly hot in the dry season even though there are huge windows everywhere. So we contacted a former neighbour that sells used ACs, paid three-quarters of the money, and had him deliver them to the house.\n\nAfter the delivery and installation by Udoka, a very cheerful and outspoken \u201cAC installer\u201d, trouble started. The ACs were not cooling. Udoka was called back several times, the gas was filled and refilled, one split AC exchanged for a standing one, a total of four technicians worked on the cooling units, one AC unit almost caught on fire.\n\nSeveral months later, my parents had spent more than \u20a6250,000 ($524.1)* on ACs that never worked. They are still in the house, an immutable reminder of wasted money and time, and perhaps, another reason to be continually disappointed in Nigerian artisans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s why when we were asked to pitch possible stories for an article, the event \u201cWorld Refrigeration Day\u201d caught my attention. I was increasingly interested when I saw that this year\u2019s theme was \u201cCooling Champions: Cool Careers for a Better World.\u201d\n\nI was immediately transported back to the emotions I felt during the AC installation and repair saga. But, rather than focus on my frustrations, I began to ask questions. What would it take to start a career in the refrigeration industry? How much would it cost? What kind of tools and technology make the work easier?\n\nWorld Refrigeration Day\n\nSince 2019, World Refrigeration Day is celebrated every June 26. It is an international awareness campaign established by the World Refrigeration Day Secretariat to raise the profile of the refrigeration, air-conditioning, and heat-pump sector. It focuses on the significant role that the industry and its technology play in modern life and society.\n\nIt was the idea of refrigeration consultant, Stephen Gill, former President of the Institute of Refrigeration in the UK. It quickly caught on in its first year, with more than 800 physical events held in 153 countries around the globe.\n\nAccording to the World Refrigeration Day Secretariat, more than 15 million people are employed worldwide in the refrigeration sector, while the total number of refrigeration, air-conditioning, and heat-pump systems in operation worldwide is around 5 billion.\n\nQuite impressive statistics, but I was curious about how much of it Nigeria\u2019s economy accounts for, especially for the average AC or refrigerator technician.\n\nI spent some time with Emmanuel to try to answer this, and you\u2019ll find details below.\n\nThe learning process\n\nEmmanuel of Ipese Oluwa Technologies\n\nEmmanuel is an AC technician who runs Ipese Oluwa Technologies, a business in the student town of Ile-Ife, Osun State. The young entrepreneur graduated from the prestigious Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, as a Physicist in 2014.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust like many OAU alumni before him, he saw a problem and decided to solve it. Before leaving school, he was already working as a cable TV installer. However, customers began to ask if he could repair ACs. Seeing the business opportunity, he decided to learn.\n\nCurrently, Nigeria has 78 approved and accredited Vocational Enterprises Institutions (VEIs), with the latest getting approval in 2019. However, only two teach Refrigeration and Air-conditioning Practice, with a two or three-year study option. Some of these institutions give scholarships in conjunction with partners, but the rest require payment.\n\nInterestingly, Emmanuel didn\u2019t go down this route. Instead, he chose to learn from technicians in Ile-Ife and Benin City, Edo State. In 2014, he undertook the course for one and a half years and paid roughly \u20a6170,000 ($1062.5)** to learn but claims to have understood the basics in two weeks.\n\nApart from the traditional training, Emmanuel uses YouTube and Google as additional learning tools. For him, they are even more helpful than the conventional training.\n\n\u201cI learn so many things. I watch clips with different styles. It is very helpful,\u201d he says.\n\nAfter watching several hours of AC installation and work tools videos on YouTube myself, I am inclined to agree. But, interestingly, Nigerians are yet to join the DIY video trend.\n\nTools of the trade\n\nSource: United National Environment Programme (UNEP)\n\nAn AC technician requires several important tools to get his work done \u2014 wrenches, pipe bending tools, manifold gauge, pliers, a pen and paper, protective equipment, and so on.\n\nFor Emmanuel, though, certain tools that would make his work easier include a vacuum pump, a drill and a Hi-Lift Jack. A vacuum pump is an essential tool used to repair cooling units to clean the compressor by removing unwanted air and water vapour.\n\nA drill is used to puncture the wall for the AC\u2019s pipes and wall brackets. A handheld drill would be a step up from the chisel and hammer Emmanuel currently uses. The videos I watched showed how technicians use it to create very clean-cut holes \u2014 a far cry from the ragged holes crude tools form.\n\nThis is important because, apart from aesthetics, you don\u2019t want air leaking out from spaces in the room.\n\nWhen it comes to quotes, he gives prices based on the type of building where the cooling unit is to be installed. This is because it takes a lot of effort to move the AC up the house using a ladder, a situation that can be avoided by using a lift that guarantees a safe and hassle-free operation.\n\nAll of these cost quite a bit of money. But these are not the only tools Emmanuel employs.\n\nLeveraging the Internet\n\nThe AC technician reveals that he uses websites like Jiji and Facebook for advertising his products and services.\n\nAccording to him, he has received referrals from those ads.\n\nI find this quite interesting because while searching Google for a cooling technician in the Ile-Ife area, his was the only name that immediately came up. Others were located in Osogbo (1 hour 22 minutes away), Ibadan (1 hour 29 minutes away), and Lagos (3 hours 53 minutes away).\n\nI would later to find others, but that involved a search on Instagram, Google, Olist and Facebook.\n\nAir-conditioning units\n\nSource: Supplied\n\nInevitably, our discussion veered into types of ACs, the most popular, and the best ones to use.\n\nIn Nigeria, the climate is tropical, semi-arid in the far north, and progressively rainier as you move southward. In the north, the temperatures become extreme depending on the season. When it\u2019s hot, it\u2019s scorching. When it\u2019s cold, it\u2019s freezing.\n\nThe south has more temperate weather, but the country is quite hot. A fact most Nigerians can attest to.\n\nPresently, the market for single-split air-conditioners in Nigeria is set at approximately 560,000 units annually. LG leads the pack with an 11% market share, Samsung has 9%, Panasonic and Midea have 8%, Gree and Chigo have 7%, Daikin 5%, while Haier Thermocool and Hisense have 3%. The remaining market share belongs to lesser-known brands like Royal.\n\n86% of these cooling units are assembled in the country, with 14% of them imported. This is because, unlike the automotive sector, for example, Nigeria encourages local assembly of the cooling units by setting a lower import duty (5%) for completely knocked down units, compared to assembled units (20%)\n\nEmmanuel says most customers prefer to buy new units with brands like Hisense, Royal, and Midea as the most patronised due to their relative cheapness. Prices range from the \u20a6100,000s ($243.01) to the \u20a6500,000s ($1215.07). However, he resisted my pressure and declined to name the best brand.\n\n\u201cWhat might be my best might be different for you,\u201d he said.\n\nI certainly wished we had decided to buy new ACs right then.\n\nCool careers for a better world\n\nAccording to Numbeo, the average monthly net salary in Nigeria is \u20a671,945.53 ($174.84).\n\nWhen asked if he would be willing to switch jobs, Emmanuel said no. According to him, he earns more money working as an artisan than most salary earners. So in one sitting, he could make more than most people.\n\nMoney aside, he views his work with enthusiasm. His eagerness to answer questions and willingness to learn things that he previously did not know, and his dedication to attempting his best work, all shine through as we converse.\n\nHappy World Refrigeration Day as we all take a moment to appreciate the cooling technicians who keep our homes and work areas cool and serene enough for comfortable living.\n\nWe should also appreciate the man who invented the modern air-conditioner, Willis Carrier.\n\n*Black market rates, December 2020\n\n**Dollar equivalent in 2014",

          "text": "Good day,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nThe world\u2019s first 3D-printed school opening in Malawi\n\nLearning disabilities and assistive technology\n\nGoogle\u2019s delay in blocking third-party cookies in Chrome\n\nWorld\u2019s first 3D-printed school opens in Malawi\n\nPhoto credit: Nairametrics\n\nWhat happened? LafargeHolcim, a French-Swiss multinational company that manufactures building materials, has announced the world\u2019s first school built using 3D printing (3DP).\n\nHow did it happen? Dedicated to accelerating the provision of affordable housing in Africa, 14Trees, a LafargeHolcim and Colonial Development Corporation (CDC) Group joint venture, deployed cutting-edge 3D printing technology to build the school in Malawi.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy did it happen? Since one of Malawi\u2019s biggest education reforms \u2014 free primary education \u2014 in 1994, there has been a decline in infrastructure, among other things. Hence, LafargeHolcim attempts to alleviate infrastructural problems with 3D printing.\n\nIncredibly, the school\u2019s wall was printed in 18 hours, unlike conventional buildings, which require months to complete. Also, learning began on Monday, June 21, 2021.\n\nSound familiar? Maggie Grout, Founder of Thinking Huts \u2014 a nonprofit organisation that makes education accessible via 3D printed schools \u2014 partnered with humanitarian-driven technology company, Hyperion Robotics, and San-Francisco-based architectural design agency, Studio Mortazavi, to launch a 3DP school in Madagascar between December 2021 and March 2022.\n\nI think I find watching how a 3D building is made therapeutic. But, of course, it has its downsides.\n\nMore to come? LafargeHolcim plans to scale up the technology across Africa. There may be projects in the pipeline in Kenya and Zimbabwe.\n\nRead this for context.\n\nLearning disabilities (LDs) and assistive technology (AT)\n\nPhoto by Wulan Sari on Unsplash\n\nJust two questions before you proceed: What are learning disabilities? How many people do you know with learning disabilities?\n\nMany people in Africa cannot answer these questions. And just like mental health disorders, it\u2019s safe to say that many of them believe a learning disability is not an African issue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA good time to revisit this: Global Wellness Day: Protecting mental health with technology\n\nWhy should you care? It is almost impossible to tell how many people in Africa have LDs because there is inadequate data on them.\n\nAlso, some people with LDs are unaware of their situation, leaving them undiagnosed. As a result, their families are not well informed about providing the necessary care and support.\n\nHistorically, they have been attributed to witchcraft, stupidity, or dumbness. But, of course, that\u2019s erroneous because LDs are neurological disorders that affect how children and adults receive and process information. They do not affect intelligence but one or two cognitive processes related to learning.\n\nWhile a learning disability has no known cause, it is believed to be linked to premature birth, maternal illnesses, and complications during childbirth, reducing oxygen supply to the child\u2019s brain. In some cases, they are hereditary.\n\nAlthough there is no cure for LDs, technology has made learning easier for people with learning disabilities.\n\nAssistive technology (AT) can influence decoding, word recognition, reading fluency, and reading comprehension. It also offers reading, writing, studying, and organisational support for children with LDs.\n\nWhile AT helps people with learning disabilities to live healthy, independent, and productive lives, people with LDs need support from family, friends, classmates, and co-workers to reach their full potential.\n\nTo know how AT is helping children with LDs and the unique case of Africans with the condition, read this.\n\nGoogle delays plan to block third-party cookies in Chrome\n\nPhoto by Brett Jordan on Unsplash\n\nAnother announcement? Google has said that it will delay its plans to block third-party cookies in the Chrome browser until 2023, a year later than planned.\n\nWhile browsers like Safari and Firefox have already begun blocking third-party tracking cookies, I think Google\u2019s implementation may require finesse because its move will be significant to the ad industry.\n\nWhy the delay? Google said that the decision to block cookies in mid-2023 would be dependent on its engagement with the United Kingdom\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).\n\nIf Google fails to cut off third-party cookies, it might be criticised by regulators, privacy advocates, advertisers, and publishers for not protecting user privacy.\n\nWhat is Google doing concerning that? The company is developing Privacy Sandbox \u2014 its new privacy technologies \u2014 out in the open web.\n\nYou saw that coming, didn\u2019t you? Google claims that the Privacy Sandbox will help web technologies that protect people\u2019s privacy online and give companies and developers the tools to build thriving digital businesses to keep the web open and accessible to everyone.\n\nGoogle plans to remove support for third-party cookies in two stages: from late 2022, Chrome will give the advertising industry and publishers nine months to migrate their services, and in late 2023, Chrome will phase out support for third-party cookies within three months.\n\nIn case you missed it:\n\nMTN plans to invest $1.5 billion to boost broadband access in Nigeria.

          "text": "On Tuesday, June 22, 2021, Facebook announced interesting eCommerce updates coming to its products. The company disclosed this on its blog, Facebook Newsroom.\n\nStating that the COVID-19-induced lockdowns in 2020 made online shopping more appealing to people, Facebook wants to make shopping across its apps easier for users.\n\nStatista showed a rise in eCommerce sales in 2020, with global online sales increasing from $3.35 trillion in 2019 to $4.89 trillion in 2020.\n\nTo take advantage of this unprecedented rise, the company rolled out Facebook Shops on May 19, 2020. Today, the social media giant claims 300 million people visit 1.2 million Shops monthly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Facebook isn\u2019t halting its eCommerce strides there.\n\nAugmented reality and artificial intelligence\n\nImage source: Facebook\n\nThe social media giant is investing heavily in augmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence (AI) to make the shopping experience realistic.\n\nExplaining, Facebook says, \u201cwe\u2019re helping shoppers find new products, and with AR experiences, we\u2019re helping people visualise items before they buy.\u201d\n\nThe social media platform believes that the shopping experience begins with visual discovery making these innovations logical.\n\nAR is a visual technology that enables computer-generated imagery to interact with the real world through a camera.\n\nThis could be a potential solution for the \u201cwhat I ordered vs what I got\u201d problem. TechCabal, reveals this to be one of the factors impeding eCommerce growth in Africa.\n\nWith Facebook\u2019s new product, shoppers can try on a dress in the comfort of their homes before making a purchase.\n\nAI will also help shoppers discover new products based on what they like. Per Facebook, the technology would recommend similar products once a shopper taps on a product they want.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe AI will act as a store attendant, giving shoppers more options based on what they like. And with a single tap, customers will get similar options.\n\nWhile these new features will enhance the shopping experience, Facebook is now able to collect more data from users through their cameras and get more specific data on their preferences.\n\nAlso, Facebook Shops is coming to WhatsApp soon.\n\nThis new update means users can use the messaging app as an online store.\n\nMeanwhile, the new feature will not be available for Whatsapp users globally. However, while Facebook did not indicate which countries will enjoy these products, it said, \u201cSoon, we\u2019ll give businesses in select countries the option to showcase their Shop in WhatsApp.\u201d\n\nHow will it work?\n\nIt is not clear how the new feature works on the messaging app.\n\nOn Instagram and Facebook, people can find Shops on a business page through ads or stories. A collection of the products the seller offers is displayed, and customers can then place an order.\n\nAlthough WhatsApp reportedly has 2 billion global users, reach is limited to people known personally.\n\nThis could be a way the company is pushing revenue generation on the messaging app. In December 2020, WhatsApp gave an ultimatum for users to accept updated privacy policy. While the policy still stands, Facebook is not forcing users to accept it.\n\nThis could be a subtle way to bring back the policy and introduce targeted ads on WhatsApp.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has unveiled plans for the Benin City Cultural District, which will house the Edo Museum of West African Arts (EMOWAA).\n\nObaseki disclosed this at the 2021 National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM) Retreat for management staff and curators held in Benin City, the Edo State capital.\n\nThe governor said an international town planning group is in the state undertaking Urban and Regional planning of Edo, which will redesign Benin City.\n\n\u201cIn this plan, we have included the carving out of a large area as a Cultural District and the Museum will be located in the Cultural District. If we host 5,000 visitors every year as a result of the attraction to the Museum, the state will benefit from it.\n\nWe are already working on this and have put up an Urban renewal plan for this purpose,\u201d he said.\n\nHe continued: \u201cEMOWAA will be part of the national museum complex and the home for the comprehensive display of the Benin Art collection across the world. The artworks are global works and represent Africa, Nigeria and Edo globally; we should not lose them. We insist on the return of these artifacts to their original home, Benin City.\n\n\u201cWe should build something that is iconic and represents the extent of the prowess of the Benin empire. EMOWAA must be a research institution as there is a lot more to research and find out about the Benin Empire. There will be several important buildings in the museum complex and the museum will be a complex that will deal with the different aspects of the cultural life of Edo people.\u201d\n\nObaseki said culture is one of the viable platforms to leapfrog the state\u2019s development moving into the future, noting, \u201cCulture is a plank for the regeneration of our people.\n\n\u201cThe state government in collaboration with the Federal Government and the Royal Palace are in conversation on the return of the Benin artifacts sited in museums and collections across the world.\u201d\n\nObaseki thanked the British Government and the British Museum for alerting that there might be more works to be retrieved and also for the grant provided to undertake archaeological surveys and research to find the works that currently exist in Edo State.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI assure you that by working with other European Governments, we have reached an advanced stage in getting the resources to start the first phase of preparing for the return and acceptance of these works. We are going to commence the construction of the pavilion where the returned works will be stored in the city center.\n\n\u201cThe Edo Museum of West African Arts (EMOWAA), which is a complex and will be made up of several pieces will include the pavilion, the National Museum, Royal collections, Urhokpota Hall, restoration of a part of the Benin Moat, all of which will make visitors have the full experience of the Benin culture that span for more than six to seven centuries.\n\n\u201cThis is a training point for us as a state as we build a museum where the world will come and see original pieces which used to adorn European museums. This is a great project, which we look forward to.\u201d\n\nThe governor commended the creation of the Digital Benin project, which is a project documenting all works taken out of this city in every private or public museum globally.\n\nThe Director General of NCMM, Prof. Abba Isa Tijani, commended the governor for his love, determination, courage and commitment in ensuring the return of the artifacts.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have 52 museums across the country and 65 monuments and sites. The issue of training and retraining is really a big problem for us in the commission.\n\n\u201cWhen I took over, I said the best way is to partner with the private sector and our partners outside the country. They have been able to now come to our aid in terms of capacity building.\n\n\u201cThe Edo Museum of West African Arts (EMOWAA) is a big opportunity for us to be at the forefront of promoting and establishing this museum. We have curators who are experienced; they just need slight training at the international level so that the standard that we want to set up at the EMOWAA will be maintained.\u201d\n\n...",

Drug abuse is an ill that must be eradicated completely.\n\n\u201cIt must be stamped out from our state. We embarked on a walk around major areas where we have a large crowd of people within the city. Our walk was also associated with the sharing of flyers and I am sure that many people have been well-informed about the dangers of engaging in drug abuse.\u201d\n\nIrowa continued: \u201cThe dangers of drug abuse are actually enormous; it starts from family, community, state, nation and eventually the entire globe.\n\n\u201cAnybody that takes often ends up indulging in crime to make money for the purchase of drugs; what does that mean? He would destroy other people\u2019s lives and their means of livelihood, and that automatically means more stress for the state.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaving too many drug abusers in the society will further impose danger in our economy as people will be scared to go about their businesses because of fear of either being robbed, kidnapped or killed,\u201d he stated.\n\nOn his part, the Edo Commander of the NDLEA, Mr. Buba Wakawa, commended Governor Godwin Obaseki for this government\u2019s efforts in raising awareness on the menace of drug abuse, noting that the increased sensitization would further help in checking the incidence of drug abuse in the state.\n\n...",

          "text": "Tunde Opalana, Abuja\n\nThe Senate has ordered a hike in importation duties on syringes and needles into the country and therefore recommended 75 percent port duties.\n\nThis is as the upper chamber mandated full implementation of the policy on usage of locally manufactured syringes and needles by federal government owned hospitals and health institutions across the country.\n\nThe two directives were meant to protect local manufacturers, give them enabling environment to contribute to the revenue base of the nation and to reduce unemployment.\n\nThese mandatory recommendations followed the consideration and approval of the reports of the Senate Committee on Health presented by chairman, Sen. Yahaya Oloriegbe (Kwara Central).\n\nAccording to the chairman, the committee discovered that majority of the imported syringes and needles are substandard, unsterile (used and rewashed syringes from Asian continent) hence endangering the lives, health and safety of Nigerians.\n\nHe said \u201cdespite several policies of the Federal Government especially the introduction of 75% import duties on imported Syringes and Needles to deter importation, the Nigeria Customs Services has not been able to enforce this effectively, thereby leading to mass importation of cheap, substandard and\n\nunsterile syringes and needles.\n\n\u201cImportation of syringes and needles is killing local manufacturers making them to lay off staff and preventing them from contributing effectively to the economy.\n\n\u201cNAFDAC regulates seven (7) products including Syringes and Needles. NAFDAC has a 5+5 policy which means at the end of 5 years the importer must migrate from importation to manufacturing. This policy is just 2 years in operation hence it has not been applied to this sector.\n\n\u201d The Federal Ministry of Health lacks policy on the procurement and utilization of Syringes and Needles by government-owned Hospitals and agencies. This has led to government-owned hospitals to sometimes procure and use substandard Syringes and Needles in their hospitals and medical centres.\n\n\u201cCompulsory requirement for manufacturers to register to pre-qualify for the World Health Organisation\u2019s certification costs about $1.5bn. This has been an impediment to local manufacturers attaining this status and preventing their being patronized by organisations using donor funds\u201d.\n\nThe committee therefore recommended that \u201cthe Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment should finalise the process of approval of the Backward Integration Policy(BIP) (for the sector) by the Federal Executive Council and commence the implementation of the Policy by 1#t August 2021.\n\nThat \u201cas a matter of urgency, the Federal Government should fully implement 75% import duties on the Importation of syringes and needles and put stringent measures to the defaulters thereby encouraging local manufacturers and ensuring employment opportunities. Towards this end, the Nigeria Customs Services should enforce this policy.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Health should develop a policy on the procurement and utilization of Syringes and Needles by government hospitals and offices by 1st July 2021. That is within six (6) weeks all Federal Government owned hospitals are to use locally manufactured Syringes and Needles in order to strengthen local manufacturing.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Health should develop and implement a Policy Guideline that will ensure that all hospitals projects and programmes funded with the government of Nigeria\u2019s funds to procure and use Syringes and Needles approved by relevant Nigerian Regulatory Bodies without a requirement for World Health Organisation\u2019s pre-qualification.\n\nThe Senate also asked syringes and needles manufacturers to take the advantage of the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s Special Intervention Fund for the Health sector to improve and extend their capacities.\n\nRecalled that the Medical Device Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MDMAN), producers of syringes and needles sought the intervention of both the Senate Committee on Health and of Industry Trade and Investment on the implementation of exiting policies meant to protect local manufacturers.\n\nThe association in its petition, had alleged that government at all tiers were not patronizing local manufacturers but instead patronize foreign syringes and needles.\n\nPresident of the Medical Devices Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MEDMAN), Mr Akin Oyediran had during interface with the Senate committees and the Health minister, Dr. Osagie Ehanire and NAFDAC Director General, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye said the implementation of the policy would stop importation of low quality medical devices that may expose patients to health dangers.\n\nOyediran explained that the Backward Integration Policy (BIP) entails Nigerian manufacturers\u2019 right to produce syringes for local market and can import same to meet local demands if their factories could not produce enough quantity to satisfy local needs .\n\nREAD ALSO: Igala Will Not Be Part Of Biafra \u2013 Group Tells Nnamdi Kanu\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have the capacity to produce the required syringes and needles that we need in the country.\n\n\u201cOne of the manufacturers in Nigeria, the Jubilee Syringe of which I am the MD is the largest manufacturers of Syringes in Africa.\n\n\u201cThe local manufacturers are actually the highest supplies of syringes and needles for hospitals. There is no point in why government hospitals should use imported syringes when we have locally manufactured ones.",

          "text": "\u2026Farmers unable to go to farms due to banditry \u2013 el-Rufa\u2019i \u2026Food calamity looms unless\u2026- CAN \u202612.83m citizens in crisis levels \u2013 FOA, ActionAid \u2026We\u2019re finding it difficult to cope \u2013 Nigerians \u2026Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re combing bandits\u2019 hideouts \u2013 Military\n\nThe increasing security concerns in Nigeria especially in the North have made it difficult for farmers to go to their farms as they fear being attacked and have consequently fled their communities. BENJAMIN SAMSON in this report examines the effects of the ugly security situation on food production and availability.\n\nNigeria is currently facing security challenges in different areas; from the North-east that is ravaged by Boko Haram/Islamic State in West Africa (ISWAP), the North-west distressed by armed bandits, the South-east disturbed by the Independent People of Biafra (IPOB) secession group, and the North-central which is battling the age-long farmers,\u2019 herders\u2019 crises.\n\nel-Rufai\u2019s alarm\n\nGovernor Nasir el-Rufa\u2019i of Kaduna state recently said there is a looming food crisis as farmers are unable to go to their farms due to the activities of bandits.\n\nThe governor, who emphasised the role of the Department of State Services (DSS) in providing reliable information needed by the Police, Armed Forces and other security agencies for the total defeat of the insurgents, said, \u201cthere is urgent need by security agencies to strengthen intelligence gathering, to establish not just the identities, plans and locations of the criminals, but to actively disrupt their capacity to organise and mount attacks on the citizens.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the criminal gangs terrorising the North-west region have become more daring and dangerous since recovering from their near defeat in 2015, after the joint operation of the states stopped.\n\n\u201cAs Directors of the State Commands of the DSS in the North-west, you are all aware of the immense security challenges across the states in our region. The consequences of these serious security deficits have devastated the rural economy, taken lives and property and made simple travel an ordeal across federal, state and local roads.\n\n\u201cThe governors of the North-west states and Niger state appreciated this salient fact as far back as 2015. We came together to fund simultaneous operations by the federal military and security agencies across the largely ungoverned Kamuku-Kuyambana forest swathes that straddle about seven of our states up to Dajin Rugu in Katsina state. These operations disrupted the cattle rustling gangs, but were unfortunately not sustained as a continuous exercise to dominate these spaces and assert within them the authority of the Nigerian state.\n\n\u201cThat the criminal gangs have become more daring and dangerous since recovering from their near defeat in 2015 is obvious across the country,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added: \u201cAs the lead agency for domestic intelligence and counter-intelligence, the Department of State Services has a vital role to play in providing the reliable information needed by the Police and Armed Forces and other security agencies for the total defeat of these dangerous insurgents.\n\n\u201cThis is an urgent priority, in the face of the looming food crisis that we face if our farmers do not go to the farms. The rains are here, but farmers in various communities are unable to go to their farms; that is when they are lucky not to have fled their remote villages under pressure and attacks from the criminals. This cannot be allowed to continue.\u201d\n\nCAN\u2019s concerns\n\nSimilarly, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in the 19 Northern states and the Federal Capital Territory (Northern CAN), has noted that without mincing words, the current state of the nation has plunged the vast majority of the people into hunger, poverty, frustration and despondency.\n\nThis was contained in a statement signed by its the public relations officer (PRO), Rev. Jechonia Albert, to mark this year\u2019s Democracy Day.\n\nAccording to the statement, due to the prevailing economic and security challenges facing Nigerians, celebrating June 12 as a Democracy Day makes no meaning to the Nigerian populace; hence not worthy of celebration.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cJune 12, declared as Democracy Day by the current administration, was marked with mixed feelings across the country. Amid increasing insecurity, bad economy and undemocratic tendencies among the leaders, is there anything really worth celebrating? Certainly none!\n\n\u201cThe security situation in the country today has worsened with bandits, kidnappers and Boko Haram insurgents unleashing mayhem on Nigerians, killing innocent people and sacking communities.\n\n\u201cThousands of Nigerians, especially the in rural communities, have been rendered homeless by bandits. On a daily basis across the country, communities are being raided and people are being killed or abducted by rampaging bandits and other criminal elements.\n\n\u201cThe security situation has crippled the economy as travelling on the highways across the country has become a nightmare to Nigerians. The rains are here, but farmers cannot go to the farms for fear of being killed or abducted by bandits.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe implication of this is a looming food crisis and unless steps are taken to provide a secured environment for farmers to return to the farms, we may be in for more trouble with a hungry and frustrated population.\n\nFAO, ActionAid\u2019s alarms\n\nIn the same vein, the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has raised the alarm over the worsening state of food security in the country. It, therefore, stressed the need for urgent measures to protect the most vulnerable, keep the national agricultural supply chains functional and efficient, and mitigate the food security impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nFAO country representative Fred Kafero, who spoke at the 44th meeting of the National Council on Agriculture and Rural Development (NCARD), said the theme of the meeting, \u2018Nigeria\u2019s Agriculture and Food Security in the Face of Covid-19, Floods and Insecurity,\u2019 was a call to action, to cushion threats to the livelihoods of a large section of the population.\n\nAccording to him, the March-April 2021 Cadre Harmonis\u00e9 (CH) food security analysis conducted in 16 states and the FCT projected that a total of 12.83 million people in the affected states would be in crisis levels.\n\nAlso, the ActionAid country director Ene Obi raised concerns over the inability of women to go to farms for fear of being raped. She said being the major producers of food in the country, it is important for the government to fast-track its efforts at curtailing the rising insecurity.\n\nShe decried low budgetary allocation to the agricultural sector despite the fact that Nigeria is a signatory to the Maputo Declaration on the allocation of a minimum of 10 per cent to the sector.\n\nNigerians\u2019 lamentations\n\nMeanwhile, Nigerians who spoke with Blueprint Weekend have lamented the increase in prices of foodstuff. The high increase in the prices of food items has affected so many families as well as salary earners. Some of the civil servants who spoke with our reporter said they now find it difficult to cope with the skyrocketing increase in the prices of essential commodities.\n\nA civil servant told this reporter in confidence that, \u201cIt is like I am not working at all. I work with the Ministry of Labour and receive salary, but at the end of the month, I pay debts because I borrow weekly from friends to buy groceries for my family. How much is a mudu of beans? How much was it three months ago? That is what we are saying; it keeps increasing.\u201d\n\nAlso, Kabiru Abdullahi, a meat seller, blamed the increase in meat in the market on the rise of insecurity in some parts of the country, pointing out that a kilo of meat sold for 1, 500 three months ago is now 2, 500 to 3, 000 depending on the bargaining power of the customer.\n\n\u201cAnytime we go to the market, we come back with whatever we can afford. A cow that we used to buy for N300, 000 is now N600, 000, while that of 250,000 is now N500, 000 or even N450, 000.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe commodities are not scarce, but the problem is going to the market to get them due to the security situation in some parts of the country. We can\u2019t go to states like Katsina and Sokoto where cows are cheap; we now source them Kano, Bauchi or Gombe state,\u201d he said.\n\nIsa Mohamed, a farmer from Anzare village in Kajuru local government area of Kaduna state whose village was sacked by bandits in February, described as \u201cunfortunate\u201d the soaring prices of foodstuff and lamented that they have been unable to farm grains due to the activities of bandits.\n\nA pepper trader, who identified herself as Bilkisu, said: \u201cThe cost of food is very expensive, especially pepper and tomatoes. Two years ago, a basket of tomatoes went for N4, 000, but now, it is N18, 000 or N17, 000. I can\u2019t afford a basket because of the hike. The money we used to buy a basket of pepper and tomatoes is what we now use to buy the items in smaller quantities. Also, a quarter bag of pepper is now N6, 500. We bought one bag of Shombo for N13, 000 yesterday. Today, I could not afford the price, and so I had to buy in bits from other traders.\n\nMilitary\u2019s assurances\n\nHowever, the Defence Headquarters said it had begun the bombardment of bandits\u2019 hideouts in the North-west, North-central and some parts of the North-east. It stated that operational efforts of the Armed Forces of Nigeria (AFN) in various theatres of operations have led to the reduction in criminal activities across the country.\n\nThe director, Defence Media Operation (DMO), Brig.-Gen. Bernard Onyeuko, stated this recently while briefing journalists on the operational activities of the AFN across the country between June 3 and 16, 2021.\n\nHe said, \u201cTroop\u2019s operational activities in Operation Hadarin Daji theatre of operation between June 3 and 16, 2021, were characterised with ambush operations, aggressive fighting patrols, air raids, sustained air intelligence surveillance reconnaissance patrols as well as cordon and search operations.\n\n\u201cThese operations yielded attendant successes in the period under review. Troops, during an ambush operation on June 3, intercepted and neutralised some gunrunners who were in possession of assorted arms and ammunition between Naimaimai Village and Sabon Birni Town in Sabon Birni local government area of Sokoto state.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, on June 4, 2021, troops, following credible intelligence report, conducted cordon and search operation along Gurbin Baure \u2013 Jibia Road in Katsina state. During the operation, troops intercepted and neutralised some armed bandits.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari\u2019s stern order\n\nThe senior special assistant on media and publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, had in an interview with the Hausa Service of the BBC in March, said President Muhammadu Buhari had ordered a crackdown on bandits terrorising farmers across the country.\n\nAlso, during his interview with Arise Television recently, the president said he had ordered security agents to shoot on sight bandits carrying AK-47 rifles.\n\nFood imports\n\nThe rise in agricultural imports has continued unabated due to insecurity despite many Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN\u2019s) initiatives aimed at achieving food sufficiency.\n\nA recent foreign trade report released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) indicated that Nigeria\u2019s agricultural imports increased by 140 per cent in the first quarter of this year.\n\nNigeria imported agricultural items worth N630.18 billion in the period compared to N262.1 billion in first quarter of 2020.\n\nThis represents the highest quarterly agric import recorded by Nigeria since 2016. In the past two years, between the second quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2020, Nigeria has spent N3.1 trillion on agricultural imports.\n\nSome of the programmes, as stated by the apex bank in its last MPC briefing, include N631.4 billion to 3.11 million small-holder farmers cultivating 3.8 million hectares of land, under the Anchor Borrowers\u2019 program. Also, 29, 26 beneficiaries received N111.7 billion for the AGSMEIS, while 548,345 beneficiaries have received N253.4 billion under the Targeted Credit Facility.\n\nThese interventions notwithstanding, agric imports have continued to rise, triggered by multiple de-valuations of the naira; demand for higher input raw materials, and rising inflation. Much of Nigeria\u2019s food consumption still relies significantly on the importation of food items to stimulate local production.\n\nFor example, wheat remains an imported production input costing Nigeria about N222 billion in the first quarter of 2021 alone. It was N252 billion in the 4th quarter of 2020, translating to an annualised cost of N1 trillion ($2 billion). The country\u2019s food index has increased by 32.3 percent between September 2019 and April 2021 which is only a weighted aggregate of the market reality.\n\nAccording to a market survey report which studies the prices of food items in major markets in Lagos state, a bag of pepper surged by as much as 85.7 per cent in May 2021, while beans increased by 15.1 per cent in the same period. Other items that have witnessed significant increases recently include flour, egg, tomatoes, noodles, pasta, bread, beverages, just to state a few.\n\nFor Suleiman Dikwa, the CEO of Green Sahara Farms, a major cause of the surge in agric imports is the inability of the country to produce sufficiently for local consumption",

          "text": "Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta has called on the States\u2019 House of Assembly to ensure that the Constitutional Amendment Bill is passed when passed to them by the National Assembly.\n\nOkowa made the call on Friday when he received the Conference of Speakers of States\u2019 Legislatures in Nigeria led by its Chairman and Speaker of Bauchi State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Abubakar Suleiman, at Government House, Asaba.\n\nHe stated that as states\u2019 legislatures, the onus was on them to pass the Constitutional amendments in the interest of the nation.\n\nHe said that the nation was in dire need of the amendments to provide equity, justice and fairness in the affairs of the country.\n\nOkowa urged the Conference to continue to be a voice for the people and to remain true in enforcing executive-legislative relations across the country.\n\n\u201cWe are all aware that the National Assembly is currently engaged in the review of the 1999 Constitution and when they are through, it will be passed over to the States\u2019 Assemblies for passage.\n\n\u201cThe management of the country has placed a key role in your hands and I urge you all to look at it passionately to ensure that we are fair, equitable and justiciable in all decisions we will take in passing the ammendment.\n\n\u201cNigeria is in trouble but I believe that in working together, we can pilot the nation out of the current challenges through a passionate approach because as leaders, everything about governance must be in the overall interest of the people,\u201d he said.\n\nHe commended the legislature in Delta for its cooperation which had led to the achievements recorded by his administration in the last six years.\n\nAccording to him, whatever we have achieved as a state so far is because we have a very robust relationship with the State House of Assembly.\n\n\u201cThey are very passionate about the development of the state and that has helped us to make lots of progress.\n\n\u201cI am glad that you have organised yourselves under the Conference to compare notes, just as the Governors, to discuss and share ideas and to also talk to ourselves because it helps to improve the bond of unity among the various states.\n\n\u201cThe more we are talking together and remain strong the better for our country and I believe that was why the Conference of Speakers was berthed and I hope that you will continue to use the conference to better the lots of this nation,\u201d he added.\n\nOkowa who underscored the importance of executive-legislative relations, said \u201cif any state is to make progress there is need for a very warm relationship with the executive and legislative arms to enable policies and programmes work more efficiently than they would have ordinarily had.\n\n\u201cWe are in very trying times and this poses more burden on the various state legislatures. There must be a lot of collaborations and thinking to get the states out of unemployment, poverty and insecurity pervading the nation.\n\n\u201cA very cordial relationship that works will help to improve on the development of our country.\n\n\u201cAs lawmakers, you have a lot of role to play and I charge you to see yourselves going beyond just making laws, to help the executive to ensure that the people get the best of governance.\n\n\u201cThe fear of legislative autonomy is unfounded because our state House of Assembly has been operating in autonomy since 2019,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier, Rt. Hon. Suleiman had said that the Speakers were in the state for the second quarter meeting of the Conference.\n\nHe said that the Conference was made up of Speakers of the 36 States Houses of Assembly representing the 998 members of Houses of Assembly in the country.\n\nHe commended the Governor for the massive development in Asaba and parts of the state, adding that the mutual understanding between the Executive and Legislative arms of government in the state was commendable and worthy of emulation.\n\nSpeaker of Delta House of Assembly and Deputy Chairman of the Conference of Speakers, Rt Hon. Sheriff Oborevwori, appreciated Governor Okowa for his love for the legislature and for graciously approving to host the Conference in Delta.",

That is why there is so much suffering in the world. Today, the Lord wants to repair all that is broken down. Only come back and reconnect to Him.\n\n\u201cYou will reconnect and your life will never remain the same. You can begin to think about the freedom, power and authority the angels enjoy, and God made it so that we can enjoy the good life He planned for us. The glory and honour are coming back. The Lord will cleanse and change you, and all you lost will be restored to you.\n\n\u201cHe also made all things: sickness, suffering, oppression, calamities, etc. to be under your feet. By divine connection, from tonight, there will be a restoration of all that God planned for you originally.\u201d\n\nThe former university don stressed that sin is the instrument used by the devil to influence people to do evil and achieve his aim of destroying human lives and all good things that would bring peace and development.\n\nHe added that sin is the spiritual challenge of man that generates physical and moral decays in the society, therefore appealed to Nigerians to connect with God, and the expected divine intervention individually, family, nationally, and socio-economically will come but through absolute repentance from all sin.\n\n\u201cYou can invite sin with one finger but at the end, ten fingers will not be enough to remove them. Many people commit sin today and they feel they are alright. We are saying tonight that when you are in sin, you are not alright.\n\n\u201cThe Lord is your Redeemer, He will save you from all troubles and problems. He knows where your goodness, prosperity, satisfaction and sufficient supplies are, and He will lead you to them as you connect to Him. After giving you all this goodness, in the end, He will take you to heaven.\n\n\u201cWhen God calls you to repentance, you have to come to Him and do away with all those things which cause disconnection, chief of which is sin\u201d, he said.",

          "title": "Deep Impact: How COVID-19 Exposed The Education Sector\u2019s Digital Flaw",
          "text": "Solomon Elusoji\n\nKemi Ogunsanya, 29, studied English Education at the University of Lagos. After graduation she wasn\u2019t inclined, at first, to teach. But after several failed job applications, she returned to the classroom, this time as an instructor. And, for seven years, she hasn\u2019t looked back.\n\nWhen Nigeria\u2019s Ministry of Education ordered the closure of all schools to limit the spread of the pandemic in March 2020, Kemi\u2019s students \u2013 aged seven to 11 \u2013 were just about to commence examinations. \u201cIt was a bit destabilising,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we knew we were going to continue online.\u201d\n\nKemi\u2019s school made the transition to online learning using tools such as Zoom and Class Dojo. To \u201cthoroughly engage\u201d her students, she picked up skills in cartoon animation and visual design, and researched techniques on how to gamify learning. \u201cI wanted to captivate my students\u2019 attention,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew that if it was boring, students would not enjoy it.\u201d\n\nOf course there were challenges \u2013 the regular limitations of Internet data and power supply. And since online learning requires a lot of parent participation, she had to keep constant tabs on parents to ensure student attendance and prompt submission of class assignments.\n\n\u201cIt was a lot of effort, but it wasn\u2019t a wasted year,\u201d Kemi said. \u201cNow that schools have resumed, there are some slides and videos I created then that we are still using now. And the students still enjoy them.\u201d\n\nBut for millions of students enrolled in public or rural schools in Nigeria, the school closures halted formal learning, according to more than a dozen teachers who spoke to Channels Television. For months, students were cut off from their instructors. The use of digital technology to communicate was not an option as most children who attend public, rural schools come from poor homes with no access to smartphones or the Internet. The Ministry of Education in several states tried to reach students through mass produced radio and television programs, but the impact was minimal at best. \u201cTeaching did not stop,\u201d one teacher said, \u201cbut I can\u2019t tell if learning took place.\u201d\n\nAn unfair advantage\n\nAdaobi Amadi, 34, had always wanted to be a teacher. When she was younger, she had her own make-shift school, complete with a blackboard and chalk, where she taught her neighbours. So it wasn\u2019t a surprise when she took up teaching after graduating from the Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Akwa, with a degree in Applied Biochemistry.\n\nToday, she teaches Chemistry to students between 13 and 18 at a public school in Port Harcourt.\n\nWhen schools were closed in March 2020, she thought, at first, it was going to be a one-month holiday. But the months continued to meld into one another and she began to feel an emotion she described as \u2018panic\u2019. While her son, who attends a private school, was receiving lectures online from home, she was cut off from her students. \u201cAt that point, it became kind of stressful,\u201d she said.\n\nAn online learning approach would never work for Adaobi\u2019s students. Most of them came from families with no access to smartphones or laptops, talk less of Internet data. \u201cIn my school, there are students who come to me and say, we haven\u2019t eaten since yesterday. Majority of them are domestic workers. We do have a sprinkling who come from middle-class homes, but those are very few.\u201d\n\nWhen schools began to reopen in the later part of 2020, Adaobi said \u201cthe drop in performance was glaring.\u201d Teachers tried to review what had been taught in the past months and holidays were shrunk. The Christmas break didn\u2019t extend much beyond a week, as efforts to gain ground intensified.\n\nAdaobi said school hours were also reduced from six to three hours as authorities moved to comply with social distancing regulations imposed by the Ministry of Education.\n\n\u201cPrivate schools have maintained their schooling schedules,\u201d she said. \u201cThey get like six hours of schooling. And my students get only three hours. And it\u2019s the same syllable they are supposed to cover and the same examinations they are supposed to sit for.\u201d\n\nShe observed that the questions in the last set of external exams her student wrote seemed to have been easier than previous ones. Perhaps, she mused, the examination bodies had considered the impact of the pandemic on student performance. (A WAEC spokesman told Channels Television the examination body \u201cwill never compromise on standards or integrity\u201d of its tests)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that will happen again,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause if it\u2019s the same standards as what we had three, four years ago, I\u2019m obviously scared for public school students.\n\n\u201cI kind of feel like it\u2019s very unfair that public school students and private school students would sit for the same exams. Private school students not only got the online classes that they did, then when schools resumed they continued with their normal schedule. So they are prepared. But public school students are not.\u201d\n\nAn inadequate government response\n\nNigeria is not the only country where the pandemic disrupted education. According to UNICEF, about 1.2 billion learners were out of school and 73.8% of the world\u2019s school population were affected by school closures as a result of efforts to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus.\n\nOn paper, the Federal Government developed several initiatives to ensure students continued to learn despite the pandemic lockdowns, through the Nigeria Education Sector COVID-19 Response Strategy set up by the Federal Ministry of Education and the Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC).\n\nThe strategy included plans for the Learn at Home Programme (LHP), which led to partnerships with educational technology companies and the launching of virtual e-learning platforms.\n\nThese platforms include SchoolGate (for primary school students), Mobile Classroom, WAEC E-learning toolkit and Unity Schools virtual learning platforms.\n\nThe Ministry, on its website, also linked to other educational resources from Khan Academy, Seesaw, National Open University, UNESCO School Meets Learner Approach, Teacher Development Programme, British Council, and others.\n\nState Governments, too, adopted several initiatives. The Lagos State government, for example, partnered with First Bank of Nigeria to equip students with e-learning solutions and low-end devices preloaded with a government-accredited curriculum and designed to work offline.\n\nAlso, many states turned to broadcasting lessons on radio and television. These lessons encompassed content on core primary and secondary school subjects.\n\nBut what was the impact of these interventions? Were they able to meet the learning needs of students or mitigate the number of dropouts when schools eventually reopened, considering Nigeria has one of the largest numbers of out-of-school-children in the world?\n\nA Federal Ministry of Education spokesman Ben Bem Goong suggested that it was hardly the Ministry\u2019s responsibility to ensure active participation in digital learning.\n\n\u201cHaving access to online facilities is basically an individual responsibility,\u201d he said during a phone interview. \u201cI can\u2019t buy a phone and give it to anybody. I don\u2019t think the Ministry will buy phones and laptops (for students) to access online materials. We haven\u2019t gotten to that level.\u201d\n\nOne vision of the Ministry of Education is \u201cto provide universal and equal access to quality basic and secondary education that will ensure self-reliance, preparedness for further education, good citizenship and effective participation in democratic governance.\u201d\n\nWhen pressed on whether the Ministry was worried about the inability of many students, especially those attending public, rural schools, to access digital learning, including resources provided by the government, Mr Goong said the government cannot be expected to do everything.\n\n\u201cThe question you are asking me is not within the (purview) of the Federal Ministry of Education to answer, in the sense that providing Internet facilities is not just a function of what the Ministry of Education does alone,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn terms of providing electricity \u2013 which is the key driver to rolling out online materials \u2013 it\u2019s not within our responsibility to do. This cuts across sectors. So when a student is unable to access online materials that are driven by electricity or wireless signals, it is not entirely a responsibility of the Ministry of Education.\n\n\u201cIt is a responsibility that cuts across Ministries, one that also has to do with the family. There is no way government can do all of that alone; if government has built schools, government has engaged teachers, it\u2019s paying them, maintaining the schools, I think some other stakeholders should also take that responsibility, particularly those that value education; they should be able to say how do I provide laptops and batteries for my children to learn. When you begin to put everything on the head of government, believe you me, even the best critics of governance will not like to be in government after one week.\u201d\n\nTo prepare for another pandemic-like school closure, Mr Goong said the Federal Ministry of Education was seeking to partner with the Nigeria Television Authority and the Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria to develop lessons in key areas for broadcast, especially for students in exit classes.\n\nThe importance of digital tools\n\nSamuel Onyeledo, 35, still remembers vividly the first day he walked into a public primary school in Kaduna. He was excited to be starting his fellowship with Teach for Nigeria, a program which recruits talented future leaders and sends them to teach at schools in low-income communities.\n\nHe remembers being introduced to teachers who were invigilating a primary six examination. When he asked them how the students were doing, they appeared to mock the pupils. \u201cThese ones? They don\u2019t know anything,\u201d one of the teachers said, according to Onyeledo. \u201cIn fact, they can\u2019t even read the questions on the board. We just wrote it down in English language but we have to read it out in Hausa before they will be able to attempt it.\u201d\n\nFor most of the next two years, Onyeledo, a graduate of Geology from the Federal University of Technology, Owerri, worked hard to teach a class of kids how to read.\n\n\u201cIf a child goes from primary one to primary six and still can\u2019t read,\u201d Onyeledo said, \u201c I think the school system has wasted six years of that child\u2019s life. Because a basic thing the child should get before leaving primary education is literacy. Just the ability to read, to communicate in the English language.\u201d\n\nThe pandemic-induced school closures cut short Onyeledo\u2019s time with the kids.\n\n\u201cFor me, it was close to devastating, mainly because of the kids in my class,\u201d Onyeledo said. \u201cI had been working with them closely, trying to get them to learn to read, basically. I was teaching primary two. I started with them in primary one. That was then the pandemic happened. When schools closed, it was devastating because I knew how far we had gone. If I\u2019m not with them, they might just slide back.\u201d\n\nAnd he couldn\u2019t really be with them because most of the parents of the kids in his class didn\u2019t have smartphones. The only channel of communication was through voice calls, which he said were not effective enough and couldn\u2019t really scale. There were radio programs, but he wasn\u2019t sold on their effectiveness for primary school students. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s much impact,\u201d he said. \u201cAt that level, these children need hands-on-learning, they need guidance.\u201d\n\nWhen lockdown measures were eased, he tried to visit some of his students at home and share resources with their guidance, while observing Covid protocols. But he would always wish that his students had access to technology.\n\n\u201cWith tech, we would have held online classes on Zoom, easily created a classroom, a group for all the parents and kids,\u201d Onyeledo said. \u201cAnd sometimes send voice notes. For those who are visual learners too, we could send some resources, including videos. It would make your teaching very effective. With technology, it would have been a whole lot better.\u201d\n\nMaryam Onubaye, 27, was another Teach for Nigeria fellow in Kaduna who lost major contact with her pupils after schools closed. But she wouldn\u2019t give up.\n\n\u201cI started thinking about ways to get them learning,\u201d she said \u201cSome of their parents have Whatsapp-enabled phones. So I went to their houses \u2013 the community where my school was \u2013 Tudun Wada \u2013 you can have like five families in one area and ten kids. I went to their houses and made lesson videos on the subjects I teach and every week I send them to their phones. I give exercises at the end of the videos that they can do. And I explain to parents how they can guide them and make sure they actually do the exercises. And they take a picture and send it back to me. We did that every week.\n\n\u201cThe ones who do not have Whatsapp-enabled phones, I had to do weekly exercises with them. Every weekend, I\u2019ll go and teach them a little, come back and follow up.\u201d\n\nHer enthusiasm and creativity and hard work made some impact, but Onubaye recognised the limitations. More \u201cdigital tools would have made a difference,\u201d she said. \u201cBut for that to happen, there are so many things that need to happen. The kids have to have access to the internet, power, a tablet, a phone or a computer.\u201d For now, they do not.\n\n\u2018A lot of work to do\u2019\n\nIn March, internet penetration in Nigeria stood at 41 percent, according to the Nigerian Communications Commission. And coverage is mostly limited to urban cities such as Lagos, Port Harcourt, Abuja and Kano. But almost half of all Nigerians still live in rural communities, according to data from the World Bank. In 2020, the Federal Government launched a new national broadband plan which, by 2025, is expected to ensure all tertiary education institutions are within \u201c5km of fibre manhole or with a fixed connection\u201d to the Internet. Under the plan 50 per cent of secondary schools and 25 percent are expected to be covered by 2025. Gbenga Sesan, Executive Director of Paradigm Initiative, which \u201cworks to connect underserved young Africans with digital opportunities\u201d, said the government\u2019s plan \u201cis very conservative\u201d and \u201cmay not even be achieved if the government continues to introduce contradictory policies.\u201d\n\nAnother obvious challenge is power supply. As of 2018, according to World Bank data, only 56.5 percent of Nigeria\u2019s population have access to electricity. And as tariffs continue to rise, the poor and their children may find it harder to afford the glow from light bulbs.\n\nThe national situation is exacerbated by rising insecurity. While the number of out-of-school-children in Nigeria has dropped to 6.9 million from 10.1 million, with the help of the Better Education Service Delivery for All (BESDA) programme in Nigeria, the Minister of State for Education, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, has noted that \u201cmore and more children are joining the queue.\u201d Between December and March 2020, over 600 students were kidnapped from schools across the country. \u201cStudent kidnappings threaten collapse of Nigerian education system,\u201d two scholars warned in April.\n\n\u201cGovernment has a lot of work to do,\u201d Zam Daniel, a teacher in Abuja, said. \u201cIn the education sector, we are about 50 years behind developed countries.\u201d\n\nMore than ever, Nigeria must work to democratise digital education.\n\n\u201cIf it is our right to be educated and the web is now the biggest source of information,\u201d Adetola Omolade, a teacher at Greensprings School in Lagos, said.\n\n\u201cthen I think access to the internet is a basic human right.\u201d",
          "summary": "\u201cBecause if it\u2019s the same standards as what we had three, four years ago, I\u2019m obviously scared for public school students.\n\u201cI kind of feel like it\u2019s very unfair that public school students and private school students would sit for the same exams.\nThe importance of digital toolsSamuel Onyeledo, 35, still remembers vividly the first day he walked into a public primary school in Kaduna.\nBecause a basic thing the child should get before leaving primary education is literacy.\nThere were radio programs, but he wasn\u2019t sold on their effectiveness for primary school students.",

          "text": "More than a dozen fully vaccinated doctors have died of Covid-19 in Indonesia, according to a medical association, as the Southeast Asian country battles a rash of severe cases in inoculated medical workers and highly infectious new virus strains.\n\nInfections have surged in the nation of 270 million people in the past week, with more than 2.05 million cases reported as of Saturday, as hospital occupancy rates soared to more than 75 percent in Jakarta and other hard-hit areas.\n\nNearly 1,000 Indonesian health workers have died from the virus since the pandemic started, with the country\u2019s medical association confirming on Friday that 401 doctors were among the victims \u2013 14 of whom were fully vaccinated.\n\n\u201cWe are still updating the data and confirming whether the other cases had been vaccinated or not,\u201d the association\u2019s COVID-19 mitigation head Mohammad Adib Khumaidi told journalists.\n\nThe rise of severe cases in inoculated medical workers has raised questions about the China-produced Sinovac jab, which Indonesia is heavily relying on to vaccinate more than 180 million people by early next year.\n\nThis month, more than 300 vaccinated doctors and healthcare workers in Central Java were found to have been infected with COVID-19, with about a dozen hospitalised.\n\nThe country is also grappling with new virus strains, including the highly infectious Delta variant first identified in India.\n\nIn the capital, Jakarta, the surge in cases have forced hospitals to set up emergency tents, according to Detik news website, which quoted provincial government officials.\n\nIn Medan, the capital city of North Sumatra province, Dr Inke Nadia D Lubis, member of the COVID task force in the area, reported that in the last six months as many as 1,800 children have been infected with the virus, including 14 who have died.\n\nMore than a third of the cases reported were elementary school-age students, while a quarter were high school-age students, Inke was quoted by Detik as saying.\n\nOn Friday, President Joko Widodo said that the country is facing an \u201cextraordinary situation\u201d, vowing to respond with \u201cquick and appropriate policies\u201d while urging his countrymen to cooperate in the government\u2019s response.\n\nClinical symptoms suggest that strain is responsible for a surge in cases in West Java, the medical association\u2019s spokesperson for the province, Eka Mulyana, said.\n\n\u201cIn West Java, bed occupancy rates have exceeded 90 percent. Some hospitals\u2019 rates are even more than 100 percent,\u201d he told reporters.\n\n\u201cAt this rate, our health system is close to collapse.\u201d\n\nDozens of communities in Central Java\u2019s Kudus regency were put under lockdown after the Delta variant was detected in local testing samples, causing a sudden spike in virus cases.\n\nA patient rests on the floor at a temporary tent outside the emergency ward of a government hospital, amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in Bekasi, on the outskirts of Jakarta on Friday [Willy Kurniawan/Reuters]\n\nThe surge has been partly blamed on millions travelling from that region across the Muslim-majority nation at the end of Ramadan last month, despite an official ban on the annual migration.\n\nThe Indonesian medical association\u2019s Kudus representative, Ahmad Ipul Syaifuddin, has said the mass movement of people had made it next to impossible to determine where the surge began.\n\n\u201cWe have no clue on how to trace and find the first spreader of the Delta cases because the sampling test result came out around three weeks after the mass exodus,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMy sample was among the tested sampling for the Delta variant. I have already recovered and (have) tested negative now, but I still have a cough.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Jakarta Post reported that among those who were recently infected with the coronavirus is an unnamed Indonesian official, who was travelling to Italy for an international conference.\n\nThe official is under quarantine for 10 days after testing positive upon arrival at the Sicilian port city of Catania, where officials from around the world were convening for a series of G20 ministerial meetings.",

          "text": "The widow of John McAfee, the British-American tycoon who died in a Spanish prison this week while awaiting extradition to the United States, on Friday demanded a \u201cthorough investigation\u201d of his death, saying her husband did not appear suicidal when they last spoke.\n\nAuthorities in Spain are conducting an autopsy on McAfee\u2019s body but have said that everything at the scene in his cell indicated that the 75-year-old killed himself.\n\nAn official source familiar with the investigation told The Associated Press that a suicide note had been found in McAfee\u2019s pocket. The source, who was not authorized to speak about an ongoing judicial inquiry, refused to comment on the content of the note.\n\nMcAfee\u2019s Spanish lawyer, Javier Villalba, said that the family had not been informed by authorities about the note.\n\nIn her first public remarks since the software entrepreneur\u2019s death on Wednesday, McAfee\u2019s widow Janice McAfee said she wanted a \u201cthorough investigation\u201d to provide \u201canswers about this was able to happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis last words to me were \u2018I love you and I will call you in the evening,\u2019\u201d the 38-year-old told reporters outside the Brians 2 penitentiary northwest of Barcelona where she recovered her late husband\u2019s belongings. She said they spoke earlier on the day he was found dead.\n\n\u201cThose words are not words of somebody who is suicidal,\u201d she added.\n\nJohn McAfee was arrested at the Barcelona airport in October last year on a warrant issued by prosecutors in Tennessee who were seeking up to three decades of imprisonment for allegedly evading more than $4 million in taxes.\n\nThe day before he was found dead, Spain\u2019s National Court had announced that it was agreeing to his extradition to the U.S. but the decision was not final.\n\n\u201cWe had a plan of action already in place to appeal that decision,\u201d Janice McAfee told reporters. \u201cI blame the U.S. authorities for this tragedy: Because of these politically motivated charges against him my husband is now dead.\u201d\n\nThe National Court judge said John McAfee had provided no evidence to back his allegations that he was being politically persecuted. \u201cOn the contrary, according to his own testimony, he took part in primaries of a certain party to defend his convictions with a result little favorable to him,\u201d the judge wrote in the ruling seen by AP.\n\nIn an e-mailed statement, the U.S. State Department confirmed for the first time the tycoon\u2019s death, offering the family condolences. It said: \u201cWe are closely monitoring local authorities\u2019 investigation into the cause of death. We stand ready to provide all appropriate assistance to the family. Out of respect to the family during this difficult time, we have no further comment.\u201d\n\nResults of McAfee\u2019s autopsy could take \u201cdays or weeks,\u201d authorities have said.\n\nThe couple reportedly met in 2012 in Miami and married the following year. John McAfee had several children from previous relationships, Janice McAfee said.\n\nThe entrepreneur had not been connected with the companies that took over the antivirus software he built after he sold his shares in the 1990s. That early success had made McAfee rich and followed him in his troubled biography.\n\nIn 2012, he was sought for questioning in connection with the murder of his neighbor in Belize, but was never charged with a crime. The controversy didn\u2019t stop him from making long-shot runs for the U.S. presidency starting in 2016.\n\nBut it was his more recent tax problems that kept him away from the U.S., the country where the British-born entrepreneur was raised and had built his early success.\n\nThe Tennessee prosecutors\u2019 indictments from 2020 showed that the tycoon allegedly failed to declare income made by promoting cryptocurrencies, attending speaking engagements and selling the rights for a documentary on his eventful life.\n\n\u201cEven though he was born in England, America was his home,\u201d Janice McAfee said. \u201cHe came there when he was a child. He had his first girlfriend there, his first case, you know, his first job. He made his first millions there and he wanted to be there. But, you know, politics just wouldn\u2019t allow for that to happen.\u201d\n\nJohn McAfee\u2019s social media postings indicated that he had chosen a northeastern Spanish coastal resort town as his base in Europe at least since late 2019.\n\n\u201cAll John wanted to do was spend his remaining years fishing and drinking,\u201d his widow said on Friday. \u201cHe had hope that things would work out. We knew that there would be an uphill battle to continue to fight this situation. But he\u2019s a fighter \u2026 And anybody that knows John, that knows him even a little bit, knows that about him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was just so loving. He had a big heart and he just loved people and he just wanted to have peace in his life,\u201d Janice McAfee added. \u201cMy prayers are that his soul has found the peace in death that he could not find in life.\u201d",
