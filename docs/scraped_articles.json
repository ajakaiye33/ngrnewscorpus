          "title": "Nigerian embassy in Paris denies allegation of extortion",
          "text": "The Nigerian Embassy in Paris, France has denied allegations that it treats Nigerians with disdain and also extorts money from them.\n\nThe allegations were made yesterday by a Twitter user, @henryabebe, who said some staff \u201cuse the fingerprint clearance form to extort Nigerians at the Paris embassy at the price of 125euro.\u201d\n\nAlerting authorities in Nigeria of the other forms of extortion allegedly going on at the embassy, he said, \u201cWe cannot expect that Nigerians receive respect from the host country while the representative (embassy) of the country treats people with disdain.\u201d\n\nReacting, the embassy issued a statement titled, \u2018Press Release By The Embassy Of Nigeria In Paris On The Spurious Allegations Of @Henryabebe.\u2019\n\nIn the statement, the embassy refuted the allegations, saying they came from someone \u201cclearly not familiar with the services rendered by the Embassy and has not been following the regular public notices updated on the website of the Mission, and public areas at the Chancery. Such notices are also regularly transmitted to Nigerian community associations in France, as part of the outreach efforts of the Embassy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe wish to state that all the staff of Nigerian Embassy in Paris exhibit the highest levels of professionalism and respect in delivering services to Nigerians. @henryabebe, in his tweet, indicated that Embassy officials were treating Nigerians with disrespect and were charging thirty euros (\u20ac30) as an administrative fee, sixty euros (\u20ac60) for legalization, and two hundred and fifty euros (\u20ac250) for express service.\n\n\u201cContrary to @henryabebe\u2019s allegations, the Nigerian Embassy France has been at the forefront of delivering efficient and timely consular and immigration services with the highest levels of professionalism. It is pertinent to highlight that due to the efficiency and professionalism of the Nigerian Embassy in Paris, Nigerians from various countries in Europe travel to Paris to apply for their passports, with a same-day collection policy.\n\n\u201cNigerians in France and across Europe, who are familiar with the high quality of the services of the Embassy in Paris, will attest to the transparency, efficiency, professionalism and courteousness of our officers and staff in dealing with applicants for passports, visas and other consular services. Furthermore, the Mission has a feedback mechanism for dealing promptly with genuine urgent passport and consular cases, as well as complaints from unsatisfied applicants.\n\n\u201cAs part of the efforts to enhance service delivery, the Embassy in the month of February and March 2021 organized training and retraining courses on professionalism and service delivery for its staff. The Embassy also introduced measures to enable applicants for consular services to book appointments online to ensure crowd control and promote transparency. Regrettably, many of our nationals refused to adhere to the online appointment policy\n\n\u201cIt is pertinent to note that 24 May 2021, the day preceding the day @henryabebe presented at the Embassy, was Ascension Day, which was a public holiday in France. Consequently, the following day, 26 May 2021, witnessed all the people who had missed their appointments due to the public holiday of 24 May 2021 and many others without appointments, trooping into the Embassy.\n\n\u201cThe Embassy staff assured our nationals that they would be attended to.\n\n\u201cHowever, due to the limited sitting space inside the Chancery resulting from Covid-19 restrictions, some of them were advised to stay in the queue at the entrance of the Chancery. Unfortunately, arguments ensued and the security staff explained the situation to our nationals, who failed to exercise patience. Some of them threatened to burn down the Embassy and attack the officials.\u201d\n\nThe embassy stated that the charges which @henryabebe complained about are in line with the administrative fees at Nigerian Missions abroad as approved by the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cAll the charges are clearly stated on the Embassy\u2019s website and displayed conspicuously at the Embassy. Meanwhile, despite the reintroduction of the fees, the Embassy has in recent months halted payment for express service to enable a faster clear up of all pending applications.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Embassy in Paris assures all Nigerian citizens and the general public that it will continue to provide timely, efficient, and professional passport, visa and consular service to our nationals, whom we treat with the highest levels of respect. Our record of efficient and compassionate service delivery is proven and has been attested to by numerous Nigerian citizens who have given honest reviews,\u201d the statement concluded.",

Would he go to far away Paris, France, to declare that his administration is being plagued by ill-luck?\n\n\u201cOur party vehemently rejects this attempt by APC leaders to claim that their party failed because of the challenges that have befallen our nation, when in reality, the APC and the Buhari Presidency should be held responsible for their own failures.\n\n\u201cInstead of this desperation to play to the gallery, APC leaders should accept the ugly fact that their lust for power, arrogance, incompetence in governance, unbridled corruption, electoral malpractices, divisiveness, vindictiveness, parochial mindedness, nepotism, disrespect to rule of law; injustice, sectional marginalization, violation of human rights, promotion of hatred and intolerance to dissenting voices had led to the security, economic and political challenges we face today.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari and the APC must therefore provide answers to why they have failed to forcefully condemn acts of terrorism in our country in addition to why they have failed to take decisive steps to vanquish terrorists, bandits and vandals ravaging our nation.\n\n\u201cThey must provide answers on how they wrecked our once thriving economy and turned our nation into the poverty capital of the world with a 33.3 unemployment rate and over 60 million Nigerians losing their means of livelihood in a space of six years.\n\n\u201cNigerians are already aware that our nation is currently plagued by economic hardship, decayed and stagnated infrastructure and over N32 trillion naira accumulated debt because of the incompetence and corruption in the Buhari administration wherein treasury looters as APC leaders, cabinet ministers, presidential aides, heads of parastatals, and their cronies, wives and mistresses are allowed to plunder our vaults and steal over N17 trillion belonging to the people.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative for President Buhari and APC to note that Nigerians are already aware that Mr. President and his party are responsible for the woes that had befallen our nation and no amount of false performance claims or so-called legacy awareness campaign can sway the people,\u201d the statement further said.",

          "title": "Jubilations in Maiduguri as Yahaya Emerges New Army Chief",
          "text": "\u2022Several generals may retire\n\nKingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nThe announcement of Maj. Gen. Faruk Yahaya as the new chief of army staff (COAS) yesterday drew pulsating jubilations at the headquarters of Operations Hadin Kai in Maiduguri, the Borno State capital.\n\nTroops of the theatre command of the war against the insurgency in the North-east jumped for joy as they were told of the rise of their commander to the top job of the service.\n\n\u201cThe excitement is not surprising,\u201d a top military officer told THISDAY last night, explaining: \u201cYahaya has a reputation for taking care of his troops.\u201d\n\nBut for several senior officers, particularly Yahaya\u2019s superiors, they have approached the end of the road; and it\u2019s not a laughing matter as they might have to abruptly retire.\n\nThe Defence Headquarters (DHQ), had in a statement by its spokesman, Brig. Gen. Onyema Nwachukwu, said: \u201cThe Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, President Muhammadu Buhari, has appointed Maj. Gen. Farouk Yahaya as the new Chief of Army Staff.\n\n\u201cPrior to his appointment, Maj. Gen. Yahaya was the General Officer Commanding 1 Division of the Nigerian Army and the incumbent Theatre Commander of the Counter-Terrorism Counter Insurgency military outfit in the North-east, code-named Operation Hadin Kai.\u201d\n\nThe appointment THISDAY gathered has left several senior officers facing an imminent retirement from service.\n\nYahaya, a member of the 37th Regular Course of the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA), succeeded Lt. Gen, Ibrahim Attahiru of Course 35, who died along with 10 other military officers and personnel in a plane crash in Kaduna last Friday.\n\nSources told THISDAY yesterday that should Yahaya decide to strictly follow military tradition, members of Course 35 and Course 36, who are his senior by date of commission, would have to go.\n\nInvestigation revealed that the army\u2019s Chief of Policy and Plans, Maj. Gen. Ben Ahanotu, and Commander Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), Minna, Maj. Gen. Abubakar Maikobi, who were course mates of the late army chief, are certain to go.\n\nThere is also the possibility that some members of Course 36, who are also senior to Yahaya, may be retired.\n\nBut sources said that their career could be saved through redeployment to the tri-service section of the military or to the Defence Headquarters, under the Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Lucky Irabor, who is of Course 34.\n\nHowever, their possible redeployment depends on the decision of the Minister of Defence, Maj. Gen Bashir Salihi Magashi (rtd), who chairs the Armed Forces Council, and Yahaya.\n\nAccording to military officers, familiar with the tradition of the armed forces, they may also be posted to the Armed Forces Resettlement Centre in Oshodi, Lagos, the Command and Staff College, Jaji and other such military formations.\n\nA top military officer who spoke to THISDAY said: \u201cThere are three ways to look at it. The officers at the same level with the current army chief that has just been appointed can be posted to tri-service institutions with those that are ahead of him.\n\n\u201cThe Chief of Defence Staff is in 34th Course. You can get members of the 36 course to go and work there. It does not affect anything. \u201cThere is only one member of the 35 Course in the army (Maj. Gen. Ahanotu). He can go home.\n\n\u201cThe ones that you should be worried about are members of the 36 Course but you can take them to head military formations in Jaji, Oshodi; you can bring them to Defence Headquarters or Defence Research and Development Bureau.\n\n\u201cHe (new Army Chief) can also decide to retire them. He can retire them; they have spent about 35 years in service. No big deal about that. He can work with his course mates (37). The late army chief worked with his course mates. He was the one that insisted that they should not retire.\u201d\n\nOn how some of the top contenders were eliminated and the considerations that led to the emergence of the Yahaya, another senior officer, who spoke anonymously, said the elimination of Ahanotu, the second-in-command to the late Attahiru, was hinged on the fact that he was due for retirement. He was supposed to retire when Attahiru was appointed.\n\n\u201cMaj. Gen. Maikobi, from Kano, is of Course 36; defence minister and chief of naval staff are from Kano. I. M. Yusuf is also of 37. Yusuf has operational experience. The problem Yusuf had is that he is from Yobe State where the IG of Police hails from.\n\n\u201cFarouk Yahaya is from Sokoto and has no contender in that area or any inhibiting factor, no service chief is from there.\n\n\u201cMaj. Gen. M.S. Ahmed was disqualified because he is from Kano where the naval chief and the defence minister are from,\u201d he stated.\n\nOn the number of generals that may be retired, he said: \u201cOnly the military secretary can say that because it depends on many factors.\n\n\u201cWhen Attahiru came on board, the minister of defence insisted that all members of 35 course must go but he pleaded that two of them remain to help him, Ahanotu and the TRADOC commander. From today, the two of them will not bother to come to the office.\n\n\u201cThe same thing with the 36 course that is his (Yahaya\u2019s) senior may not even remain. The same minister of defence may say that all members of Course 37 should go. He did that in the navy when the present naval chief was appointed. He said that all Course 36 must go so that he should have command and control.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cHe can say all members of 37 Course should go; it depends on the decision at the strategic level. The decision will come from the Chairman of Armed Forces Council, who is the Minister of Defence, and who will also decide on how to streamline the army.\n\n\u201cIt is not easy to say who will go or not. It\u2019s only when you check the seniority role that you can say so \u2013 if you check from the first 30, less CDS.\n\n\u201cThe new army chief is in 37 Course. Even in the 37, he is number 27. If he is no 27 on the seniority roll; let\u2019s say 23 are going from 36. But if you add his course mates more will go. If you also add the two from 35, you can arrive at 30.\u201d\n\nTHISDAY further gathered that the expected retirement of the senior officers in the army may also affect their colleagues in the navy and the air force.\n\n\u201cWhen the present service chiefs were appointed, their course mates in the three services were advised to leave the service and they all left except for those who were moved to the defence headquarters.\n\n\u201cIf you ask the opinion of other younger officers, those who are due for retirement should go,\u201d the source said.\n\nHe described the new army chief as a man known to have the welfare of the army at heart.\n\n\u201cIn terms of welfare, duties, he is even better than Buratai. He does not listen to gossip,\u201d the source added.\n\nProfile of New Army Chief, Yahaya\n\nYahaya was born on January 5, 1966, in Sifawa, Bodinga Local Government Area of Sokoto State. A member of the 37 Regular Course of the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA), he started his cadet training on September 27, 1985, and was commissioned into the Nigerian Army Infantry Corps on September 22, 1990.\n\nYahaya has held many appointments, including staff, instructional and command.\n\nNotable among the appointments he held are Garrison Commander, Headquarters Guards Brigade, Directing Staff at the Armed Forces Command and Staff College (AFCSC), Deputy Director, Army Headquarters Department of Military Secretary, Deputy Director, Army Research and Development and the Chief of Staff, Headquarters Joint Task Force Operation Polo Shield.\n\nHe also served as the Principal General Staff Officer (PGSO) to the Minister of Defence, the Commander, Headquarters 4 Brigade and 29 Task Force Brigade (Operation Zaman Lafiya). He was also Director, Manpower at the Army Headquarters, Military Secretary, Army Headquarters and General Officer Commanding (GOC) 1 Division of the Nigerian Army.\n\nThe new COAS is a recipient of many honours and awards, including Forces Service Star, Meritorious Service Star, Distinguished Service Star, Grand Service Star, Passed Staff Course (Dagger), National Defence Course (Chile), Economic Community of West Africa State Monitoring Group Medal, Command Medal, Field Command Medal, General Operations Medal, Silver Jubilee Medal and Golden Jubilee Medal.\n\nHe is married with children.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Urges govs to make states economically viable\n\n\u2022FG to screen projects for PPP suitability\n\nNdubuisi Francis and James Emejo in Abuja\n\nThe Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, has said Nigeria requires about N35 trillion investments in infrastructure for the economy to post a double-digit growth.\n\nBut Emefiele, in a goodwill message he delivered yesterday at a webinar on \u201cFinancing Public-Private Partnership to Boost Infrastructure Delivery in Nigeria,\u201d organised by the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) in Abuja, added that given the paucity of government revenues, it will be difficult to support such investments using government funds alone.\n\nThe Nigerian economy, which is just crawling out of recession, recorded a 0.51 per cent growth in the first quarter of 2021 after a 0.11 per cent growth in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nBesides, Emefiele, at another forum yesterday, also called on governors to make their states economically viable in order to reduce their dependence on allocations from the Federation Account.\n\nEmefiele, whose message to the webinar was delivered by the Deputy Governor of the bank on Economic Policy, Dr. Kingsley Obiora, stated that the theme of the webinar was topical as a critical part of efforts to drive sustainable growth of the economy.\n\nHe said the COVID-19 pandemic had exerted unprecedented impacts on the economy, adding that interventions by the monetary and fiscal authorities had led to Nigeria exiting recession with muted growth.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhile this news is positive, growth is still well below our population growth of 2.7 per cent. It is therefore imperative that we all work together to harness the growth potential of the Nigerian economy.\n\n\u201cIf we take into account Nigeria\u2019s Infrastructure Masterplan, we require close to N35 trillion worth of investment in order to attain double-digit growth. But given the paucity of government revenue, which the BPE director-general mentioned earlier, it will be difficult to support these investments using government funds alone.\n\n\u201cSo, finding ways to harness public-private partnerships have become very important and we are happy to acknowledge that these partnerships have started in earnest and the Central Bank of Nigeria looks forward to continuing collaboration with the BPE to harness these partnerships to ensure that we significantly scale up investment in our infrastructure.\u201d\n\nIn her keynote address, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Dr. Zainab Ahmed, said from the 2021/2022 budget cycle, all infrastructure projects in Nigeria must be screened for Public-Private Partnership (PPP) suitability and compliance with the National Integrated Infrastructure Master plan by her ministry and the BPE before inclusion in national budgets and subsequent procurement.\n\nThe minister, who is also the Vice-Chairman of the National Council on Privatisation (NCP), said: \u201cAll these efforts are to ensure that PPP takes a center stage in the procurement of infrastructure in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAccording to her, the federal government is willing to discuss and incorporate suggestions from stakeholders with a view to strengthening Nigeria\u2019s PPP framework.\n\nShe stated that the webinar was an opportunity to hear from participants on the concerns and areas they want the government to address to make investment beneficial and deliver value to the country.\n\nShe solicited the support and cooperation of the public and private sectors partners, local and foreign partners, financial institutions and other important key stakeholders towards the successful implementation of the new PPP policy directive.\n\nShe added that the present administration is committed to the development of infrastructure through PPP arrangements.\n\nThe BPE Director-General, Mr. Alex Okoh, also said in line with its new role in the administration of concession programmes of the federal government, the bureau, in collaboration with the Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning had developed a PPP project information tool, which has been forwarded to all ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs), to capture all current and proposed infrastructure projects in the country.\n\n\u201cThis will help document a pipeline of PPP projects across various sectors of the economy,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that some MDAs have submitted their PPP Project Information Data ahead of the final submission date of May 31.\n\nAccording to him, the bureau will partner the United Kingdom Nigeria Infrastructure Advisory Facility (UKNIAF) to screen projects to ensure that only those that are financially as well as economically viable are included in the \u2018National Pipeline of PPP Projects\u2019.\n\nHe stated that the BPE will also establish a revolving Project Development Fund (PDF) for PPP transactions, while funds realised from the pool will be used to facilitate the proper structuring of PPP transactions.\n\nHe expressed hope that financial institutions will support the initiative to increase the number of viable projects that could be successfully brought to commercial and financial close in the infrastructure space through PPPs.\n\nEmefiele Urges Govs to Make States Economically Viable\n\nAlso yesterday, Emefiele called on governors to make their states economically viable in order to reduce their dependence on allocations from the Federation Account.\n\nEmefiele, at the inauguration of the Rivers State Cassava Processing Plant in Oyigbo Local Government Area of the state, also told reporters that there was no devaluation of the naira, contrary to speculations.\n\nHe, however, lamented that notwithstanding the country\u2019s position as the largest producer of cassava in the world, it spends over $580 million to import its by-products, adding that the country can no longer afford to support continued importation of items that can be produced locally.\n\nEmefiele said the CBN had set aside N1.5 billion for land clearing and urged the states, particularly those in the southern region, to take advantage of the facility to open up their respective economies.\n\nHe also advised the governors to woo private investors to help resuscitate their economies to generate employment through agriculture, adding that this will help the states boost internally generated revenue.\n\nWhile commending the Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, for the cassava project, he encouraged other governors to emulate the gesture to empower the citizens.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe seize this opportunity to encourage our states, particularly the southern states, that there are facilities available for you to draw to involve in land clearing.\n\n\u201cAt least, N1.5 billion is available for land clearing. It may seem small but it\u2019s a seed that we can start with.\n\n\u201cWe need to see to how we can open up our states for the good of our people and also for the economic viability of out states.\n\n\u201cPlease, help to make your states economically viable so you can depend less on revenues from FAAC so that you can grow your economy.\n\n\u201cYou can encourage private sector who need these processed materials for their final produce.\u201d\n\nOn the rumoured devaluation of the naira, he said: \u201cNaira was not devalued, it\u2019s just the handiwork of mischief-makers.\n\n\u201cPeople just go about, do your business. Naira was not devalued, we will continue to do our business and Nigeria will continue to prosper.\u201d\n\nHowever, Emefiele stated that the cassava project is designed to support improved production and processing of the commodity into high-quality flour.\n\nAccording to him, such investments could help drive economic growth, reduce unemployment as well as induce other wealth-creating activities in the state.\n\nHe added that it also helps support the CBN\u2019s mandate of promoting economic growth for the country.\n\nThe CBN governor expressed delight that the project would improve livelihoods, as well as enhance the sustainability of farming for over 3,000 farmers by guaranteeing the offtake of their farm produce.\n\nHe said this guaranteed off-take would encourage participating farmers to improve their output per hectare in order to earn additional income.\n\nHe also said the project provided them with a verifiable platform to access finance from the CBN and other financial institutions through the Anchor Borrowers Programme (ABP) among other benefits.\n\nHe said with the ability to process over 45,000 tonnes of cassava, the facility would provide high-quality cassava flour for households, industries and bakeries.\n\nEmefiele added that about N7.43 billion had been accessed by four out of the six states in the South-south region to open up more land for cultivation, create access roads to agricultural lands and provide infrastructure among other support services in the region.\n\nAccording to him, these measures are helping to induce greater activity in the agricultural sector and are enabling the movement of goods from farm to factories, and to the markets.\n\nEmefiele said the current situation had made it imperative for the central bank to work towards supporting programmes to enable greater cultivation and processing of key agricultural commodities.\n\nHe said so far, the apex bank\u2019s developmental finance initiatives had been focused on creating an enabling environment to drive both public and private sectors\u2019 participation in the real sector with strategic deliverables around price stability, job creation, financial inclusion, import substitution and accretion to foreign reserves, among others.\n\nHe added that the bank\u2019s interventions seek to improve access to credit for households and businesses, which will enhance productivity and create value across a wide range of economic activities.\n\nEmefiele said so far, the Rivers State Government had accessed over N13 billion from the CBN\u2019s various intervention programmes.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs I said earlier, we have given them over N10 billion which have been fully repaid. And anytime they ask for money because he (Wike) is a very good debtor, we will always give them the facility.\n\n\u201cYou heard him say that around May next year, even a year before he hands over, that he would have no debt. So he can come and take the money and pay back next year.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Alhaji Sabo Nanono, said the country must strive to grow its food despite the current security challenges facing it.\n\n\u201cObviously, we cannot succumb to our security challenges, we have to eat, we have to farm whether there is security or not and that is absolutely necessary.\n\n\u201cThe security matter is not affecting agriculture alone but the entire country, and I think in spite of all the security issues people have been raising, agriculture has been growing in this country even last year.\n\nThis season\u2019s dry farming will multiply what we have done last year,\u201d Nanono told reporters.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",
          "summary": "Besides, Emefiele, at another forum yesterday, also called on governors to make their states economically viable in order to reduce their dependence on allocations from the Federation Account.\n\u201cIf we take into account Nigeria\u2019s Infrastructure Masterplan, we require close to N35 trillion worth of investment in order to attain double-digit growth.\n\u201cThis will help document a pipeline of PPP projects across various sectors of the economy,\u201d he said.\nHe added that some MDAs have submitted their PPP Project Information Data ahead of the final submission date of May 31.\nEmefiele Urges Govs to Make States Economically ViableAlso yesterday, Emefiele called on governors to make their states economically viable in order to reduce their dependence on allocations from the Federation Account.",

          "text": "Investigations have revealed that Uduak Frank, the rapist and killer of Akwa Ibom job seeker, Iniubong Umoren had criminal cases to answer for before the latest saga.\n\nA report by The NEXT EDITION disclosed that the Akwa Ibom State Police Command has not only compromised the investigation into the assault, rape and murder of the job seeker, Umoren, but also disgracefully colluded with the criminal to conceal many parts of the crime.\n\nRight from when the elder sister of the deceased, Ifiok, reported that Umoren, who had gone for a job interview along the Airport Road, Uyo, was in distress, the police did not take quick action to save her.\n\nThe report was made at the Itam Divisional Police station on April 29, less than 25 minutes after Umoren made a distress call to her friend.\n\nRather than rush to where she was heard yelling, \u201cJesus ooo. Jesus ooo,\u201d in a highly disturbing call to her friend, the police simply asked the distressed sister to go home and wait.\n\nBased on reports, the police said they could not do anything because it was not up to 24 hours after Umoren went missing.\n\nIt was, however, not true that she was missing. In fact, Ifiok, the elder sister and a bosom friend in Lagos, Uduak Umo, knew who invited Umoren for a job interview and the rough idea of the address of the interview.\n\nIt is also true that the operatives at the Itam Police Station were told where the late Umoren had gone for an interview and who the supposed interviewer was, but they declined an offer to help the victim.\n\nFurther investigations showed the police only moved into action about 24 hours after the information they refused to act upon was shared and it was trending on social media.\n\nMany believe that Umoren could have been rescued alive if the police had swung into action and raided the fake interview compound immediately a report was made.\n\nBesides failing to act promptly to save the life of the late Umoren, the report also shows that the command has dished out many lies to cover up the activities of what appears to be a dangerous murder ring in Uyo.\n\nDuring weeks of enquiries, it was found that the self-confessed rapist and murderer, Uduak Frank, was not working alone contrary to claims by the state Police Commissioner, Andrew Amiengheme.\n\nMr. Amiengheme had said on a live interview programme on Arise News and while addressing reporters in Uyo that the police had not found any accomplice to the crime.\n\nBut the investigation by The NEXT EDITION showed that it was Emem Emmanuel, who first reached out to the late Miss Umoren and offered to help her get a job, a fact the police are aware of.\n\nThe deceased, who made best grades in the Department of Philosophy, University of Uyo, had made a post on social media requesting for a job while waiting to be called up for the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) scheme.\n\nNot long after she made the post, Emmanuel reached out to her through the social media platform, Twitter.\n\nAfter asking whether the late Umoren was still available for a job and she responded in the affirmative, he offered to link her with his boss whom he claimed was looking for a secretary.\n\nA top security source revealed to The NEXT EDITION that Emmanuel is suspected to be a front for a deadly murder gang in Uyo.\n\nInvestigation by the newspaper has also shown that it was Emmanuel who sent Akpan\u2019s phone number to Umoren.\n\nThe alleged accomplice, Emmanuel, is the son of a prominent pastor of The Apostolic Church in Akwa Ibom State.\n\nFor reasons best known to Amiengheme, the name of Emmanuel, a key suspect and member of the fake recruitment ring who personally lured Umoren to her death, has not been referenced at any event.\n\nThis happens even as the suspect has been held in custody for weeks alongside Uduak Akpan and his father at the state headquarters, Ikot Akpan Abia.\n\nBoth the fathers of Akpan and the suspected accomplice were arrested on April 30 hours before the culprit turned himself in following assurances that he would not be hurt by the police.\n\nThis shows that the three persons were arrested on April 30 but at different times.\n\nCuriously, neither Amiengheme nor the Police Public Relations Officer, Idiko MacDon, has said anything about Emmanuel and why he has been held in custody during their various encounters with journalists.\n\nFor instance, MacDon did not say anything about an accomplice in a statement he issued on the arrest of Uduak Akpan on May 1.\n\nMr. Emmanuel was not paraded on May 14, when Uduak Akpan and his father were paraded.\n\nBut the newspaper noted that Emmanuel has been in police custody from April 30 and the Akwa Ibom State Police command can only deny it to its corporate shame.\n\nNot long after the search for her went viral on social media, Emmanuel quickly deleted his conversation with late Umoren. He also brought down both his Facebook and Twitter accounts when social media users started attacking him for his role in the jobseeker\u2019s travails.\n\nUnable to take the hit, Emmanuel used his shadow Facebook account to make a post denying ever contacting or having a conversation with his victim, the late Umoren.\n\nHis surrogate boss, Uduak Akpan, also disabled his Facebook and Twitter accounts but later used one of his shadow accounts to admit he contacted the late Miss Umoren.\n\nHe, however, dropped the number of the job seeker whom he had raped and murdered at the time, insisting that she never made it to his location.\n\nBoth accomplices disappeared into thin air shortly after making their respective posts while the search for the late Miss Umoren on social media became the top trending topic.\n\nThe circumstances that led to the arrest of Uduak Akpan have been a subject of controversy.\n\nThere are contradictory accounts by Uduak Akpan\u2019s father, his cousin, Kufre Effiong, the police and the chairman of Uruan Local Government Area, Iniobong Ekpenyong.\n\nIn any case, on Friday, May 21, it was discovered that Pastor Emmanuel, a politically-exposed minister of The Apostolic Church, Uyo Field, went to the police headquarters to take his child, Emem, on bail.\n\nHe was said to have obtained a note from the office of the Akwa Ibom State Director of Public Prosecution (DPP) authorising the release of the suspect.\n\nThe move was, however, halted when concerned Nigerians drew the attention of Miss Umoren\u2019s family members and they rallied people to the state police headquarters to stop the move.\n\nMr Amiengheme, while speaking with journalists on May 14, maintained that there were no shallow graves in the compound where Umoren was murdered, but an investigation by The NEXT EDITION has shown otherwise.\n\nIn fact, multiple sources and locals who spoke with one of the newspaper's correspondents who visited the crime scene confirmed that indeed, many more corpses were exhumed in the compound by persons suspected to be police officers.\n\nA resident of the community who took the correspondent around the crime scene said a few days after the police came to exhume Miss Umoren\u2019s body, another set of persons who behaved like security operatives stormed the compound and exhumed seven more corpses.\n\n\u201cAfter the corpses were exhumed, the whole of this neighbourhood was oozing with this strong putrid odour and it was difficult to pass here,\u201d a local youth who would not give his name because of safety concerns said.\n\nThe youth who spoke Ibibio continued, \u201cHe had buried so many people in this compound. Do you see this place, there was a corpse here. In that place you see there, there was a corpse. It seemed he cut people into pieces and buried them in a sack.\n\n\u201cMany of the trees he planted here were spots he buried people and if they dig around the compound, many corpses will be found.

          "text": "Investigations have revealed that Uduak Frank, the rapist and killer of Akwa Ibom job seeker, Iniubong Umoren had criminal cases to answer for before the latest saga.\n\nA report by The NEXT EDITION disclosed that the Akwa Ibom State Police Command has not only compromised the investigation into the assault, rape and murder of the job seeker, Umoren, but also disgracefully colluded with the criminal to conceal many parts of the crime.\n\nRight from when the elder sister of the deceased, Ifiok, reported that Umoren, who had gone for a job interview along the Airport Road, Uyo, was in distress, the police did not take quick action to save her.\n\nThe report was made at the Itam Divisional Police station on April 29, less than 25 minutes after Umoren made a distress call to her friend.\n\nRather than rush to where she was heard yelling, \u201cJesus ooo. Jesus ooo,\u201d in a highly disturbing call to her friend, the police simply asked the distressed sister to go home and wait.\n\nBased on reports, the police said they could not do anything because it was not up to 24 hours after Umoren went missing.\n\nIt was, however, not true that she was missing. In fact, Ifiok, the elder sister and a bosom friend in Lagos, Uduak Umo, knew who invited Umoren for a job interview and the rough idea of the address of the interview.\n\nIt is also true that the operatives at the Itam Police Station were told where the late Umoren had gone for an interview and who the supposed interviewer was, but they declined an offer to help the victim.\n\nFurther investigations showed the police only moved into action about 24 hours after the information they refused to act upon was shared and it was trending on social media.\n\nMany believe that Umoren could have been rescued alive if the police had swung into action and raided the fake interview compound immediately a report was made.\n\nBesides failing to act promptly to save the life of the late Umoren, the report also shows that the command has dished out many lies to cover up the activities of what appears to be a dangerous murder ring in Uyo.\n\nDuring weeks of enquiries, it was found that the self-confessed rapist and murderer, Uduak Frank, was not working alone contrary to claims by the state Police Commissioner, Andrew Amiengheme.\n\nMr. Amiengheme had said on a live interview programme on Arise News and while addressing reporters in Uyo that the police had not found any accomplice to the crime.\n\nBut the investigation by The NEXT EDITION showed that it was Emem Emmanuel, who first reached out to the late Miss Umoren and offered to help her get a job, a fact the police are aware of.\n\nThe deceased, who made best grades in the Department of Philosophy, University of Uyo, had made a post on social media requesting for a job while waiting to be called up for the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) scheme.\n\nNot long after she made the post, Emmanuel reached out to her through the social media platform, Twitter.\n\nAfter asking whether the late Umoren was still available for a job and she responded in the affirmative, he offered to link her with his boss whom he claimed was looking for a secretary.\n\nA top security source revealed to The NEXT EDITION that Emmanuel is suspected to be a front for a deadly murder gang in Uyo.\n\nInvestigation by the newspaper has also shown that it was Emmanuel who sent Akpan\u2019s phone number to Umoren.\n\nThe alleged accomplice, Emmanuel, is the son of a prominent pastor of The Apostolic Church in Akwa Ibom State.\n\nFor reasons best known to Amiengheme, the name of Emmanuel, a key suspect and member of the fake recruitment ring who personally lured Umoren to her death, has not been referenced at any event.\n\nThis happens even as the suspect has been held in custody for weeks alongside Uduak Akpan and his father at the state headquarters, Ikot Akpan Abia.\n\nBoth the fathers of Akpan and the suspected accomplice were arrested on April 30 hours before the culprit turned himself in following assurances that he would not be hurt by the police.\n\nThis shows that the three persons were arrested on April 30 but at different times.\n\nCuriously, neither Amiengheme nor the Police Public Relations Officer, Idiko MacDon, has said anything about Emmanuel and why he has been held in custody during their various encounters with journalists.\n\nFor instance, MacDon did not say anything about an accomplice in a statement he issued on the arrest of Uduak Akpan on May 1.\n\nMr. Emmanuel was not paraded on May 14, when Uduak Akpan and his father were paraded.\n\nBut the newspaper noted that Emmanuel has been in police custody from April 30 and the Akwa Ibom State Police command can only deny it to its corporate shame.\n\nNot long after the search for her went viral on social media, Emmanuel quickly deleted his conversation with late Umoren. He also brought down both his Facebook and Twitter accounts when social media users started attacking him for his role in the jobseeker\u2019s travails.\n\nUnable to take the hit, Emmanuel used his shadow Facebook account to make a post denying ever contacting or having a conversation with his victim, the late Umoren.\n\nHis surrogate boss, Uduak Akpan, also disabled his Facebook and Twitter accounts but later used one of his shadow accounts to admit he contacted the late Miss Umoren.\n\nHe, however, dropped the number of the job seeker whom he had raped and murdered at the time, insisting that she never made it to his location.\n\nBoth accomplices disappeared into thin air shortly after making their respective posts while the search for the late Miss Umoren on social media became the top trending topic.\n\nThe circumstances that led to the arrest of Uduak Akpan have been a subject of controversy.\n\nThere are contradictory accounts by Uduak Akpan\u2019s father, his cousin, Kufre Effiong, the police and the chairman of Uruan Local Government Area, Iniobong Ekpenyong.\n\nIn any case, on Friday, May 21, it was discovered that Pastor Emmanuel, a politically-exposed minister of The Apostolic Church, Uyo Field, went to the police headquarters to take his child, Emem, on bail.\n\nHe was said to have obtained a note from the office of the Akwa Ibom State Director of Public Prosecution (DPP) authorising the release of the suspect.\n\nThe move was, however, halted when concerned Nigerians drew the attention of Miss Umoren\u2019s family members and they rallied people to the state police headquarters to stop the move.\n\nMr Amiengheme, while speaking with journalists on May 14, maintained that there were no shallow graves in the compound where Umoren was murdered, but an investigation by The NEXT EDITION has shown otherwise.\n\nIn fact, multiple sources and locals who spoke with one of the newspaper's correspondents who visited the crime scene confirmed that indeed, many more corpses were exhumed in the compound by persons suspected to be police officers.\n\nA resident of the community who took the correspondent around the crime scene said a few days after the police came to exhume Miss Umoren\u2019s body, another set of persons who behaved like security operatives stormed the compound and exhumed seven more corpses.\n\n\u201cAfter the corpses were exhumed, the whole of this neighbourhood was oozing with this strong putrid odour and it was difficult to pass here,\u201d a local youth who would not give his name because of safety concerns said.\n\nThe youth who spoke Ibibio continued, \u201cHe had buried so many people in this compound. Do you see this place, there was a corpse here. In that place you see there, there was a corpse. It seemed he cut people into pieces and buried them in a sack.\n\n\u201cMany of the trees he planted here were spots he buried people and if they dig around the compound, many corpses will be found. All these spots you see are places where they exhumed decayed corpses. You can perceive the stench wherever you find a hole here.\n\n\u201cThere are places we found human bones and they were so many of them. Look at this human bone here. People came in here and picked some of the bones and dried human flesh.\n\n\u201cThese bags you find all over the place are what he used in burying people. He cut the parts he needed and dumped the remaining body parts in the bags and buried them.\"\n\nA woman from the neighbourhood said early in the year, a lady climbed the fence of the compound and ran naked to their home at midnight.\n\n\u201cOne night, a lady scaled the fence and ran naked into our compound and we hid her till the next day.

          "title": "Nokia X20 Review \u2013 Dualsight Camera, 2-day battery life, and more",
          "text": "The Nokia X20 is your chance to use a high end smartphone with many features that are likely to help with your content creation, gaming, and overall selfie experience.\n\nEarly in April, HMD Global announced the launch of six new Nokia Android smartphones. I got my hands on one of the phones in the X Series and explored some of its features.\n\nIts major selling points include 3 years worth of Android updates from Nokia, cinema mode and dualsight camera, 2-day battery life and a large screen that allows you to watch virtually anything in full HD+.\n\nSo let\u2019s get into it.\n\nWhat\u2019s in the box?\n\nThe front of the box is branded with Nokia\u2019s logo and a photo of the phone. The phone is available in both Midnight Sky and Nordic Blue.\n\nThe Nokia X20 retails for about $480.\n\nOn the box, there\u2019s also a circle that tells you that you\u2019ll be getting 3 years of Android updates but that\u2019s for a different section of this review.\n\nFinally, inside the box we have the following:\n\nThe Nokia X20 : I mean, it would be extremely awkward if this was not in there.\n\n: I mean, it would be extremely awkward if this was not in there. USB-C Cable: It\u2019s helpful to note that there is no wall charger.\n\nIn a world that is currently piling up more and more e-waste, the makers of Nokia figured everyone already had some type of wall charger in their homes so they decided to not include them in the packaging.\n\nI for one know that I have enough standalone wall chargers as is so this was actually a welcome development.\n\nCompostable case: Remember what I said about avoiding e-waste, well they also added a biodegradable phone case that shouldn\u2019t be a menace to the environment if you were ever to throw it out.\n\nSim Slot Pin : personally I would really love it if more phone manufacturers imitate the Sony Xperia 1ii \u2013 which allows you eject your sim slot without a need for a very easily misplaced pin.\n\n: personally I would really love it if more phone manufacturers imitate the Sony Xperia 1ii \u2013 which allows you eject your sim slot without a need for a very easily misplaced pin. There are the warranty papers but that\u2019s not what you\u2019re here for is it? Thought as much. Onward!\n\nThe Look, The Feel, The Heft\n\nI will start by saying the Nokia X20 is a large phone. With a 6.67-inch screen, it is quite hard to operate it entirely with one hand \u2013 I couldn\u2019t reach the top left corner with my thumb when I held it in my right hand.\n\nThe back of the phone is Nordic Blue and has four cameras (main \u2013 64MP, ultra-wide \u2013 5MP, macro \u2013 2MP, depth \u2013 2MP) surrounding the ZEISS logo that most Nokia users have come to know and expect on Nokia phones.\n\nOn the left, we have the sim slot which allows for two sims but if you only need one sim, you can also put a MicroSD card in the space created for the second sim.\n\nThere\u2019s a dedicated button for the Google Assistant on the left of the phone as well. I think this button is overkill mostly because on the phone you have two other ways of accessing Google Assistant \u2013 you can click the actual Google Assistant app or you can swipe up from the bottom right corner. Thankfully this button can be deactivated in your settings.\n\nLeft showing sim slot and Google Assistant button\n\nOn the right side of the phone, there are volume control buttons. There\u2019s also the fingerprint sensor (which is also the power button).\n\nOn the bottom of the phone, we have our old friend the 3.5mm headphone jack \u2013 it feels like more phones are leaving this guy out. We also have the USB-C port and mono speakers.\n\nAnd finally, the screen. The first thing I notice is the pre-applied screen protector \u2013 good looking out, Nokia.\n\nThe screen has thick bezels and the manufacturers went for a hole punch (with a 32MP camera) instead of a notch. I\u2019m yet to decide which of those I prefer.\n\nAt the bottom of the screen, we have some extra Nokia branding \u2013 just in case you forgot you were holding a Nokia phone.\n\nThe phone feels a bit heavy but not so much that it grows uncomfortable. I put the compostable case on almost immediately because I like my phones protected at all times.\n\nCan we turn it on now?\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nWhen you press the power button the screen goes white and you see the \u201cAndroidOne\u201d logo. The startup time is slow so you see that logo for a couple of seconds. By my count, I would say about 14 seconds of waiting before you hear the oh so familiar Nokia starting tune.\n\nAfter that, the phone is on and you can set up your fingerprint AND face recognition. Both of them are quite responsive and don\u2019t take long before your phone is unlocked.\n\nX20 showing volume controls and fingerprint sensor\n\nWhat\u2019s under the hood?\n\nThe Nokia X20 is running Android 11, the latest version of the Android OS.\n\nRemember how I mentioned the 3 years worth of Android updates? Well, users of this phone do not need to worry about software or security updates for the next 3 years. This is probably one of its biggest selling points.\n\nThe phone comes with 128GB of storage but this is expandable (up to half a terabyte) through the MicroSD card slot I mentioned earlier. It also has 8GB of RAM.\n\nChipset for this gigantic phone? Qualcomm Snapdragon 480. The phone also allows 5G. I guess we\u2019ll be patiently waiting till we get that now, won\u2019t we?\n\nChipsets usually determine how fast your phone works and while the Snapdragon 720g (which can be found on other phones in this price range) has better CPU performance, the 480 uses less battery life.\n\nThe phone\u2019s 60Htz screen and Snapdragon 480 chipset allow it not to use too much of its 4470 mAh battery (with 18W fast charging), thereby allowing you to use it for up to 2 days.\n\n2-day battery life? For real?\n\nImmediately I saw it on the box I knew it was something I had to check out so as soon as I got the phone out, I charged it fully \u2013 this was on Monday night.\n\nI downloaded a few apps and just went to town \u2013 mostly watching Netflix and playing some Call of Duty.\n\nI didn\u2019t need to charge the phone till about Thursday night and even then the phone still had some juice.\n\nSo if you don\u2019t use your phone for much more than texting and calling, you can very easily get more than 2 days out of it.\n\nFor you gamers and perpetual video watchers, you\u2019ll probably get a full day\u2019s use without frantically searching for your USB-C cable.\n\nDisplay, Audio and Camera\n\nThe Nokia X20\u2019s 6.67-inch screen\u2019s resolution is 1080 x 2400 and it\u2019s also full HD+. What this means is that you can very comfortably watch your favourite videos on YouTube or Netflix in great quality.\n\nThe phone\u2019s sound comes from a mono speaker that is admittedly quite loud. However, because it\u2019s not a stereo speaker, your audio experience can be a little one-sided when you use it but it shouldn\u2019t affect your listening experience too much.\n\nI did find something peculiar with the videos I shot on the phone\u2019s camera. At full volume, I struggled to hear my voice in these videos. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the phone\u2019s microphone or something else but it\u2019s definitely not great to record videos and barely have enough audio coming from them.\n\nNow that we are at the cameras, I will post two images I took in the different modes below. You tell me what you think.\n\nPortrait selfie mode\n\nMain selfie mode\n\nTwo standouts for me are both video modes on the X20 \u2013 dual sight and cinema\n\nDualsight: This feature allows you to record a video with both your front and back camera at the same time. I find that this will be extremely useful for vloggers who want to be able to capture an event and their reactions to the event at the same time.\n\nStill from dualsight video\n\nCinema mode: This feature can only be used in landscape mode and basically allows you to turn yourself into an amateur filmmaker with access to settings and filters that help give your video a cinematic feel.\n\nStill from video shot in cinema mode with filter\n\nThe phone delivers on many promises but could do better with some of the things I pointed out. Overall, if you\u2019re looking for a phone with a large screen, interesting camera features, Android updates till Android 14, and long battery life, this is definitely a phone for you.\n\nUntil our next review.",

In some countries, these attacks come at a very high cost.\n\nThis reduces the level of trust people have in the internet or systems that use the internet. For instance, when it comes to savings, some people prefer not to save their money in traditional banks; and trusting their savings with a fintech company would probably be their last option.\n\nAnd that\u2019s only one example\u2013 there\u2019s a lot of customer data scattered across other tech-enabled services. Losing your money is perhaps the least harmful way cyber fraud can harm you.\n\nFirstly, your data could be used to carry out illegal activities which could put you in even more trouble. Secondly, your company\u2019s trade secrets or other sensitive business data could be leaked to the public. You could lose your good reputation in a blink.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of work to be done to improve cybersecurity measures, and the work of improving these measures isn\u2019t the sole responsibility of tech companies. In our present digital age, traditional sectors like oil and gas need new and more effective ways to protect their customers from cyber fraud, too.\n\nAn estimated $103.1bn was spent on security-related software, hardware and services in 2019 and this spending is expected to increase to $133.8bn by 2022. However, improving cybersecurity measures will not only involve spending more on security but also making it a part of the company culture. Every employee should have a role to play in keeping the organization safe.\n\nTomorrow at 11 am on TechCabal Live, we will be discussing with Adeoluwa, Daniel, Joseph, Sophina and Nick about some of the best practices they\u2019ve picked up in the course of their careers.\n\nRegister here to join the event.\n\nAdeoluwa is a skilled Information Security Professional. He has built a career spanning about 20 years in the field and has honed his expertise in some of the world\u2019s leading organizations, including Barclays, Brown Shipley and the British Council.\n\nDaniel is the co-founder and Chief Technology Officer at Evolve Credit, a loan and financial products marketplace. He is responsible for building the backend infrastructure, driving product roadmap, leading the technical team and driving company strategy.\n\nOver the past year, Joseph led the United Capital Group of companies to transition to a 100% remote work structure due to the COVID limitation while improving services and automation, leading to a 61% growth in revenue for the year ended 2020, with customers transacting seamlessly and securely.\n\nSophina is a cybersecurity professional currently working with a leading financial services firm. She has in previous years worked on providing digital and holistic security support to various marginalized communities and NGOs across Nigeria and Africa at large. She also collaborated on creating digital security guides to such organisations and communities to stay safe.\n\nNick Maxwell is a cybersecurity and networking industry professional with a passion for learning, working and creating a better understanding of the concerns and needs of clients and partners, across several regions in a variety of verticals. He has over 13 years experience in the technology industry and has worked for multinational, leading technology companies.\n\nAttendees will be able to ask the speakers questions in an interactive session.\n\nRegister here to join the event.",

          "title": "GovTech In Nigeria: From Regulatory Maze to Models of Good Practice",
          "text": "Nigerian public procurement and regulation can be labyrinthine, but recent policy reforms and the model of good practice provided by Kaduna State hint at opportunities for public-purpose innovation to flourish in the country. The result could be more accountable and effective governance institutions.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic found Nigeria\u2019s health system largely unprepared. When the Federal Government first announced a lockdown in March 2020, the country only had 6 testing centres. With a population of 200 million across 36 states, it needed to expand its ability to test quickly. One of the government\u2019s readiest supporters in this situation, the genomics research startup 54gene, had only been on the scene for a year. 54gene studies the African genome in order to personalise medication for Africans. It put these research capabilities to use establishing its DNA biobank lab as Nigeria\u2019s first accredited private testing centre and\u2013strikingly\u2013converting shipping containers into mobile testing laboratories, helping to augment testing capacity.\n\n\n\n54gene is one of many high-quality startups driving large investments into the Nigerian ecosystem and earning its position alongside Kenya, South Africa and Egypt as Africa\u2019s top four VC funding destinations\u2013Africa\u2019s \u201cbig four\u201d. The government partnered with 54gene out of necessity, but broader gains await should it systematically seek out such partnerships as a means to achieving its service delivery and administrative rationalisation goals. Its capacity to deliver on plans to digitise all government operations is questionable\u2013the 2020 UN e-government survey revealed that Nigeria\u2019s online service quality declined from already low levels in 20181. Accountable and well-managed partnerships with innovative startups can tip the scales in its favour, here and in other areas: improving education, promoting sustainable forms of energy and tackling healthcare challenges from both the most served verticals and some of the most pressing governance challenges.\n\n1 According to the UN e-government survey, Nigeria\u2019s online service index declined from 0.5278 in 2018 to 0.5176 in 2020. Scores range from 0 (worst) to 1 (best).\n\n\n\nPolicy progress?\n\nThe Federal Government looks to be aware of this opportunity. Its recently released National Digital Innovation and Entrepreneurship Policy aims to prioritise the use of tools developed by Nigerian startups to automate public processes and services, including modifying the Procurement Act to better allow for the procurement of innovation. It has also mandated Nigerian companies with large public sector IT contracts to engage Nigerian startups as R&D partners on the projects. Ideally, a more immediate intervention to consider is introducing the Nigeria Sustainable Development Goals Fintech Hackathon. In its first iteration, the hackathon will allow FinTech startups with innovative approaches to agricultural credit schemes, cash transfers to the financially vulnerable and clean energy to partner with relevant public sector bodies.\n\nThese are all steps that, on their surface, should enable more startups to work with it. However, to truly capitalise on potential gains, the government must focus on unravelling deep-seated behavioural barriers to access. The strength of these biases\u2013such as a preference for partnering with large, established companies and a tendency for harsh regulation of innovation\u2013will determine how well the above-mentioned initiatives play out.\n\nLabyrinths of Procurement and Regulation\n\nThere is plenty of evidence of these biases\u2019 detrimental impact on the potential for partnerships. When the Nigeria Railway Commission (NRC) started the train line between Kaduna State and the Federal Capital Territory, a payments startup called Payant Technologies sent in an unsolicited proposal to handle the digital booking and payments infrastructure. They didn\u2019t receive a response.\n\nUndeterred, Payant sent another in when the official request for Expressions Of Interest came out, but this also went unanswered. Why? The NRC was, according to its eligibility criteria, only looking for companies with an annual turnover of a billion naira ($2.4 million) or more, something only a few startups in Nigeria have. Preferring to work with large firms does more than stymie startup growth. It could lead to vendor lock-in and eventually, bilateral dependence between government and supplier. Both do not bode well for the quality of services rendered.\n\nHarsh regulatory policies also deter local and global partnerships. Like US-headquartered 54gene, many of Nigeria\u2019s best startups have chosen to incorporate outside the country. When one defines startup location as a place of incorporation, Nigeria falls out of the top four African VC funding locations\u2013the most adversely impacted country.\n\nThis year alone, government actors have stopped banks from processing transactions associated with cryptocurrency exchanges and issued a cease and desist to investment startups offering access to foreign securities. Both actions have negatively impacted startups working in those spaces. More importantly, they may signal an unwillingness to cooperate that will put off startups serving the government market.\n\nAso Villa Demo Day \u2013 Enterprise 54\n\nFor Inspiration, Look Local\n\nMitigating these and other negative behaviours will be hard work. But the Federal Government need not look far for inspiration; it can take a page out of the Kaduna State Government (KDSG)\u2019s Govtech playbook. Govtech developments in Kaduna have unfolded as part of a broader governance reform programme; reform has itself been driven by the capable leadership of seasoned public servant Nasir El-Rufai. Elected for a second term in 2019, perhaps the most important quality Governor El-Rufai brings to the table is a capacity for making unpopular but ultimately effective decisions. He previously displayed this capacity as Minister of the Federal Capital Territory from 2003 to 2007; in the face of limited resources, he downsized the civil service, an action he is repeating in Kaduna.\n\nBuoyed by experienced leadership, KDSG is blazing the trail for both digital government interventions and partnering with startups and SMEs. Its globally recognised Eyes and Ears budget monitoring program enables citizens, via a mobile app, to provide feedback on public infrastructure projects. It worked with Yellow Line Services, a Kaduna-based IT company, to facilitate electronic voting during its 2018 local government elections, Nigeria\u2019s first and Africa\u2019s second electronic voting exercise. It has recently signed a deal with drone-delivery unicorn Zipline to deliver Covid vaccines and other on-demand medications. According to the World Bank\u2019s latest subnational Doing Business ratings, Kaduna is the most accessible state to register property and get contracts enforced in Nigeria. Kaduna\u2019s example is an exciting preview of what could be should the Federal Government follow through on a promising start.\n\nWritten by Tolu Segun, Fellow at StateUp.\n\nStateUp is a leading provider of public-purpose technology intelligence. We aim to bridge the gap between the worlds of government and technology through specialist, multi-disciplinary advisory, training, and information services focused on digital innovation that serves a public purpose.",

          "title": "How GOtv Nigeria Built the Widest Coverage in Nigeria with Investments in Local Infrastructure",
          "text": "Nationwide digital terrestrial television operator GOtv has greatly contributed to Nigeria\u2019s digital migration through eye-watering infrastructure investment.\n\nMore often than not, what comes to mind when people think of digital pay-television is its expensive nature. To a great extent, GOtv has changed that notion in Nigeria, where it brings family entertainment and information to millions of homes at ridiculously pocket-friendly prices, essentially becoming a lifestyle choice and transforming the national pay-TV landscape.\n\nGOtv Nigeria is not only affordable, but also widely available. Presently, Nigerians can access the service in over 50 cities across 26 states, which makes it by far the widest nationwide digital terrestrial television (DTT) network coverage, despite not being the first operator to launch in the country.\n\nAchieving this is no mean feat, especially when one considers the challenge of Nigeria\u2019s notoriously acute infrastructural deficit which by itself is enough to discourage any potential investor. But GOtv, launched by Details Nigeria in October 2011, has shown confidence in the local broadcast industry. That is demonstrable in the fact that in a decade, it has spent well over $100 million/N48 billion on investments in broadcast technology and infrastructure in the country, which oustrips those of licensed signal carriers and has significantly contributed to the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nGOtv has been the foremost figure in pushing Nigeria\u2019s drive towards migration from analog to digital transmission after the government joined a host of other countries in signing up to the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) agreement of 2006. The company has since worked closely with the government and the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) in providing affordable digital television for everyone through unmatched investments in modern broadcast infrastructure.\n\nIn line with Nigeria\u2019s aspirations to get on the digital broadcasting train, GOtv at inception rolled out the DVB-T2 decoder, a second-generation technology platform approved by the ITU as the standard for digital television broadcasting. The DVB-T2 technology allows for up to 20 channels per frequency, compared to DVB-T1 technology, an outdated system that only allows for 12 channels per frequency and was widely used by first movers in the digital migration. It also delivers a vastly superior digital audio-visual quality, a higher number of channels, access to Free-to-Air after subscription expiry, and prevents signal depreciation in adverse weather conditions.\n\nSo with the launch of GOtv came a dramatic improvement on the dividend of terrestrial frequencies available to Nigeria when DVB-T2 was deployed. The company was the first Nigerian DTT provider to offer its service on the modern technology, which is one of the most advanced broadcast systems and infrastructure established in Africa and globally. For Nigerians, it meant access to a premium digital audio-visual quality and enhanced viewing experience at extremely cheap rates. And for Nigeria, that effectively put the country at the forefront of technology on the global digitalisation map.\n\nOver the years, GOtv has continued to invest heavily in the latest technology in digital television, especially on its transmission technology, which it has consistently improved upon. Notable among investments made in infrastructure was the building of 73 transmitter sites between 2011 and 2015 at a cost of $95.5 million, to provide DTT coverage for over 50 percent of Nigeria\u2019s population.\n\nAs the coverage increases, so does the need for similar significantly large investments to maintain the transmitter sites in peak condition for effective transmission. GOtv has not been shy to spend in that regard too. Between 2014 and 2018, more than N8 billion was expended on the maintenance of transmitter sites. In 2014 alone, N572.2 million was spent and the sum rose consecutively in the following years \u2013 to N1.39 billion in 2015; N1.9 billion in 2016; N2.033 billion in 2017; and N2.28 billion in 2018. It is vital to note that the huge sums invested in the provision and maintenance of broadcast infrastructure are exclusive of what was invested in bringing digital broadcasting to Nigeria.\n\nThese investments by GOtv in the local broadcast infrastructure and the expansion of its network coverage have come as the government-driven digital switchover programme (DSO) progresses in fits and starts. The country has missed several deadlines since the digitisation process took off in 2008, mainly because of inadequate funds. Meanwhile, the two signal carriers licensed by the government to spread DTT coverage across the country have not functioned optimally. Set up about five years ago, they have been unable to provide nationwide coverage due to lack of finance and technical capacity.\n\nThe sub-par infrastructure provided by the carriers has led to endless complaints by Nigerians in most states where the switchover programme has been launched. Among those who have bought the device recommended by the National Broadcasting Commision (NBC) as its digital transition vehicle, there have been issues such as partial or total lack of reception, which sometimes lasts for several months, as well as service availability limited to the state capitals.\n\nWhile the heavy investments by GOtv have been crucial in helping the company beat topographical hindrances that most DTT operators face and ensure subscriber access in several cities across the country, they rarely occur without a ripple effect on national development and the impact has been massive, in terms of improving lives and job creation.\n\nAt the heart of it all is a commitment to stimulate the national digitisation process, boost the government\u2019s efforts towards national socio-economic development and impact millions of lives, as GOtv puts pay-TV services at the disposal of as many households as possible that wish to migrate into the digital age.",
          "summary": "Nationwide digital terrestrial television operator GOtv has greatly contributed to Nigeria\u2019s digital migration through eye-watering infrastructure investment.\nBut GOtv, launched by Details Nigeria in October 2011, has shown confidence in the local broadcast industry.\nThe company has since worked closely with the government and the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) in providing affordable digital television for everyone through unmatched investments in modern broadcast infrastructure.\nOver the years, GOtv has continued to invest heavily in the latest technology in digital television, especially on its transmission technology, which it has consistently improved upon.\nThese investments by GOtv in the local broadcast infrastructure and the expansion of its network coverage have come as the government-driven digital switchover programme (DSO) progresses in fits and starts.",

          "text": "Lagos, Nigeria. 26th of May, 2021. \u2013 In the recently released Africa\u2019s Best Brands 2021, TECNO ranked for five consecutive years among the TOP 6 brands on the African continent, marking another prestigious recognition of the brand\u2019s leadership in Africa.\n\nEstablished in 2011, the Brand Africa 100: Africa\u2019s Best Brands rankings is the most authoritative survey and analysis on brands and underlying businesses in Africa, based on a study by Geopoll across 28 countries spanning all the five economic regions and analysis and ranking by Kantar and Brand Leadership. Collectively they account for over 80% of the population and over 80% of the GDP of Africa. The 2021 survey was conducted between March and April 2021 and yielded over 80,000 brand mentions and over 3,500 unique brands.\n\nSince its entry into the African market, TECNO\u2019s operations have been customer focused. Year in year out, they have ensured that their offerings are tailored to meet the needs of Africans.\n\nSpeaking to this at a virtual event organised by Brand Africa, Vincent Uzoegbu, Public Communications Manager, TECNO said; \u201cFrom the first day of our business, TECNO made a strategic decision to focus exclusively on Africa, and when we first entered Africa, our core strategy was to focus on sub-Saharan Africa, where mobile phone penetration was still very low and largely ignored by global mobile phone manufacturers. The aim was to bring a mobile phone that would suit African consumers and improve the lives of as many people in Africa as possible by bridging the digital gap through technology and innovation.\u201d\n\nTECNO has worked tirelessly all these years to do just that. With the brand\u2019s Phantom, Camon, Spark and Pova smartphone series, TECNO has been able to set numerous records that define its success and popularity on the continent, evident of its dogged resolve to present Africa with the best of technology and innovation. When TECNO launched dual SIM cards in Africa, there had been nothing of the kind before then. TECNO was also the first to develop long-lasting batteries that lasted 3 days to combat the epileptic power supply in places like Nigeria. The brand was also the first to bring camera solutions on their smartphones that suited the predominant African dark skin.\n\nAfter more than a decade of commitment and consistency, the rewards are finally falling in. Earlier in the year, Counterpoint Research ranked TECNO as Africa\u2019s number one smartphone brand in 2020, stating that TECNO made its breakthroughs in mobile photography technology and continued investment in the market throughout the pandemic despite a challenging year. And now, with Brand Africa\u2019s new rankings, TECNO has once again come out tops, becoming a leading player in mid to high-end mobile brand segments in Africa.\n\nAttai Oguche, Marketing Manager TECNO Nigeria said; \u201cWe\u2019re very honoured to be listed again amongst Africa\u2019s Best Brands ranking this year and to be part of the key contributors to the development of African business. Shouldering African consumers\u2019 trust and great support, we will keep the momentum to continuously unlock our best of contemporary products and technologies for consumers across Africa and inspire them to pursue a better life via mobile technology innovations.\u201d\n\nAbout TECNOTECNO Mobile is a smartphone brand from TRANSSION Holdings. With \u201cStop at Nothing\u201d as its brand essence, TECNO is committed to unlocking the best contemporary technologies for progressive individuals across global emerging markets, giving them elegantly designed products that inspires consumers to uncover a world of possibilities.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nNew licence requirements for Nigerian fintechs\n\nMay 26: New Episode!

          "text": "This post is a delayed version of Techpoint Digest, a week-daily newsletter that rounds up major happenings in African tech. You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you subscribe now\n\nGood day,\n\nOluwanifemi and Bolu here.\n\nToday we\u2019re discussing:\n\nWhat tech is doing for African kids\n\nCrypto withdrawal on PayPal\n\nFacebook\u2019s plan to hide Like counts\n\nTwitter Spaces available on web browsers with new features\n\nCelebrating Children\u2019s day\n\nIn Nigeria, Children\u2019s Day is observed every May 27. As to the \u2018why?\u2019 I believe it\u2019s a day when we are all reminded to celebrate and promote children\u2019s rights. Yearly, conversations are driven in specific directions to discuss action points for making the world a better place for children.\n\nTrivia: World\u2019s Children\u2019s day is celebrated yearly on November 20, while International Day of the African Child happens every June 16.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTalking of making the world a better place for kids, exposure to tech solutions makes way for the same advancement that has made life easier for everyone. In fact, edtech has become a huge part of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nWe did a compilation of a few: These 11 startups are preparing African kids for the future\n\nNot only for kids, here\u2019s a list of eight tech careers you can get into and how to get started.\n\nHowever, it appears it is becoming harder by the day to protect them from the evil that comes with it. While some media platforms have versions for kids, others have age limits.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the US government prevented Facebook from going ahead with releasing Instagram for Kids. During the pandemic, this came in handy, suggesting ways to protect kids since they had to spend more time online.\n\nCheck this out: We owe it to our kids to put an age limit on social media\n\nApart from the solutions provided by startups, some schools now run hybrid models where kids learn both in the classrooms and at home.\n\nDo you remember how Nigerian schools fared after the lockdowns?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn a different note, Ikorodu Bois, Emmanuella: meet the top 5 Nigerian kid influencers on social media. Interesting!\n\nPayPal\u2019s crypto withdrawal\n\nPayments giant PayPal will soon open up crypto withdrawals for its customers. The company\u2019s crypto lead, Fernandez da Ponte, revealed this at CoinDesk\u2019s crypto event Consensus 2021 on Wednesday, May 26, 2021.\n\nBecoming even more crypto-friendly: Currently, PayPal users cannot withdraw or send cryptocurrencies directly to friends and families. Only the fiat equivalent can be sent, which means customers have to sell their holdings. Now, da Ponte says PayPal wants to \u201cmake it as open as possible\u201d, allowing direct purchases and transfers in crypto.\n\nMore crypto users? PayPal\u2019s purported crypto tolerance could be a ploy to lure more crypto users to its platform. In an interview with the Time Magazine, the CEO, Dan Shulman, revealed that the demand for crypto is \u201cmultiple fold\u201d of initial expectations.\n\nMore crypto features coming? This might be the first of many crypto features on PayPal as the venture is seemingly profitable for the company.\n\nFacebook to hide Like count\n\nFacebook is giving users the option to hide the Like count on their posts. It announced this on Wednesday, May 26, 2021, on Facebook Newsroom. Instagram and Facebook users now have more control over their experience on the apps.\n\nFacebook has been testing this new feature since 2019. According to them, they wanted to see if hiding the count could take the pressure off people. Some found it useful, while others found it annoying.\n\nAn end to Like-chasing? Not quite. Users can decide if they want to see a Like count on others\u2019 posts, theirs by others, and which of their posts they want a like count on. This way, Facebook satisfies those who feel pressured by Likes and those who depend on Like counts \u2014 such as influencers \u2014 to use the app.\n\nAccording to Facebook, pressure caused by Like counts, made people focus less on content and more on content engagement.\n\nWhy does Facebook care? Per TechCrunch, the pressure from Like counts made people opt for \u201cLike free\u201d platforms. The new Like counts feature could be a way to retain users.\n\nTwitter Spaces comes to the Web\n\nTwitter\u2019s Clubhouse competitor, Spaces, hits the web. This means users can now host and join sessions via desktop and mobile browsers. You can also preview a session before joining and minimise the website to continue browsing.\n\nTranscriptions anyone? What other way to be one up on competitors than live transcriptions? Perks: accessible to people who are hard of hearing, deaf, or want the sound off. I\u2019m not sure how the platform plans to pull this off for non-native English speakers. We all know how it is on web conferencing platforms.\n\nNot slowing down: Since it launched in December 2020, Spaces has continued to evolve as Twitter keeps adding new features. Meanwhile, Clubhouse only recently became available for Android users.\n\nTwitter\u2019s monetisation plan is adding up: Last week, Twitter disclosed its plans on how Ticketed Spaces would enable users to make money from their followers. Guess what? Twitter makes money too.\n\nHow? It\u2019s a 20-20-60 (Google/Apple-Twitter-User) sharing ratio for every ticket sold. For now, only users in the US can sell tickets, while anyone around the world can buy.\n\nIt appears we\u2019re already getting answers to how social audio-chat apps can monetise the platform. Remember this discussion \u2014 This is the last one, we promise, but we\u2019re not sure?\n\nWe\u2019ll see if Twitter\u2019s first-move advantage into Android and monetisation plans will work out well for the platform.\n\nICYMI on Techpoint Africa\n\nWhat\u2019s the fate of Nigerian fintech following banking regulator\u2019s fresh regulations? Read\n\nWhat you need to know, as Kenya moves to outlaw pornography.\n\nWhat else we\u2019re following\n\nDubai is a paradise for \u201cdigital nomads\u201d \u2014 and hell for low-wage gig workers.

You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you subscribe now\n\nGood day,\n\nOluwanifemi and Bolu here.\n\nToday we\u2019re discussing:\n\nWhat tech is doing for African kids\n\nCrypto withdrawal on PayPal\n\nFacebook\u2019s plan to hide Like counts\n\nTwitter Spaces available on web browsers with new features\n\nCelebrating Children\u2019s day\n\nIn Nigeria, Children\u2019s Day is observed every May 27. As to the \u2018why?\u2019 I believe it\u2019s a day when we are all reminded to celebrate and promote children\u2019s rights. Yearly, conversations are driven in specific directions to discuss action points for making the world a better place for children.\n\nTrivia: World\u2019s Children\u2019s day is celebrated yearly on November 20, while International Day of the African Child happens every June 16.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTalking of making the world a better place for kids, exposure to tech solutions makes way for the same advancement that has made life easier for everyone. In fact, edtech has become a huge part of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nWe did a compilation of a few: These 11 startups are preparing African kids for the future\n\nNot only for kids, here\u2019s a list of eight tech careers you can get into and how to get started.\n\nHowever, it appears it is becoming harder by the day to protect them from the evil that comes with it. While some media platforms have versions for kids, others have age limits.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the US government prevented Facebook from going ahead with releasing Instagram for Kids. During the pandemic, this came in handy, suggesting ways to protect kids since they had to spend more time online.\n\nCheck this out: We owe it to our kids to put an age limit on social media\n\nApart from the solutions provided by startups, some schools now run hybrid models where kids learn both in the classrooms and at home.\n\nDo you remember how Nigerian schools fared after the lockdowns?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn a different note, Ikorodu Bois, Emmanuella: meet the top 5 Nigerian kid influencers on social media. Interesting!\n\nPayPal\u2019s crypto withdrawal\n\nPayments giant PayPal will soon open up crypto withdrawals for its customers. The company\u2019s crypto lead, Fernandez da Ponte, revealed this at CoinDesk\u2019s crypto event Consensus 2021 on Wednesday, May 26, 2021.\n\nBecoming even more crypto-friendly: Currently, PayPal users cannot withdraw or send cryptocurrencies directly to friends and families. Only the fiat equivalent can be sent, which means customers have to sell their holdings. Now, da Ponte says PayPal wants to \u201cmake it as open as possible\u201d, allowing direct purchases and transfers in crypto.\n\nMore crypto users? PayPal\u2019s purported crypto tolerance could be a ploy to lure more crypto users to its platform. In an interview with the Time Magazine, the CEO, Dan Shulman, revealed that the demand for crypto is \u201cmultiple fold\u201d of initial expectations.\n\nMore crypto features coming? This might be the first of many crypto features on PayPal as the venture is seemingly profitable for the company.\n\nFacebook to hide Like count\n\nFacebook is giving users the option to hide the Like count on their posts. It announced this on Wednesday, May 26, 2021, on Facebook Newsroom. Instagram and Facebook users now have more control over their experience on the apps.\n\nFacebook has been testing this new feature since 2019. According to them, they wanted to see if hiding the count could take the pressure off people. Some found it useful, while others found it annoying.\n\nAn end to Like-chasing? Not quite. Users can decide if they want to see a Like count on others\u2019 posts, theirs by others, and which of their posts they want a like count on. This way, Facebook satisfies those who feel pressured by Likes and those who depend on Like counts \u2014 such as influencers \u2014 to use the app.\n\nAccording to Facebook, pressure caused by Like counts, made people focus less on content and more on content engagement.\n\nWhy does Facebook care? Per TechCrunch, the pressure from Like counts made people opt for \u201cLike free\u201d platforms. The new Like counts feature could be a way to retain users.\n\nTwitter Spaces comes to the Web\n\nTwitter\u2019s Clubhouse competitor, Spaces, hits the web. This means users can now host and join sessions via desktop and mobile browsers. You can also preview a session before joining and minimise the website to continue browsing.\n\nTranscriptions anyone? What other way to be one up on competitors than live transcriptions? Perks: accessible to people who are hard of hearing, deaf, or want the sound off. I\u2019m not sure how the platform plans to pull this off for non-native English speakers. We all know how it is on web conferencing platforms.\n\nNot slowing down: Since it launched in December 2020, Spaces has continued to evolve as Twitter keeps adding new features. Meanwhile, Clubhouse only recently became available for Android users.\n\nTwitter\u2019s monetisation plan is adding up: Last week, Twitter disclosed its plans on how Ticketed Spaces would enable users to make money from their followers. Guess what? Twitter makes money too.\n\nHow? It\u2019s a 20-20-60 (Google/Apple-Twitter-User) sharing ratio for every ticket sold. For now, only users in the US can sell tickets, while anyone around the world can buy.\n\nIt appears we\u2019re already getting answers to how social audio-chat apps can monetise the platform. Remember this discussion \u2014 This is the last one, we promise, but we\u2019re not sure?\n\nWe\u2019ll see if Twitter\u2019s first-move advantage into Android and monetisation plans will work out well for the platform.\n\nICYMI on Techpoint Africa\n\nWhat\u2019s the fate of Nigerian fintech following banking regulator\u2019s fresh regulations?

          "title": "Why some Nigerians might not miss Internet Explorer but would use Microsoft Edge",
          "text": "Microsoft announced in a blog post that it would retire the Internet Explorer (IE) on June 15, 2022.\n\nLaunched globally in August 1995, Internet Explorer became the most widely used web browser with about 95% market share between 2002 and 2003. And in 2015, it was already one of Africa\u2019s most used web browsers.\n\nDespite being the pioneering Internet browser, its security, speed, and reliability have been the butt of jokes for a few years now. Maybe that\u2019s why Microsoft has decided to pull the plug on the browser\u2019s life support.\n\nDue to its longevity, no other software has had more security bugs than Internet Explorer before 2019. Its users are prone to get tricked by hackers into opening malicious websites from search queries or clicking on an email link.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Microsoft reportedly confirmed a security flaw in January 2020, the company said it had no immediate plan to fix the defect used by hackers on IE until they released a new update in February of that year.\n\nIn January 2020, Microsoft ended support for Windows 7 after announcing that it wouldn\u2019t offer security updates for Windows users in January 2019.\n\nDespite the patches rolled out almost every month, its security and low network connectivity, which make it unreliable, do not inspire confidence.\n\nThat explains why some users started looking for alternatives.\n\n\u201cInternet Explorer was the go-to to download Chrome back in the day. I left it for Chrome because IE is very unreliable, and has bugs,\u201d IheAnyi Okere, a Geographic Information System (GIS) analyst, told Techpoint Africa.\n\nA Techpoint Africa Twitter poll revealed that most respondents share their sentiments and quit using IE due to unreliability.\n\nOne hundred and twenty respondents voted, and 48 people (40%) said they stopped using IE due to its unreliability; 36 people (40%) discontinued using it, citing bad network connectivity. Approximately 7 people (5.8%) stopped because of security bugs, and about 29 people (24.2%) said they never used it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsequently, it appears some Nigerians won\u2019t miss the browser when Microsoft eventually puts it to rest.\n\nNonetheless, while Internet Explorer was going through its steady decline in market share, and Google Chrome dominated other browsers with 69% market share, Microsoft was building Microsoft Edge to replace IE.\n\nWhat about Microsoft Edge?\n\nWith the Microsoft Edge browser launch in 2015, the software giant revealed plans to kill off Internet Explorer, though it would continue working until the end.\n\nRecall that on August 17, 2020, Microsoft announced that the Microsoft Teams web app would no longer support IE. And on November 30 of the same year, Microsoft Teams stopped endorsing IE.\n\nFrom August 17, 2021, Microsoft services like OneDrive and Outlook will no longer support IE.\n\nInterestingly, Edge has an IE mode despite being touted as faster, more secure, modern, and reliable than its predecessor.\n\nThe IE mode is built in to access the legacy Internet Explorer-based websites and applications directly from the browser.\n\nMicrosoft also claims that Edge is its solution to the security issues faced on Internet Explorer over the years.\n\nAccording to Microsoft, approximately 579 password attacks are attempted every second. And with reportedly the highest-rated protection against malware and phishing attacks, Microsoft Edge seems to be up to the task of protection.\n\nAccording to browser statistics, Edge can identify 98% of phishing sites while Chrome and Firefox can successfully recognise 96%.\n\nMicrosoft Edge promises to give out security patches for instant vulnerabilities within hours compared to the monthly security patches on IE 11.\n\nAccording to research, Edge can immediately block 89% of phishing sites, outperforming Chrome (79%) and Firefox (77%). This suggests that Edge is more secure than Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer.\n\nIn the blog post released on Wednesday, May 19, 2021, Microsoft said, \u201cthe future of Internet Explorer on Windows 10 is in Microsoft Edge.\u201d\n\nBut how much of this do users believe?\n\n\u201cI enjoy using Microsoft Edge, and it\u2019s better than Chrome because it helps me retrieve my previous tabs whenever I log in again. Also, whenever I want to read, I can use the Immersive Reader. It\u2019s like you\u2019re reading on AnyBooks,\u201d says Damilola*, a Microsoft Edge user who never used IE.\n\nAccording to the Market Share Statistics for Internet Technologies, Chrome ranked first with 69.28% market share, while Microsoft Edge ranked second with 7.75% between November 2019 and April 2021.\n\nNew Edge Features\n\nOn Tuesday, May 25, 2021, Microsoft announced two new features for version 91 of the Edge browser at its annual Build conference.\n\nStartup boost allows Edge to start up almost immediately. The second feature \u2014 sleeping tabs \u2014 puts your tabs to sleep so that they don\u2019t use up memory and the CPU cycle.\n\nWith the new Edge features and the retirement of Internet Explorer in June 2022, Microsoft might finally build a reliable brand known for speed and security and probably overtake Chrome some years down the road.\n\nIn Africa, according to Browser Usage Statistics, 68.37% use Chrome while 1.26% use IE and Edge, respectively. However, chrome is still the most vulnerable web browser in 2019, with 177 vulnerabilities detected.\n\nThat is, even with its vulnerabilities, people still chose Chrome over Edge.\n\nSo, what might prompt Africans to use Edge more? The reliability of a browser that hasn\u2019t passed the test of time? How much work do you think Edge has to do to catch up with Chrome? We are also asking the same questions.\n\n* Not real name\n\nFeatured Image by Firmbee from Pixabay\n\nNew licence requirements for Nigerian fintechs\n\nRegister to attend the largest educators\u2019 event in Africa.

          "title": "Green Africa disrupts airline business with cheap airfares",
          "text": "With insecurity driving more people to travel by air and the incessant surge in airfares as a result of depleting fleet and high foreign exchange, Green Africa, a new entrant in the Nigerian aviation sector, may cause disruption in airline business as it commences sales of tickets with airfares as low as N16,500.\n\nFrom N28,000 for one hour flight after the high season in December 2020, the average cost of one hour ticket has now risen to N60,000 for one-way ticket and rising still as high as N80,000 for passengers who buy a ticket on the day they are travelling.\n\nAirlines have continued to increase the price of tickets because they source foreign exchange from the parallel market at N500 per dollar.\n\nThis is also as operators point out that many aircraft that were taken out of the country overseas were yet to be brought back because of the coronavirus pandemic, which has hindered activities in most countries, so the Nigerian carriers have limited fleet but high demand for air travel, as insecurity continues to discourage many people from travelling by road.\n\nWith the 70 percent slash in airfares offered by Green Africa, stakeholders are concerned if these fares would be sustainable and if passengers would be willing to fly propeller aircraft instead of jet aircraft, considering how uncomfortable these aircraft can be.\n\n\u201cActually, if I ran an airline in Nigeria, I would do exactly what Green Africa appears to be trying to do \u2013 target the mid-to-lower end of the market with cheap tickets by using propeller aircraft instead of jet aircraft.\n\n\u201cUp to 40 percent less fuel consumption so cheaper tickets. The trade-off is longer flight times and more in-flight turbulence since turboprops have lower cruising altitude (and turboprops are also noisier than jets). But in Nigeria, the deciding factor is always price,\u201d David Hundeyin, a renowned writer, journalist and researcher stated via his twitter handle @DavidHundeyin.\n\nRead Also: Green Africa commences flight tickets sales with fares as low as N16,500\n\nHe acknowledged that turboprops are less comfortable and take longer time than jets, adding that some aircraft type like the ATR72, which Green Africa uses are known to have tail rudder issues in severe icing conditions, but in our equatorial climate, that is unlikely to be a factor.\n\nHundeyin, who expressed his optimism in Green Africa\u2019s business model, added, \u201cLet people fly for N20,000 and you\u2019re printing money.\u201d\n\nWith Green Africa\u2019s commencement of ticket sales, some airlines are already slashing fares.\n\nFor instance, airfares from Lagos to Abuja has dropped from N60,000 in April to between N25,000 and N35,000 now.\n\nAirPeace slashed the airfare from Lagos to Ilorin from N52,500, some airlines charged last month, to N32,700.\n\nSeyi Adewale, CEO, Mainstream Cargo Limited, told BusinessDay that N16,500 airfares was just a promotional fare by Green Africa to appeal to passengers not used to flying a propeller aircraft and who were yet to experience the airline for the first time.\n\n\u201cIf Green Africa does not get people to experience their flights, they won\u2019t be able to penetrate the market. People would be willing to fly the turboprops, as long as it is cheaper,\u201d Adawale said.\n\nHe assured that after two weeks of offering promotional prices, Green Africa would begin to adjust prices to fit into current operational and economic realities.\n\nChecks by BusinessDay show that the seat capacity for an ATR 72-600 aircraft that would be operated by Green Africa would take between 70 and 78 passengers, depending on the seat configuration.\n\nJohn Ojikutu, aviation security consultant and secretary general of the Aviation Safety Round Table Initiative (ASRTI), told BusinessDay that the load factors of the small aircraft were lower, so they may not break even if they charge the same rates with airlines having bigger aircraft.\n\nIt cost airlines between $500,000 and $1 million to carry out mandatory C-checks on their aircraft every 18 months.\n\nChecks show that it cost not less than N2 million to operate a one-way flight using a Boeing 737 aircraft. Aviation fuel cost about N220 per litre and operators would need not less than 8,000ltr (N1.7m) to operate a one way Lagos- Abuja flight. In addition, operators need to pay for landing and parking fees, ground handling fees, en-route air navigation services, catering, among others.\n\nAviation analysts say when airlines charge passengers less than N40,000 for a one-way flight, they are operating at a loss or relying on government intervention funds, palliatives or concession on recurring debts.\n\nHowever, Tolu Odutola, a pilot and aviation expert, argued that Green Africa operates ATR 72-600, which are generally cheaper to maintain than the 737s, CRJs and other aircraft operated by local airlines.\n\nOperations cost is generally cheaper and that is probably why ticket costs are commiserate, Odutola said, but noted that N16,500 fare may also just be an introductory rate to break into the market.",

I see this victory as a renewed call by God Almighty to rededicate myself to His service and that of the people of Edo state.\n\n\u201cFrom the statement by the Supreme Court Justices, it is clear that they align with what Edo people knew all along, which is that there was no merit in the case. The controversy was diabolical and ill-willed. It is reassuring that the Judiciary has upheld the wishes of the masses once again.\u201d\n\nObaseki dedicated the victory to Edo people, noting that their resolve to stand by him despite the campaign of calumny was inspiring.\n\nHe expressed appreciation to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for supporting him and holding steadfast in his belief and vision for a better Edo.\n\nThe governor also hailed His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari (GCFR), for ensuring that the judiciary remained impartial.\n\nRecall that the Federal High Court, Abuja, had on January 9 dismissed the alleged certificate forgery suit against Governor Obaseki.\n\nThe judge, Ahmed Mohammed, had described the APC\u2019s allegation as strange, saying it was like an outsider telling a man in his house that he is not the father of a child.\n\nApparently not satisfied with the decision of the lower court, the APC approached the appellate court to challenge the judgment.\n\nBut the Court of Appeal had in a judgement, on March 18, held that the case the APC brought to vacate the January 9 verdict of the Federal High Court in Abuja, which authenticated Obaseki\u2019s University of Ibadan degree certificate, lacked merit.\n\nThe appellate court panel which was led by Justice Stephen Adah, upheld the testimony of the Deputy Registrar, Legal, University of Ibadan, Abayomi Ajayi, who had earlier confirmed before the trial court, that Obaseki attended the University and fulfilled all the requirements for admission into the department of Classical Studies.\n\nDelivering judgment in the appeal, the judge held that the lower court was right in its findings and conclusions.\n\n...",

We introduced the Edo Basic Education Sector Transformation (EDOBEST) programme, where we have efficiently deployed and utilized technology to impact knowledge on our pupils.\n\n\u201cThey can now read and write with the aid of technology. The activities of teachers can easily be monitored; they have also benefited as we have enhanced their skills, using technology.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Kallon said the delegation was in Benin to reinforce partnership with the government and to see how they can work better in the fight against COVID-19.\n\nHe noted that a part of the aim for the visit was to discuss ideas that would put an end to irregular migration among youths in Edo.\n\n...",

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nThe Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF), has encouraged all patriotic Igbo people across the globe to observe the May 30 Biafra Remembrance Day, as according to it, the day remained an important part of the history of Igbo nation.\n\nThe ADF which made call in a statement signed by its president, Professor Uzodinma Nwala and spokesperson, Chief Abia Onyike on Friday, argued that May 30 has become an official Igbo Remembrance Day, which cannot be wished away.\n\nThe Indigenous People of Biafra had called for a candlelight procession on May 30 and sit-at-home on May 31 in honour of those killed during the Biafra war.\n\nHowever, opposing the call, the Imo State governor, Hope Uzodinma, yesterday asked residents to go about their activities without fear.\n\nThe governor said his administration said had finalised arrangements with security operatives to contain any eventuality\n\nBut throwing its weight behind the decision the May 30 commemoration, ADF maintained that the event is deeply rooted in the heart of Igbo people and which nobody can wish it away or ban it by force of Law or prevent it by force of arms.\n\n\u201cEvents in Alaigbo on May 30, each year show that May 30 has become an official Igbo Remembrance Day not only within Alaigbo but throughout the entire world where Igbo citizens live. Each year from London to Johannesburg, to several cities in Europe, Asia, America and Canada, the story is the same with various activities organized by Umuigbo and their friends to mark the occasion,\u201d ADF said in the statement.\n\n\u201cBack home the entire Alaigbo have often been shut down; markets, shops, schools and offices closed while streets are deserted to mark the Remembrance Day.\n\n\u2018The Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF) is fully aware that May 30 is a day in the history of Alaigbo, deeply rooted in the heart of our people and which nobody can wish away or ban by force of Law or prevent by force of arms.\n\n\u201cIt is in the light of this that the ADF fully supports observance of May 30, this year as Igbo Day Celebration. We urge all Igbo patriots to celebrate this year\u2019s event on Sunday, 30th May, 2021. Let Ndigbo celebrate it as a solemn occasion by going to Church, wearing of black bands and fasting including peaceful activities lined out for the day by different Igbo organizations.\u201d\n\nThe ADF said May 30 is day the defunct Biafra Republic was declared, and no conscious Igbo person would deny that Biafra is part of their history.\n\n\u201cMay 30 marks the day Biafra was declared in 1967 and no patriotic Igbo son or daughter can pretend that Biafra is not part of the history and indeed the major water-shed in the history of the Igbo nation,\u201d the group noted.\n\n\u201cIf anyone is in doubt let him recall what has often happened on May 30, especially in 2017 and 2018 when our sons and daughters under the aegis of IPOB, MASSOB and other Pan-Igbo organizations declared a SIT-AT-HOME to commemorate Biafra Day as a historic day in the life of Ndigbo, while other forms of memorial activities take place to mark the historic day.\n\n\u201cThe total compliance of that call throughout the length and breadth of Alaigbo was not because these pan-Igbo and pro-Biafra organizations had become their supreme authority. No! That call evokes intense yearning in the innermost recesses of the hearts and minds of Umuigbo.\n\n\u201cConsequently, whosoever provoked the observance is welcome as a lover of the Igbo nation. BIAFRA evokes intense longing for freedom for our people. Biafra is indeed more than a state of the mind. It is also a material force that moves our people.\u201d\n\nAccording to the group, Biafra has remained in the mind of Igbo people because it symbolizes their longing for freedom.\n\n\u201cWhy will Biafra not symbolize their longing for freedom, when their predicament since the Amalgamation in 1914 up to the Biafra Declaration on My 30, 1967 and ever since Biafra has been a continuous state of estrangement, brutal attacks and punitive measures against their spiritual, economic, political and physical survival?\n\n\u201cThe Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF), therefore, proposes that Umuigbo should turn May 30 every year to be observed as a REMEMBRANCE DAY \u2013 a day to remember our history, to review our successes and failures, to remember those who have died fighting for the Igbo cause and also think of our future,\u201d the statement concluded.",

          "title": "Any PDP tour of Osun without resolution chairmanship tussle a waste of time \u2013 Adagunodo",
          "text": "The embattled chairman of Osun State Chapter of People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) Hon. Soji Adagunodo recently met with some selected journalist where he bare his mind on some sundry issues. SUNDAY OGUNTUYI was there.\n\nExcerpts:\n\nIt\u2019s been two months since an Appeal Court sitting in Akure decided that you are no longer the Chairman of the Osun State Chapter of PDP\u2026?\n\nNo! no!! no!!! The Appeal Court never ruled that I am no longer the Chairman. Go and read the judgment very well. It did not say that. There was a prayer by the appellants to the court that the November 3, 2020 High Court Ikirun Division Interim/Interlocutory Order be vacated which was granted. Meanwhile my Chairmanship position that hinges on November a 9, 2020 Preservative Order was not appealed against, which means it still subsists. The Court of Appeal ruled that the substantive case be determined at the lower court.\n\nMind you, there is nowhere in the judgment where Sunday Bisi was pronounced Chairman of the Osun State Chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party. Go and get a copy of the judgment and read it very well. I\u2019m waiting for the resumption of the courts to straighten this out.\n\nOkay, what are your prayers before the court?\n\nMy prayer is that my removal is illegal, null and void, based on the 2017 Constitution of our party as amended, which incidentally was signed into law by both the National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus and the National Secretary of the Party, Senator Umar Ibrahim Tsauri. Section 2 of our Party Constitution is very clear on its supremacy, so I am praying the Court to reaffirm me as the rightful chairman, with all privileges to function and serve out my tenure, without hindrance.\n\nIncreasingly, party members are articulating that you should settle out of court. How are you going to pursue the next phase of the court case against PDP on your removal?\n\nOn the two occasions that the High Court, Ikirun Division gave an Interim order on the 3rd and 9th of November last year, I called for political solution, but those that do not have the interest of the party at heart did not allow those, who are supposedly, concerned to listen. What I believe is that there are certain elements that are feeding party members with fabricated lies, to actualize their illegal position, but by God\u2019s grace the case will reopen when the courts resume sitting. I will exploit and execute every known legal means available to clear my name and pursue same to a logical conclusion.\n\nWhat is your assessment of the party crisis and what is the way forward since some observers of the happenings in the party believe that the solution lies with your reinstatement?\n\nFor peace to reign in any society, which our party belongs, there must be justice. My removal from office illegal, it is injustice of the highest order and quite unexpected from a party I hold so dear. Suffice it to say, that political parties aggregate the destiny of citizens in trust and, therefore, should be seen to obey its own laws and constitution. That is what gives the populace the confidence to cast their votes, in trust for the party to take charge of their affairs and destiny as a people and without fear of being manipulated as being presently experienced by APC, especially at the Federal level.\n\nAre you aware of a proposed tour of the state by the Sunday Bisi led Working Committee beginning from June 1, 2021? If yes, what does this mean to you?\n\nI am aware that a group of people in the party, otherwise known as the Ademola Adeleke group, codenamed The Pathfinder Team, proposed that and also made a release about the tour which clearly indicates that it is not a party programme but a group\u2019s programme. That\u2019s what our party has been turned into.\n\nIt is not an official programme of the Osun State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party. Interest groups within a political party are allowed to consult but this should not be misconstrued as an official programme of Osun PDP. No, it is not. It is a group of supporters that want to do that for their preferred aspirant. There is a difference between OSUN PDP AND PATHFINDER TEAM. Many of such will still take place.\n\nAs for the party, when it is ready to move and consult with members of the party and the good people of Osun State, you will see the who-is-who that will be involved. There\u2019s no way the party will consult round the state, whether with members and or the public, without me as the party chairman being involved.\n\nOur party will never embark on state wide consultations without our revered leaders like Prince Olagunsoye Oyinlola; Alhaji Shuaib Oyedokun; Dr. Olu Alabi; High Chief Dele Faseru; HE, Erelu Obada, CON; Senator Akinlabi Olasunkanmi; Chief Segun Odekunmi; Our National Ex-Officio, Hon. Paul Olakunle; Chief Olaoye Oyelayo; Alhaji Sule Oyedeji; Aremo Kunle Alao; Engr. Jide Adeniji; Barrister Kayode Oduoye; Dr. Oluomo Daisi Aina; Senator Francis Adenigba Fadahunsi, CON; Hon. Busayo Oluwole Oke; Hon. Taofeek Abimbola Ajilesiro; the Southwest Zonal Officers; Members of the State House of Osun State House of Assembly who are members of the party and many other leaders across the state that are too numerous to mention. So any arrangement or movement that does not have the inclusion of these people, to me, is a mere jamboree that we should discountenance\n\nIn addition, even in the so called Adeleke Group, the few that are planning the movement are in their minority. Others in the same group are still eagerly waiting for the court pronouncement on our case because they don\u2019t want to be caught in the web. More importantly, there is no serious minded group that will be planning a tour on behalf of an aspirant without the aspirant being physically present to meet the people. Are they going to be consulting for him by proxy?\n\nWill you consider your removal as the genesis of the Osun PDP crisis?\n\nSee, our endless journey in the wonderland of political quandary and party leadership quagmire is due to one reason: TRUTH. The same truth we all love to hate. My removal was premeditated and hatched by some Fifth Columnists within our party, who fed Dr Deji Adeleke with many lies about me. I have, on several occasions, explained to him through personal contacts and letters to clear myself of the many falsehoods and allegations they raised against me. You see, isn\u2019t it funny that I was accused of anti-party activities when, as a matter of fact, I delivered my unit, ward, state and federal constituencies in all elections? I also delivered my senatorial and Governorship votes during elections just as I did in respect of the Presidential Election for the Party\u2019s candidate. Now tell me how they want to justify my loyalty to the party and her candidates in those elections? I did everything humanly possible for the success of the Party even to the extent of putting my life on the line .Those feeding fat from the crisis are the ones who want to subjugate the supremacy of the party and our collective will, with intent to disallow free, fair and credible internal democratic processes under me, to elect the party flag bearer for Osun 2022. They prefer to select, rather than elect, a candidate so that they too can enjoy the same selection because many of them have ambition and they know they can never emerge as candidates of the party in their various domains and constituencies. Funny enough they all lost in all past and previous elections except for a few of them.\n\nWho are those few?\n\nThe few ones know themselves and those who lost, who have been serial losers, also know themselves. They are many that do not have records of electoral success or victory for themselves or for the party from time immemorial. They are now the ones in charge that want to control the party machinery at all cost, for the sake of their selfish interest , pecuniary gains and personal political ambition.\n\nBarring all obstacles, if you\u2019re back in office fully today, what will you do as the Party Chairman to chart a new course for the party?\n\nI\u2019ll renew and increase my efforts that was deployed in 2017 and which gave us the needed maximum victory in 9 out of 10 local government areas during the Osun West Senatorial bye-election. In 2018 same efforts gave us another victory at first ballot despite the fact that manipulators crept in and destroyed the lofty relationship between the party leadership and the family of our candidate. I will also ensure that we evolve new strategies to bring in more disenfranchised members. Some have distanced themselves from the party due to the lingering crises. I will bring them back in order to strengthen the party. As it is today, the advantage of the impeding implosion in APC will be fully utilized to bring PDP back to governance in Osun State in 2022.\n\nIt is everywhere that Dr Deji Adeleke solely sponsored the Congress leading to your emergence as Chairman. How true is that?\n\nNo, It\u2019s a lie. The Adelekes participated in only 1 out of the 4 congresses that we had. I appreciate Dr Deji Adeleke\u2019s contributions. Anything, or every money, he spent was after the Party had successfully installed his brother, Senator Ademola Adeleke, as Senator. They were the first, and the highest, beneficiary of our struggle. Please, don\u2019t forget that we had two formidable, qualified and acceptable Senatorial candidates, Senator Akinlabi Olasunkanmi and Col. Olayiwola Falabi, before the leadership of the Party directed them to withdraw for Senator Ademola Adeleke.\n\nOn the Governorship primaries, Osun PDP had many aspirants before the Adelekes joined our Party, only Dr. Akin Ogunbiyi and Adeleke came into the Party later and almost at the same time. There were aspirants before them, like Rt. Hon. Rafiu Adejare Bello (now in APC); Akogun Lere Oyewumi; Dr Kayode Oduoye; Senator Kola Ogunwale; Dr Ayoade Adewopo; Senator Olasunkanmi Akinlabi; Oluomo Gbenga Owolabi; Barrister N.O.O. Oke (SAN); Alhaji Fatai Akinbade and others. All these gentlemen stood with the Party. They all did everything possible to reshape and reposition the party. And they did not cry about their lofty efforts like what we are witnessing from the greatest beneficiary of our struggle when they lost the bid to emerge as the Party\u2019s candidate.\n\nFor record purposes Hon Oluwole Oke; Baba Shuaib Oyedokun; the National Secretary of our party at that time, Prof. Wale Oladipo; Sen (Dr) Olu Alabi; Erelu Olusola Obada CON; at a later date Senator Francis Fadahunsi, CON; and Rt. Hon. Albert Adeogun with the aforementioned foremost aspirants and Dr Akin Ogunbiyi also contributed immensely to the struggle, not to mention my personal involvements and contributions.\n\nOne of the allegations against you is that you were involved in anti-party activities?\n\nIt\u2019s laughable and insulting. I am a founding member of the party. I can never be involved in anti-party activities against the PDP. The party is in my blood. No matter what happens, I see PDP as my investment. I won my Unit with over 300 votes , my ward with over 1000 votes, an uncommon occurrence in the state. I won my Ward, Local Government, Federal Constituency and Senatorial district, Governorship and presidential elections as I said earlier. So where does the issue of anti-party activity come in?\n\nDuring the 2018 Governorship election, I was in my ward when I received security information that APC was trying to rig the election in Ward 4 and Ward 5 in Osogbo local government and no single leader was responding to their distress calls from Osogbo. Immediately I got that message, I left my unit in Obokun Local Government and joined our people in Osogbo to prevent the rigging and it was God that saved my life. I was attacked by APC two times that night during that election. I almost lost my life. All active members in Osogbo local government reading this interview will bear me witness. Is it possible for APC to attack someone that was working for them? I didn\u2019t engage in anti-party activities and I can never be. I will never do that against my beloved PDP as long as I remain a member.\n\nCan you confirm to us when the next Ward and Local government congresses of your party will be taking place? We heard it\u2019s October this year.\n\nThat cannot be correct. It is a misinformation. The congresses will come up anytime from March next year according to the term and years of office. If you remember, the resolution reached by the present National Working Committee of our party under Prince Uche Secondus in Abuja sometimes around February 2018 was that we should go and conduct a fresh congress from Ward to State when the attempt to install Dr. Bayo Faforiji by the Omisore group failed. They had complained that the existing Partial Ward congress conducted in October 2017 favoured me and that it was going to be an easy win for me. Despite that, we went to Ejigbo High Court and there was a judgment that was delivered on March 22. We got clearance from Abuja to go ahead with the congress in compliance with the court judgment. The fourth and last congresses that ushered us in took place on March 23, 24 and 25, 2018. Therefore, the four year tenure will lapse on those dates in 2022.\n\nAs at today, how many gubernatorial aspirants have declared their intention to contest the gubernatorial ticket of the party?\n\nThe fortune of the party depends on the ongoing leadership tussle in the court of law, Osun PDP is blessed with personalities who are well equipped in providing lasting solutions to the plight of the people. We have a few who have expressed their wish to run, but no candidate can emerge without a valid Party leadership and primaries. You can\u2019t build something on nothing. I know immediately the leadership crises is over we will have qualified and competent aspirants from our party that will become our candidate.\n\nOn a final note, what are your party\u2019s chances in 2022?\n\nThe chances of any political party to win elections depend on its stability, capacity and capability to handle internal criss that are always inevitable. Any political party that cannot handle its own internal crisis as a family affair is heading for destruction.\n\nAs it is today, I pray that our leaders at both state and national levels will quickly rise to the occasion to resolve all internal crisis within the party. To be specific, the victory or success of Osun State Chapter of PDP in 2022 is very central to the party winning the national elections in 2023, hence the need to resolve the crises in Osun state chapter as soon as possible, so that we can win 2022 Gubernatorial Election which will definitely have multiplier effects on other national elections that will follow, including the Presidential election.",

          "title": "Remembering Nigeria\u2019s Biafra war, which many Nigerians would rather forget",
          "text": "The deaths of more than a million people in Nigeria as a result of the brutal civil war which ended exactly 50 years ago are a scar on the nation\u2019s history.\n\nFor most Nigerians, the war over the breakaway state of Biafra is generally regarded as an unfortunate episode best forgotten, but for the Igbo people who fought for secession, it remains a life-defining event.\n\nIn 1967, following two coups and turmoil which led to about a million Igbos returning to the south-east of Nigeria, the Republic of Biafra seceded with 33-year-old military officer Emeka Odumegwu Ojukwu at the helm.\n\nThe Nigerian government declared war and after 30 months of fighting, Biafra surrendered. On 15 January 1970, the conflict officially ended.\n\nThe government\u2019s policy of \u201cno victor, no vanquished\u201d may have led to a lack of official reflection, but many Nigerians of Igbo origin grew up on stories from people who lived through the war.\n\nThree of those who were involved in the secessionist campaign have been sharing their memories.\n\nHe had just finished grammar school and started training as a veterinary assistant at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN), in south-eastern Nigeria, when the civil war began.\n\nAlmost every student he knew became part of the war effort.\n\nHe joined the Biafran army and was assigned to the signal unit, whose responsibilities included \u201cactive intelligence and eavesdropping on the Nigerian military\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerians who were pursuing us were trained soldiers. We were not. We were drafted into the war, given two days\u2019 training.\n\n\u201cPlus the fact that we were hungry. Some of us, our skin was getting rotten. Nobody can fight a war like that.\u201d\n\nIn January 1966, some senior Nigerian army officers, mostly of the Igbo ethnic group, assassinated key politicians during a coup in the West African state.\n\nThose killed included Ahmadu Bello, a revered leader in the north.\n\nThis led to months of massacres against the Igbo living in the north. Tens of thousands were killed while about a million fled to what was then known as the Eastern Region.\n\nColonel Odumegwu Ojukwu, the Military Governor of Biafra in Nigeria inspecting some of his troops, 11th June 1968.\n\nThese events sparked the decision to secede, spearheaded by Ojukwu, who was then the military governor of the Eastern Region.\n\nIn the months preceding the war, Ojukwu often visited UNN, the only university in south-eastern Nigeria at the time, to meet with students and prepare them for secession.\n\nMr Ago looked forward to these visits, and joined the crowd who gathered at the university\u2019s Freedom Square.\n\n\u201cOnce his helicopter touched down, everybody went there and, practically, school shut down.\n\n\u201cHe had this incredible sense of humour. He spiked everybody up and we formed songs and were singing and enjoying ourselves.\u201d\n\nIn the first year of the war, the Nigerian government captured the coastal city of Port Harcourt and imposed a blockade, which cut food supplies to Biafra.\n\nNigerian troops entering Port Harcourt, after routing Biafran troops during the Biafran War.\n\nMr Ago remembers the overpowering hunger that often forced Biafran soldiers to catch and eat mice. He also remembers the last year of the war when his unit was continuously on the move, fleeing the advancing Nigerian army.\n\n\u201cSomewhere in the middle of the war,\u201d he said, \u201cthe Biafrans made some dramatic successes that gave us hope that we might hold the Nigerians until at least some help from outside came.\u201d\n\nBy late 1969, all hope was lost.\n\nBiafra timeline\n\nJanuary 1966 \u2013 Nigerian government overthrown in what was seen as an \u201cIgbo coup\u201d led by junior army officers\n\nJanuary 1966 \u2013 Lt Col Odumegwu-Ojukwu appointed military governor of Eastern Region\n\nJuly 1966 \u2013 Second coup masterminded by Murtala Muhammed, Lt Col Yakubu Gowon becomes head of state\n\nJune to October 1966 \u2013 Riots in northern Nigeria targeted at Igbos, killing many and forcing up to a million to return to south-eastern Nigeria\n\nMay 1967 \u2013 Ojukwu declares independence of the Republic of Biafra\n\nJuly 1967 \u2013 War begins\n\nOctober 1967 \u2013 Biafran capital Enugu falls\n\nMay 1968 \u2013 Nigeria captures oil-rich Port Harcourt\n\nApril 1969 \u2013 Umuahia, new Biafran capital falls to Nigerian forces\n\nJanuary 1970 \u2013 Ojukwu flees Nigeria\n\nJanuary 1970 \u2013 Biafra surrenders\n\nPresentational grey line\n\nMr Ago left the army and went in search of his family, whom he had not heard from in more than two years.\n\nHe collected his portion from an allocation of raw rice to his unit, then set off towards the village of a relative, where he suspected his parents and siblings would be holed up.\n\n\u201cI had to carry the rice while starving myself, carrying it across rivers and forests until I found them,\u201d he said.\n\nBIAFRA- By all military odds, Biafra should have lost its war with federal Nigeria long ago.\n\nIt has not lost, but in the next few months it might\u2013vanquished by starvation. Here, women and children receive their meager rations at a refugee camp.\n\nMany of his friends and classmates had died at the battlefront. But his family was delighted to see that the son and brother they assumed dead was alive. And they were glad that he had turned up with food.\n\nHunger killed more Biafrans than bullets and bombs.\n\nWhen the university was reopened a few months after the war ended, Mr Ago returned to UNN, eventually graduating with a degree in plant and soil science.\n\n\u201cI think we would have done better if we had handled it with a little bit more intelligence,\u201d said Mr Ago. \u201cI think now that Ojukwu\u2026 thought he was Jesus Christ.\n\n\u201cHe thought he could do magic. If he had slowed down and allowed some people who were with him to advise him properly, we would have come out better than we did.\u201d\n\nHe was a physics lecturer at UNN when the civil war began.\n\nFor the next 30 months, he headed the Research and Production (RAP) group comprising Igbo scientists from various fields.\n\nIts primary responsibility was to provide technological support to the Biafran army, which was poorly equipped.\n\nWhen the war started, there was not a single weapon\u2026 anywhere throughout Biafra. No gun, no bomb, no nothing.\u201d\n\nThe RAP\u2019s most notable product was the \u201cogbunigwe\u201d, a weapons launcher of remarkable and devastating effect which influenced the outcome of many battles in Biafra\u2019s favour, according to historical reports.\n\n\u201cWithout us, the war would have lasted only about 30 hours,\u201d said the 85-year-old.\n\n\u201cWhen the war started, there was not a single weapon either in a store or anywhere throughout Biafra. They only had knives and cutlasses. No gun, no bomb, no nothing.\u201d\n\nIn the aftermath of the war, the Nigerian government did not want to impose any form of collective punishment.\n\nNevertheless, the Igbo faced some devastating consequences, particularly economically as the Biafran currency that people had accumulated became worthless.\n\nMany Igbo still feel sidelined in Nigerian politics, as since the civil war no-one from the ethnic group has become president.\n\nIncreasing cries of marginalisation have led in recent years to the emergence of Igbo groups agitating once again for secession, particularly the Indigenous People of Biafra (Ipob), formed by UK-based British-Nigerian Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nmedia captionBiafran conflict: A grandmother\u2019s perspective on the war\n\nMr Oragwu wishes that the Igbo had paid less attention to the scramble for power at the centre, and instead distinguished their region by advancing the technological gains of the war.\n\n\u201cBiafra would have been a technological nation and would have been able to compete with anybody,\u201d he said, anger in his voice.\n\n\u201cThat is what makes me sad. By this time, we would have been competing with at least South Korea.\u201d\n\nThe scientist\u2019s wartime accomplishments had caught the attention of the Nigerian authorities and he was invited by the government to pioneer a special science and technology programme for the country.\n\nHe was behind the setting up of four universities of science and technology in different regions of Nigeria and after retirement he published Scientific and Technological Innovations in Biafra, a book he hoped would inspire young Nigerians.\n\n\u201cNigeria was programmed by the British colonial authorities not to participate in production and manufacture of global technologies,\u201d he wrote in the book.\n\n\u201cThe war gave the opportunity to\u2026 reject the colonial design.\u201d\n\nShe was teaching English and French in a secondary school in Port Harcourt in southern Nigeria when the civil war began.\n\nWhile the UK backed Nigeria, France was the most prominent supporter of Biafra.\n\nBut English was more widely spoken in Biafra, so translators were needed whenever French officials visited Ojukwu.\n\nMs Nwanunobi joined the Biafran ministry of foreign affairs as part of a handful of translators who worked directly with Ojukwu.\n\nREAD ALSO: Doctor narrates his encounter with a female ghost in his house, shares \u2018proof\u2019 of her presence\n\n\u201cThe war was an incredible period,\u201d said 82-year-old Mrs Nwanunobi. \u201cEverybody was forced to go home so you were forced to fraternise with your people more than any time before.\n\n\u201cAnd people who worked in every Biafra office were high level people. These were people who were doing all sorts of things and the war forced them out of their positions.\u201d\n\nShe enjoyed working directly with the Biafran leader, whom she and her colleagues fondly referred to as \u201cBrother OJ\u201d.\n\nmedia captionBiafran War veterans remember the conflict 50 years on\n\n\u201cHe was a gorgeous person,\u201d she said again and again. \u201cAnd he was disciplined. If any meeting lasted more than two hours, he wouldn\u2019t be party to it.\u201d\n\nHer most memorable assignment occurred after the Biafran military captured six Italian oil workers employed by the Nigerian government.\n\nOfficials from different European countries travelled to meet Ojukwu to appeal for their release.\n\n\u201cThat was the largest assembly we had,\u201d she recalled. \u201cEven the Vatican sent representatives.\u201d\n\nDuring the meeting, Mrs Nwanunobi conveyed to Ojukwu that he stood the risk of losing European support.\n\nHe promised to consider the matter, and the Italians were subsequently released.\n\nBritish Labour Party politician Michael Barnes speaking at a rally organised by the \u2018Biafra Committee\u2019, London, UK, 7th July 1968.\n\nMrs Nwanunobi met Ojukwu for the last time on 23 December 1969, when she lined up outside his office with her colleagues, to receive a Christmas gift and a handshake from him.\n\nA few days later, she left the country for the Biafran office in Paris. During a stopover of several days in Lisbon, she heard that Biafra had surrendered.\n\nHer first concern was for Ojukwu.\n\n\u201cI was worried that he would come to harm,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI didn\u2019t want anybody to disgrace him.\u201d\n\nHer worry lifted when she learned that her boss had escaped in his private jet, and was granted asylum by Ivory Coast, a francophone country.\n\nMrs Nwanunobi spent much of the 1970s in Canada before returning to Nigeria in 1977, where she resumed work as a secondary school teacher.\n\nThe bronze plated casket with the body of Odumegwu Ojukwu is being carried to his native Nnewi home by army pall bearers after a national inter-denominational funeral rites.\n\nOjukwu himself remained in exile for 13 years. After he was officially pardoned by the Nigerian government, he returned in 1982, with multitudes pouring onto the streets of his home state of Anambra to welcome him.\n\nHe died in November 2011 and was given a full military burial in a ceremony attended by then Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, some other African leaders and members of the diplomatic corps.\n\nFifty years after the Biafran conflict, Nigeria is still battling to maintain its unity, with various groups, not just the Igbo, calling for the restructuring of Africa\u2019s most populous state.\n\nIt is probably for this reason that the war is barely mentioned.\n\nThe government has nothing to gain by reminding Nigerians that secession happened before and can be attempted again.\n\nSource: BBC",

          "text": "The Federal Government of Nigeria has ordered the military junta in Mali to immediately and unconditionally release the detained transitional President and Prime Minister.\n\nSpokesperson, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Ferdinand Nwonye in a statement said the action is totally unacceptable.\n\nIt warned the key military actors and perpetrators of the condemnable act to beware of the fact that stakeholders in the region and friends of Mali reject any act of coercion of the detained officials, including forced resignations.\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cThe Federal Government of Nigeria condemns in strong terms the detention of the duo of interim President Bah Ndaw and Prime Minister Moctar Ouane of Mali.\n\n\u201cThe two key officials in the transitional government of Mali were reportedly taken by Soldiers to the Kati Military Camp near the Capital, Bamako on Monday 24, May 2021.\n\n\u201cThe action is totally unacceptable and might derail the peace building efforts and time table for the return of democratic governance in Mali\u201d.\n\nDiplomatic and government sources said that the reason for the detention is not unconnected to governmet reshuffle that affected some of the military guys in the transitional government.\n\nInternational media reported that President Bah Ndaw, Prime Minister Moctar Ouane and defence minister Souleymane Doucoure were all taken to a military base in Kati outside the capital Bamako, hours after two members of the military lost their positions in a government reshuffle.\n\nThe sacking of the pillars of the coup was an enormous misjudgement,\u201d a senior former Malian government official told the international medium.\n\nThe United Nations\u2019 mission in Mali called for the group\u2019s \u201cimmediate and unconditional\u201d release and said those who hold the leaders would have to answer for their actions.\n\nA delegation from the top regional decision-making body ECOWAS will visit Bamako on Tuesday to help resolve the \u201cattempted coup\u201d, ECOWAS, the U.N., African Union, European Union and several European countries said in a joint statement.\n\n\u201cThe international community rejects in advance any act imposed by coercion, including forced resignations,\u201d the group further said.\n\nThe U.S. State Department called in a statement for the \u201cunconditional release of those currently being held\u201d.\n\nRecall that on August 18, 2020 young military officers overthrew the country\u2019s elected president, Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, after a mounting wave of protests against his handling of Mali\u2019s conflict and the country\u2019s economic malaise.\n\nUnder the threat of international sanctions, the officers, headed by the American trained officer and leader of the coup, Colonel Assimi Goita handed power between September and October to a caretaker government, which is meant to rule for 18 months before staging elections.\n\nThe military government was officially disbanded in January, although the army has retained a tight grip on the interim government. The pledge of an 18-month transition had spurred many doubts as to whether the military-dominated government had the will, or the ability, to stage elections on such a timescale.\n\nEarlier in the year, Lieutenant Colonel Abdoulaye Maiga, the minister of territorial administration, told reporters that the first round of voting will take place on February 27, 2022 and a second round will follow in March.\n\nThe dates strictly uphold promises of an 18-month transition for returning to an elected government, Maiga said.\n\nMeanwhile the continental and sub-regional bodies have been lethargic about the issue, as all the resolutions of ECOWAS on the issue were not backed by actions ostensibly because of divergent interest of member states.\n\nOnly recently the\n\nECOWAS Parliament said that its non recognition of the parliamentarians from Mali has been referred to ECOWAS Court of Justice for interpretation.\n\nThe parliament maintained that it would not recognize parliamentarians from Mali following the military junta that took over the political leadership of the country.\n\nThe parliament further maintained that it would not recognize undemocratic governance under any guise.\n\nThe Community parliament later side tracked and allowed the MP from Mali\u2019s disbanded parliament to participate in its first extra ordinary session in Sierra Leone as observers.\n\nSuch weak disposition could not send any meaningful strong message to the transitional Government.",

          "text": "Syrian President Bashar al-Assad won a fourth term in office with 95.1% of the votes in an election that will extend his rule over a country ruined by war but which opponents and the West say was marked by fraud.\n\nAssad\u2019s government says the election on Wednesday shows Syria is functioning normally despite the decade-old conflict, which has killed hundreds of thousands of people and driven 11 million people \u2013 about half the population \u2013 from their homes.\n\nHead of parliament Hammouda Sabbagh announced the results at a news conference on Thursday, saying voter turnout was around 78%, with more than 14 million Syrians taking part.\n\nThe election went ahead despite a U.N.-led peace process that had called for voting under international supervision that would help pave the way for a new constitution and a political settlement.\n\nThe foreign ministers of France, Germany, Italy, Britain and the United States said in a statement criticising Assad ahead of the election that the vote would not be free or fair. Turkey, an Assad adversary, has also said the election was illegitimate.\n\nThe win delivers Assad, 55, seven more years in power and lengthens his family\u2019s rule to nearly six decades. His father, Hafez al-Assad, led Syria for 30 years until his death in 2000.\n\nAssad\u2019s years as president have been defined by the conflict that began in 2011 with peaceful protests before spiralling into a multi-sided conflict that has fractured the Middle Eastern country and drawn in foreign friends and enemies.\n\n\u201cThank you to all Syrians for their high sense of nationalism and their notable participation. \u2026 For the future of Syria\u2019s children and its youth, let\u2019s start from tomorrow our campaign of work to build hope and build Syria,\u201d Assad wrote on his campaign\u2019s Facebook page.\n\nAssad\u2019s biggest challenge, now that he has regained control of around 70% of the country, will be an economy in decline.\n\nTightening U.S. sanctions, neighbouring Lebanon\u2019s financial collapse, the COVID-19 pandemic hitting remittances from Syrians abroad and the inability of allies Russia and Iran to provide enough relief, mean prospects for recovery look poor.\n\nRallies with thousands of people waving Syrian flags and holding pictures of Assad while singing and dancing took place all day Thursday in celebration of the election.\n\nOfficials have told Reuters privately that authorities organised the large rallies in recent days to encourage voting, and the security apparatus that underpins Assad\u2019s Alawite minority-dominated rule had instructed state employees to vote.\n\nThe vote was boycotted by the U.S.-backed Kurdish-led forces who administer an autonomous oil-rich region in the northeast and in northwestern Idlib region, the last existing rebel enclave, where people denounced the election in large demonstrations on Wednesday.\n\nAssad was running against two obscure candidates, former deputy Cabinet minister Abdallah Saloum Abdallah and Mahmoud Ahmed Marei, head of a small, officially sanctioned opposition party.\n\nMarei got 3.3% of the vote, while Saloum received 1.5%, Sabbagh said.",
