          "text": "Angela Onwuzoo\n\nPresident, National Postgraduate Medical College of Nigeria, Dr. Musa Muhammed Borodo has begged doctors leaving the country to show more understanding about the state of the nation, noting that things will soon improve.\n\nBorodo also urged the Federal Government to declare brain drain a national emergency, stressing that it is now imperative to improve the working environment of medical doctors.\n\nThe College President made the plea during a press briefing on Tuesday on the forthcoming College\u2019s 39th Convocation ceremony billed to hold 16th September 2021.\n\nAccording to Borodo, this year\u2019s graduation ceremony brings to almost 7,000 the number of Fellows by examination that the college has graduated since its inception.\n\nHe, however, said, \u201cIt is sad to note that the intended impact of this effort in our national healthcare delivery system is rapidly being lost to other, often more developed climes, due the escalating monstrous phenomenon of brain drain we are experiencing in our dear country.\n\n\u201cWe accordingly urge the government to declare brain drain as a national emergency and urgently reverse it through improving job opportunity as well as improving the work environment of the doctors.\n\n\u201cWe also dispassionately urge the trained doctors as well as those in training leaving the country to show more patience and understanding about the situation at home as things improve.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the third wave of COVID-19, Borodo said the pandemic was still disrupting the socio-economic life of the world to varying degrees from one region to another.\n\nHe urged the Federal Government to further step up public awareness campaigns on the issue.\n\n\u201cWhile college further advocates and appeal, as we have done previously, to the general public, including health workers, to continue to observe the universal preventive precautions of wearing masks, hand hygiene, and maintaining social distances as appropriate.\n\n\u201cAs shown by research work presented at the recently concluded ASCAF of the college in Kaduna the acceptability of the COVID-19 vaccine is far from satisfactory in Nigeria even among health workers.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the college continues to recognise and commend the effort of frontline health workers, in many instances led by fellows of this college, in the fight against the pandemic,\u201d he said.\n\nOn residency training in Nigeria, he stated that as a regulator of the Residency Training Act in Nigeria, the college has been further given the responsibility of making annual budgetary estimates for the allowances of all residents in recognised training in Federal Government-owned Teaching Hospitals and Federal Medical Centres.\n\nBorodo noted that the mandate, which he said they are already pursuing vigorously would allow the government to annually adequately budget for these allowances thereby reducing the restiveness in the sector.\n\n\u201cI urge our sister West African Postgraduate Medical Colleges to be more forthcoming in turning in to NPMC all relevant data on residents enrolled in their training programs including the progress they are making in the exams.\n\n\u201cWe appeal to residents to pay more attention to their training so that they can complete the program within the period approved for funding by the government as spelt out in the Residency Training Act,\u201d he appealed.\n\nBorodo said the convocation would award one distinguished fellowship, two honorary fellowships and 15 foundation fellowships from the Faculty of Emergency Medicine and 88 postgraduate MDs by publication.\n\nAccording to him, top among the awards is the posthumous award to Late Dr. Stella Adadevoh, a fellow of the College in Internal Medicine for her dedication to medical duty that took her life, but saved Nigeria an epidemic of Ebola Virus in 2014.\n\n\u201cThe other two distinguished personalities- Alhaji (Dr) Aminu Alhassan Dantata and Dr. Babagana Zulum, the executive governor of Borno State -are recognised for College\u2019s Honorary fellowship award for distinguishing themselves in leadership, administration,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Lara Adejoro\n\nNigeria, Jamaica and Grenada are among the countries that could be moved to the red list today, according to a data expert.\n\nThe government is set to update its COVID-19 travel list as part of a review that happens every three weeks.\n\nCountries and territories are listed as red, amber or green \u2013 with different rules for each of the three lists.\n\nSky News has spoken to data expert, Tim White to find out which countries could be affected.\n\nAccording to Mr. White, Jamaica and Grenada which are popular destinations for tourists in the Caribbean, could be added to the red list.\n\nJamaica stayed amber in the previous review, but within hours the Foreign Office issued guidance saying it \u201cadvises against all but essential travel to the whole of Jamaica based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks\u201d.\n\nYahoo News reports that in the last few days, there has been a big spike in the number of people arriving from Jamaica with COVID-19.\n\nMr. White said the transport secretary \u201cwould effectively be admitting a mistake three weeks ago\u201d if he put Jamaica on the red list \u2013 and might not do so for that reason.\n\nGrenada could become the first country to go directly from green to red because of an \u201castonishing\u201d spread of COVID-19 on the small Carribean island, he said.\n\nAbout 1,000 people per 100,000 are testing positive for COVID-19 each week, which Mr. White said is \u201cwell into the danger zone\u201d.\n\nHe thinks a few other small islands in the Americas could be added to the red list, but the only concerns in Europe this time are in the Balkans.\n\n\u201cAlbania had one of the highest rates of infected arrivals in the most recent NHS results, but rates there seem low enough to keep it amber,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSerbia has the strongest sustained COVID-19 growth in Europe right now, but levels are still below Montenegro when I warned it may go red three weeks ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cSerbia\u2019s vaccination rate is also better, so I think it avoids red too.\n\n\u201cKosovo should already be red, but its fate could be linked with Serbia and seems set to survive again.\u201d\n\nFurther afield, Iran and Iraq may yet again stay amber \u2013 though Mr. White believes the fact they have remained so is a \u201cmystery\u201d.\n\nIn Africa, the data suggests Nigeria could be vulnerable, he said.\n\nHe said St Lucia is at risk because infection rates increased after the last travel review \u2013 but they are now declining and the case numbers are low overall, leading him to suspect that the country will be spared.\n\nThe data expert noted that the Maldives are most likely to be taken off the red list and moved to amber.\n\n\u201cIt is madness that the popular archipelago was not removed from red three weeks ago,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said case numbers there are low, with almost all of them on Male, the main island which is not popular with tourists.\n\nMr. White said the \u201cexcuse\u201d given for the country staying red was that it did not submit genomic sequencing data, which is used to identify variants \u2013 but it has now done so and is among the top 32 reporting countries.\n\n\u201cThere are no more excuses: sense must prevail,\u201d he said.\n\nThe data expert said the Dominican Republic should be removed but may not be because it does not carry out genomic sequencing.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion it\u2019s nonsense,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe risk of a mutant developing in such a small number of cases in the Dominican Republic is incredibly small, and much less likely than in Russia, or even India, giant countries on amber with areas of very high infection, but where over the whole country rates look acceptable.\u201d\n\nPeople hoping for Pakistan and Turkey to be removed from the red list may be disappointed.\n\n\u201cNeither has conclusive data for me to say they should be removed,\u201d Mr. White said.\n\nHe said Pakistan has \u201cbad\u201d test and trace figures, with 3.2% of all arriving passengers testing positive for COVID-19.\n\nEven though cases are decreasing, the percentage of COVID-19 tests which are positive in Pakistan is a little higher than 5 percent, which Mr. White sees as a benchmark.\n\nPakistan is not doing enough genomic sequencing, Mr. White said, which may also pose a problem.\n\nHe, however, said none of the big European holiday destinations are in any danger in the upcoming review.\n\n\u201cIn the last three weeks infection rates have been coming down in almost all the major holiday hotspots like France, Spain, Greece, Italy, Cyprus and Portugal,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the only country popular with UK tourists to see a rise has been Croatia due to a \u201chotspot\u201d of cases heading north and east across the continent.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re planning to head to Dubrovnik, Split, Zadar or any of the other Croatian delights, don\u2019t fear,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe seven-day infection rate is nowhere near worrying levels, indeed currently being a little lower than Austria which was added to the green list only last month.\u201d",

His abductors killed him in cold blood after collecting ransom from family and friends of the monarch.\n\n\u201cOn July 18, 2021, a medical doctor, Dr Solomon Nidiamaka, working with General Hospital Ugwolawo, in Ofu Local Government Area of Kogi state was kidnapped by gunmen in similar circumstance.\n\n\u201cEqually, on September 6, 2021, Mrs Fatimetu Ishaku, the General Manager of Radio Kogi at Ochaja was kidnapped while on transit to her village. Few day later, precisely on September 11, 2021, one Idris Bala was killed by Fulani herdsman at Ojapata Oganigu village in Dekina local government of Kogi state.\n\n\u201cThe same Oganeinugu village has been raided three tomes within the last one year by gunmen suspicion to be armed bandits.\u201d\n\nIt added: \u2018There have been countable numbers of kidnapping in Ejule, Iyale, and Ochadamu-Umori axis in Ofu Local Government Area.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, Itobe-Ojodu-Anyigba road as well as Idah-Ajegwu road has become a den of kidnappers with communities along those roads as well traveled faces danger daily.\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, Igah-Ikeje communities, especially at Adumu village, in Igah District of Olamaboro Local Government Area are having sleepless nights over incessant activities of armed Fulani herders.\n\n\u201cAnother fresh dimension in the criminal activities in the zone is the attacks on operators of POS and ATM machines especially in Abejukolo, headquarters of Omala local government. In July this year alone, four POS operators were robbed in a violent manner.\n\n\u201cAll these criminal acts have been so consistence within the last two years in a manner that shows complete absence of security or outright ineffectiveness of the available security system in the zone.\n\n\u201cThese criminals operate with impunity, as they are usually more armed than local vigilantes.\n\n\u201cOne of the most recent cases of insecurity in the zone was the killing of four persons at Otutubatu (Bagana) in Omala LGA\n\n\u201cMore worrisome in the prevailing security situations in the zone is that farmers could no longer go to farm due to fear of armed Fulani herders who are parading the farmlands with A K 47 and are ready to kill if you dare them.\u201d\n\nThe organisation said it observed the proliferation of small arms and light weapons in the hands of youths from the 2019 governorship election in the state, a situation that resulted in burning of Mrs Salome Abu and her residence during the 2019 election.\n\nIt called on Federal and State government as well as security agencies, local government chairmen, traditional rulers, and security experts, to put in place an effective security arrangement to respond to the peculiar challenges facing Igala land and Kogi State at large.\n\nUIO calls on all communities in Igala land to put in place dependable and formidable Community Security outfits, which could assist the efforts of the security agencies.",

He claimed all the calls from voices of reason appeared not to have moved both the federal and state governments to rise to the occasion.\n\n\u201cThe relocation of Boko Haram to Southern Kaduna is not new. Who are those that have been killing people indiscriminately in that area in the last few years? The church, SOKAPU and the people have been complaining about killings in Southern Kaduna but only fell on the deaf ear of those in authority. Therefore, the leaked document has simply confirmed our worries and shows that more days for killings of innocent citizens are coming unless the people take personal initiative to defend their lives and land. Our government has not done enough to convince us that they want to stop the killings going on all over the area.\n\nNow, we were being told that there is a leaked memo about Boko Haram when those in authority have always turned deaf ears to cries of our people when we complain about killers that people see everyday. Boko Haram fleeing North East to Southern Kaduna is simply a wake-up call for the southern Kaduna people to rise to the occasion,\u201d he said.\n\nA leaked DSS memo had said insurgents were relocating from Sambisa forest in Borno state to Chikun LGA in Kaduna state.\n\nThe alert was in a leaked memo marked NSCDC/NHQ/INT&INVST/323/2021 dated September 9, 2021 and signed by B.O Bassey, acting deputy commandant-general of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, intelligence and investigation.\n\nThe DSS, therefore, asked the civil defence to be on the alert.\n\n\u201cIt has been uncovered, plans by senior Boko Haram fighter, Ibrahim (FNU) alongside his foot soldiers relocating from \u2018Sambisa Forest in Borno State to Rijana Forest in Chikun local government area of Kaduna State with a view to joining their counterpart under the leadership of one Adamu Yunusu (aka Saddiqu).\n\n\u201cIn light of the above, you are hereby directed to step up surveillance and intelligence gathering on the aforementioned areas and environs.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, months after the crash involving a Nigerian Air Force (NAF) King Air 350 aircraft on May 21 at the Kaduna Civil Airport, Commissioner of the Accident Investigation Bureau (AIB), Akin Olateru, submitted an interim report to the Chief of Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Amao, at his office at NAF Headquarters, Abuja.\n\nAfter the crash, the CAS directed that a joint investigative body consisting of NAF safety officers and the AIB be constituted to investigate the causes.\n\nA joint statement by the Director of Public Relations and Information, Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet and General Manager, Public Affairs, AIB, Tunji Oketunbi, revealed that at this interim stage, a total of 27 initial findings and eight safety recommendations were made for the convening authority as well as other aviation-related agencies for immediate implementation.\n\nThey further disclosed that it is expected that the final report would contain the flight data recorder readout, the reviewed operator\u2019s and service provider\u2019s standard operating procedures as well as other detailed analyses.\n\nWhile receiving the report, the CAS reiterated the main essence of activating the \u2018joint investigative\u2019 clause contained in the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed between the NAF and the AIB on July 1, 2020.\n\nHe said successful collaboration is a clear indication of the potency of collaboration in aircraft accident investigation, which must be encouraged.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "\u2022Gas transportation code attracts $1bn investment\n\n\u2022Regulator calls for industry collaboration on PIA\n\nEmmanuel Addeh\n\nBuoyed by an impressive revenue performance, which has seen it generating 70 per cent of its initial target of N3.2 trillion, the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) has raised the bar and now targets N5 trillion income by year-end\n\nThe oil and gas industry regulator noted that the recently launched gas transportation network code had already generated over $1 billion in investments. It called for industry synergy to ensure that President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s vision for the sector was realised.\n\nSpeaking during a visit to the Abuja head office of Executive Secretary of the Petroleum Technology Development Fund (PTDF), Dr. Bello Gusau, Executive Secretary of DPR, Mr. Sarki Auwalu, explained that as of the end of August, over 70 per cent of the initial N3.2 trillion revenue target had been realised, making the organisation to set a new N5 trillion target.\n\nAuwalu said he was at the PTDF headquarters as part of efforts to strengthen collaboration with other agencies in the oil and gas sector, stating that as a capacity building organisation, PTDF and DPR have a lot in common. He said plans were already in place to pursue the new revenue target, hinting that parties in the years between 2005 and 2007 oil bid rounds have started paying part of their signature bonuses to halt the activation of the \u201cno work programme\u201d bond.\n\nThe DPR executive secretary explained, \u201cLast year, we exceeded our revenue target. We were given N1.5 trillion, but we were able to generate N2.7 trillion for government and this year, our revenue budget was N3.2 trillion and as of August, we had generated up to 70 per cent. So, it is obvious that this year, we are going to exceed the target.\n\n\u201cWe are targeting N5 trillion for government, but as it is now, the N3.2 trillion as of 30 August, we had generated 70 per cent. So, with September to December, it is obvious the 30 per cent will be a walkover.\n\n\u201cWe have seen the fiscal part of the PIA and there are the 2005, 2006, 2007 bid rounds, which bonds were attached to the PSC blocks, but were not activated. They were based on work programmes. So, if you don\u2019t do work programme, we will activate the bond for you to pay and the bond is handsome. We have budgeted it in our revenue.\u201d\n\nAuwalu pointed out that because some of the bid block owners did not want the clause used, they had started writing to the DPR to pay certain percentages of their signature bonuses, so that they would retain the assets and delay activation of the clause.\n\n\u201cThey feel that if they retain the block, they will enter into the new fiscal terms and that has immensely generated serious revenue to the signature bonus account,\u201d he emphasised.\n\nWhile calling on the PTDF to be part of the work programme scheme, which will give them a full view of all the programmes in the industry, Auwalu said it was high time the industry started exporting skills to neighbouring countries that were just discovering oil. He stressed that with the recognition of seven new basins, including Sokoto, Upper Benue, Chad, Anambra, Dahomey, and the traditional Niger Delta basins, the PTDF had to fully work with sister organisations for new skills in the sector.\n\nHe stated that the leadership of the steering committee for the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) was clear-headed enough to deliver on its mandate and ensure that the right thing was done.\n\nAuwalu stated that with the national oil and gas excellence centre working with the PIA implementation committee, there was a lot of untapped potential to be explored, adding that the centre now has the capacity to see every reservoir with the latest hardware and software.\n\nAccording to Auwalu, \u201cWe have 7,100 discovered reservoirs in Nigeria, but we are producing from 1,331. We have producing reservoirs of 1,700, but we are not producing from all these oil and gas reservoirs. We have 18 billion barrels of oil in P3 reserves and in P2 areas.\n\n\u201cWe have 68 TCF of gas in P2 areas and 70 per cent of this can be produced, giving us capacity to migrate and increase our reserve base as a nation and that was achieved after the establishment of NOGEC centre.\u201d\n\nAuwalu said with the help of the gas transportation network code that had registered shippers, aggregators, and gas producers in the network, investment generation exceeding $1 billion had been achieved.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to push until we are satisfied that history has been made and the country is de-risked and there\u2019s more investment coming into the country,\u201d he explained.\n\nIn his remarks, Gusau stated that the managements of both organisations were sorting out all the issues raised during the PTDF\u2019s earlier visit to the DPR. He expressed appreciation to Auwalu for the collaboration.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Asks FG to sell off N900bn dead assets to enhance fiscal position\n\n\u2022Nigeria\u2019s public debt grows to N35tn, says DMO\n\nNdubuisi Francis and James Emejo in Abuja\n\nNigeria\u2019s current public debt stock is unsustainable even though the country\u2019s debt-to-Gross Domestic Product (GDP) ratio at 35 per cent seems comfortable, Chairman of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s Economic Advisory Council (EAC), Dr. Doyin Salami, has said. Salami also lamented that with debt service-to-revenue ratio at 97.7 per cent (January to May 2021), the country\u2019s public debt profile was unmaintainable.\n\nThe assessment comes on the heels of Buhari\u2019s fresh loan request, in a letter to the National Assembly seeking the legislature\u2019s approval of $4.179 billion ($4.054 billion and $125 million) and \u00a3710 million external loans.\n\nThis is just as the Debt Management Office (DMO) yesterday disclosed that Nigeria\u2019s total public debt, comprising states and federal government debt obligations, grew by 7.75 per cent, from N32.916 trillion in December 31, 2020, to N35.465 trillion as of June 30, 2021.\n\nAccording to Salami, the country\u2019s debt stock is estimated to hit about N54 trillion when Ways and Means as well as the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) liabilities and projected fiscal deficit for 2021 are put into consideration.\n\nTo improve revenue, therefore, the economist said the government must block leakages, unlock opportunities at state level, improve tax efficiency and coverage, and sell-off dead assets, which are estimated at $900 billion.\n\nSalami, in a presentation on \u201cThe State of the Economy,\u201d pointed out that the federal government\u2019s expenditure had been on the increase, and at a faster pace than its revenue. He added that public debt had continued to expand on the back of growing fiscal deficit.\n\nHe said from January to May 2021, actual fiscal deficit was N3.01 trillion, representing 53.8 per cent of total budgeted deficit for 2021.\n\nSalami stated, \u201cWhile overall expenditure has grown by 102 per cent, from N5 trillion to N10.1 trillion between 2015 and 2020, revenue increased by just 15 per cent.\n\n\u201cThis subdued government revenue is as a result of constraints around domestic production/investment; low tax base, as tax revenue to GDP still revolves around seven per cent; limited effort to explore and unlock opportunities for revenue generation at state level; over-centralisation and issues relating to efficiency in revenue collection.\u201d\n\nThe economist pointed out that macroeconomic stability, consistency of policy and regulation, sectoral reforms, human capital development, and resolution of the security crisis were key to the economy\u2019s ability to rebound. He also stated that the investment climate in the country currently faced major headwinds, as total foreign investment inflows into Nigeria remained low.\n\nThe presidential advisor said foreign direct investment (FDI) inflow was $875 million in the second quarter of 2021, which was the lowest quarterly inflow since first quarter of 2016.\n\nSalami said FDI inflow into Nigeria had revolved around $1 billion in the last five years, adding that FDI inflow in the second quarter of 2021 was $78 million, even lower than Q2 2020.\n\nHe said the country\u2019s investment climate was being constrained by macroeconomic instability, policy inconsistency, inadequate infrastructure, insecurity, as well as tough business climate.\n\nSalami said the way forward for the country was for the state Houses of Assembly to help in improving state competitiveness by reallocating spending priorities. He said more emphasis should be given to human capital development and the provision of social amenities for the populace. Among other things, Salami said they serve as champions of Ease of Doing Business, adding that the legislative bodies can review existing legal impediments to doing business in the states.\n\nThe steps, according to him, would include amending tax laws; reforming procurement laws to support indigenous private sector; improving access to construction permits; and making it easier to register properties.\n\nNigeria\u2019s Public Debt Grows to N35tn\n\nMeanwhile, Nigeria\u2019s total public debt, comprising states and federal government debt obligations, rose by 7.75 per cent, from N32.916 trillion in December 31, 2020, to N35.465 trillion as of June 30, 2021.\n\nThe federal government carries 83.07 per cent of the debt burden while the states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) account for 16.93 per cent\n\nDomestic debt accounts for 68.40 per cent while the external component stands at 38.60 per cent.\n\nDirector General of the Debt Management Office (DMO), Ms. Patience Oniha, who gave the figures during a virtual debt management presentation to the media yesterday, said while the total external debt component stood at N12.706 trillion as of December 31, 2020, it rose to N13.711 trillion as of June 30, 2021.\n\nOniha also said total domestic debt increased from N20.210 trillion as of December 2020, to N21.754 trillion as of June 30, 2021.\n\nA breakdown of this gives N17.632 trillion for the federal government, while N4.122 trillion is for states and the Federal FCT.\n\nOf the N13.711 trillion external debt, the federal government only accounts for N11.828 trillion while the states and FCT make up the balance of N1.883 trillion.\n\nExplaining the latest move by the federal government to secure $4.054 billion, \u20ac710 million and $125m fresh borrowing, Oniha stated that it had nothing to do with President Muhammadu Buhari as an individual.\n\nAccording to her, approval has already been secured from the Federal Executive Council (FEC) and the National Assembly under the under the 2018-2020 External Borrowing (Rolling) Plan to finance capital projects.\n\nOniha noted that there were entrenched processes and statutory instruments, including annual budgets, anchored on the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), which allowed borrowing.\n\nBuhari had on Tuesday asked the Senate to approve $4.054 billion, \u20ac710 million and $125 million fresh external loans to fund projects captured under the 2018-2021 borrowing plan.\n\nThe president said the projects listed in the borrowing plan were to be financed through sovereign loans from the World Bank, French Development Agency (AFD), China-Exim Bank, International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), Credit Suisse Group and Standard Chartered/China Export and Credit (SINOSURE).\n\nHe said the loans would be used to fund federal and state governments\u2019 projects that cut across key sectors, such as infrastructure, health, agriculture and food security, energy, education and human capital development, and COVID-19 response efforts.\n\nOniha also spoke on the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) overdrafts to the federal government. She said at the beginning of the year, they stood at N10 trillion, and must have increased by now. When added to the current debt profile, it would certainly increase the debt figures, she stated.\n\nBut she noted that the process of adding the CBN loans had commenced, adding that the approval of the Federal Executive Council and the National Assembly would be secured to do that.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Says no recoveries yet\n\nBy Alex Enumah\n\nThe Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), has written the 36 state governors of the federation regarding the state of stamp duty collection and remittance in the country.\n\nMalami, in the letter, stated that although recoveries are being conducted for the Federal Ministries, Departments, Agencies and financial institutions but, \u201cat this stage liabilities are being established, and no actual recovery has been made\u201d.\n\nThe letters, according to Malami\u2019s media aide, Dr Umar Gwandu, were written pursuant to the provision of Section 111 of the Stamp Duty Act, which provides that \u201call duties, fines, penalties and debts due to the government of the federation imposed by this Act shall be recoverable in a summarily manner in the name of the Attorney General of the Federation or the state\u201d.\n\nIn a statement made available to journalists on Wednesday, the media aide added that the letters were for the purpose of compliance with audit and recovery of back years of stamp duty from January 15, 2016 to June 30, 2020.\n\n\u201cPursuant to Mr. President\u2019s approval and directives, I also wish to request Your Excellency to direct the state Ministries, Departments, Agencies, and Regulatory Institutions of Financial Sector to engage and grant access to the appointed recovery agents for the purpose of the audit and recovery of Stamp Duty to ensure that all established liabilities are remitted as appropriate,\u201d the letter read in part.\n\nGwandu noted that Section 111 of the Stamp Duty Act granted the AGF an exclusive power to recover any outstanding payment or remittances related to stamp duty.\n\nHe explained that what the AGF did was to activate those powers, conduct the audit and recovery of back years stamp duty in collaboration with stakeholders.\n\nHe said the Federal Government of Nigeria has set up an Inter-Ministerial Committee on Audit and Recovery of Back years Stamp Duties from January 15, 2016 to June 30, 2020.\n\nMembers of the committee were drawn from the Office of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice in collaboration with relevant agencies including the Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), Office of the Accountant General of the Federation, Ministry of Finance, Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), and Revenue Mobilization and Fiscal Allocation Commission (RMAFC), among others.\n\nThe statement said in view of the need to provide a comprehensive overview of the process and to properly understand the task, the AGF organized a meeting with the attorneys general of states since they have similar powers with respect of stamp duty of Ministries, Departments, Agencies and Financial Institutions in their respective states.\n\nOnly last month, the attorneys-general of the 36 states have sued Malami over the alleged failure of the federal government to remit funds generated from stamp duties into states\u2019 accounts.\n\nThe states argued that they are the sole authority to collect stamp duties and not the federal government.\n\nMeanwhile, states starting with Rivers are challenging the right of the FIRS to collect Value Added Tax (VAT), with a Federal High Court already given judgment in favour of the state.\n\nJustice Stephen Pam of a Federal High Court in Port Harcourt had, in a judgment delivered August 9, stopped the FIRS from collecting VAT in Rivers and directed the state government to take charge of the duty.\n\nFollowing the court judgment, Lagos State asked FIRS to stop issuing demand notices for VAT payments in the state, as well as going ahead to pass its own law on VAT.\n\nAlthough, the Court of Appeal, Abuja had made a temporary order asking Rivers and Lagos not to give effect to the judgment of Justice Pam, the Rivers State Government however on Tuesday appealed the ruling, asking the Supreme Court to nullify the temporary order restraining it from obeying the order of the Federal High Court.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Germany-based Kingsley Kanu has filed a suit against the Kenyan government at the High Court of Kenya, Nairobi for its involvement in the abduction and extraordinary rendition of his brother and leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu to Nigeria.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit filed on Tuesday, there are five respondents which are the Cabinet secretary, Director of Immigration Services, Director of Criminal Investigations, Commanding Officer of Police at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport and the Attorney-General of Kenya.\n\nNnamdi Kanu\n\nKanu's special counsel in Nigeria, Aloy Ejimakor disclosed this to SaharaReporters on Thursday with evidence of court documents.\n\nThe lawsuit read partly, \u201cThis petition concerns the unconstitutional and unlawful removal engineered by the respondents through abduction, denial of fair administrative action in violation of the human dignity of the subject: Nwannekaenvi Nnamdi Kenny Okwu\u2019Kan (Mr Kanu) whose presence in Kenya was lawful and non-threatening.\n\n\u201cThis petition seeks a declaration of rights and appropriate reliefs against the involuntary and illegal return of Mr. Kanu to Nigeria when there were substantial grounds for believing that the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment that is prohibited by the Constitution of Kenya and the human rights treaties in force in Kenya.\n\n\u201cThe petitioner is a German citizen ordinarily residing in Munich within Germany. This petitioner brings this petition on behalf of his brother, Mr. Kanu.\u201d\n\nDOCUMENTS: Nnamdi Kanu Sues Kenya Government for 'Illegally Detaining, Extraditing' Him to Nigeria by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\nWhile speaking on the suit with BBC according to the audiotape obtained by SaharaReporters through Ejimakor, Kanu\u2019s lead counsel in Kenya, Prof. George Wajackoyah said there are pieces of proof that the Kenyan government was culpable despite its denial of involvement.\n\nWajackoyah stated that Kanu cannot be tried in Nigeria because there was no due process in repatriating him to Nigeria, which made it an extra rendition, and the fact that Kanu is a British citizen and has renounced his Nigerian citizenship.\n\nHe said. \u201cWe filed a petition today (Tuesday) against the Kenyan government and various actors in this case for their unconstitutional and unlawful removal which denied our client his human rights, which was engineered by 1st to 5th respondents in the violation of human rights of Nnamdi Kanu.\n\n\u201cWe are serving the respondents and from there, we take on. Once we filed and served, then the court will give us a date, and that should be within a very short period of time because it was served under a certificate of urgency.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the evidence that indicted the Kenyan government, the Kenyan lawyer disclosed, \u201cWe have copies of his passport and a stamp that he was indeed in Kenya. We also have evidence he was in his residence on a particular day. We also have material proof that he was at the airport on a particular day to meet a friend and there he was arrested. Definitely, he was kidnapped.\u201d\n\nWajackoyah further told BBC, \u201cWhy on earth will the Kenyan government deport a British citizen to Nigerian territory. Kanu has renounced his Nigerian citizenship. Extradition and extra rendition are two things. Extradition has to follow due process, you can\u2019t just pick up somebody and throw him. That\u2019s barbaric. It\u2019s outlawed by international law.\n\n\u201cIf they are trying a Nigerian national, certainly (they will win). But, if they are trying a British national, not at all. It is an abuse of the court process for the Nigerian court to try a British citizen who has no connection with Nigeria and without due process. So, I have been given instruction by his family in London and his brother in Germany to file a lawsuit against the Kenyan government.\u201d",

          "text": "Amid reports of his plan to defect to the All Progressives Congress (APC) from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), former President Goodluck Jonathan is only biding his time for some of the conditions he had given the ruling party to be met.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that apart from that, the APC cabal loyal to President Muhammadu Buhari is indeed keen to bring Jonathan into the party for a number of reasons, including damaging the ambition of the national leader of the party, Bola Tinubu to become Nigeria\u2019s president in 2023.\n\nGoodluck Jonathan\n\nA top source told SaharaReporters that the Buhari had started courting Jonathan since 2020 to bring him into the APC to run for the presidency and succeed Buhari.\n\nAccording to the source, the Presidency cabal wants to make Jonathan the next president as they know he won't investigate atrocities committed by Buhari's regime.\n\nAnd Jonathan, who is purportedly nursing a presidential ambition to complete two terms in office, an opportunity denied him by the APC in the 2015 presidential election, has agreed to play the game, especially considering the slim chances he has in the PDP with the wealth and connection of former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar.\n\nAtiku was the PDP presidential candidate in the 2019 election.\n\nAlthough Atiku has yet to declare interest in the race, he appears to be testing the waters, as some groups showing support for his 2023 ambition have already emerged.\n\nThe source further said Jonathan is also wary of the threat posed by the ambitions of the Governors of Sokoto and Rivers states, Aminu Tambuwal and Nyesom Wike respectively, said to be considering a joint ticket.\n\nHowever, Jonathan was said to have given certain conditions to Buhari's cabal which have yet to be fully fulfilled hence the delay in joining the ruling party.\n\n\u201cAbout a year ago Jonathan started consulting with APC to see how he could join the party. Jonathan realised that his chances in PDP were slim due to Atiku\u2019s influence and opposition posed by PDP leadership, including Wike who is interested in a joint ticket with Tambuwal,\u201d the source said.\n\nNoting how the move by the Buhari cabal is also kill another bird, which is the ambition of Tinubu to succeed Buhari in 2023, the source added, \u201cBuhari and his cabal had decided to discard Tinubu and started courting Jonathan. Jonathan assisted APC candidate in his state to win election but a court squashed his victory before he could be sworn in.\n\nThe Supreme Court in February 2020 sacked David Lyon of the APC as governor-elect of Bayelsa State, barely 24 hours to his inauguration. Lyon had the support of Jonathan in the election and it paid off as he won the November 16, 2019 governorship election in the state.\n\nBut a five-member panel of the apex court led by Justice Mary Odili nullified the election of Mr Lyon on the grounds that his deputy, Biobarakuma Degi-Eremienyo, presented false information to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), which aided his qualification for the last governorship election.\n\nThe Supreme Court had agreed with an earlier ruling of the high court on the matter, leading INEC to subsequently withdraw the certificate of return issued to Lyon and Degi-Eremienyo, as they had a joint ticket.\n\nThe source continued, \u201cBuhari cabal knew Jonathan could only do one term, in fact only 2 years constitutionally. They also know Jonathan is a softie who won\u2019t go after members of the current regime.\n\n\u201cBut Jonathan insisted on one condition that monies and assets of his which were seized and frozen by the Buhari government should be returned including, those belonging to his wife, Patience. He told them he had no money and the cabal agreed that they would unfreeze his assets and bankroll him.\n\n\u201cHe has insisted that they must demonstrate good fate before he would take the plunge. And they have started to resolve some of the issues raised by Jonathan. For instance, one of his cousins $40 million was returned via two court rulings.\u201d\n\nRecall that in May 2019, an Abuja Division of the Federal High Court discharged and acquitted Jonathan\u2019s cousin, Robert Azibaola, of $40 million laundering charges filed against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).\n\nThe judge, Nnamdi Dimgba held that no credible evidence was adduced to establish the offence of money laundering against Azibaola.\n\nThe source, however, said the former President is due in the Gambia on a diplomatic assignment in the coming week and might take the plunge by joining the APC when he returns as there are speculations that his seized assets might have been released by then.\n\n\u201cI think the Jonathan\u2019s people were holding out for the release of monies seized from his fronts. Conversations were around the issue of monies frozen and all. The monies may have been released Buhari and the cabal have backed themselves into a tight corner. But fortunately, Nigeria has moved on from 2015. Jonathan has no base in the South-South.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the National Secretary, APC Caretaker, and Extra-ordinary Convention Planning Committee, John Akpanudoedehe, on Wednesday stated that Jonathan can contest the next Presidential election in 2023 if he joins the party.\n\nHe said this while featuring as a guest on Channels Television\u2019s Politics Today.\n\nHe revealed this when asked about reports saying Jonathan is considering joining the ruling party.\n\nAkpanudoedehe said the ex-president will be given a founding member status if he joins the party that defeated his party, Peoples Democratic Party in 2015 and got him out of office.\n\nThe APC official, however, noted that Jonathan would compete with other members of the party before getting the ticket, stressing that he will not get an automatic ticket.\n\nAkpanudoedehe said, \u201cWe will welcome him; that will also strengthen the party.\n\n\u201cThe last National Executive Council of the party actually gave a blanket approval to any individual that if you join APC today, it is as if you are a founding member of the party.\n\n\u201cSo, anyone who joins today has the same opportunity to run for any office in this party. It has always been so, so I am not speculating.\u201d\n\nThere have been reports that Jonathan would join the APC but the PDP has insisted that the former President would not be leaving the party.",

          "text": "After about a year of speculation and anticipation, Apple has released the iPhone 13 series.\n\nDuring a virtual event on Tuesday, Apple announced that the iPhone 13 will come in four new models: the iPhone 13, 13 Mini, 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max.\n\nWhat\u2019s new about the iPhone 13 series?\n\nWell, it looks very much like the iPhone 12 but two notable main updates were made to the phone\u2019s display and camera. The new phones will also run on the latest version of Apple\u2019s operating system, iOS 15. They also come with larger batteries, more storage (maximum of 1 Terabyte storage), a new A15 Bionic processor, a smaller notch and new camera features.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nThe iPhone 13 starts at $829 for 128GB, which is twice the storage the iPhone 12 started with; while the iPhone 13 Mini starts at $729 for 128GB of storage. The iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max start at $999 and $1,099 respectively, for 128GB storage.\n\nIPHONE 13 SERIES US PRICES AND STORAGE\n\nPhone 128GB storage 256GB storage 512GB storage 1TB storage iPhone 13 Mini $729 $829 $1,029 NA iPhone 13 $829 $929 $1,129 NA iPhone 13 Pro $999 $1,099 $1,299 $1,499 iPhone 13 Pro Max $1,099 $1,199 $1,399 $1,599\n\nWhy the iPhone 13 series are more expensive in African countries\n\nOver the years, there\u2019s been a noticeable price difference for Apple products in African countries. So, TechCabal reached out to iPhone retailers in different African countries to find out when the iPhone 13 will be available and how much it\u2019ll cost.\n\nNigeria\n\n\u201cOf course, you can expect that since the iPhone will be available on September 24, we\u2019ll have it in Nigeria on or before October 1.\u201d Emmanuel Osho, CEO of Bodds IT and Apple certified technician told TechCabal. \u201cThe price will be about 30% higher because it\u2019s new and there\u2019s a lot of hype around it.\u201d\n\nDespite the increased margin on the iPhone, Osho expects that the new iPhones will still sell out fast. A positive effect of the people purchasing the new iPhone 13 is that they\u2019ll most times trade in their older iPhones, making room for other people to buy them at a more affordable price.\n\nSouth Africa\n\nIn South Africa, the iPhone 13 will reportedly be available from October 8 according to iStoreZA, an Apple premium reseller. Although the store hasn\u2019t revealed the prices, the iPhone 13 Pro 128GB is expected to go for around R23,499 ($1,640), while the iPhone 13 Pro Max 128GB could retail for around R25,999 ($1,815). This is a high price margin of over 50%, most likely influenced by the fact that an iPhone or iPod attracts 7% duties and 15% VAT in South Africa per Business Insider.\n\nYou can expect that the price of iPhones from other retailers to be around the same price range as the majority of Apple products sold in South Africa come through a sole distributor, Core Computer Group.\n\nKenya\n\nIn Kenya, TechCabal spoke to a Salute iWorld, an authorized Apple product retailer at Yaya Center, Nairobi.\n\nA representative of the retailer told us that they expect to have the iPhone 13 in their stores within the next two weeks.\n\nWhile he couldn\u2019t comment on how much it\u2019ll cost he mentioned that in general Apple products are charged a 16% import fee with an additional 6% added on for Value Added Tax (VAT). This is aside from the transportation cost and the profit margin that the retailer will add to arrive at a final price for the public.\n\nThe iPhone 13 looks like it offers a bit over its predecessor. But not so much that it\u2019ll compel many to upgrade. In the context of Africa, it brings up the question of whether the minor upgrades are worth paying at least an additional 30% \u2013 50% to get the new iPhone 13 in Nigeria, Kenya or South Africa.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "text": "A few months ago, Udoma Nseobong took a \u20a630,000 ($60) loan from CashLion Credit. He repaid the weekly interest consistently for six weeks until his final payment.\n\nUnfortunately, he defaulted on his final payment by a day due to unforeseen circumstances. This short period was enough time for Nseobong to be declared by CashLion credit as a fraudster on the run with his entire family to his contacts (OP: ICIR Nigeria).\n\nThis incident is one out of many which indicate that digital lenders will go the extra mile, sometimes using unethical methods, to get their loans back.\n\nNotably, despite the criticism against unethical practices by lenders, some still justify this method of debt collection.\n\n\u201cThere is no defamation of character involved when we trust people we\u2019ve never seen by giving them money and when it\u2019s time to pay they don\u2019t pay,\u201d Titilayo Adetonya, a customer representative for digital lender CashLion told The ICIR.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s lawful to send those messages to their contacts because we warn them before we send those messages to their contacts and that\u2019s how we get our money,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter many years of unending complaints, on August 17, the National Information and Technology Development Agency (NITDA), slammed Soko Loan Company Limited, a Nigerian digital lending platform, with a fine of \u20a610 million for privacy invasion. Soko Loan was found guilty of unilaterally sending privacy-invading messages to the loan defaulters\u2019 contacts.\n\nThis sanction, although a mere warning shot, is the first public attempt by NITDA to address this prevalent issue. The sanction served as a clarion call for digital lenders to use ethical alternative methods to collect loans.\n\nBut what does an ethical alternative look like and how effective is it?\n\nAn alternative approach\n\nJulian Flosbach knows what it\u2019s like to look for better alternatives, as he experienced it first hand when he was the general manager at FairMoney, a Nigeria-based digital lender turned digital bank. He helped grow the company from 8 employees to over 120 employees; and in that same period, Julian also supervised doling out loans to over a million customers.\n\n\u201cIn the early days when giving out a few loans, it\u2019s easy to have a team of five in charge of collections but as things scale up and you have to manage over one million borrowers you start reconsidering a few things,\u201d Julian said. \u201cWhen you have 100,000 defaulters [10% default rate], you have to ask yourself, \u2018Do I want to be a fintech lender or do I want to be a collection company?\u2019\n\nAt one point, FairMoney had as many as 80 employees managing collections in-house; but it quickly became clear that running in-house collections moved the company\u2019s focus away from its business model: giving out loans.\n\nSo the company decided to search for an external solution, and found themselves with the best available option at that time: business process outsourcing (BPO) firms who do customer service for big banks and telcos. But it didn\u2019t take long to see that there were some cracks in the collection process.\n\n\u201cIf you want to do collections with operational excellence then just calling customers actually doesn\u2019t always work. These BPOs don\u2019t have customised computer systems for collections, rather they have generic customer relationship management tools (CRMs) or predictive dialers. So for instance they call customers once a week, instead of when the customer actually should or wants to be called. It\u2019s not very efficient.\u201d\n\nThis harrowing experience led him to team up with Moses Nmor (Chief Product Officer), and Chukwudi Enyi (Chief Operations Officer) to start BFree, Africa\u2019s first digital credit collection company. All three co-founders worked together at FairMoney.\n\nThe company saw an opportunity to be one of the less than ten digital credit collection companies grappling for a slice of a $14.4b credit collection market in emerging markets. In emerging markets, BFree\u2019s competitors are India\u2019s Credgenics (recently raised $25m Series A) and CreditMate (backed by Paytm), FLOW in Singapore and Blu365 in Brazil.\n\nIn the space of over a year since it launched, BFree has grown to nearly 460,000 active customers from over 20 lenders in Nigeria and Kenya.\n\nWhat does Ethical credit management look like?\n\nLooking away from the approach of other debt collection solutions, most of which thrive on humiliating customers, BFree focuses on ethics and technology in debt recovery.\n\nBFree helps lenders collect loans from their borrowers for a fee. The company charges a commission on the repayments that a lender receives. This commission depends on the lender\u2019s portfolio size and quality amongst other factors.\n\nBFree\u2019s ethical approach to loan recovery is guided by a data-backed belief that the majority of customers take a loan with the intention to repay. Of course, with the exception of isolated cases of fraudsters and fraud victims.\n\nThis approach is validated by the fact that the average 90 days default rate of Nigeria\u2019s top digital lending companies is 10% \u2014 FairMoney (10%), Carbon (11%), Branch (<10%). This means that only about 10% of Nigerians (there\u2019s no central register, but Flosbach estimates about 10-15 million people) default on loans.\n\n\u201cThe majority of the customers (70-75%) fall into the category of folks that want to pay but cannot repay. This is usually due to loss of income \u2014 loss of job or the business went bad or there was an emergency that took away the money.\u201d\n\nThis is a common case in a country like Nigeria where people live from hand to mouth. Without insurance, anything can topple their sustainability.\n\nAt BFree customers are appraised based on two factors: willingness and capability to pay.\n\n\u201cWhen a lender like Branch or FairMoney gives us a portfolio, we assess and underwrite the loan. We take their behavioural data and build two things: collectability score and use case. Then we move these into a collection funnel.\u201d\n\nThis debt collection process basically starts as a self-service platform where customers can log in and see their own repayment plans. At this phase, customers get SMS messages and perform loan repayment activities themselves. This way BFree reduces the number of man-hours spent on making calls and customers aren\u2019t forced to deal with unexpected phone calls during working hours.\n\nIn the case where a customer defaults, BFree reaches out to the borrower to find out why and to also get a promised date of payment (verbal agreement). This simply involves reaching out and asking them for when they\u2019ll be able to make a payment. Based on the agreed dates, automated reminders are put in place.\n\nBFree operates call centres with about 200 agents who are responsible for reaching out to customers. BFree\u2019s goal is to make the process of debt recovery 95% automated in the next few years.\n\n\u201cThe story of collections has gotten bad press with BPOs taking data and threatening customers. Automating this process helps remove the risk of this happening because a bot will never threaten a customer.\u201c\n\nWhat happens when customers default\n\nFlosbach acknowledges that one of the inherent risks of lending is that you have to accept that there\u2019s always going to be default. He believes that the way out here is to accept that some customers won\u2019t repay, and assist customers that will repay as much as possible.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no portfolio in the world that doesn\u2019t have default. In this case, you have to assess whether it\u2019s a natural default or an operational default.\u201d\n\nIn a natural default, the customers don\u2019t repay because of an unexpected occurrence like a health emergency. When this happens the best case is to re-assess the customer status and agree on a different repayment plan.\n\n\u201cWe should normalize the fact that customers have financial emergencies, the same way nobody blames people for going to the doctor when they fall unexpectedly sick.\u201c\n\nIn an operational default customers don\u2019t repay because of a flaw in the loan collection process. For example, customers don\u2019t get the right repayment plan or they\u2019re not aware of how to make the repayment i.e they don\u2019t know which bank account to pay to.\n\nBFree\u2019s process helps to ensure that operational default decreases as much as possible. So far 95% of customers have rated their experience with BFree as good or satisfactory, a hint that the company\u2019s approach is effective.\n\nAs lending expands beyond an activity being performed by only traditional banks and digital lenders to one that almost every company can, BFree\u2019s value proposition remains relevant.\n\nFlosbach believes that BFree\u2019s ultimate goal is to increase trust in the African lending space.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re increasing trust in the financial retail market by decreasing risk and giving businesses a better margin.\u201d\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

At the event, I learnt practical strategies on how to navigate through Nigeria\u2019s unique market. With the grant my business won, I was able to get a refrigerator for my business, which was a pressing need at the time.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in the workplace, and this also plays out in the venture capital space. According to Crunchbase, global VC funding to female founders dropped in 2020. Their figures show that 800 female-founded startups received $4.9bn from investors \u2014 a 27% decrease from the same period in 2019.\n\nOne reason for this is low representation in VC firms. Axios reports that 12.4% of decision-makers in US venture capital firms are women. And only 10% of West African startups that cumulatively raised $1m between 2010 and 2020 had at least one female co-founder.\n\nThis is a problem Yemi Keri, one of a handful of women investing in African startups, is passionate about solving. After getting a taste of angel investing with the Lagos Angel Network and seeing how hard it was for women to get funded, she co-founded Rising Tide Africa to get more women involved in angel investing.\n\nTechpoint Africa caught up with her for a chat, and she held nothing back as she shared her experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nI got into angel investing by referral with the Lagos Angel Network. Now I\u2019m on the board, but I got started there. I think this was 2014/2015, and Tomi Davies had started off Lagos Angel Network and wanted a group of us to come in and understand what it was all about. If I recall correctly, he brought about 50 of us together, and every so often, we would meet and listen to pitches.\n\nI used to watch and listen to the kind of questions that were asked. My background is in information technology, so this was new to me at the time. I made two investments \u2014 in Cafe Neo and Big Cabal \u2014 with Lagos Angel Network, and that\u2019s how I came into angel investment.\n\nWhat was the attraction to these companies?\n\nFor Cafe Neo, it was the revenue and expansion model and the target audience (youthful demography). In the case of Big Cabal, the passionate team, the possibility of catering for multiple audiences, and the various products that were in the pipeline when we invested won me over.\n\nWhat influenced the founding of Rising Tide?\n\nAround 2016, I began to toy with the idea of having a female-focused angel network because many of the people who came to pitch were men who got more attention and interest than the few women who showed up. And this made me wonder. It wasn\u2019t by design, but I began to notice that, first of all, the questions they asked women were kind of different.\n\nSecondly, the women were not communicating effectively to the investor team, and the kinds of businesses they pitched were slightly different. Women often do their businesses with a sense of passion. As we approached 2017, a lady came to pitch one of the best products in the healthcare sector \u2014 it still is today \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t convey it very well.\n\nI think it was her first few months of fundraising, so Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien and I took her aside and began to mentor her. We took her to pitches; we would put a group of women together and tell her to pitch. We would then question her thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nAfter a while, we brought her back to the team, and everybody was impressed and wanted to invest. They got to the point of negotiations, and the rest is history. Though we did not invest then, she\u2019s doing well. I knew that there was a gap and that we had hit on something we could develop.\n\nSo Ndidi and I got together and started Rising Tide Africa, which has been my major focus. We founded Rising Tide to increase women\u2019s participation in angel investing so that they can see it as an asset class; the end goal is to invest in more female founders. We believe that with more female angel investors, we can reduce the gender funding gap for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the genesis of Rising Tide, and it is a vehicle in which we are now investing. Lagos Angel Network has metamorphosed into a network of networks. Now we have different networks within Lagos Angel Network.\n\nHow many startups has Rising Tide invested in?\n\nBy 2019, we had done six. By the end of 2020, we had 15 investments. In 2021 we have made six investments. That would mean 21 investments in all, and we have completed the due diligence for two others, for which we are about to call for funds.\n\nHow many investments have you made?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m on my 19th investment.\n\nWhat is Rising Tide\u2019s average ticket size?\n\nWe initially said we would start with $25,000, but so far, our largest ticket size is $289,000. We intend to do between $50,000 and $200,000.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to increase female participation in both startups and angel investing. What else drives your investment mission?\n\nRising Tide is set up on four major pillars, one of which is investments.\n\nThe other thing that we do is education. We now have about 64 members at Rising Tide, and some of them are new to angel investing, so we have to do a lot of educating.\n\nWe try to teach them about things going on in the ecosystem so they can be better investors. We also educate the entrepreneurs. Over the years, we\u2019ve organised training and masterclasses for our founders and others in the ecosystem. We are now developing Entrepreneurship 101, which contains several courses to help entrepreneurs become investment-ready. We plan to develop other curricula that will be required for the ecosystem.\n\nThe other arm is networking. Just like what you\u2019re doing, having us talk about investments and enabling entrepreneurs to have access to investors, we also do our bit in terms of networking. We attend events where we meet many entrepreneurs.\n\nWe organise events where entrepreneurs can meet many investors not only within Rising Tide but also outside. We do a lot of coaching and panel roles for other networks or groups of networks. So we try to develop not only Rising Tide but also the ecosystem.\n\nThe fourth arm is mentoring, which is very crucial. We act as individual mentors for our portfolio. We don\u2019t believe that investments alone are what we need to provide for our businesses. We believe in growing with them and holding their hands.\n\nYou get a pool of people who can mentor you for a period. So we have one-offs like that. We also have mentoring sessions where we spend three to six months mentoring a business. Our goal is to mentor them until they are investment-ready, either for Rising Tide or any other network willing to invest in them.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is giving back to the ecosystem and ensuring that it develops so that our businesses do not die within the first three years. Those are the four pillars that Rising Tide operates by.\n\nAre there specific markets or industries that you focus on?\n\nWe are sector-agnostic; however, we try to invest in certain sectors. We look at sectors that have volume and the most impact on our economy \u2014 like education, for instance. Apart from education, we\u2019re looking at something related to healthcare. So education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, essential goods, and services are our areas of interest.\n\nHow do you determine what startups to invest in?\n\nWe have an investment process that guides us. First of all, tech and tech-enabled startups get our attention. We prioritise female-owned, female-led, and gender diverse companies. We look at their business model critically. We look at the market. Of course, we look at their financials and their corporate documents.\n\nSo we filter based on our investment philosophy. After we do that, if they qualify, we look at factors like their team. We look at their qualification and prior experience, their commitment to the business itself; we don\u2019t want people doing part-time coming to us for investment.\n\nWe look at diversity. We go as far as looking at who sits on your board of directors and talking to some of your references. We also look at your business model. Don\u2019t forget that these are early-stage startups, and there\u2019s only so far we can go in terms of due diligence, but we look at these basic things.\n\nWhat are their revenue sources? Who are their potential customers and suppliers? What kind of pipeline do they have? What\u2019s their value proposition? We look at the size of the market and the key drivers within that landscape. These are external things that we look at in terms of whether there\u2019s a unique selling point, the barriers to entry, and the competitive landscape.\n\nSome don\u2019t have historical financials, but we look at how objective their revenue projections are? What will their gross margins be? Their burn rate of cash \u2014 how long our investment can carry them. Also, because we are angel investors, we want to exit between a three to five year holding period, so we look at the exit potential.\n\nThis is how we filter and look at the kind of businesses that we invest in. If we are not investing in Nigeria, we would require a local investment network in that country to co-invest with us because those are the people who understand the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI will talk about the team first. If a founder says, \u201cI am still keeping my day job until we get funding,\u201d that\u2019s a red flag because it means that the founder is not confident about their business. You will quickly lose the interest of an investor. So, when you are pitching, make sure you are fully committed to your startup.\n\nThe other thing is that while you are putting your team together, try and understand the kind of skill sets that you require based on what you are doing and ensure that you have those requisite skills. Ensure that you are not relying on one person to the point that if your technology person or CTO leaves, your startup shuts down.\n\nSome founders tend to make the CTO a co-founder, but you have to be sure about the interest of your CTO. Even though you make them your co-founder, that might not be enough to hold them down.\n\nDon\u2019t rely solely on raising capital from investors, solely being the keyword. Fundraising is a different ball game in itself, and sometimes, it makes you shift focus from your business. A founder needs to determine how much they need over a fixed period so that they\u2019re not continuously raising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re raising funds, remember that an investor does not want to fund your overhead. Do not raise $100,000 and then use it to rent a place or pay salaries. That is not what we\u2019re interested in investing in.\n\nEven if you use some of it for your overheads, let most of it be for improving or scaling your product or whatever it is that will make the business grow. We also advise founders not to give out majority equity of their business. As angel investors, we also say, \u201ctry not to take more than 15% of the business, so you do not kill it.\u201d\n\nThey will always need to have that kind of authority because if other investors are coming in down the line and you have given away 30% already without even getting to Series A, then it starts to become a major challenge.\n\nAnother issue that investors are beginning to see is the level of valuation. It\u2019s incredible how a company that started business 5 or 12 months ago and is still in product development is valuing itself at $1 million. That is ticking off a lot of investors. Be realistic in your valuation.\n\nWe are not in the mature European and American markets, so stop equating your business to startups in those regions; it is bad for the ecosystem. You have to be able to justify your valuation to angel investors. If we see that something is overvalued, we walk away.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nAmayi Foods and Migo in terms of expansion into other environments. Amayi is on Amazon Prime and sells globally, and Migo \u2014 formally Mine.io \u2014 has expanded its services to Brazil.\n\nHave you had bad investments, and how did you deal with them?\n\nIn your portfolio as an investor, you should be ready to lose some funds. Before we onboard our investors, we always tell them only to invest what will not affect their lifestyles because statistically, only one or two of your investments will become a unicorn. However, they will make up for your other investments.\n\nWe started off investing really critically in 2019. We have two that are not looking promising so far. As for the others, it\u2019s still too early for us to say they have failed. What we do when we are investing is to position the team lead of that investment as a board observer or a board member in that startup, so they act as a liaison between Rising Tide and the startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried everything from mentoring to handholding to board observing, and we\u2019ve made recommendations, but we\u2019re still watching. It\u2019s still early to say that they are really bad. We hope that the recommendations we\u2019ve made can take them out of the hole that they\u2019re in.\n\nWhat startups are in your portfolio?\n\nSo we have Migo, Amayi foods, Big Cabal, Cafe Neo, Aruwa Capital, OZ\u00c9, Kwik, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Eden, Blackbet \u2014 which we co-invested in with Lagos Angel Network.\n\nInkblot is an interesting one because we decided to try entertainment. We have Seso Global, Emergency Response Africa \u2014 very early stage but gaining a lot of traction. We have Bankly, Chekkit, and Gradely.\n\nAre there any deals that you passed on that you regret?\n\n(Laughs) There will always be deals that you pass on. I think in the early stages of Lagos Angel Network, we let Flutterwave go. We also let Paystack go. That\u2019s for Lagos Angel Network. Now, I don\u2019t know if any we let go has done well, but you will always have those companies.\n\nThere\u2019s a company called Termii. We didn\u2019t want to pass up on them, but before we could conclude, they had gotten other investors. At that time, our investment process took so long because we were at the teething stages ourselves. This was 2018/2019. As an investor, you win some and lose some.\n\nHow do you deal with the fear of missing out as an angel investor?\n\nThere will always be deals. If you miss one bus, there will always be others. If you miss out in the early stages, you might get another opportunity later. There will always be a chance for you to get on board, and if there is none, it wasn\u2019t yours.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nFor Rising Tide Africa, you can send an email to info@risingtideafrica.com. You can also visit the website at www.risingtideafrica.com if you want to join us as an angel investor. Finally, you can send your pitches to pitches@risingtideafrica.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nIndependent National Electoral Commission (INEC) Chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu has tasked the new Residents Electoral Commissioners (RECs) to take their appointments as call to service in ensuring free, fair and credible elections to deepen the nation\u2019s democracy.\n\nThe chairman made known at the headquarters of the Commission during the swearing in ceremony of the RECs, in Abuja.\n\nAccording to Prof. Yakubu, RECs as election managers, must know that their integrity is paramount to the success of their duty. \u201cLet me draw the attention of the new National and Resident Electoral Commissioners to the reality of serving in INEC. The task ahead is challenging but it is also a national call to service. It is important to quickly settle in and familiarize yourselves with the rules, procedures and responsibilities of your office.\n\n\u201dLet me reiterate once again that you should always bear in mind that a credible election draws heavily from the integrity of the election managers, I urge you to join us in raising the bar even higher\u201d.\n\nThe chairman also pointed out that, the policy of the Commission is to deploy RECS within their geo-political zones, but they will not be posted to their States of origin.\n\nHe expressed joy that all four appointees will bring to the Commission their vast knowledge and experience as scholars and administrators, stating that he is confident that the new RECs will join in furthering the frontiers of free and fair elections in Nigeria in addition to adherence to the provisions of the law in achieving success in this arduous task also as election managers.\n\n\u201cWe must be strict in the application of the law, firm in handling the public trust bestowed on us and fair in our dealings with political parties and candidates. We must remember that in discharging our responsibilities, Nigeria and Nigerians must always come first, he said.\n\nThe chairman also promised that the Biomodal Voters Accreditation System (BVAS) technology will be tracked against hijacking in the November 6 Anambra state Governorship Election.\n\nSpeaking on the November 6 Anambra State Governorship Election, he said the Commission will install a mechanism to disable and track the new Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) device in the event of theft by hoodlums.\n\nThe chairman said though the BVAS was deployed in last Saturday\u2019s Isoko South 1 State Constituency bye-election in Delta State where huge success was recorded, there were a few challenges.\n\n\u201cOnly last weekend, we piloted yet another innovation in the Isoko South 1 State Constituency bye-election in Delta State. We introduced the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) for efficient human recognition through a biometric verification mechanism using both fingerprint and facial recognition of voters.\n\n\u201cThe result of the pilot in the 84 polling units was very encouraging indeed. It took an average of just one minute for the device to correctly locate the voter in the system and another two minutes to authenticate a voter.\n\n\u201cAll voters were accredited electronically using the BVAS, The use of the incident form was eliminated: The Isoko South 1 State Constituency bye election was historic in this respect.\n\n\u201cHowever, there were a few challenges. Matching the voter\u2019s live image against the image on the register was difficult in a few instances due to the quality of pictures of some voters arising from previous voter registration.\n\n\u201cSecondly, some polling units were not bright enough when taking the photo for the facial authentication. Thirdly, there was the age-old problem of thuggery during elections Our officials were attacked and five BVAS devices snatched by hoodlums.\n\n\u201cAlthough this did not affect the elections because we deployed extra devices as part of our contingency measures. Incident is being investigated by the Police: Nevertheless, we wish to assure Nigerians that the Commission will address these challenges including the installation of a mechanism to disable and track the device in the event of theft by hoodlums.\n\n\u201cThis mechanism will be activated ahead of the forthcoming Anambra State Governorship election\u201d, Prof Yakubu said.\n\nYakubu finally charged the commissioners to abide by the oaths of office to defend the choice made by Nigerians at the polls in all elections and continue to protect the sanctity of the vote without which democratic election is meaningless\u201d.\n\nThe three new National Commissioners who were recently sworn-in by President Muhammadu Buhari are; Professor Abdullahi Zuru, a Chemist and former Vice Chancellor of Kebbi State University and Usman Danfodiyo University, Sokoto; Professor Sani Adam, a lawyer and former Deputy Vice Chancellor of the University of Abuja; and Dr Baba Bila, a Chartered Accountant and former Bursar of the University of Benin.\n\n...",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s public debt stock stood at N35.465 trillion as at June 30, Director-General of the Debt Management Office, DMO, Ms. Patience Oniha, disclosed yesterday.\n\nTotal Public Debt is composed of the domestic and external debt of the Federal Government, the 36 state governments and the Federal Capital Territory, FCT.\n\nNigeria\u2019s total public debt stock was N33.107 trillion or USD87.239 billion, as at March 31, 2021, Vanguard reported.\n\nThis indicated a N2.358 trillion rise in the debt stock from the end of the first quarter of the year to the end of the second quarter.\n\nA breakdown of the public debt figure under review indicated that that external debt was N13.711 trillion, representing 38.66 per cent.\n\nOn the other hand, domestic debt was N21.754 trillion, representing 61.34 per cent of the total stock.\n\nThe Federal Government accounted for N11. 828 trillion of the external debt and N17. 632 trillion of the domestic debt.\n\nStates and the FCT\u2019s external debt stood at N1.883 trillion, with a domestic debt stock of N4.122 trillion.\n\nThe breakdown of the external debt showed that the bulk of the debt is owed to multilaterals (World Bank Group and the African Development Bank Group), which accounted for 54.88 per cent.\n\nThe next highest category is the commercial debt (Eurobonds and Diaspora bonds) which accounted for 31.88 per cent; while bilateral (China, France, Japan, India and Germany) stood at 12. 70 per cent. Promissory Notes represent 0. 54 per cent.\n\nMs. Oniha explained that the nation had several benefits from going to source funds which included showcasing Nigeria in a positive light in the international financial markets where large pools of capital are available.\n\nIn addition, she said \u201cThe sovereign Eurobonds serve as a benchmark on the back of which several local banks have issued Eurobonds. Amongst them are Zenith Bank, Access Bank, UBA, FBN, Ecobank Nigeria and Fidelity Bank. This window opened by the sovereign enabled these Nigerian Banks raise Tier-2 Capital to meet regulatory requirements and enhanced their capacity to lend to, and, support local borrowers.\n\n\u201cIssuing Eurobonds has been a potent tool for building up Nigeria\u2019s External Reserves. A healthy level of External Reserves supports the Naira Exchange Rate and Nigeria\u2019s sovereign rating.\n\n\u201cRaising funds externally through Eurobonds to finance budget deficits reduces the level of sovereign borrowing in the domestic markets. The benefits of this are many: mitigates the risk of crowding out the private sector (more funds available at moderate rates for other borrowers in the domestic economy)\n\n\u201cThe Eurobonds are also listed in Nigeria\u2019s two (2) securities exchanges: The Nigerian Exchange Limited and FMDQ Securities Exchange Limited. This increases the size of these exchanges and diversity of instruments listed.\n\n\u201cThe Eurobonds are actually issued as part of approved Government Borrowing Plans, usually in the FGN\u2019s annual budgets, for financing capital projects thereby reducing the infrastructure gap.\u201d\n\n\u2018Issues of rising debt germane\u2019\n\nThe D-G explained that the issues of rising debt, high debt service to revenue ratio and utilization of borrowed funds were germane.\n\nShe said that members of the public should not lose sight of the facts which necessitated borrowing which included: \u201cHuge Infrastructure Deficit , Recession (twice in the last six years), Consecutive Budget Deficits , Low Revenue Base, compounded by dependence on one source \u2013 crude oil which prices crashed and at a point, at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic had no buyers.\u201d\n\nMs. Oniha stressed that Nigerians must challenge themselves and support the federal government on the need to raise revenue.\n\nShe noted that the 5 per cent tax as a percentage of the Gross Domestic product (GDP) was too poor for Nigeria and that concerted efforts must be made to increase the nation\u2019s revenue.\n\nWays and means\n\nThe D-G disclosed that work has already started on this, adding the Federal Government debt to the Central Bank of Nigeria which was at about N10 trillion at the beginning of the process.\n\nShe said, \u201cWe are working towards recognizing it, getting the proper approvals to include it in the public debt stock. Where we are is to get the necessary approvals to convert it into a tenured debt.\u201d\n\nOn the foreign exchange implications for debt service, especially the fall in the value of the Naira, in recent times, the DMO boss said \u201cwe have initiated actions towards managing that risk.\u201d\n\nVanguard",

          "text": "The administration of President Muhammadu Buhari has received commendation for its prompt response to move Nigeria out of the COVID-19 challenges.\n\nThe APC Legacy Awareness and Campaign, a voluntary think-tank group of the governing party, acknowledged what it described as the remarkably clear and firm response of the APC-led government of President Muhammadu Buhari to Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe group in a statement issued Wednesday by its coordinators, Ismail Ahmed, Lanre Issa\u2013Onilu, Tolu Ogunlesi and Salihu Moh Lukman, stated that nobody anticipated that the year 2020 would usher in the most disruptive pandemic in recent history.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt, however, noted that the current administration undertook \u201ca two-step approach to tackle the devastating effects of the pandemic, soon after it broke out.\n\nThe group listed the major steps taken by the Buhari in response to the pandemic to include setting up an Economic Sustainability Committee chaired by the Vice President Yemi Osibajo, to develop a comprehensive economic stimulus plan, known as the Economic Sustainability Plan (ESP), adding thst the ESP has been widely credited with fast-tracking Nigeria\u2019s exit from the Covid-induced recession, and as a contributor to the robust 5.1 percent economic growth recorded in Q2 2021.\n\n\u201cThe ESP has included a range of interventions from Payroll Support, to federal investments in renewable energy for households, to grants for artisans and transport workers, and aviation sector bailout packages.\n\n\u201cSetting up a Presidential Task Force on Covid-19 (now the Presidential Steering Committee on Covid-19), chaired by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation.\n\n\u201cSetting up a Poverty Reduction with Growth Strategy Implementation Committee, chaired by the Vice President, to contribute to the presidential vision of lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty within a decade.\n\n\u201cApproving the establishment of a 500 billion Naira COVID-19 Crisis Intervention Fund, dedicated to various programs ranging from health infrastructure upgrades to a national public works programme. Health infrastructure successes seen so far include the (ongoing) construction of Oxygen Production facilities in every State of the country, as well as the construction of Infectious Disease Centers,\u201d it said.\n\nThe APC group noted further that the President approved a series of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) stimulus interventions, including a stimulus support package for individuals and households, which has seen total disbursements of more than 400 billion Naira so far, to over 600,000 beneficiaries.\n\n\u201cAnother aspect of the CBN\u2019s stimulus programme is the reduction in interest rates on CBN intervention facilities, from 9 percent per annum to 5 percent, from March 1, 2020 to February 28, 2022.\n\n\u201cApproving the take-off of the 75 billion Naira National Youth Investment Fund (NYIF) which is funding youth-led businesses, as well as the Jubilee Fellows Programme which will place 20,000 University graduates in work-preparation/career-development internships annually.\n\n\u201cApproving the launch of an Export Expansion Facility Programme, designed to provide a financial lifeline to export businesses, as well as the release of special intervention grants of 10 billion Naira and 5 billion Naira to the Lagos State Government (Lagos being the pandemic epicenter) and the Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC) respectively.\n\n\u201cApproving a repayment moratorium for all Social Investment Programme microcredit loans (TraderMoni, MarketMoni and FarmerMoni), and all Federal Government funded loans issued by the Bank of Industry, Bank of Agriculture and the Nigeria Export Import Bank,\u201d it added.\n\nLAC also argued that Buhari\u2019s approval of the expansion of the National Social Register (official database for implementation of the Conditional Cash Transfer programme) by 1 million additional households, and of the N-Power youth jobs scheme have added most to his further inclusive growth gesture to Nigerians, adding that the President has recently set up a Committee to comprehensively reform the health sector, to build on the efforts already introduced by the administration in the recent past, including the operationalisation of the Basic Healthcare Provision Fund.\n\nIt further expressed confident that the administration\u2019s economic efforts and initiatives will continue to yield fruit and translate into inclusive growth and prosperity for all Nigerians.",

That\u2019s exactly what they did.\n\n\u201cIntroducing LG GX Gallery series OLED TV, available in 65- and 77-inch screen sizes, LG\u2019s GX Gallery series TVs deliver everything that was cutting-edge about the wallpaper TV without the need for a separate soundbar to house all the electronics.\n\n\u201cThe company\u2019s success in creating a product that fuses together form and function so seamlessly has earned recognition from the world\u2019s most prestigious design award programs, its 65-inch GX Gallery series OLED TV winning the Best of the Best title at the Red Dot Design Award and top honors at the iF Design Award 2020.\n\n\u201cThis advanced TV\u2019s perfectly executed minimalist aesthetic and integrated bracket that allows for flush-to-the-wall mounting are the outcome of LG\u2019s peerless gallery design. A triumph of human-centered industrial design, the GX Gallery lineup would not look out of place in an art gallery exhibit, displayed as a series of understated, ultra-modern sculptures.\n\n\u201d It is this refined, artistic quality that the TVs bring to consumers\u2019 homes and what enables them to complement and augment practically any existing d\u00e9cor.\n\n\u201cAt the core of the gallery design is the creation of a complete TV that can fit harmoniously within a given space \u2013 a concept LG\u2019s designers refer to as \u201cadding spatial value.\u201d\n\nThe team behind the GX Gallery stayed true to its original vision throughout the entire development process, working closely with LG engineers to deliver a new kind of TV. The results speak for themselves: an advanced OLED TV with a thickness of less than 20 millimeters and a built-in, ultra-slim bracket that hugs the wall and is completely hidden from view\n\nThe gallery design would not have been possible without OLED, a technology which LG\u2019s expertise remains unmatched.\n\nOLED\u2019s inherent thinness enabled the designers to pursue the unique and elegant slender form factor they envisioned and see it become a reality.\n\nLG\u2019s OLED technology is also what enables the TVs to provide such unforgettable viewing experiences, with phenomenal color expression, infinite contrast and a wide viewing angle.\n\n\u201cCreating a sense of harmony wherever they\u2019re installed, LG\u2019s GX Gallery series TVs are designed to effortlessly fit in with modern consumers\u2019 lifestyles, providing more possibilities to curate their living spaces and more room to enjoy life.\n\nFeatured in the OLED Gallery Series is the \u03b1 (Alpha) 9 Gen 3 AI Processor. The company\u2019s third-generation processor builds on the capabilities of its predecessors, leveraging additional processing power and advanced deep learning algorithms to further boost picture and sound quality on the new TVs\u201d.",

Commanders would be held responsible for any security breach. The importance of leadership cannot be overemphasized especially in the military.\n\n\u201cIt is the responsibility of a leader to develop and earn the trust of his or her subordinates. Trust built on good character is the bedrock for effective leadership which is geared towards achieving results. Therefore, Commanders at all levels must provide quality and good leadership while imbibing the core values of the Nigerian Army\n\n\u201cCommanders must also ensure that they remain selfless, build and earn the respect and confidence of their subordinates in order to lead effectively. I have directed that leadership training modules be developed and utilized in all our training institutions to enhance the career and performance of all NA personnel,\u201d he said.\n\nThe COAS added, \u201cin the conduct of our operations, Commanders must ensure that their troops maintain a state of constant alertness and vigilance at all times to avoid any surprise attack by the adversary. It is also the task of Commanders to take care of the resources and logistics put at their disposal for the conduct of operations towards achieving results. Laissez faire attitudes on the part of commanders would not be tolerated. Like I have always said, failure is failure irrespective of the circumstances. To that end, I have directed the appropriate departments to come up with modalities for the evaluation of the performance of commanders in the course of their command.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, commanders must continue to cooperate and work in synergy with our sister Services, other security agencies and stakeholders while developing novel processes, strategies, and tactics to overwhelm the enemy using both kinetic and non-kinetic approaches. Commanders must be proactive in the conduct of their operations. You must take the fight into the identified and known enclaves of terrorists and criminals to neutralize them\u201d.\n\nAppealing to Nigerians for support, Gen Yahaya assured that in days ahead, there shall be more visible signs of improved security across the country, adding that the military will speak to the terrorists, bandits, kidnappers and other perpetrators of violence in the language they understand.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI however, seek the understanding and support of all Nigerians to enable us serve the nation as expected. I assure Nigerians that in days ahead, there shall be more visible signs of improved security across the country. I would like to seize this opportunity to advise those fueling the crises being witnessed across the country to desist from their unpatriotic acts as we remain committed to ensure peace returns to every part of the country in no distant time.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Army, within the ambit of rule of law, will talk to the terrorists, bandits, kidnappers and other perpetrators of violence in the language they understand while ensuring that all peace-loving citizens of this country would go about their legitimate businesses and live their lives without fear or intimidation\u201d.",

Such collaborative efforts make accident investigations more transparent and open as the outcome of the investigation is not necessarily aimed at punitive measures but essentially at generally improving safety in the aviation industry\u201d.\n\nOn his part, the Chief Executive Officer of AIB, Engr Akin Olateru said the joint investigation with the NAF was its first direct involvement in military air crash investigation in Nigeria and second investigation outside its mandate having also assisted Sao Tome and Principe in the past.\n\nHe also noted that copies of the report, with the endorsement of the CAS, will also be submitted to the Hon. Minister of Aviation and Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) to ensure that the recommendations addressed to aviation agencies are implemented.\n\nThe Commissioner equally stated that although the accident involved a military aircraft and crew, it happened at a civil airport.\n\nHe added that the involvement of AIB in the investigation by the Nigerian Air Force would help in closing the gaps on the civil aviation side.",

The NAF last conducted a mission into Yobe State (Not Yunusari LGA) on 5 September 2021 and it was an armed recce. No bomb or missile was even expended\u201d.\n\nHowever, an international news outlet, BBC Hausa Service reported that dozens of civilians were allegedly killed in the early hours of Wednesday, September 15, 2021, after a military fighter jet mistakenly bombed a village named Buhari in Yobe State.\n\nWhile quoting an eye witness, BBC, reported thus: \u201cthree fighter jets went around the area before one of the pilots dropped the bomb on the civilian population. He added that 5 of his relatives died in the incident. Recall that a similar event happened in 2017 when the Nigerian Air Force mistakenly bombed an Internal Displaced Persons\u2019 camp in Rann, Borno State\u201d.\n\nAccording to another online report that quoted Bulama Bukarti, a popular journalist, who said: \u201cBBC Hausa reports that many civilians were killed & others injured earlier today when a jet believed to be NAF\u2019s bombed Buhari village, Yunusari LGA, Yobe State. A witness who lost five relatives said \u201cthree jets went around, then one of them started firing in the center of the village.\n\n\u201cThis area is in the northern part of Yobe, close to BH/ISWAP\u2019s area of operation, so it is possible that the jets were on anti-BH operation. Villagers say they are unsure if the jets belong to Nigeria or Niger, but it\u2019s unlikely to be Niger\u2019s given it\u2019s within Nigeria\u2019s territory.\u201d",

The group was also said to have been behind a deadly attack on US troops in Niger in 2017.\n\nThe Sahel\u2019s porous borders are often exploited by drug runners, people smugglers and militants such as the ISGS.\n\nJihadist attacks also spill into neighbouring Nigeria.\n\nFrench forces have been hunting jihadist cells in the region for years. In 2013, France intervened to prevent an al-Qaeda affiliate from taking over the Malian capital Bamako.\n\nThere are now two concurrent missions running in the Sahel \u2013 a UN peacekeeping mission, comprising 56 nations and 14,000 troops, and the French-led counter-terrorism mission Operation Barkhane, which is backed by US intelligence.\n\nIn June, Mr Macron announced that Operation Barkhane would end in its current form, and that French troops would be cut in the region over the course of several years. Last month, Chad announced it was halving its counter-terrorism force in the region.\n\nAfter announcing Sahrawi\u2019s death, Mr Macron added in a tweet: \u201cThe nation is thinking this evening of all its heroes who died for France in the Sahel in the Serval and Barkhane operations, of the bereaved families, of all its wounded.\n\n\u201cTheir sacrifice is not in vain. With our African, European and American partners, we will continue this fight.\u201d",

There was a huge Eritrean army presence there,\u201d Getachew Reda told the Reuters news agency. \u201cIf there were vigilante groups acting in the heat of the moment I cannot rule that out.\u201d\n\nInternational investigators were welcome to visit the area, he said.\n\nPrior to the Tigray conflict, Ethiopia hosted around 150,000 Eritrean refugees, fleeing poverty and an authoritarian government.\n\nMuch of the report focused on two camps \u2013 Shimelba and Hitsats \u2013 destroyed during the fighting. HRW cited UN refugee agency UNHCR figures that 7,643 out of 20,000 refugees then living in Hitsats and Shimelba camps are still missing.\n\nUNHCR, the United Nations refugee agency, said it was \u201cappalled\u201d at the reports of \u201cimmense suffering\u201d in refugee camps, which it was unable to access from November to March.\n\nAlthough Ethiopia and Eritrea fought a brutal border war in 1998-2000 that left tens of thousands dead, President Abiy Ahmed initiated a rapprochement with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki that earned him the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019, and Asmara has lent him military backing in Tigray.\n\nEritrean forces arrived in the northern town of Hitsats on November 19, killed residents, and pillaged and occupied the refugee camp, HRW said. Some refugees helped direct looters, one resident told HRW.\n\n\u201cIn every house, people were killed,\u201d one resident told HRW.\n\nFour days later, Tigrayan fighters attacked an area near Hitsats camp\u2019s Ethiopian Orthodox church, killing nine refugees and injuring 17, HRW reported.\n\n\u201cMy husband had our four-year-old on his back and our six-year-old in his arms. As he came back to help me enter the church, they shot him,\u201d one refugee told Human Rights Watch.\n\nTwo dozen residents in Hitsats town were reportedly killed in clashes that day, HRW reported.\n\nThe report said that HRW had been unable to determine the extent that Tigray\u2019s formal forces directly commanded local Tigray militias operating around Hitsats.\n\nShortly after, Eritrean soldiers detained 24 refugees, who were never seen again, HRW said. They also took the 17 injured refugees back to Eritrea.\n\nEritrean forces withdrew from Hitsats camp in early December. Tigrayan forces returned on December 5, sending refugees fleeing under attack.\n\nRefugees around the villages of Zelasle and Ziban Gedena, northwest of Hitsats, reported being shot at and attacked with grenades. Tigrayan forces marched fleeing refugees back to Hitsats, shooting some stragglers, refugees reported to HRW.\n\nSome women also said they were raped by Tigrayan fighters as they fled. One 27-year-old woman said Tigrayan fighters raped her along with her 17-year-old sister.\n\nTigrayan forces withdrew from Hitsats on January 4, HRW said. The Eritrean forces returned, ordered remaining refugees to leave, then destroyed the camp.\n\nIn the northernmost camp, Shimelba, Eritrean forces killed at least one refugee, raped at least four others and killed local residents, HRW said.\n\nThe violence and severe food shortages forced some refugees to return to Eritrea. Others fled south to two other camps, Adi Harush and Mai Aini. Tigrayan forces took over those camps in June and refugees have reported killings and looting.\n\n\u201cWe are extremely worried about the current situation of over 20,000 Eritrean refugees living in Mai Aini and Adi Harush camp in southern Tigray,\u201d UNHCR told Reuters on Wednesday, saying there were severe food and water shortages and healthcare was unavailable.",

          "text": "Elite US gymnast Simone Biles has testified before the Senate about abuse she suffered at the hands of disgraced former team doctor, Larry Nassar.\n\nFormer teammates Aly Raisman and McKayla Maroney also appeared before the committee, along with FBI Director Christopher Wray.\n\nThe committee is examining shortcomings in the FBI\u2019s investigation into Nassar, later convicted of sexually abusing girls.\n\nHe is serving a life sentence in jail.\n\n\u201cI blame Larry Nasser, and I also blame an entire system that enabled and perpetrated [sic] his abuse,\u201d said Ms Biles, the most decorated Olympic gymnast of all-time.\n\n\u201cIf you allow a predator to harm children, the consequences will be swift and severe,\u201d she added.\n\nGymnast Maggie Nichols \u2013 the first victim to report her abuse to USA Gymnastics \u2013 also testified.\n\nIn emotional testimony on Wednesday, the four women told the Senate Judiciary Committee they had \u201csuffered and continue to suffer\u201d from the abuse they experienced and its bungled handling.\n\nFour-time Olympic gold medallist Simone Biles \u2013 one of the most famous figures in world sports \u2013 called for the agents involved to be federally prosecuted.\n\n\u201cHow much is a little girl worth?\u201d she asked.\n\nAly Raisman, who served as captain of the 2012 and 2016 US Olympic gymnastics teams, expressed disgust that she was \u201cstill fighting for the most basic answers and accountability\u201d more than six years after first reporting her abuse.\n\n\u201cOver the past few years it has become painfully clear how a survivor\u2019s healing is affected by the handling of their abuse,\u201d she testified.\n\nShe criticised the FBI investigation as being \u201clike guesswork\u201d, warning that not addressing its serious flaws would result in a recurring \u201cnightmare\u201d for many more women.\n\nMcKayla Maroney, who won gold at the London 2012 Olympic Games, described the experience of being interviewed by the FBI as replete with \u201csilence and disregard for my trauma\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey chose to fabricate, to lie about what I said and protect a serial child molester,\u201d she told senators.\n\n\u201cWhat is the point of reporting abuse if our own FBI agents are going to take it upon themselves to bury that report in a drawer?\u201d\n\nThe four athletes were among more than 200 women who gave powerful impact statements to a court in 2018, detailing Larry Nassar\u2019s abuse as the sports doctor of the United States women\u2019s national gymnastics team.\n\nIn total, Nassar was accused of sexual abuse by more than 330 women and girls at USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University.\n\nA long-awaited report into the FBI\u2019s investigation, which was published in July, found numerous missteps, delays and cover-ups by FBI agents, which allowed Nassar\u2019s abuse to continue for several more months after the case was first opened.\n\nThe 119-page report by the Department of Justice Inspector General found that, despite the seriousness of the allegations against Nassar, the FBI field office in Indianapolis had been slow to respond.\n\nThe agency initially interviewed only Ms Maroney while declining to interview other young women who had come forward with their stories.\n\nConfronted by their mistakes, two FBI officials lied during interviews to cover up their errors, the report said. According to the FBI, one of those officials was fired last week.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray apologised profusely to those present for the \u201creprehensible conduct\u201d and \u201cfundamental errors\u201d detailed in the July report.\n\nMr Wray only took the agency\u2019s top job in 2017, but pledged to prevent a repeat of the mishandled case under his leadership.\n\nHe pointed to last week\u2019s removal of the supervising official involved, while noting the other official \u2013 who led the field office in Indianapolis \u2013 had retired long before he could be disciplined.\n\nHe acknowledged the work of both agents had \u201cviolated the FBI\u2019s long-standing code of conduct\u201d but was \u201cinconsistent\u201d with the vast majority of his team.\n\nAt a news conference later on Wednesday, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the president \u201csupports\u201d the recommended steps outlined for the FBI in the Department of Justice report.\n\nBut both lawmakers and witnesses called out the department for being a \u201cno-show\u201d at the hearing despite being invited. Speaking after the hearing, Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal noted the department must still answer more questions.",

Unity, cooperation\u2014and leaders like Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala,\u201d wrote Prince Harry and Meghan wrote.\n\n\u201cAs the first African and first woman to lead the WTO, a 164-member group of nations that oversees trade across the world, Okonjo-Iweala took on the role of director-general this March at a watershed moment for our global health and well-being. Make no mistake, her job affects every person, family and community.\n\n\u201cAs we face a constant barrage of vaccine misinformation, bureaucratic slowdowns across both government and industry, and the rise of variants that underscore the urgency of the situation, Okonjo-Iweala has shown us that to end the pandemic, we must work together to equip every nation with equitable vaccine access,\u201d they added.\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan pointed out that their, \u201cconversations with her have been as informative as they are energising. This is partly because, despite the challenges, she knows how to get things done\u2014even between those who don\u2019t always agree\u2014and does so with grace and a smile that warms the coldest of rooms.\n\n\u201cThe fragility of our world right now cannot be overstated. Just over a quarter of the nearly eight billion global population is fully vaccinated.\n\n\u201cAchieving vaccine equity is a global duty of compassion for one another. Our hope is that guided by strong leaders like Ngozi, we can get there soon.\u201d\n\nOkonjo-Iweala, 67, is an economist and development specialist.\n\nShe is a renowned global finance expert with over 31 years of experience, having worked in Asia, Africa, Europe, Latin America, and North America. She used to be the Chair of the Board of GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance and formerly African Union Special Envoy to mobilise international financial support in the fight against COVID-19.\n\nIn addition, Okonjo-Iweala served twice as Nigeria\u2019s finance minister, from 2003-2006 and 2011-2015 and briefly as foreign affairs minister in 2006, the first woman to hold both positions.\n\nAs finance minister, Okonjo-Iweala steered Nigeria through the varying degree of reforms, particularly on macroeconomic, trade, financial and real sector issues.\n\nAs Managing Director (Operations) of the World Bank, her several portfolios included oversight responsibility for the World Bank\u2019s $81 billion operational portfolio in Africa, South Asia, Europe, and Central Asia.\n\nOkonjo-Iweala spearheaded several World Bank initiatives to assist low-income countries during the 2008-2009 food crises and later in the trying period of the global financial crisis.\n\nObinna Chima",
