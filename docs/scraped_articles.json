Seeing others from neighboring states,\n\neg Yobe and Maiduguri on yearly basis going for scholarships in batches while ours can not is not good,\u201d he said.\n\nDescribing the State\u2019s education and economy, the forum noted that \u201cOut of the 36 states and FCT, Bauchi ranks 26th, this is to say simply that our State is the 10th ranking state in illiteracy in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAnother equally devastating issue is the statistics that affirmed that Bauchi is also the 8th in the table of poverty in Nigeria with a figure as high as 61.53%. There is no doubt that, when you draw a line and connect the dots between the two variables, the conceptual framework that aligns them is unarguably nothing but poor administration from the Government. And that is the hurtful truth.\u201d\n\nIn finding a solution to the problems they listed, the students further said: \u201cWe have engaged ourselves in searching for a replacement who is a competent person, having discipline and vast administrative experiences.

          "text": ".\n\nBy Johnbosco Agbakwuru, ABUJA\n\nThe Federal Government has commenced moves to avert the impending nationwide strike of aviation workers.\n\nRecall that the aviation workers under the aegis of the National Union of Air Transport Employees (NUATE) and Association of Nigeria Aviation Professionals (ANAP), had threatened to withdraw their services by Tuesday, February 8, 2022, over poor welfare and unimplemented agreements with the Government.\n\nTo stop the impending strike which could ground air travel nationwide, the Federal Government Monday opened discussions with the aviation unions at the office of the Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige.\n\nThe meeting, which commenced by 6 pm was ongoing as at the time of filing this report and also had in attendance, the Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika and other relevant top government officials.\n\nIn his opening remarks, Ngige thanked the aviation workers for the matured way they went about their matter, saying they acted in the spirit of labour conciliation.\n\nHe noted that the aviation workers gave the necessary warning to his ministry, but they resolved that their parent ministry should first engage with them.\n\nA statement by Charles Akpan,\n\nDeputy Director, Press and Public Relations in the Ministry of Labour and Employment quoted Ngige as saying, \u201cI am happy that the Permanent Secretary of the Federal Ministry of Aviation reported that they did so with you, but there are two major areas that they couldn\u2019t reach an agreement with you and therefore, you had to escalate the matter by issuing an ultimatum to close the entire air space.\n\n\u201cI can see that all of you are here, both the traffic controllers and engineers. We thought there may be some openings in the air space, but I can see that all of you are united.\n\n\u201cI can assure you that we are going to reach agreements here and some of the agreements will be reached with the speed of a flash and we will get back to them.\u201d\n\nThe Minister, however, drew attention to a conciliation agreement earlier done by NUATE with officials of his ministry, in which they agreed on March 31 as the timeline for the consummation, wondering why such an agreement exists and it was now as if they were on a steeplechase.\n\nHe said, \u201cBut that is not the issue now. I know about your complaints and that is why I called all the stakeholders including the National Salaries, Income and Wages Commission (NSIWC) and the Federal Ministry of Aviation. I had discussed most of the issues with your employers, the Minister and the Permanent Secretary and we decided on a line of action. It is that this government, the President, in particular, does not believe that we can disengage people.\n\n\u201cThe President does not believe a worker is not due his remunerations in terms of salaries and allowances. That is why nobody can complain that we are owing salaries. Some allowances that have not been fine-tuned, once fine-tuned, the Government will pay because the President was a wage-earning person all through his military career. That is why he does not deal with anything pertaining to anybody being owed for work done.\n\n\u201cAs long as I am the Minister of Labour, no Government agency will owe anybody salaries and even confirmed allowances. If you cannot pay all, the CBA negotiations allow you to do the ability to pay at the time in question so that you can stagger payment. .But, we will agree on things today, put timelines on them and it will be done.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, Sirika said the agitation for the rights and privileges of workers is lawful and acceptable, especially under the current administration of President Muhammadu Buhari, which in its manifesto, entrenched the principle of social democracy, adding that the Government takes the issue of labour very seriously.\n\nThe minister however described the agitation as something in-house between the Ministry and its parastatals, which could be dealt with, hoping that the leadership of the unions will go back to their members with something that they will be happy about.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the aviation unions, the National President, Air Transport Services Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (ATSSAN), Ahmadu Ilitrus, called for urgent measures to address their demands.\n\nHe lamented that since 2019 when the Minimum Wage Bill was signed into law, no worker from the Aviation Ministry has benefitted from it.\n\nHe said many of the aviation workers had left service without benefitting from it, urging the Government to look back and ensure that those who deserve the payment were paid.\n\nHe also called for the approval/release of the reviewed conditions of service for aviation workers.\n\nThe ATTSSAN boss also appealed to the Government to address the issue of suppression of unionization in the aviation industry.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "title": "It\u2019s the turn of Ijaws to be governor in Rivers State",
          "text": "Rev Asoliye Douglas-West\n\n\u2014Rev Asoliye Douglas-West\n\n\u2022Says, political offices should yield to negotiated zoning formula\n\nBy Moses Nosike\n\nAn Anglican priest and oil magnate, Rev Asoliye Douglas-West is an aspirant for the 2023 governorship election in Rivers State. In this interview, he spoke about how the Ijaw speaking parts of the state have been sidelined in governance and stressed that the situation should be addressed in 2023. Excerpts:\n\nFormer Rivers State governor, Dr Peter Odili is from the West Senatorial District of the state while both the immediate past governor, Rotimi Amaechi as well as the incumbent, Nyesom Wike are from the East Senatorial District which means the South East district has not had the opportunity to govern the state. What is your take on the issue of zoning of political offices?\n\nThe Constitution governing our democracy does not recognise the sanctity of zoning of political offices, but the principle of zoning is an extra-constitutional mechanism which evolved as an appropriate response to deal with moral conscience in enthroning equity and fairness in the distribution of political benefits to satisfy sentiments relating to our ethnic diversity. No matter how contiguous our geographical affinity might be, we cannot live in denial or be pretentious about the existence of ethnic diversities just as resource endowments are diverse. Since we have found a mechanism of pooling proceeds of economic resource exploitation into a commonwealth for redistribution among the entities, therefore it is a logical corollary that high ranking political offices should yield to a negotiated zoning formula. Perhaps this was why the writers of our Constitution introduced the federal character concept as a means of invoking balance in representation and some semblance of fairness and equity in the allocation of resources among the constituent entities.\n\nREAD ALSO:DELTA 2023: Nobody can shut out Ijaw from guber race \u2013 Bozimo\n\nRivers State is geographically dichotomised between an upland north and a littoral south with their peculiar physical features and topographies. Four prominent linguistic groups are recognisable within the ethnic diversities that make up Rivers State, which include the Igboid tribe (Ikwerre, Etche and Oyigbo), the Ogonis (Khana, Gokhana, Tai and Eleme), the Ijaws (Kalabari, Okirika, Bonny/Opobo and Andoni/Nkoro) and the Beninoid stock (Ndoni, Ekpeye, Abua/Odual. The Igboid, Ogonis and Beninoid stocks are located in the upland north while only the Ijaw speaking ethnicities are located in the riverine south. The threesome of Celestine Omehia, Chibuike Amaechi and Nyesom Wike, all of whom are Ikwerre speaking have ruled as governors for a consecutive totality of sixteen years shared among them. Peter Odili representing the Beninoid was governor for eight years. A disregard for the zoning formula and the political expediency that enabled and enthroned Nyesom Wike as the third governor of Ikwerre speaking extraction is apparently emboldening them to enact an agenda and act a script intended to perpetuate hegemony which is unconscionable to good moral conscience, equity and fairness. If and when we recognise our diversity, the application of the zoning principle is a pragmatic way of guaranteeing inclusiveness and social justice.\n\nDespite the heterogeneous nature of Rivers State as you have said, all the governors since 1999 came from one particular area, how do you feel about that?\n\nIt is rather disinteresting, disquieting and disconcerting to witness a situation where one particular ethnic group had devised a stratagem of capturing and retaining power for 16 years without consideration for the political well-being of other constituent ethnicities. Using the advantage of incumbency, that same ethnic group is still unjustifiably wrangling and plotting to produce a candidate for the 2023 election. I am a strong proponent of a paradigm shift where compromises and negotiations would embrace themselves in favour of a candidate from the riverine south. I stand to be corrected, the riverine Ijaws have been very patient and understanding. It is the turn of the Ijaws to produce a credible candidate to be elected and serve as the next governor of Rivers State. It will be a demonstration of bad faith and insensitivity if our brothers upland should insist on satisfying their appetite for power by presenting another candidate for the governorship election in 2023. Their argument of possessing a higher voters\u2019 population in Obio/Akpor is untenable and dubious.\n\nWhat will be your agenda for the people of Rivers State if you become governor in 2023?\n\nOften times we give priority to the wrong things. I wonder why the incumbent governor finds it fashionable to expend so much resources on constructing flyover bridges in the Port Harcourt metropolis. This appears to me as heaps of concrete clutter. Things have to be done differently to fetch different results and change the narrative about governance. There is going to be a departure from the old ways of doing things. After nearly 24years of uninterrupted democracy we can hardly perceive or feel a meaningful impact of governance positively changing lives in Rivers State. Poverty is still very pervasive. We have to create a new message that emphasises value creation as the distinctive selling proposition with focus on investing in human capacity development, inventing new ideas to modernize the economy through knowledge and eco-tourism. Human beings are the most valuable resource any society can possess and developing the capacity of human resource should form the priority of any government. It is human beings that initiate and propel the knowledge-driven economy. Human beings build and work in factories. Human beings construct the roads and bridges. Human beings cultivate the farms. With a bold determination, I have unyielding conviction that the new direction to steer the state is investment in human capital who would be armed with the capability to create ideas, invent innovation and reduce poverty. Therefore, our agenda will prioritize human capacity development and to build brand new cities that would redirect the movement of population away from a congested Port Harcourt. Research and development, Supply chain logistics, Tourism and agriculture are other critical sectors that would receive preferences in the agenda.\n\nHow do you intend to increase IGR in the state when you become governor?\n\nI may not be able to give comprehensive details of our strategy for increasing IGR but I know there is a foundation already established by successive governments. It would be appropriate to say that we will build upon that foundation by tweaking and introducing some reforms that would totally revolutionise how public tax revenue management system can be deepened and expanded in line with global best practice. While seeking to plug leakages where they exist and reduce the cost of tax administration, we will strive to expand the tax net to include more taxable individuals and entities especially among the informal sector. The new economy we envisage would seek to create enabling environment to ease doing business and attract new businesses. We would provide incentives to encourage small scale start-ups\n\nWhat stands you out among other aspirants?\n\nThere is an urgent call to duty to alter the narrative about the ways the business of governance is conducted. Rivers State needs a forward thinking leadership whose preoccupation would not be to preserve its own privileges but to channel energies and resources into building a modern economy and a smart society. In very critical moments in the history of a people, those in whom God is well pleased would hear His voice saying \u2018whom shall I send and who will go for us\u2019? They would offer themselves and say, \u2018Here I am, send me\u2019. Many governors have come, and seen but failed to conquer. Many appropriation bills have been passed into law but budget implementation has failed to deliver on promises. I would like to describe two scenarios and situate myself in the appropriate context. On the one hand there are those who are either thrown up by the system or they throw up themselves and run for political offices in order to fulfill some personal ambition or ethnic agenda\n\nBut on the other hand, there are others who seek the opportunity to serve in leadership position in order to manage resources efficiently and effectively for the benefit of the community. Those who run the race most likely turn out to be chips off the old block whose contribution would terminate at maintaining the status quo but those who seek to serve would bring value. The challenge is big but my resolve is firm. The mission is urgent but my purpose is unmistakable. The terrain is tough but my faith is solid. I am a political outsider but a providential insider.\n\nYou are not decided on the political party platform on which you want to contest the election, how do you want to actualise your aspiration?\n\nI am not a card-carrying member of any political party yet. I realise that the mechanism for selecting candidates for election in the existing political structure in the dominant parties is flawed. The so-called dominant political parties have cultivated and entrenched a certain culture and habit that could be likened to the laws of the Medes and Persia that changeth not. A game changer would probably be located in one\u2019s ability to create a vision and an alternative message that can resonate a rhythm that would connect with the hearts and minds of the people. All things being equal, upsets caused by dark horses are not improbable in the race.",

I am under the weather,\u201d he said.\n\nResponding, Adedipe said he was informed over the weekend that his client\u2019s passport had been released to him in accordance with the court order.\n\nHe urged the court to put a stop to the hearing already slated for Adamu to appear to show cause why disciplinary action should not be meted out to him.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood.

These final bills will be voted for or against by the two chambers.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, The Joint Senate and House of Representatives Committee on Constitution Review has recommended the separation of the office of the Attorney General of the Federation from the Minister of Justice.\n\nAccording to reports, the recommendation was considered to avoid the visible politicisation of the two critical offices.The lawmakers envisage that the minister of justice will deal with policy and administrative issues, while the AGF will oversee dispensation of justice without fear or favour\n\nHowever, the proposed constitutional amendment has thrown up a diverse opinion from the legal community. While some Senior legal practitioners (lawyers) in the country, who spoke with Daily Sun in separate interviews on Sunday, threw their weight behind the move, others who are opposed of it rather called for a review of the appointment process.\n\nAhmed Raji (SAN) who threw his weight behind the proposal stated that \u201cthe occupant of the office of the Attorney General of the Federation should be a career person, while that of the Minister of Justice should be a politician.",

He is a Member of both the FIFA and CAF Technical Study Groups.\n\n\u201cThe NFF Board has approved a recommendation of the Technical and Development Committee retaining Augustine Eguavoen as Technical Director/Technical Adviser (interim) while Emmanuel Amuneke becomes the Chief Coach of the Super Eagles.

          "text": "*Bill prescribes sanctions for erring parties\n\n*Advises aggrieved potential aspirants to approach federal high court for relief\n\n*Says judicial pronouncement can\u2019t stop primary or general election\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nShould President Muhammadu Buhari sign the new Electoral Act amendment bill recently forwarded to him by the National Assembly into law, all political appointees in his government would no longer be eligible, either as voting delegates or aspirants during the conventions or congresses of their political parties.\n\nThe implication is that some key ministers in Buhari\u2019s cabinet, said to be nursing presidential ambitions would be barred from seeking the nominations of their parties.\n\nWhat this therefore, means is that ministers, commissioners and other political appointees are expected to resign ahead of their parties\u2019 primaries in order to be eligible to contest in the primaries.\n\nTop on the list of the aspiring appointees to be affected by this new amendment are the Minister of Transportation, Rt. Hon. Chibuike Amaechi; Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola; and Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola. They are believed to have presidential ambitions, even though they have yet to declare their interests.\n\nBut by the provision at issue, political appointees are also barred from voting as delegates in a convention or seeking nomination in the primaries of their political parties.\n\nUnlike what was obtainable in the past when most APC ministers and commissioners took leave of absence to contest their party\u2019s primaries and later went back to their jobs after they lost, that grace is no longer available.\n\nHowever, with the new amendment, if signed by the President, they would henceforth be required to vacate office completely before being eligible to contest.\n\nThe bill also advises aggrieved aspirants to seek redress at the Federal High Court if they suspect the political parties did not comply with the relevant provisions in the selection of candidates.\n\nAccording to Clause 84 of the recommitted bill, \u201cNo political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the convention or congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election.\n\n\u201cWhere a political party fails to comply with the provisions of this Act in the conduct of its primaries, its candidate for election shall not be included in the election for the particular position in issue.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of this Act or rules of a political party, an aspirant, who complains that any of the provisions of this Act and guidelines of a political party have not been complied with in the selection or nomination of a candidate of a political party for election, may apply to the Federal High Court for redress.\n\n\u201cNothing in this section shall empower the courts to stop the holding of primaries or general election under this Act, pending the determination of a suit.\u201d\n\nBut there appears to be a lacuna in the new law, which may encourage infringements on the inalienable rights of citizens to vie for elective offices.\n\nThe Supreme Court had pronounced at different times that any law inconsistent with the provisions of the constitution is ultra vires and, to that extent, null and void.\n\nSources believe the clause is meant to clip the wings of the governors, who, through appointments, often control those who become automatic delegates and determine the outcome of congresses.\n\nSources further claimed that the idea was originally from the House of Representatives, pushed by a principal officer from Lagos as an agenda to serve some interests. The senate was said to have concurred, just to keep the \u201cone house\u201d refrain of the National Assembly.\n\nBut the fear being expressed by many is that, with a clause that clearly breaches the provision of the constitution, the president might be forced to veto the electoral act amendment bill again. If this happens, a new electoral law may not be ready for the 2023 elections.\n\nThe National Assembly had recently transmitted the new Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill to Buhari for assent, through the Clerk of the National Assembly, Olatunde Ojo. Before the latest transmission, Buhari had in December 2021, vetoed the former amendment bill, leading to a recommittal by the National Assembly.\n\nThere have been misgivings about the new amendment, fuelling speculations on whether or not the president would sign it into law. The latest speculation was stoked by rumours that some governors, especially, those of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), were not comfortable with the new amendment and had planned to prevail on the president to also veto it, as he did in the last one.\n\nThe harmonised version of the Electoral Bill recently passed by the legislature was considered the final agreed version by both Senate and House of Representatives on the amendment to Clause 84 of the bill.\n\nIn this clause, the direct, indirect and consensus modes of primary election by political parties were included. This was after the controversy that trailed the different versions initially approved by the two chambers.\n\nThe senate had in its re-amended bill approved direct, indirect, and consensus primaries for the nomination of candidates by political parties, while the House only provided direct and indirect modes, saying the president did not speak about the consensus option, when he vetoed the previous bill.\n\nBut President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, while presiding at plenary, stated that both chambers had agreed to give a clear and sufficient definition for each mode of primary, and how they would be conducted.\n\nLawan explained that for the consensus method, the two chambers produced a clear-cut definition on how a consensus candidate would emerge.\n\nBuhari had declined assent to the first amendment bill over the provision of direct primary as the only mode of choosing candidates by political parties.\n\nThe bill earlier passed by the National Assembly on November 18, 2021, provided: \u201cA political party seeking to nominate candidates for elections under this bill shall hold direct primaries for aspirants to all elective positions, which shall be monitored by the commission.\u201d\n\nBut Buhari, in declining assent, disclosed that he would only give assent to the bill if the lawmakers provided options for the conduct of primaries by political parties.\n\nThe president also cited several disadvantages of the provision to the system, including security and possible manipulation by incumbent officeholders, who might be seeking re-election, as well as political parties\u2019 inability to muster funds for it.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Fitch: Nigeria\u2019s Oil Sector Weak Performance May Slowdown Economic Growth",
          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nFitch Solutions, an affiliate of global rating agency, Fitch, has predicted that Nigeria\u2019s weak performance in the oil and gas sector may continue to slow down the country\u2019s economy in the coming years. In its latest report on the state of the Nigerian economy, the rating agency stated that from its analysis, the new Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) might not markedly impact the country in the near term.\n\nForecasting an average annual decline of 0.5 per cent in the next four years, the group added that given the rapid pace of population growth in Nigeria, it expected that average incomes would continue to stagnate in the country.\n\nFitch stated, \u201cWhile the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), which was finally signed in 2021, will create a more stable operating environment, we doubt that it will have a significant effect on investment this year. It will take time for foreign firms to launch any new projects.\n\n\u201cIndeed, despite the new bill, our oil and gas team expects that oil production will gradually fall over the coming years. We predict an average annual decline of 0.5 per cent between 2023 and 2026. All told, fixed investment spending will contribute just 0.6 per cent to headline growth in 2022.\u201d\n\nThe report projected that the poor performance of the oil sector, which is Nigeria\u2019s key foreign exchange earner, would keep headline growth weak over the coming years.\n\nThe rating agency said, \u201cWe expect that real GDP growth will average just 2.9 per cent between 2023 and 2026. Headline growth will be even weaker in per capita terms. Given the rapid pace of population growth in Nigeria, we expect that average incomes will continue to stagnate.\u201d\n\nHowever, despite the slowdowns, Fitch predicted that economic growth in Nigeria would pick up slightly from an estimated 3.1 per cent in 2021, to 3.5 per cent in 2022, primarily driven by increased oil production, which will boost export growth. But the firm stated that it expected that growth would slow to 2.9 per cent in 2023, and over the medium term, that the combination of poor economic performance and rapid population growth per capita income would essentially stagnate.\n\nIt said, \u201cWe at Fitch Solutions expect Nigeria\u2019s economy will expand by 3.5 per cent in 2022. This would be the eighth consecutive year in which Nigeria has underperformed the aggregate growth figure for Emerging Markets (EM). We expect growth of 4.8 per cent across EMs as a whole.\n\n\u201cEven so, 3.5 per cent growth would represent an acceleration compared to the 3.1 per cent growth for 2021, and be Nigeria\u2019s best performance since 2014.\u201d\n\nAccordingly, Fitch solutions predicted that the volume of Nigeria\u2019s oil production would rise by 4.1 per cent in 2022, which would be a significant improvement compared to 2021, when it estimated that output fell by 8.1 per cent as a result of low investment and OPEC+ cuts.\n\nThe report said, \u201cBut with the OPEC+ agreement now ending, we think that output will rise, though it will remain below the recent peak recorded in 2020.\n\n\u201cSince oil makes up almost 90 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s exports, increased production will boost the country\u2019s export earnings. Indeed, given rising agricultural exports, we expect that exports will rise by 11.6 per cent in real terms in 2022.\n\n\u201cWhereas net exports subtracted 1.0 percentage points (pps) from headline growth in 2021, we think that the component will add 1.8pps to headline growth in 2022.\u201d\n\nAccording to the agency, the slow but rising oil production would also fuel strong private consumption growth, spurring private consumption spending to rise by 3.5 per cent in 2022, in line with the outturn in 2021.\n\nThe report explained, \u201cThis will contribute 2.2pps to headline growth. Continued FX shortages and slow productivity growth in the agricultural sector \u2013 which employs almost 35.0 per cent of the workforce \u2013 will prevent a sharper acceleration. Indeed, over the past seven years, private consumption growth has averaged just 0.7 per cent.\n\n\u201cWe expect that government consumption will rise by 3.0 per cent in 2022. The government passed an ambitious budget in late 2021, but recent experience suggests that implementation will be very weak.\n\n\u201cWe are, therefore, sceptical about plans to significantly increase public infrastructure spending.\n\nIndeed, some projects were probably included in the budget for political reasons before the 2023 election, and we expect that very little real progress will be made. Given the small scale of Nigeria\u2019s federal government, public spending will contribute just 0.4pp to headline growth.\u201d\n\nIt emphasised that the government\u2019s failure to raise living standards would probably result in increased social tensions over the coming years, projecting that the febrile political environment can result in violence surrounding presidential elections scheduled for 2023.\n\n\u201cOur current forecasts assume that the vote passes peacefully, but a series of violent clashes \u2013 as happened in 2011 \u2013 could pose a headwind to real GDP growth,\u201d it projected.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Osinbajo to Announce Presidential Bid after APC Convention",
          "text": "* Secures go-ahead of his spiritual father\n\nAdedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo has concluded plans to announce his presidential ambition immediately after the All Progressives Congress (APC) national convention, slated for Saturday, February 26.\n\nSources close to Osinbajo\u2019s strategy team hinted at the weekend that in spite of the ongoing campaigns against his currently rumoured bid for the presidency by some interests in the South-west, where he hails from, Osinbajo had made up his mind to give the presidency a shot.\n\nEven more instructive, inside sources claimed, was the fact that Osinbajo had received the blessing and the charge to go ahead with his ambition from his spiritual father and General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Pastor Enoch Adeboye.\n\nThe source said, \u201cTake it to the bank, he will run and he is declaring soon after the APC convention. All is set, including premium consultations already done. The coast is clear and the journey is looking good. I believe prof is also motivated by the increasing level of support from across the country, especially, the youths of this country.\n\n\u201cFrom the north to the south, tell me where he has visited recently and the charge has not been that he should contest? He has capacity, competence and knows what the issues are. Importantly, he can also sell them \u2013 I mean the issues. So, why will he not run? Why should the bitterness and envy of some minions stifle him?\u201d\n\nOsinbajo, who sources said was unfazed by the growing allegation of betrayal and the push for him to stand down his ambition for his former principal and supposed benefactor, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, who had since declared his intention to run, was said to have described the attacks against him as the real motivation to take his chances.\n\nThe source added, \u201cIn fact, none of such bothers him. But he has done one thing though, he has called his supporters and pleaded with them never to talk down on Tinubu or engage in a mud fight with his support groups, even in the face of obvious provocation.\u201d\n\nAlthough Osinbajo has refused to officially talk about his aspiration, despite the growing support for him to succeed Buhari, he is said to have been holding high level consultations with prominent Nigerians, many of whom have encouraged him to give the aspiration his best shot possible.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that Osinbajo\u2019s motivation to run for the presidency in 2023 stemmed from the first time he acted as president, when Buhari was away on medical leave to London, during which he took far-reaching decisions in the national interest. It was further gathered that taking active charge during the period provided the vice president both the confidence and impetus to desire to succeed his current boss.\n\nAn APC member, who is favourably disposed to Osinbajo\u2019s aspiration, stated, \u201cIt may be right to admit he stands a really good chance to succeed President Buhari after eight years as his deputy. He is an insider, who has had the opportunity of seeing things from high and serious vantage position, especially, having acted before on behalf of his boss.\n\n\u201cAlthough that may not be enough to get the presidency of Nigeria, because I believe and I know there are some politics directly connected to being the president of Nigeria. But, how well Osinbajo fits into that conversation is another debate altogether. From the list of those currently strutting the turf, he stands a really good chance, except the election is not his to lose.\n\n\u201cBut, file this away, he is contesting and would declare after the APC convention. I am aware of that. There\u2019s actually no stopping him. The supports have been sweeping and encouraging and for him, this opportunity might just be once and might never come his way again. Sincerely, he has nothing to lose throwing his hat in the ring. After all, he is already a frontline aspirant.\u201d\n\nAsked if it was true that Adeboye had given his blessing, the party chieftain, who would rather maintain anonymity, stated, \u201cI am not privy to that, but it\u2019s also a simple logic. Osinbajo is a pastor in Redeem and Baba Adeboye would never leave one of his own to support someone else. I also believe he must have hinted him. Honestly, the days ahead will be interesting.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Lai Mohammed, Ngige, Okorocha, Wamakko, Abe\u2019s factions spit fire\n\nOur Correspondents\n\nDespite last Thursday\u2019s inauguration of the state chairmen of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in 34 states at the party\u2019s national headquarters in Abuja, the tussles over the control of the party structures have remained unabated in no fewer than 13 states, THISDAY investigation has revealed.\n\nThe affected states include Zamfara, Sokoto, Delta, Rivers, Anambra, Imo, Enugu, Ogun and Kwara.\n\nOthers include Osun, Kano, Bauchi and Kebbi states.\n\nVarious factions of the party led by the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed; Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige; former Governor of Imo State, Senator Rochas Okorocha; former Governor of Sokoto State, Senator Aliyu Magartada Wamakko; former Governor of Kebbi State, Senator Adamu Aliero, and Senator Magnus Abe, have faulted the action of the national leadership of the party.\n\nAbe\u2019s faction in Rivers State has warned that the division in the party and the recognition of the faction led by the Minister of Transportation, Mr Rotimi Amaechi could lead to the exclusion of the party in the 2023 general election like in 2019.\n\nThe ruling party did not inaugurate the leadership of the party in Sokoto State, which is being contested by three factions led by a former governor of the state, Senator Wamakko; a member of the House of Representatives representing Illela/ Gwadabawa Federal Constituency, Hon. Balarabe Salame, Speaker of the Sokoto State House of Assembly, Hon. Muhammad Aminu Achida; and Senator Abubukar Gada, who leads his faction.\n\nWhile Wamakko leads one faction, Salame and Achida are in one faction.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that Wamakko has six National Assembly members, a senator, and 13 members of the state House of Assembly in his faction.\n\nBut Salame, Achida and Gada\u2019s factions have the backing of chieftains of the party based in Abuja.\n\nWhen contacted, the Chairman of Wamakko\u2019s faction, Alhaji Isa Sadiq Achida told THISDAY that nobody can truncate the will of the people of the state.\n\nHe further explained that those ranting that Wamakko has hijacked the party cannot win even an electoral ward for the party.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that if you remove Wamakko from APC in Sokoto, the party is dead because Wamakko is the party and the party is Wamakko,\u201d he stated.\n\nOn his part, another factional leader of the party in the state, Salame alleged that Wamakko sat down in his house and wrote the names of the executives and submitted it to the party headquarters.\n\nHe further alleged that the party lost the governorship election in 2019 \u201cbecause of Wamakko\u2019s handedness. He imposed an unpopular candidate, which made us lose the governorship seat.\u201d\n\nIn Zamfara State, the APC faction led by Senator Kabir Garba Marafa had described the recognition of the faction led by Governor Bello Matawalle as an act of impunity by the national leadership of the party.\n\nIn a statement issued by the factional Publicity Secretary, Mr Bello Bakkyasuwa Maradun titled: \u2018We enjoy watching APC\u2019s parade of madness,\u2019 the faction stated that the action of the party\u2019s caretaker and extraordinary convention planning committee would cause chaos in the party.\n\nHe predicted that APC would soon collapse because of impunity thriving in it.\n\n\u201cThe saying \u2018the wages of sin is death\u2019 applies perfectly in the most recent action of the APC Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of presenting certificates to their selected chairpersons of state chapters of the party. As one of the many factions across the country with legitimate grounds for agitation, the Senator Marafa-led faction of APC in Zamfara State sees this action as desperate and negates all principles of strategic thinking for building an enduring party that can weather the storm of 2023 as President Buhari rightly warned.\u201d\n\nIn Delta State, members of the party opposed to the faction led by the Deputy Senate President, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, have also kicked against the inauguration of Mr Omeni Sobotie as the state chairman.\n\nAccording to them, the so-called inauguration ceremony that took place in Abuja on Thursday was merely a sham as it did not follow due process, including the proper administration of the oath of office and oath of allegiance before competent officials.\n\nEminent chieftains of the party allegedly \u201cshut out\u201d of the process of the different party congresses by the Omo-Agege group include Dr Cairo Ojougboh; the 2019 APC governorship candidate, Chief Great Ogboru; former Speaker of the Delta State House of Assembly and Executive Director at NIMASA, Chief Victor Ochei; and the National Women Leader, Dr Mariam Alli.\n\nThe (factional) state Deputy Chairman of the anti-Omo-Agege faction, Hon. Elvis Ayomanor told THISDAY in Asaba that the national secretariat of the party Abuja has not confirmed Sobotie as the authentic chairman of the state chapter of the APC because the appropriate Oath of Office was not administered to him and his counterparts from other states.\n\nA factional chairman of the party in Rivers State, Golden Chioma, has also faulted the inauguration of the chairman of the faction loyal to the Minister of Transportation, Mr Rotimi Amaechi.\n\nChioma said what APC needed was an inclusive party and not a divisive party.\n\nThe APC chieftain told THISDAY that the party leadership at the national level ignored a faction to protect the interest of the other faction, stressing that one individual cannot continue to control party structure in the state.\n\nChioma who belongs to Senator Magnus Abe-led faction further urged the party leadership to avoid making the same mistake that led to the experience of 2019 where APC was removed from the electoral process over the internal crisis.\n\n\u201cWe are not asking for anything, but an inclusive party. The division in my APC in Rivers State is the oldest in the country.\n\n\u201cIf you remember, in 2019, the party did not present any candidate based on this same division. So, we need to do something different. We need to be more inclusive and not divisive,\u201d Chioma added.\n\nA faction of the APC in Anambra State led by the Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige, has also rejected the inauguration of Mr Basil Ejidike as the state chairman.\n\nThe state secretary of the party, Mr Chukwuma Agufugo, who belongs to Ngige\u2019s faction, has dismissed Ejidike\u2019s executive, saying it would not stand.\n\nAgufugo said Ejidike and his co-travellers have violated the order of the court, describing it as contempt, and vowed that they must pay for it.\n\nAlso, the factional Publicity Secretary, Mr Okelo Madukaife insisted that Ejidike and his executives remained rejected.\n\nHe said it was not true that the executives of the Anambra State chapter of the party had been inaugurated.\n\nHe said: \u201cOur dynamic chapter of APC congratulates the national leadership of our great party for the wisdom contained in the decision not to swear in anybody as Chairman of Anambra State chapter of All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\n\u201cThis noble decision validates the position of the mainstream of our party in Anambra State that 2018 officials remain in charge of our affairs until congresses can hold as leadership abhors a vacuum.\u201d\n\nIn Imo State, a faction of the APC led by Senator Rochas Okorocha said it would rely heavily on the ruling of the Appeal Court of November 6, 2020.\n\nThe chairman of the faction, Mr Dan Nwafor told THISDAY that the recognition of the Governor Hope Uzodimma\u2019s faction, which has Macdonald Ebere as chairman was contempt of court.\n\nA former Caretaker Committee Chairman of the party in Enugu State, Mr Ben Nwoye, has also argued that Mr Ude Agaballa, another factional chairman, who was inaugurated in Abuja, was not sworn in.\n\nIn an interview with THISDAY, Nwoye who said he monitored the inauguration, explained that the Senator Abdullahi Adamu-led reconciliation committee had listened to the complaints, reports, and petitions of aggrieved party members, adding that when Agballa\u2019s name was mentioned in Abuja, he was directed to go back because he did not win any congress.\n\nNwoye noted that Agballa was a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), who only came in August 2021 and expressed his interest to join the APC.\n\nThe Chairman of APC faction loyal to a former Governor of Ogun State Senator Ibikunle Amosun, Chief Derin Adebiyi, told THISDAY that his faction would hold a meeting to determine the next line of action.\n\nThe APC had sworn in Chief Yemi Sanusi, Chairman of a faction loyal to the state Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun.\n\nDeputy Chairman of the faction led by the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, in Kwara State, Hon. Sunday Oyebiyi told THISDAY that the inauguration of Prince Sunday Fagbemi was an exercise in futility, which would not take the party anywhere during the next elections.\n\n\u201cIt is a kangaroo outing that would not bring out the result to the party leadership both at the national secretariat and state chapter of APC.\n\n\u201cThe development shows that the national leadership of APC is unserious one and when the time comes, all of them will see it.\n\n\u201cI know it is not only in Kwara State but some other states where injustice is greatly pervaded by the governors over the control of the party and when the time comes, they will all see the outcome of their actions,\u201d he explained.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that in Kebbi State, a faction of the party led by Senator Adamu Aliero, representing Kebbi Central, which lost out during the inauguration, has vowed to resist the alleged imposition of party leadership in the state.\n\nA faction of the party loyal to the Minister of Interior, Mr Rauf Aregbesola, in Osun State, has also refused to recognise the new leadership of the party in the state.\n\nMeanwhile, efforts by the national caretaker committee led by Governor Mai Mala Buni to reconcile and put an end to the crisis rocking the Kano chapter of the party has hit another brick wall last week.\n\nTHISDAY investigation revealed that the peace meeting was the second in one week brokered at the instance of Buni-led APC to reach a compromise on the leadership of the APC in Kano.\n\nHowever, the peace meeting which was held on Friday night in Abuja ended in a stalemate as the leadership tussle rocking the Kano State chapter of the party continues.\n\nThe peace meeting could not resolve the leadership tussle as the Ibrahim Shekarau faction insisted that it should be accorded recognition having been pronounced as the valid leadership by a court judgment.\n\nInvestigation further revealed that efforts to prevail on the Shekarau faction already accorded recognition a court to accept the harmonisation deal by the Governor Abdullahi Ganduje faction was rebuffed by Shekarau\u2019s team.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Women and e-commerce: Capturing the $14bn opportunity in Africa",
          "text": "In Africa, the COVID-19 pandemic has, to a great extent, brought to the fore the potential of the digital economy. One sector where this is most vivid is e-commerce. Stay-at-home orders boosted online shopping activity during lockdowns and companies, large and small, are now leveraging online channels to drive business growth amid the crisis.\n\nBut much of the gains in e-commerce has so far been realised by male-owned businesses, which saw a collective 7% rise in sales during the pandemic. By contrast, female-owned businesses saw a 7% decline, per Women and E-commerce in Africa, a report by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) that examines the state of e-commerce across Kenya, Nigeria, and Ivory Coast.\n\nMore often than not, technological advances exacerbate existing gender inequalities. In this instance, women lag behind their male counterparts in terms of accessing and using digital marketplaces, despite representing half of Africa\u2019s population and accounting for the bulk of entrepreneurial activity in many African countries.\n\n\u201cThere is a digital disconnect,\u201d says Mercy Wanjau, Director, Legal and Board Advisory, at the Communications Authority of Kenya (KCA) while delivering her keynote speech during the first TechCabal Live session this year. \u201cIt\u2019s provocative and sad. So much progress has been made in connectivity globally, even in Africa, but there\u2019s still a disconnect when you look at the situation from a gender lens.\u201d\n\nWanjau adds that the internet is a \u201cgateway to huge economic opportunities\u201d and with women having no access, there\u2019s a digital disconnect and denial of opportunities, particularly in the low and middle-income countries.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nOver the past decade, e-commerce in Africa has expanded rapidly and the market value is expected to quadruple in the next decade. But with equal participation rates from both men and women in e-commerce, the growth could be even higher, per the report.\n\nBeyond participation, however, there exists an earning gap between e-commerce businesses owned by women compared to those owned by men, skewed in favour of the latter. According to the IFC report\u2014compiled with data from Jumia, Africa\u2019s largest e-commerce platform\u2014closing this gap between male and female vendors by 2025 would yield $14.5 billion in additional e-commerce market value in Africa by 2030.\n\nHow can this be achieved?\n\nJuliet Anammah, Jumia Nigeria\u2019s Chairwoman and Chief Sustainability Officer for the Group, notes that increasing the number of women selling through e-commerce platforms is crucial.\n\nIn countries like Nigeria, many women own physical stores while a growing number of female merchants sell through informal social commerce platforms like WhatsApp and Instagram. Helping the latter group transition to selling via formal e-commerce platforms, where they can access wider markets and business records needed to secure loans, is one of Jumia\u2019s objectives, in line with closing the gender gap in e-commerce.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear one of the ways women can grow their businesses through e-commerce is participating on platforms,\u201d Anammah says. \u201cMany traders opt for social commerce but in such instances, you\u2019re a single player and not aggregating data that can be useful when applying for loans. On Jumia, there\u2019s a database on your sales history, transactions, which lending partners use in providing credit.\u201d\n\nAs an entrepreneur and mother of 3, managing her business while taking care of the family was tough for Bukola Ogundijo, until she started selling on Jumia. \u201cThe platform has been very helpful in managing my business in 3 major ways,\u201d the founder of Purple Linings Ventures told the TC Live audience. \u201cWarehousing my product, packaging, and delivery whenever I get orders, all of which has reduced my operational costs.\u201d\n\nIn terms of access to credit to grow her business, Ogundijo says she\u2019s been able to secure low-interest loans from Jumia\u2019s lending partner, which has helped scale the business faster than her pre-Jumia days.\n\nFor Alexa Roscoe, the Disruptive Technology Lead (Gender and Economic Inclusion Group) at the IFC, the value of an enhanced seller base isn\u2019t just about the number of sellers going online but also bringing in more diverse products and services that serve a wider market and more customer needs.\n\n\u201cEntrepreneurs are just half the puzzle of the marketplace,\u201d Roscoe says. \u201cWomen are also buying online and we know they are responsible for making the vast majority of consumer decisions such as what groceries to buy.\u201d\n\nHence, understanding what women consumers want to better serve them is of equal importance, she argues, especially the women new to online shopping. \u201cThat way, they see e-commerce as a way to meet their needs. That\u2019s how we can help grow the market and make it more diverse.\u201d\n\nWhile the report finds that e-commerce companies can lead the way in the bid to increase the number of female entrepreneurs in e-commerce, as well as their sales, the IFC does recognise the importance of partnerships involving investors and policymakers in achieving this goal.\n\n\u201cPartnerships play an important role in bringing together different expertise, expanding knowledge and evidence, and most importantly, scaling impact massively and addressing multiple challenges,\u201d Anne Kabugi, the IFC\u2019s Regional Gender Lead for Africa (Gender and Economic Inclusion Group), says. \u201cThere is a huge e-commerce opportunity in Africa but Jumia alone may not be able to do massive research covering different geographies.\u201d\n\nWith partnerships that bring in the right resources, expertise, and investments to undertake research, players like Jumia can leverage the data to inform strategy and expansion across the continent.\n\n\u201cMore of these partnerships are needed, not just in the private sector but also the public. Government can help remove the legal and regulatory bottlenecks for business expansion and enable women access e-commerce and other digital services through inclusive connectivity policies for instance.\u201d\n\nKCA\u2019s Wanjau holds a similar stance on partnerships between stakeholders. \u201cE-commerce companies or the government can\u2019t do it alone. There\u2019s a need for collaboration across board,\u201d she says. \u201cCooperation between investors, e-commerce platforms, governments, and development organisations is needed to ensure a multi-stakeholder approach to address these issues. This isn\u2019t restricted to national levels because e-commerce is international.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "The Next Wave: Who will win Africa\u2019s music streaming wars?",
          "text": "November 29th 2021\n\nThe Next Wave provides a futuristic analysis of BizTech and innovation in Africa. Subscribe here to get it directly in your inbox on Sundays at 3 PM (WAT).\n\nThe African music industry is booming due to great musical talent, a diverse array of musical sounds, a young population, and increasing internet connectivity. But it was not always like this. For instance, the world\u2019s biggest music streaming service (with a 34% market share), Spotify, entered Nigeria in 2012, around the same time it expanded to Asia and the US. But, in 2012, Nigeria\u2019s smartphone and internet penetration were low, and the majority of the country still used the 2G network. This automatically meant low adoption of Spotify\u2019s service and low revenue. So, they abandoned the market for a while.\n\nIn a bid to tap into the potentials of the African entertainment industry, global players like YouTube Music and Spotify eye the continent. YouTube Music launched in South Africa in 2019 and Nigeria in 2020. Spotify returned to Nigeria last year, years after Nigerians had begun to use Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and third-party payment apps like Flutterwave\u2019s payment gateway Barter to bypass payment restrictions.\n\nBoluwatife Sanwo\u2013TechCabal Insights\n\nConverting a big user base to subscribers\n\nA report by Media Research indicates that MENA, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and Africa will account for 73% of global music subscriptions by 2028, counting from 2020. But average revenue per user in these developing markets is low\u20143\u20135 times smaller than in the US and Europe. Spotify, for example, charges subscribers in the US $9.9 per month, and for those in the UK $13.97. But, in Nigeria, it charges $1.7 (\u20a6900), and in South Africa $3.9 (R59.99). In India, subscribers pay between $1.63 and $2.00 per month.\n\nSince 2018, Spotify has expanded to 48 African countries, but because it gets its money from subscriptions and the continent has low spending power, it doesn\u2019t seem like the streaming giant will direct too much focus on its play on the continent. According to a study by UK Research firm, Midia Research, worldwide streaming subscriptions grew by 26.4% in the second quarter of 2021. It stood at 521.3 million subscribers at the end of the quarter, a huge growth from 109.5 million from the year before. But because the majority of this growth came from low-spending emerging markets, the 26.4% global growth in subscribers did not translate to a huge increase in revenue.\n\nIt is important to note, though, that Spotify\u2019s game plan transcends music streaming\u2014podcasts, audio advertising, audio branding, and audiobooks are crucial parts of its strategy.\n\nBoluwatife Sanwo\u2013TechCabal Insights\n\nWhat advantages do local platforms have?\n\nEven though local music platforms like Boomplay and Audiomack are barely known in the West, they have had a headstart in Africa. When YouTube Music launched in South Africa, Boomplay already had over 10 million downloads on Google Playstore. Boomplay apps come pre-installed on mobile phones made by China\u2019s Transsion\u2014makers of phone brands like Tecno, Infinix, and Itel, which are ubiquitous in Africa. What this means is that Boomplay\u2019s 60 million registered users might just be its starting point. According to research firm IDC, Transsion recorded over 40% of smartphone sales in Africa in the last quarter of 2019. As more Africans are coming online by the minute, it is very likely that they will use these Transsion phones, and when they do, Boomplay app users will keep increasing.\n\nThese local players also have a deeper relationship with the industry, artistes, music community, and media; and they don\u2019t have the payment barriers some foreign streaming apps have. Not only do Audiomack and Boomplay allow Africans to use their streaming platform for free, and download and listen offline, they allow them to use their service with affordable data. These platforms, instead of introducing just Western musicians to their audiences, serve as avenues for them to discover exciting new African musicians. For new artistes, it exposes them to millions of new audiences, and offers them a ticket to stardom even while they are yet to get a deal with a record label or distributor.\n\nPartner Message\n\nReceive money from over 30 countries directly to your bank account or mobile wallet.

The Abu Dhabi-headquartered streaming platform, which serves the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries, became the first Arab tech company to go public. Anghami has more than 70 million registered users and has a partnership with music\u2019s Big Three\u2014Universal Music Group, Sony Music, and Warner Music Group. Like Boomplay\u2019s Transsion advantage and Audiomack\u2019s partnership with telco, MTN, Anghami partnered with 37 telcos (as of last year) to help subsidise and promote its music services.\n\nPartner Message\n\nThe 10X Thrive Conference brings the best minds from the world\u2019s most successful companies across Africa, Europe, America, Asia.\n\nNo PowerPoint presentations, just real stories and tips you can act immediately to take your life, career, business to the next level! Register for free here.\n\nStreaming services generated 84% of all US music revenue in the first 6 months of 2021, i.e. $5.9 billion. Clearly, subscription is king, with paid subscriptions accounting for 78% of streaming revenue, growing by 26% year-on-year to reach $4.6 billion. In all, streaming subscriptions accounted for about two-thirds (65%) of total recorded music revenues in the first half of 2021 in the US.\n\nOn the flip side is Africa, whose streaming revenue is much lower. African artistes made $300 million from streaming in the entire 2021. While the majority of music subscribers in the coming decade will come from developing countries, revenue potential on the continent, as it stands, remains unattractive to global companies. Still, there is a chance that the success of Tencent Music Entertainment and NetEase Cloud Music in China and Anghami in MENA (which, combined, accumulated 35.7 million subscribers in a year) can be replicated by local music streaming services like Boomplay and Audiomack in Africa.\n\nHave a great week.\n\n\n\nThank you for reading The Next Wave.

          "title": "Saudi Arabia: A new home for Nigerian startups?",
          "text": "For Nigerians who want to start or already run their businesses, there\u2019s a constant concern about access to supporting infrastructure, funding, and talent. These concerns are the primary causes of high failure among startups on the continent.\n\nThe startup failure rate in Nigeria reportedly stood at 61% in 2021, meaning only 39% survive. This is similar across Africa where startup failure rates range from 75% in Ethiopia and 74% in Ghana to 58.3% in Senegal and 58.7% in Kenya.\n\nIn a bid to increase the success rate and accelerate the transition to a digital economy, the Saudi Arabian government is partnering with Nigerian authorities to provide Nigerian entrepreneurs with expedited entry and support via Digital Cooperation Organization (DCO) Startup Passport.\n\nThe Startup Passport initiative, which will ultimately be between the 8-member DCO countries, rolled out initially in Saudi Arabia and Nigeria. This announcement implies that Nigerian startups building products that primarily serve the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region are invited to build their companies from Saudi Arabia with support from the government.\n\nThis initiative was launched at LEAP, a global event for future technologies being held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, from February 1 to 3 and attended by leading technology corporations, global start-up pioneers, and venture capitalists.\n\nFaris AlSaqabi, Saudi Deputy Minister for Future Jobs and Capabilities, explained that the bond between Saudi Arabia and Nigeria is fueled by the country\u2019s movement to a digital economy.\n\n\u201cNigeria is one of the key players in the digital economy. We\u2019ve noticed you cannot do it alone, so we have to partner with other countries.\u201d\n\nAt LEAP, \u201cThe Garage\u201d, a world-class innovation hub to support emerging and disruptive technology-based startups was also announced. The name is inspired by the origin stories of many of the world\u2019s top tech companies that famously started from inside garages.\n\nAlongside other business leaders who were present at the event, Nigerian Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Pantami; Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Communications Commission, Umar Danbatta, and other delegates were attendees.\n\nNigerian Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Pantami in conversation with a representative of the Digital Cooperation Organization. Source: DCO\n\n\u201cOne lesson we can pick from Saudi Arabia\u2019s success is that we should take away the word impossible. We should be optimistic about any plans we have for transforming Nigeria,\u201d Pantami told TechCabal. \u201cWhoever comes to Saudi for the first time after some years and sees the changes will appreciate what\u2019s going on in the digital economy. Their institutions are no longer obsolete. They\u2019re not just advanced but proactive.\u201d\n\nHe further said that his presence at the conference is to connect with potential investors, government officials, tech giants, and even startups. \u201cWe\u2019ve been having a series of meetings with investors on how they can come to Nigeria and invest. Some of the global tech giants are willing to come to Nigeria and establish their manufacturing plants.\u201d\n\nPantami pointed out that Nigeria\u2019s large economy, youthful population, and its exit from the recent recession are some reasons why investors are excited about the country, despite there also being a few areas to improve on.\n\n\u201cThe first meeting I had, they were surprised that Nigeria has 6 successful unicorns and still many are coming. The fastest-growing economy is the digital sector, which played a pivotal role in exiting the country out of recession.\u201d\n\nAlongside the Nigerian delegation, Domineum, Tanadi, Rice Afrika and 7 other Nigerian startups were also present at the event.\n\nAll roads lead to Vision 2030\n\nSo far, investments worth about $10 billion in technology and startups were announced at LEAP.\n\nThe investments and initiatives include the launch of Aramco Venture\u2019s Prosperity7 fund with $1 billion, and a billion dollar investment from NEOM Tech & Digital Company with a focus on future technologies. The Saudi Telecom Company announced MENA HUB, a $1 billion investment in regional connectivity and infrastructure.\n\nIgnite, a $1.1 billion investment targeted at the creative industry, was also launched. This new program is expected to transform Saudi Arabia into a leading digital entertainment and media production hub.\n\nTo provide better internet service, WiFi 6E was launched, supported by the largest amount of spectrum available for WiFi of any country worldwide. This is accompanied by other connectivity-boosting initiatives, including the first regional trial of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite technology to extend reliable coverage to remote areas of the Kingdom.\n\nThese announcements are all connected to Saudi Arabia\u2019s Vision 2030, a drive to reduce dependence on oil and diversify its economy.\n\nSince the drive to achieve the Vision 2030 began in 2016, there\u2019s been considerable changes in Saudi Arabia, notably the liberalisation of its entertainment sector, provision of tourism visas and relaxing its rules for tourists as well as lifting the ban for women to drive in 2018\u2014the last country in the world to do so.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thinking about the emerging technologies and the future of jobs for our people because soon millions of current jobs will be replaced by technology,\u201d AlSaqabi said. \u201cThis means we\u2019ll lose millions of dollars if we don\u2019t adopt emerging technologies. There is no excuse to wait for the future to come, we have to go to it.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

As had a previous attempt made 10 years prior.\n\nA 2019 court order finally put a temporary halt to new card issuance after a paltry 1.2 million cards had been issued. NIMC then switched attention from e-cards to simply issuing paper-printed National Identification Numbers (NINs). So far, NIMC has successfully registered over 71 million Nigerian residents and citizens, representing roughly 35% of the population.\n\nNow Nigeria\u2019s identity management office is rolling out the next phase of its ambitious digital ID programme, a virtual e-ID that anonymises the personally identifiable information used for KYC verification.\n\nOn the one hand, it\u2019s a long-overdue milestone, and on the other hand, it is a confidence signal that the government is serious about digitally ID-ing Nigerians.\n\nWhy are digital IDs important?\n\nGenerally speaking, legal identification is important. People have the right to be recognised legally by their government for social protection, financial inclusion, and migration. Identification is how people prove that recognition. Theoretically, what digital IDs do is simply replace paper records with digitally stored and accessible ID databases.\n\nOf course, today\u2019s digital IDs do much more than simply recognise and authenticate identity claims. Some governments want them to serve as intermediaries between the population and access to basic services.\n\nIndia\u2019s Aadhaar number is a good example of a widely successful digital identity project. Aadhaar now covers 99% of Indian adults, a huge feat in itself, given the country\u2019s huge population. According to K. Sudhir and Shyam Sunder, both faculty members at Yale, \u201cBecause of Aadhaar, many have gained access to public services they had long been entitled to. Banks and mobile phone companies have enrolled poor people who previously had been seen as too risky and cost-prohibitive to be viable customers.\u201d\n\nSubsidies and food aid, which used to be diverted through \u201cghost\u201d recipients, now go to the people who need them, and rural-urban migrants are able to access an entire suite of services that would otherwise be challenging to access. In Malawi, fingerprinting for credit disbursement helped reduce loan default rates and supported repayment behaviour.\n\nHowever, untokenised unique identifying numbers (UINs), like Nigeria\u2019s NIN, can leave people vulnerable to privacy abuses since the individual has one identifying number which follows them across every database they interact with. For example, NIMC recommends that Nigerians not share their NIN, but the same NIN is one of the channels for verifying customer identity.\n\nA digital token is that crucial additional layer that prevents personally identifiable information (PII) from being recorded while allowing a company to securely verify the user\u2019s identity. My earlier example, India\u2019s Aadhaar, is tokenised in a similar way as NIMC intends. What is more? India\u2019s Reserve Bank has even asked all service providers to tokenise card and card-on-file storage, but that\u2019s a story for another day. The point is, tokenisation is an important component of privacy protection.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nImproving data privacy\n\nIn 2019, following the footsteps of Europe, Nigeria\u2019s National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) issued the Nigerian Data Protection Regulation (NDPR). The NDPR was largely based on the European example, but some analysts argue that it is inadequate and lacks sufficient legal status, as it is not a law. That flaw, combined with the fact that a proposed data protection bill was abandoned by the federal government late last year, has allowed a legal grey zone for how data is handled in Nigeria.\n\nFor example, private companies might handle, store, or even sell personal data in ways that are not only unethical but legally grey. A NIN token prevents that from even happening instead of simply relying on the honor code illusion.\n\nBy tokenising the authentication process, NIMC is helping to prevent users\u2019 personally identifiable information from being accessed and stored unethically by private companies.\n\nNow NIMC has asked service providers to only verify NIN tokens, not the actual NINs. This KYC policy update means that startups, telcos, and the organisations that use NIN will need to update their onboarding processes and app interfaces to be able to verify NIN tokens. According to Kasim Sodangi, Head of Compliance, NITDA, using NIN tokens to verify user identities will be cheaper for private companies\u2019 KYC.\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nUsers can create NIN tokens from NIMC\u2019s mobile application or generate the tokens via USSD (*346*3*Your NIN*AgentCode#). Agent codes are like unique merchant numbers that identify the service provider requesting the verification. This means that tokens generated for merchant X can only be used for that merchant and remain valid for only 72 hours.\n\nWhat does this mean for service providers?\n\nIn general terms, nothing much changes. Service providers can still use the Bank Verification Number (BVN) or any other KYC verification channel to authenticate users\u2019 identities. The only big change applies to startups that require NIN for KYC. Such companies will have to apply as enterprises to get unique merchant keys with which they can verify virtual NINs or tokens. Or use KYC verification services like Smile Identity to access NIMC\u2019s API. NIMC also says using the service will be cheaper than using BVNs for KYC.\n\nNIMC launched the NIN tokens in January, and while telcos and Nigeria\u2019s National Pension Commission (PENCOM) have begun dry runs of the new process, Usman Abiola, Principal Product Manager at Smile Identity says they were yet to try the product and expected to get access later in February. NIMC has issued over 70 million NINs despite debilitating trust issues and a generally poor service infrastructure. A lot of that success comes from the mandated linking of NINs to individual SIM cards. Tokenisation will protect people\u2019s personal data, for sure, but that is only one part of the enormous work needed to fix data protection and enforcement in Nigeria.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

And from this school of thought to this one, we saw different takes on whether employees should jump ship within six months of employment and whether they should accept freelance gigs. Made for some scintillating exchanges, if I\u2019m honest.\n\nWhat do you think, though? Should employees take freelance work? Are they unserious when they leave a job within a year? I\u2019m curious to hear your thoughts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, in Today\u2019s Digest, we\u2019d be discussing\n\nThe competition fintechs may not see coming, and\n\nThe tech/Afrobeats combo\n\nWho\u2019s competing with fintechs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting the scene: These days, for a lot of financial transactions that we make, we often have to jump between different apps for them.\n\nTo transfer money, you have options ranging from your bank, your savings apps, and your investment apps. For bill payments, you\u2019d probably have to move to another app. And we\u2019ve not even touched on cross-border payments or options for investment or even the decentralised finance space.\n\nA crossroads: This situation just goes to show how inefficient the traditional banking system had become and why the need for fintechs like Paystack, Flutterwave, Cowrywise, among others, rose. But these fintechs might soon find themselves facing some stiff competition they might not have expected.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, though: I\u2019m not saying fintech startups are having a bad run, but here\u2019s the thing, there are a lot of them. Interestingly, when I talked to Adedeji Olowe last year for The Next Frontier series, he quite disagreed.\n\nAt Techpoint Build 2021, Oluwatobi Boshoro, CEO of Infinitetiks, spoke on Business model innovation: the rise of ecosystems and platforms based on changing customer attitudes. While giving this overview, she touched on several things, including possible competition from non-fintech startups.\n\nCurious?

Before that, most of us got our music from illegal download sites, and if you could afford it, iTunes. Of course, you could purchase CDs and Vinyl too.\n\nNow, platforms like Spotify, YouTube Music, and Apple Music are currently trying to take a huge piece of the African pie.\n\nThey\u2019ve also helped catapult Afrobeats \u2014 one of Africa\u2019s most prominent exports on the music scene \u2014 to the world stage faster. Artists like Rema, Burna Boy, and Tems blazing trails and setting new records.\n\nAt Techpoint Build 2021, the music panel had quite a bit to say, taking us through the history, the now, and probably the future.\n\nGrab your prefered poison and come along for this ride: Afrobeats: \u201cThere are global moments, but the biggest opportunity is Nigeria.\u201d \u2014 Obi Asika\n\nStories from the week before\n\nWhat I\u2019m listening to/reading/watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nPaystack is hiring.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAfrobeats is the movement; it\u2019s the underdog, a mongrel that had no home and somehow, has managed to use global platforms to manoeuvre and invade the world with that melody that comes from our music.\u201d \u2014 Obi Asika.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObi Asika, Founder of Storm 360 Records and Co-founder of Social Media Week Lagos\n\nThere is no doubt that African music, especially Afrobeats \u2014 the melting pot of West African music styles blended with American Jazz \u2014 has gone global. It has become a norm to see non-Africans identifying with Afrobeats and enjoying the African rhythm.\n\nHowever, it didn\u2019t happen overnight. With the help of media companies focused on music and the Internet, Afrobeats has travelled across the globe as an internationally recognised sound.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoey Akan, Founder and CEO Afrobeat Intelligence. Moderator of the Afrobeats session\n\nTechnology has played an outstanding role in the popularity of Afrobeats. From tools that create the melody Obi Asika describes as the \u2018sweet spot\u2019 to the platforms that have pushed those melodies across hemispheres and into the hearts of people with no ties with Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe early days\n\nObi Asika has been in the Nigerian music industry for several decades; he has watched the industry mature from the homeless mongrel to the behemoth that it is now. He is the Founder of Storm 360 Records and Co-founder of Social Media Week Lagos, one of the most significant new media and technology conferences in Africa.\n\nSpeaking at Techpoint Build 2021, during the panel session themed: Afrobeats to the World: Nigerian Domination, Asika explained the journey of Afrobeats from the beginning to where it is now and the opportunities that artistes and everyone in the music business should be leveraging.\n\n\u201cI remember then when you tell people in the West, \u2018I\u2019ve got some guys in Lagos that can rap better than anyone in the world,\u2019 they\u2019ll look at you like you\u2019re mad and ask who is interested in whatever young Africans have to say or do?\u201d Asika said.\n\nAccording to him, people in the West imagined Afrobeats as traditional music. Still, the sound has evolved through the years, retaining its African origins while mixed with sounds from different parts of the world.\n\nAmerican online education platform, MasterClass, traces the history of Afrobeats to the early 20th Century when Ghanaian musicians merged West African regional music with Western Jazz and Calypso to create highlife music. This was then fused with Western influences to create Afrobeats.\n\nAfrobeats continued to evolve, but its power was still unknown, not just to the West but to the Africans wielding it. A problem, Asika said, was solved by Channel O, a South Africa-based music channel.\n\n\u201cIn the mid-90s, young Africans were seeing people that looked like them on Channel O, doing amazing things. That generated a spur of energy for the next decade.\u201d\n\nAfter Channel O opened the eyes of Africans and the world of what was possible with Afrobeats, MTV Base Africa, a 24-hour music channel, continued the spur of energy. Social media took on from there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMTV Base Africa changed the level in terms of quality. By the late 2000s, we had Myspace, then Facebook, followed by YouTube,\u201d Asika noted.\n\nMusic streaming platforms changed everything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddy Awofisayo, Head of Music, Sub-Saharan Africa at YouTube,\n\nAddy Awofisayo, Head of Music, Sub-Saharan Africa at YouTube, agreed with Asika on how these platforms have helped Afrobeats.\n\nShe said, \u201cWhen people ask me the reason why Afrobeats is going global, I say it\u2019s the platforms. Not just YouTube, but Spotify, Apple Music, and TikTok.\n\n\u201cBack in the days, if you didn\u2019t live in Nigeria and wanted to listen to 2Face, you\u2019d need someone from Nigeria to bring you a CD. But now, you just go on YouTube and search for it.\u201d\n\nAwofisayo also added that platforms such as hers \u2014 YouTube \u2014 try to create initiatives that can amplify the voices and talents created in Africa. An example is Foundry, a programme that helps artistes grow their presence on YouTube and \u201cbreak them outside of their market.\u201d\n\nHowever, artistes are not the only ones who need support. Awofisayo pointed out that \u201cfor an artiste to be successful, they need an army of people around them. A great producer, songwriter and manager.\u201d\n\nIn light of this, YouTube also created a programme to support songwriters and producers. It was through this program Awofisayo got to know P.Priime, the producer behind the hit song, Infinity.\n\nThe importance of music platforms can also be exemplified through the amount of money they generate. Streaming services, for example, generated about $300 million for African artistes in 2021. This number is estimated to reach $500 million by 2025.\n\nWhile Asika believes that several platforms played a significant role in making Afrobeats go global, the talents that create the music play the biggest part.\n\n\u201cThat melody from our music is what drives everything!\u201d\n\nThe future of Afrobeats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictor Okpala. Spotify\u2019s West African Artist and Label Partnerships Manager\n\nSeeing music beyond art but as a product is what Victor Okpala, Spotify\u2019s West African Artist and Label Partnerships Manager, projects for African and Nigerian music.\n\n\u201cMusic is not just art; it\u2019s a product. It goes through a life-cycle as most products.\u201d\n\nThe reason Okpala wants music to be seen as a product is to see more investors coming into the space. Despite the growth that has been seen in the Nigerian music industry, there are still a lot of issues when it comes to funding.\n\nAccording to Okpala, the cost of producing high-quality videos is skyrocketing, and as Nigerian music goes global, it has to deliver world-class content. As it becomes increasingly challenging to create content that can compete internationally, we \u201cneed people to come into the space and fund the product called music.\u201d\n\nFor Henry Cocobassey, a Nigerian music executive and NFT collector, the future of Afrobeats is on the blockchain. Cocobassey told a story of how he collaborated with a Nigerian music artist, Challex D\u2019 Boss, to sell 10 thousand copies of minted non-fungible token (NFT) music in two weeks.\n\nHe said NFTs are like \u201ca new revolution where the artiste isn\u2019t the only one earning money off music but the fans too.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHenry Cocobassey is a Nigerian music executive, NFT collector, and CEO of Unique Sirius.\n\nThis is only the beginning\n\nWith a 51.44% Internet penetration rate in Nigeria, Awofisayo believes Afrobeats has barely begun to scratch the surface of what it is capable of.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot more people out there that are not able to access the Internet and able to consume music on platforms like YouTube and Spotify,\u201d Awofisayo submitted.\n\n\u201cOnce we see the Internet no longer becoming a barrier, we\u2019re truly going to see how African music will blow up. Though we\u2019re going global, there\u2019s still so much opportunity on the continent that is unrealised, and I think the Internet is the barrier and once that goes away, what we\u2019re going to see will completely blow our minds!\u201d She added.\n\nObi Asika\u2019s future for Afrobeats lies in the home of Afrobeats \u2014 Nigeria. To him, the conversation about Afrobeats in the future will be based on who did the most in the \u201chome market.\u201d which is the most important market.\n\n\u201cThere are global moments, but the biggest opportunity is Nigeria!\u201d He said emphatically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "text": "The current expectation is that the incoming Dangote Refinery will solve all of Nigeria\u2019s petrol subsidy woes, the government thinks, but findings by BusinessDay show otherwise.\n\nAfter years of hopes and delays, Dangote Refinery, expected to be Africa\u2019s biggest oil refinery and the world\u2019s biggest single-train facility, is expected to start with a processing capacity of 540,000 barrels per day between August and September 2022, while full production is expected at the beginning of 2023.\n\nWith the hype and hope, many Nigerians already think the project would reverse the government\u2019s expensive subsidy practice and save foreign exchange so much so that it would reduce the pump price of petroleum products, but Biodun Adedipe, an economist and chief consultant, BAA Consult, thinks otherwise.\n\n\u201cThe Dangote Refinery will not solve the myriad of challenges bedevilling Nigeria\u2019s downstream sector such as lack of transparency, accountability, the domineering stature,\u201d he says.\n\nFor Adedipe, the Dangote Refinery is built on dollar-denominated loans, which means the project would focus more on speedily generating the dollars to services and repay those loans rather than selling cheap petrol.\n\nAt the project\u2019s launch less than a decade ago, the refinery was expected to cost $9 billion. By 2019, it ballooned to $15 billion. Now analysts say the figure is an estimated $19 billion, which is a combination of equity and debt.\n\n\u201cThe pump price of petrol from Dangote Refinery will reflect the market price of crude and cost of production, which will not be static at any point,\u201d Adedipe notes.\n\nIsrael Aye, the managing partner of the Commercial and Energy Law Practice (CELP) believes that \u201cthe only difference that would happen if Nigeria\u2019s supply was coming from in-country would have been the freight price. But whether it is coming from outside or coming from within, it will be about the same cost because when you import, the only difference is that you will have to pay the freight.\u201d\n\nAs of February 1, 2022, the upturn in the price of Brent Crude pushed the landing cost of Premium Motor Spirit (petrol) imported into Nigeria to over N282 per liter, thanks to a freight cost of $26.77 per MT (N8.31 per liter), according to finding from Platts.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing like an opportunity for buying things at a cheaper price, it will be based on the international standard,\u201d Bello Rabiu, formerly the chief operating officer, Upstream at Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), states.\n\nOther cost elements that make up the landing cost include lightering expenses (N4.81), Nigerian Ports Authority charge (N2.49), Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency charge (N0.23), jetty throughput charge (N1.61), storage charge (N2.58), and financing (N2.17).\n\nIn Africa\u2019s biggest oil producer, the pump price is the sum of the landing cost, wholesaler margin (N4.03), admin charge (N1.23), transporters allowance (N3.89), bridging fund (N7.51), marine transport average (N0.15), and retailer margin (N6.19).\n\n\u201cThe hope the Dangote Refinery brings is refreshing but relying on a single project to rescue the oil and gas sector of the world\u2019s 13th-largest crude producer points to the years of neglect that has riddled the sector and its damming frailty,\u201d Joe Nwakwue, former chairman of Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE), says.\n\nOther experts are unanimous in their views that full deregulation would, in the long run, benefit ordinary Nigerians, and positively change the industry\u2019s fortunes forever if the government put the right structures in place.\n\n\u201cWithout full deregulation in Nigeria\u2019s downstream sector, we shouldn\u2019t expect any miracle,\u201d Nwakwue states.\n\nAt a recent foreign investors\u2019 meeting in New York, the Central Bank of Nigeria governor, Godwin Emefiele, stated that Nigeria\u2019s import of petroleum products that accounted for 30 percent of its forex could be reversed by the successful commencement of operations at the Dangote Refinery.\n\nRead also: Dangote\u2019s giant Oil Refinery to Begin Production in Third Quarter of 2022\n\n\u201cThe Dangote Refinery once it begins production would be a major FX saving source for Nigeria,\u201d the governor said, adding that \u201cif the 650,000\u201d daily barrels that will be produced from the refinery will \u201cbe sold in naira it would be a major FX saver for Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe CEO of Financial Derivatives Company, Bismarck Rewane, also thinks the Dangote Refinery will not solve all of Nigeria\u2019s problems in the downstream petroleum sector.\n\n\u201cDangote Refinery as a silver bullet to solving Nigeria\u2019s foreign exchange problem is a misunderstanding of the facts. It will help in reducing refining cost, it will help in reducing transportation cost but it is the oil that you are going to export that will give you a dollar,\u201d Rewane said during a panel session at the IMF\u2019s Public Presentation of the fall 2021 Issue of the Regional Economic Outlook.\n\nThis is however not to say the huge refinery will not have any impact at all.\n\nFindings by BusinessDay show if the Dangote Refinery operations go as announced, the refinery would add 0.6 percentage points to Nigeria\u2019s GDP in 2022 with an estimate of 2.7 percent increase to 3.3 percent.\n\nFurther estimates show the refinery would add 2.2 percentage points to Nigeria\u2019s GDP in 2023, based on an estimate of 2.8 percent increase to 5.0 percent.\n\nThe criteria for these estimates are based on a conservative assumption that if the refinery starts in 2022 it will produce 10 percent of total capacity, 20 percent next year, and achieve full capacity after 2025.\n\nPundits believe the refinery should enable Nigeria to break free from the import of petroleum products and employ a large chunk of its unemployed youths. A piece of good news for the leading oil producer on the continent, which has faced several oil shortages.",

          "text": "The N3 trillion Africa\u2019s largest oil-producing country has committed to subsidising petrol in 2022 is no longer news, but what is more alarming is the opportunity cost forgone in a slow-growing economy that could use more investments.\n\nThe situation concerning the opaque petrol subsidy is having such a negative impact on the Nigerian economy, that despite global oil price topping $90 for the first time since 2014, every gain from oil exports is now almost entirely cancelled out by the costly subsidy regime.\n\nBusinessDay analysis reveals that the proposed subsidy spree of N3 trillion could have provided funds that would have been allocated to education, health, defence, and agriculture and rural development that would have increased the economic growth or standard of living of its over 200 million people.\n\nHealthcare\n\nFor instance, an analysis by BusinessDay shows the proposed subsidy spree of N3 trillion can fully equip 100,000 primary health centres across the country (at N30m each).\n\nThese would have improved access to health for the people and also created jobs for an average of 10 persons per health centre.\n\nHousing\n\nThe subsidy spree is capable of building at least 200,000 mortgage homes valued at N15 million each, a development that can play a big role in reducing Nigeria\u2019s housing deficit projected at 20 million.\n\nWater supply\n\nThe N3 trillion can construct at least 5 million boreholes at N600,000 each across the country. This could have reduced the challenges of proper sanitation faced by acute water scarcity in communities, especially in rural areas.\n\nStart-up capital\n\nAlso, close to 3 million entrepreneurs could have been empowered with an N1 million loan each to boost their businesses, a development that could culminate in job creation, increased GDP, and improved living standards for millions of Nigerians.\n\nSolar electricity\n\nThe subsidy spree is also capable of adding 27,342 megawatts (MW) of solar electricity to the national grid at N360 million per megawatt. This would have improved the power supply to the manufacturing industries, hence, enhancing production at a lower cost, which would have translated into low prices of goods.\n\nRead also: When is the right time to remove petroleum subsidy?\n\nEducation\n\nUsing Freedom of Information requests and analysis by transparency campaign group Public Private Development Centre, it would cost an estimated N17 million to build a 3-classroom block. This means N3 trillion is capable of building 176,470 blocks of classrooms needed across Nigeria\u2019s 774 local governments.\n\nThe subsidy spree is also capable of providing educational support through the tertiary level to 600,000 Nigerian children provided with educational support through the tertiary level at N5 million each.\n\nAgric machinery\n\nN3 trillion can also purchase an estimated 300,000 agricultural incubators used for the artificial hatching of fertilised eggs. This could have increased the efficiency and productivity of Nigerian farmers on the farm leading to greater output.\n\nGood roads\n\nThe decision to allocate N3 trillion to petrol subsidy also means Nigeria may have lost an opportunity to construct 6,000km of roads across major highways at N500 million each.\n\nRefineries\n\nEmerald Energy Institute at the University of Port Harcourt estimated the construction cost of a 100,000-barrels per day (bpd) refinery plant at $2 billion (N830bn). This means the unremitted N3 trillion could have helped the country construct at least three of such refineries, instead of importing light petroleum products estimated at $15 billion per annum.\n\nImmunisation\n\nThe expenditure on subsidy for petrol also dwarfs the government proposed 2022 spending of N45.19 billion allocated for immunisation against measles, whooping cough, and tetanus to the most vulnerable and disadvantaged children, despite a United Nations International Children\u2019s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) report showing 4.3 million children in Nigeria still miss out on regular vaccinations every year.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe illegal action of sponsoring thugs to win party congresses in Osun is a recipe for violence. Governor Oyetola is inducing violence in Osun APC by orchestrating thugs attack and manipulated the state APC congresses. The use of thugs in Osun APC by Governor Oyetola to conduct ward, local government and state congresses clearly shows the level of bad governance in Osun State. The illegality and the danger of sponsoring thugs to win Osun 2022 election poses a great threat to 2023 election in Nigeria. Every democratic system has to regulate the flow of money and use of thugs for political gains. Illegal thugs funding for Osun 2022 election presents certain problems to future elections in modern liberal and the emerging democracy in Nigeria. Sponsoring of thugs in Osun State fails to guarantee fairness and equality in the competition among candidates and political parties. The outcome of Osun 2022 election may not reflect the interest of the majority in Osun State, but the interest of the financier of the thugs. This will necessitates reactions in the form of violence, which characterized Nigerian political system in the post general election, postelection litigation, and postelection violence. It is important for me to emphasize that many democratic governments to continually strive toward reducing thugs and money in politics. The danger ahead of Osun 2022 election is that Governor Oyetola used thugs to conduct APC state congress and he is set to use thugs against other political parties that will participate in the Osun 2022 election. Governor Oyetola is now a threat to members of Osun APC and a threat to Nigeria\u2019s 2023 elections because he is not committed to free and fair election.\n\nI want to urge Governor Oyetola to concentrate on winning elections by the performance of his party and not by relying on thugs and violence for electoral victory. Good governance remains the surest path towards winning elections especially when you are committed to free and fair and credible elections devoid of the kind of violence witnessed in Osun State today. So instead of trying to pacify by violent and lawlessness just because Oyetola wants to win election, Oyetola should support the stellar performance being displayed by former Governor Aregbesola in Osun State, that way, he will not need the services of his thugs to win Osun 2022 election.\n\nGovrnor Oyetola has been sending thugs to attack members of Osun APC since 2021 so as to disrupt members of Osun APC meetings and prevent them from getting justice. Governor Oyetola is so sad that he will not be able to win Osun 2022 governorship election because of his bad governance. If Oyetola can rely on thugs to win APC PRIMARY, I wonder what will happen to Oyetola during July election. We are now seeing desperation and frustration in the behaviour of Governor Oyetola.\n\nThe attack on the Oranmiyan House, the political edifice of the immediate past governor and current Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola will not help Governor Oyetola to win Osun 2022 election. Osun state governor, Adegboyega Oyetola and some leaders of the faction supported by the governor are sponsoring attacks against Aregbesola\u2019s supporters. Governor Oyetola is pursuing victory without peace in Osun State because he lacks the experience of a leader and he is still behaving as if he is still working in an insurance company. These attacks are sponsored by the state government through the campaign structure of the governor, known as Ilerioluwa.\n\nThe hoodlums that attacking members of Osun APC were identified for the police in the state, but they were yet to make any arrest. I want to call on the Inspector-General of Police Usman Alkali Baba to act swiftly on these attacks.\n\nThugs working for Governor Oyetola have denied members of Osun APC from conducting ward congress and state congress in 2021. Thugs seized their voting credentials and beat them up to produce Famodun as state chairman. The inability to conduct a free and fair state congress in Osun is a reflection of what Governor Oyetola stood for in Osun. The 2,517 aggrieved members of Osun APC have gone to court. It is not Aregbesola\u2019s camp that has gone to court. They are card-carrying members of Osun APC. They are pursuing their rights. I want to correct the wrong impression about labelling aggrieved members as Aregbesola\u2019s camp. Aggrieved members have the rights to go to court. The implication of 2,517 aggrieved members of APC court suit is that Governor Oyetola has lost his popularity and now relies on thugs to conduct ordinary party congress in Osun State. Thugs cannot save Governor Oyetola from defeat in Osun 2022 election. I want to warn that 2,517 aggrieved members should not be reduced to Aregbesola\u2019s name.\n\nAggrieved members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Osun State that dragged the leadership of the party to court to challenge the outcome of the last state congress in the state will go to court of appeal to challenge the judgment. A total of 2,517 aggrieved members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in 26 local governments of the State of Osun have approached a Federal High Court, sitting in Osogbo, the state capital, to challenge the Ward Congress of the party, held on July 31, 2021 in the state. They are being victimised by political operatives in Osun loyal to Oyetola.\n\nGovernor Oyetola failed when he refused to submit Aregbesola\u2019s name for ministerial appointment but he was disappointed when Aregbesola was appointed as minister. Governor Oyetola failed when he used thugs to conduct Osun APC ward congress and now he is confused whether to revoke the certificate of occupancy of Oraminyan House in Osogbo. Governor Oyetola has resorted to the use of arrest and judicial harassment of political opponents since he is no longer popular in Osun. In March 2021 Olateju Adunni, the Personal Assistant to Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola was attacked by some hired thugs.\n\nThe popular Oranmiyan House belonging to the Honourable Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Ar\u00e9gb\u00e9sol\u00e1 has constantly come under attack because it the venue of the weekly stakeholders meeting of The Osun Progressives (TOP) .\n\nBystanders who watched the siege from a far how thugs armed with guns and other dangerous weapon unleashed terror on Oranmiyan House couldn\u2019t hold their tears as information has it that the floor targeted by the gun men was proposed to house TOP hierarchies meeting which was billed to hold immediately after the Thursday general meeting. Armed political hoodlums have been sponsored by Governor Adegboyega Oyetola-led IleriOluwa faction of the All Progressives Congress (APC), are currently attacking Oranmiyan House in Osogbo.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nInwalomhe Donald writes from Osogbo, Osun State.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

We are, however, lucky now to have a youth who can positively steer the ship of the Nigerian state to the advantage of every citizen.\n\n\u201cOur ardent hope and confidence is Bello\u2019s commitment and zeal to take the bull by the horn to aspire for the plum seat which is a commendable courage worthy of emulation by every youth worth his or her salt,\u201d Karami told journalists.\n\nAnother participant, Imam Sulaiman Abdullahi Azare, expressed confidence that the prayers would not go in futility, adding that their supplications would not only meet their demand but also pave the way for peaceful co-existence among the diverse people of Nigeria.\n\nImam Azare said he was optimistic that their prayers would provide the much-desired leadership for Nigeria even if such was not bestowed on Governor Bello.",

          "text": "The Nigerian government on Monday revealed some of the actions it is taking under the radar regarding the allegations against a police officer, Abba Kyari, and suspected fraudster, Ramon Abbas, popularly known as Hushpuppi.\n\nTop of these actions, according to the Minister of Justice and Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF), Mr Abubakar Malami, is the collaboration with the United States government to ensure justice is served.\n\n\u201cThe position now is that there are prima facie grounds \u2013 reasonable grounds for suspicion that have been considered from the perspective of prosecution, from the perspective of likely extradition, if the need for so doing arises,\u201d said the Minister who was a guest on Channels Television\u2019s Politics Today.\n\n\u201cIt is an issue that has both national and international dimensions and in respect of the two, actions are being taken; it is a work in progress locally and internationally and we are doing whatever it takes to ensure justice is done within the context of the law, regardless of the personalities involved.\u201d\n\nHushpuppi, an Instagram influencer, was arrested in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in June 2020, and was extradited to the U.S. where most of the victims of his alleged fraudulent activities are based.\n\nHaving spent about one year in custody maintaining his innocence, he later pleaded guilty to multi-million-dollar fraud charges filed against him by the American government.\n\nRELATED\n\nUS Court Issues Arrest Warrant For Abba Kyari\n\nMoney Laundering: Hushpuppi Pleads Guilty, Risks 20 Years\u2019 Imprisonment\n\nIn the process, an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) indicted Kyari, a Deputy Commissioner of Police, leading to a warrant of arrest issued against him by a U.S. magistrate judge, Otis Wright.\n\nThis led to Kyari\u2019s suspension from the police and from his position as the Head of Intelligence Response Team (IRT) by the Police Service Commission in August last year.\n\nSix months after his suspension, the AGF told Channels Television on Monday that the Nigerian government was working with the U.S. on the cases against Kyari and Hushpuppi.\n\nHe stressed that issues that have to do with criminality and enforcement of laws associated with crimes and offences could have local and international colorations.\n\nExtradition Likely\n\nMalami described Hushpuppi\u2019s case as one involving multiple jurisdictions \u2013 Nigeria, the U.S., and the UAE.\n\n\u201cWithin the context of the international comity of nations, as it relates to the prosecution of cases, the international community is indeed collaborating and providing the necessary support for the purpose of ensuring that justice is done to the case with the peculiarities of the matter taken into consideration.\n\n\u201cSo, what I am saying, in essence, is that internationally and locally, all hands are on deck,\u201d said the minister who commended the existing collaboration between Nigeria and the U.S. in tackling criminality.\n\n\u201cSo, Nigeria is, indeed, doing the needful by way of supporting what America is doing for the purpose of ensuring that the cases are tried accordingly within the context of the American aspect of it, and then eventually if there is need for local prosecution, nothing as well stops it.\u201d\n\nAccording to the AGF, both countries have made progress in terms of joint investigations and the outcomes, although no prosecution is happening yet in Nigeria.\n\nHe restated that the government would not rule out the possibility of consideration for the extradition of Kyari, as there have been exchanges of correspondence in that regard as well as investigation and associated matters.\n\nAsked if the suspended police officer was guilty of the offences he was accused of, Malami responded, \u201cYou cannot find someone guilty but perhaps, the reasonable ground for suspicion can be established and will translate to prosecution that will eventually translate to it (being found guilty).\n\n\u201cReasonable ground for suspicion has been established and that will eventually translate to the possibility of prosecution and eventual conviction if, indeed, at the end of the day one is adjudged guilty by a court of law.\u201d",

In 2023, we will be in an even much deeper hole than in 2015,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThose struggling to be president, I hope they understand that the problems that they are going to face are multiples of the problems that were faced in 2015. All of us have to be ready for difficult decisions and if they are taken, we are all going to pay for them.\n\n\u201cBut the solution is not for all of us to jump into politics. This country needs good politicians. It needs imams, pastors, and bishops who are going to stand up and remind them (politicians) of the fear of God.\n\n\u201cIt needs technocrats who are going to critique their policies. It needs traditional rulers who are going to speak as the conscience of the people. Everyone has a role to play and we should try to play that role to the best of our ability.\u201d\n\nThe former Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) governor also called on Nigerians to pray for good leaders at all levels. He asked Nigerians to elect leaders who are competent to deliver the dividends of democracy to the benefit of the people.\n\nWhile warning the people against voting for people who woo them with money and other greek gifts, Sanusi advised that the electorates should choose leaders based on merits\n\n\u201cI think the most important thing is that we should continue to pray for our country that whoever emerges as president, governors, senators, leadership at all levels, that we get good leaders,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should also remind ourselves as citizens that we owe it to ourselves because we know that this country deserves better than we have been given.\u201d",

          "text": "The mayor of Canada\u2019s capital Ottawa has declared a state of emergency in response to more than a week of truckers\u2019 protests against Covid restrictions.\n\nJim Watson said the city was \u201ccompletely out of control\u201d, with demonstrators outnumbering police.\n\nHe said the protests posed a threat to residents\u2019 safety. There have also been reports of racial attacks.\n\nOttawa\u2019s centre has been paralysed, with vehicles and tents blocking roads.\n\nThe \u201cFreedom Convoy\u201d was sparked by the introduction last month of a new rule that all truckers must be vaccinated to cross the US-Canada border, but the protests have morphed into broader challenges to Covid health restrictions.\n\nThe protesters have since gathered in downtown Ottawa near Parliament Hill, and their demands have grown to include ending all such mandates nationwide and opposing the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\nSpeaking to Canadian radio station CFRA, Mr Watson said the protesters were behaving increasingly \u201cinsensitively\u201d by continuously \u201cblaring horns and sirens, [setting off] fireworks and turning it into a party\u201d.\n\n\u201cClearly, we are outnumbered and we are losing this battle,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThis has to be reversed \u2013 we have to get our city back.\u201d\n\nThe mayor did not give specific details about what measures he might impose, but police said on Sunday that they would step up enforcement, including possible arrests of those seeking to aid the protesters by bringing them supplies like fuel, toilet paper and food.\n\nA state of emergency will give the city additional powers, including access to equipment required by frontline workers and emergency services.\n\nMany Ottawa residents have objected to the demonstrations.\n\nComplaints range from idling trucks that impede traffic and makeshift wooden structures in city parks to lost income and fears of harassment and even violence.\n\nPolice have said they are concerned about how the convoy has attracted far-right and extremist elements, and on Sunday confirmed they were dealing with more than 60 criminal investigations, with alleged offences including \u201cmischief, thefts, hate crimes and property damage\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere have been racist signs, there have been a lot of reports of people being assaulted and harassed if they wear a mask,\u201d Stephanie Carvon, Ottawa resident and former national security analyst for the Canadian government told the BBC.\n\nShe added that some organisers of the protest hold extremist views but have \u201csuccessfully framed their actions in the name of the pandemic and ending the mandates, so they\u2019ve earned the sympathy of a lot of Canadians who may not necessarily realise where this has come from\u201d.\n\nOne demonstrator who drove for hours to join the protest in Ottawa, Kimberly Ball, told the AFP news agency that the protest was \u201cabout our freedom\u201d.\n\n\u201cA couple of people we know, friends, lost their jobs because of these mandates,\u201d she said, adding that she had concerns about the safety and effectiveness of Covid vaccines.\n\nCovid-19 vaccines have cut the risk of severe illness in those infected with the virus and serious side effects are extremely rare. More than 80% of the eligible population is fully vaccinated and a recent poll showed a majority of Canadians favoured imposing more restrictions on the unvaccinated.\n\nA recent opinion poll by Abacus Data suggested 68% of Canadians felt they had \u201cvery little in common\u201d with the protesters, while 32% said they \u201chad a lot in common\u201d with the truckers.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Presidency on Sunday faulted a report on security challenges in the country, published in the January 31, 2022 edition of Financial Times of London Newspaper, saying banditry has been caged to the level that no territory in the country was under terrorists control.\n\nIn another breath, the Minister of Defence, Maj. Gen. Bashir Magashi (rtd), said at the weekend that the federal government was committed to providing more platforms for the military to sustain the tempo of operations in order to contain insurgency, banditry and other security challenges across the country.\n\nHowever, in a letter to the Editor, Financial Times, by presidential spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu, the Presidency expressed its concern over the wrong perceptions contained in the article: \u201cWhat is Nigeria\u2019s Government For,\u201d authored by David Piling.\n\nAccording to the one-page letter, the presidency stated: \u201cThe caricature of a government sleepwalking into disaster (What is Nigeria\u2019s government for? January 31, 2022 ) is predictable from a correspondent, who jets briefly in and out of Nigeria on the same British Airways flight he so criticises.\n\n\u201cHe highlights rising banditry in my country as proof of such slumber.\n\n\u2018What he leaves out are the security gains made over two presidential terms. The terror organisation Boko Haram used to administer an area the size of Belgium at inauguration; now, they control no territory.\n\n\u201cThe first comprehensive plan to deal with decades-old clashes between nomadic herders and sedentary farmers \u2013 experienced across the width of the Sahel \u2013 has been introduced: pilot ranches are reducing the competition for water and land that drove past tensions.\n\n\u201cBanditry grew out of such clashes. Criminal gangs took advantage of the instability, flush with guns that flooded the region following the Western-triggered implosion of Libya. The situation is grave. Yet as with other challenges, it is one that the government will face down.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Magashi, speaking at the end of the 2021 West African Social Activities (WASA) of the Army Headquarters Garrison, in Abuja, said President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s continuous support for the armed forces added impetus to the ongoing efforts by the Nigerian armed forces in the fight against insurgency.\n\n\u201cIt is based on the support of the federal government that the ministry had continued to strive relentlessly to keep the services by providing various grades of equipment and ammunition. We shall continue to make efforts to ensure that more platforms are prescribed to sustain the tempo of operations.\n\n\u201cI wish to state that you must imbibe good maintenance culture so as to make this equipment readily available, when needed for operations. It is worthy to mention that training is the best welfare that can be given to officers and soldiers and I am very appreciative of the efforts of the Chief of Army Staff for ensuring that all the training exercises for the year 2021, were successfully conducted,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister said the conduct of the training for the military had proven to be result-oriented, adding that several personnel, who were trained and deployed for operations had performed creditably well.\n\nHe reassured the Nigerian army that the ministry would continue to accord the welfare of officers and soldiers and their family a priority.\n\nMagashi also commended the officers and soldiers for their sacrifices towards ensuring enduring peace in the country, adding that 2021 was an eventful year characterised by challenges, sober moments and records of successes.\n\nHe recalled the gallant performance and sacrifices of the Nigerian army personnel in counterterrorism, counter insurgency and other operations across the country.\n\nIn his remarks, the Commander, Army Headquarters Garrison, Maj. Gen. Sanusi Dahiru, said WASA was an enduring tradition of the Nigerian army, during which officers, soldiers and their families come together to socialise in a relaxed mood.\n\nDahiru said the event also served as a vehicle to enhance esprit de corps and the spirit of brotherliness within a command and avenue to appreciate personnel for their individual and collective contributions towards the success of the command.\n\nHe said the command diligently provided operational, administrative and logistic support to the army headquarters departments, formations and units, as well as successfully executing all training activities.\n\nHe appreciated the chief of army staff for exemplary leadership, passionate and selfless commitment to the welfare of personnel, assuring them that the garrison would do its best to sustain the tempo of achievements in 2022.\n\n\u201cI wish to state that the personnel of the command are poised to carry out the activities with renewed vigor and commitment in terms of professionalism, responsiveness and commitment in the discharge of the constitutional duties,\u201d he said.\n\nThe event featured cultural display by different ethnic groups and a tug of war, which featured the female members of the National Youths Service Corps (NYSC) serving in the garrison.\n\nDeji Elumoye and Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja",

          "text": "Five days after a Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) facility belonging to Shebah Exploration and Production Company Limited (SEPCOL) exploded in Warri, the company on Sunday announced that three crew members aboard the ship had been found alive.\n\nA statement by the company signed by its Chief Executive Officer, Ikemefuna Okafor, indicated that one unidentified body was also noticed floating around the vessel, Trinity Spirit, located at Ukpokiti field (OML 108).\n\nThe statement said, \u201cWe can confirm that three crew members have been found alive in the community and our priority is to ensure that they receive the appropriate medical attention they need.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, in the early hours of Sunday, 6th February 2022, one dead body was discovered in the vicinity of the FPSO. The identity of the dead body is yet to be ascertained.\u201d\n\nAn earlier update provided on Saturday by the company had confirmed that the fire had been extinguished, while the search for whereabouts of the crew on board was ongoing.\n\nThe incident on the FPSO, with a capacity to process up to 22,000 barrels of oil per day, inject up to 40,000 barrels of water per day and store two million barrels of oil, took place around Excravos, Warri South-west, Delta State.\n\nTrinity Spirit is the primary production facility for OML 108, which covers 750 square km (290 square miles) of water off the Niger Delta, ranging from a depth of 30 metres to 213 metres, according to SEPCOL\u2019s website.\n\nTHISDAY checks showed that the huge facility was built in 1976 (46 years ago), with a carrying capacity of 274774 Dead Weight Tonnage (DWT). SEPCOL, now in receivership, in 2004 acquired all 40 per cent of ConocoPhillips equity interest in OML 108 owned by a combination of Nigerian and overseas corporate entities, which include Abbeycourt Trading Company Limited (ATCO), Abbeycourt Petroleum Company Limited, and Allenne Limited.\n\nThe FPSO serves as the primary production facility for OML 108 and it is also a government approved terminal for lifting operations for all the facility\u2019s production.\n\nAt the time the massive fire erupted on-board the vessel, it was learnt that about 10 persons were within the facility, but with three crew members found, at least seven of the persons on board were yet to be accounted for on Sunday. In the statement, SEPCOL reiterated that the fire burnt out completely as of last Thursday, thus enabling closer inspection of the vessel.\n\nA Joint Investigation Visit (JIV) with the relevant authorities, stakeholders, and expert organisations, it said, took place on Saturday, 5th February 2022.\n\n\u201cThe focus of our joint efforts is to prioritise investigations towards establishing the whereabouts, safety, and security of the seven crew members still missing, clean up and limit damage to the environment, and establish the cause of the explosion,\u201d the statement added.\n\nThe company appreciated the assistance provided by the Clean Nigeria Associates, the Chevron team, other stakeholders and people in the community, particularly the fishermen, who it said had been of immense help since the incident occurred.\n\nFurthermore, the management of SEPCOL urged members of the public to continue to keep away from the area while its crisis management team monitored developments in the investigations and updated stakeholders with new information accordingly.\n\nAlthough the details were yet to be made public, The Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) in collaboration with other relevant stakeholders had also embarked on a Joint Investigation Visit (JIV) to the facility.\n\nNUPRC said, \u201cThe commission will further deploy its incident management strategy while also ensuring that the removal of the FPSO is carried out professionally to prevent an escalation of the incident.\n\n\u201cThe commission will continue to ensure that all safety and environmental measures are strictly adhered to in the management of the incident.\u201d\n\nFPSO serves as the primary production facility of for OML 108 and it is also a government approved terminal for lifting operations for all the asset\u2019s production.\n\nMeanwhile, Reuters quoted the Minister of State, Environment, Sharon Ikeazor, as saying at the weekend that the oil storage vessel was holding around 50,000 to 60,000 barrels of crude oil at the time of the incident. Ikeazor said the National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA) had called the oil industry operators and the Clean Nigeria Associates, a cooperative responding to oil spill incidents, for support.\n\nIt also quoted Chairman of the host fishing community, Ikusemuya Igbekele, as disclosing that two bodies were seen lying dead in front of the vessel, while three crew members jumped into the sea with life jackets and had been taken to the hospital.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja and Peter Uzoho in Lagos",
