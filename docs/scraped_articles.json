Never shall we allow a governor who once robbed us of our hard-earned victory in 2014, force us into another political Siberia.\n\n\u201cThis is why a quick step is required to arrest the ongoing attempt to sweep the rights of the majority of our party members in Ekiti State under carpet.\n\n\u201cWe are sure the nocturnal action will eventually blow open and curtailed as the people will keep demanding for their rights to equity and fair play, until justice is entrenched through people\u2019s-oriented leadership from our wards, up to the state level,\u201d Ojo said.\n\nHowever, APC Ekiti Caretaker Publicity Secretary, Ade Ajayi, denied the the allegations, saying the party was committed to conduct free, fair, credible and most acceptable congresses in the state.\n\nAjayi added the ex- lawmaker lacks the locus standi to make such damaging allegations, having been suspended from the party for alleged anti party activities.\n\n\u201cWe are assuring our people that the congresses will be free and fair. That is the focus of the committee. Nobody will be marginalised. All the tendencies in the party will be accommodated.\n\n\u201cAPC is a party that is governed by constitution.

          "text": "By Mike Odiegwu, Port Harcourt\n\nElder statesman and National Leader of the Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF), Chief Edwin Clark, has described the South-East as the most disadvantaged geopolitical zone in the country.\n\nClark further observed that inequality in the country was fueling the ongoing agitations and dissatisfactions in various zones.\n\nClark spoke while addressing stakeholders at the South-South Zonal Conference with the theme, \u2018Restructuring: Imperatives for Sustainable development, unity and security\u2019 in Port Harcourt, Rivers State on Friday.\n\nThe conference was organized by the Agape Birthrights, founded by the Ankio Brigs, in partnership with Savanna Centre.\n\nClark said: \u201cSouth-East geopolitical zone has five States, while other zones, the South-South, the South-West, the North-Central, the North-East, have six States each. In fact, the North West has seven States, what injustice against a people.\n\n\u201cLook at the northernisation policy going on in the country. Appointments are skewed in favour of the north, in total disregard to the feelings of other areas. Key positions in the Ministries, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Customs, Police, you name it, are all given to northerners.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThere are 17 security arms, 14 of them are headed by northerners. Yet one expects that there shall be national unity. Of course, it will not be possible. There must be dissatisfaction and agitation.\n\n\u201cFor instance, look at what is happening in the South-East today. Our critical national assets are being attacked almost every day. People are killed, maimed. While one is gravely against such a method of expressing grievance, the people are pushed to the wall.\n\n\u201cThe South-East geopolitical zone could rightly be described as the most disadvantaged. One could not understand why the Independent People of Biafra (IPOB) will be declared as a terrorist organization, while similar organizations in the North have not been so declared.\u201d\n\nClark\u2019s in his address read by Chief Obiuwevbi Ominimini and National Chairman, Oil Producing Areas Association of Nigeria, said the absence of unity caused distrust, saying no nation could survive with such situation.\n\nHe said: \u201cUnity in this country today is unfortunately a scarce commodity despite the fact that unity is one of the four cardinal points contained in our country\u2019s Motto, which is Unity and Faith, Peace and Progress.\n\n\u201cOur nation has never been so disunited, as we are today. There is so much distrust. We suspect one another\u2019s next move. No nation can survive with such a level of distrust. And the major cause of disunity in the country today, is inequality.\n\n\u201cYou do not expect me to live in unity with someone who is oppressing me, and treating me as though I am a second-class citizen in my own country. This is unacceptable,\u201d the Ijaw leader stated.\u201d\n\nHe further said the country was disintegrating following \u201cdeliberate attempts to enslave\u201d people from other zones of the country by those who think the country belongs to them alone.\n\nHe decried the rising spate of insecurity in the North, especially the recent trend of kidnapping of school children.\n\nHe maintained that the solution to various agitations in the country was restructuring, insisting it would guarantee peace and even development.\n\n\u201cThere is so much agitation in the country. Fortunately, there is a solution to these issues. An action that can be taken and the nation will to a large extent be at peace; and that is restructure Nigeria now,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan and Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri\n\nChief of Defence Staff (CDS), General Lucky Irabor, yesterday, debunked allegation by Islamic cleric, Sheik Ahmad Gumi, that soldiers were colluding with bandits, saying those harbouring such thoughts were hallucinating and needed their heads examined.\n\nHe also said the Federal Government is engaging retired senior military officers across the six geo-political zones to tackle security challenges like banditry, terrorism, armed robbery, pipeline vandalism, arms proliferation, herders-farmers clashes, violence by secessionist groups and other violent crimes.\n\nIrabor made this known at an interaction with retired senior military officers in the South West at the Headquarters of 2 Division of the Nigerian Army, Odogbo, Ibadan.\n\nOn Gumi\u2019s allegations, he said: \u201cAnyone who is hallucinating with the idea that the military or other security agencies are conniving, I think needs to have himself checked. Do you connive with someone to take your life? That of course is a question that should dismiss that kind of allusion any day. All you need to know is that yes, on daily basis, because of the technological tools available to everyone of us, it is not impossible that criminally-minded individuals may take advantage of these tools. That is the reason on daily basis, we are reassessing our operational engagements, to ensure that our engagements are intelligence-driven, and equally know that these bad elements, who live among us need be exposed.\u201d\n\nGumi on Wednesday alleged that bandits engaged in kidnappings and killing of victims in the North worked in collaboration with some security officers to facilitate the movement of arms across the border into the country for their use.\n\nBut the Army through its spokesman, Brig-Gen Onyema Nwachukwu, denied the allegation saying it was a calculated attempt to denigrate the military and embolden criminals.\n\nIrabor, however, said the country was under serious threat which necessitated the engagement of retired officers to assist in resolving security challenges, especially in regions where they live.\n\n\u201cCurrently, there are various security issues, and we have identified our retired colleagues, who have sold out to the unity, peace and progress of our nation. This speaks to their sense of patriotism and zeal. We believe that in their retirement, they would be better instruments of sensitisation of those who live around them on issues bordering on peace and security.\u201d\n\nIrabor said the visit to Ibadan was to interact with the retired officers to find out their observations and recommendations on how to improve security in the country.\n\n\u201cAfter the South West geo-political zone, we will go to other geo-political zones. I think that we can only leverage the wealth of experience that they have to be able to do this. That is why we are here. I believe it will be better for all of us at the end of the day.\u201d\n\nChief of Defence, Civil Military Cooperation, Rear Admiral Frederick Agu, admitted that insecurity in the country has risen to a level where the armed forces require variety of inputs from different stakeholders to combat it\n\nGeneral Officer Commanding (GOC), 2 Division, Nigerian Army, Major General Gold Chibuisi, commended the CDS for his wisdom in creating a platform to tap from wealth of experiences of retired senior officers with a view to finding a lasting solution to current security challenges confronting the country.\n\n\u201cI want to remind the retired senior officers that they have crucial roles in a time like this when the armed forces in Nigeria is fully engaged in combating emerging security challenges nationwide. These challenges range from armed robbery, banditry activities, violence by the Boko Haram and ISWAP terrorists, pipeline vandalism, arms proliferation, kidnapping, and herders-farmers clashes, and continuous attacks on security personnel by violent secessionist groups. These problems have put the Police on the spotlight, and necessitated the deployment of the armed forces in almost all the states of the federation.\n\n\u201cThe precision with which hoodlums carry out their attacks call for concern by all loyal and patriotic Nigerians. Innocent souls have continued to be lost amid these crises, as well as valuable property, institutions, and infrastructure. No doubt, this growing insecurity has contributed to economic stress and joblessness. Thus, this forum provides a veritable platform.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), yesterday, reinstated its position that it was not after northerners but terrorists killing and maiming people in the South East.\n\nMedia and Publicity Secretary of IPOB, Emma Powerful, stated this in a statement where it debunked allegation by Sheikh Gumi that herdsmen were better off than Eastern Security Network (ESN) and IPOB.\n\nHe also accused Gumi of using his comments to blackmail IPOB in order to continue the military presence in the South East.\n\nThe cleric was quoted to have while comparing the two groups indicted IPOB for arson and killing while herdsmen were only kidnapping for ransom. But Powerful said there was no truth in the claim by Gumi.\n\n\u201cIn case the self-acclaimed Islamic cleric has forgotten, may we remind him that neither IPOB nor ESN is a terrorist organisation or killers like his bandit clients and allies. Spilling of blood is never part of our mandate. ESN is a child of necessity created for the defence of our ancestral land against terrorists and killer herdsmen wrecking havok across our communities. ESN is only defending our hapless mothers and sisters who have been raped, maimed and attacked without any justification by Fulani herdsmen.\n\n\u201cSince December 2020 when ESN was set up by our leader, these vampires have been on the run because of the heat from our gallant operatives across Biafran forests. For Sheikh Gumi who never gave a hoot while killer herdsmen rampaged our communities to try to twist the fact now is not only a mischief, but an act of terror itself.\u201d\n\nPowerful insisted \u201cno northerner in any part of Biafra land can prove that he/she has at any time been attacked by IPOB or ESN. We are only chasing terrorists and bandits behind the killings and kidnapping for ransom in our land. Gumi should be ashamed that an Islamic cleric as he claims has suddenly become a mouthpiece for bandits and terrorists. Why Gumi has special interest in bandits and terrorists is an indication that he is a terrorist who has never shown any empathy to victims of other Nigerians.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022UN: 350,000 killed in North-east insurgency\n\nDeji Elumoye and Michael Olugbode in Abuja\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo has expressed optimism that Nigeria will soon prevail over the current security challenges facing it.\n\nHe anchored his optimism on various efforts by the federal government to tackle insecurity, including the recent supplementary budget sent to the National Assembly for approval for the procurement of military hardware for the use of the military and other security agencies.\n\nOsinbajo, while hosting the Oluyin of Iyin Ekiti, Oba Adeola Ajakaiye, yesterday in Abuja rallied Nigerians to support the security agencies to ensure that Nigeria is safe.\n\nHe said: \u201cI can assure you that soon, the issue of insecurity will be a thing of the past, and that we will all live in peace and prosperity in this country.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the supplementary budget seeking approval for funds to enhance the capacity of the military and other security agencies is part of the concerted efforts of the federal government to beef up its response to the nation\u2019s security challenges.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe president has recently constituted a committee that will look at the whole security infrastructure with a view to looking at the needs of the military, as well as the police and security agencies.\n\n\u201cThe result of that is a bill before the National Assembly, a supplementary bill. The purpose of that bill is to present some of the needs of the military, as well as of security agencies in order to be able to beef up our response to the security challenges.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo also stressed the need for traditional rulers, local and state governments to collaborate with the federal government to tackle insecurity.\n\n\u201cAny country with this number of security challenges must respond as robustly as possible. But it is also important to bear in mind that it takes a combined effort of all of us, at the local government level, state and federal levels; all of the levels; we need to come together to tackle this issue of insecurity,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to him, even as the federal government is concerned about the security challenges, and will continue to ramp up efforts towards improving security nationwide, community efforts are also vital in tackling the issue from the roots.\n\nHe stated that at the level of community there is a need to take decisive action, as most of the security issues occur at the community level.\n\nOsinbajo expressed happiness that his guest has set up a committee in his domain to tackle insecurity \u201cand that you\u2019ve been able to contain the menace that we see in different parts of the country in your community.\u201d\n\nHe added that the federal government will support the community in tackling its challenges, and is also working with the Ekiti State Government on dealing with insecurity, as well as various issues.\n\nIn his remarks, Ajakaiye thanked Osinbajo for granting his delegation audience and listening to their demands, including support for the establishment of a Federal University of Medical and Health Sciences in the community.\n\nHe said: \u201cAgain, as a community, we have come to appreciate you (Vice President) for your diligence, hard work, commitment and loyalty; and that, we from the South-west are very proud of you. We want to assure you that we are very much in support of you. From our own end, we are doing a lot to ensure that the menace of insecurity will not remain in our domain.\u201d\n\nUN: 350,000 Killed in North-east Insurgency\n\nMeanwhile, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) yesterday put the death toll from the ongoing conflict with terrorists in the North-east at about 350,000 people as of the end of 2020.\n\nIt, however, projected that should the insurgency continue till 2030, the fatalities could rise to over 1.1 million.\n\nAccording to a UNDP\u2019s report on the impact of the insurgency in the North-east region presented yesterday at a virtual meeting by the Country Director, Mr. Mohammed Yahaya, at least 35,000 people have so far been killed directly by the insurgents, with 350,000 said to have died indirectly as a result of the crisis.\n\nOn the socioeconomic impact of the crisis on states in the region, the report said $27.8 billion had been lost in GDP, plunging at least 1.4 million people into poverty.\n\nThe report showed that at least 1.8 million children in the North-east are not enrolled in schools as a result of the conflict.\n\nThe UNDP said: \u201cThe full human cost of the war is much greater.\n\n\u201cAlready, many more have died from the indirect effects of the conflict.\u201d\n\nIt cited damage to agriculture, water, trade, food and healthcare.\n\nChildren younger than five accounts for more than nine out of 10 of those killed, with 170 dying every day, the UNDP added.\n\nIf the conflict continues to 2030, more than 1.1 million people may die, the agency stated.\n\n\u201cDestruction and displacement have set back development in the region by decades, and continued conflict will only further scar the region,\u201d the UNDP said.\n\nThe report said since 2009, the devastating conflict in the North-eastern Nigeria has directly resulted in the deaths of approximately 35,000 people as a consequence of insurgency.\n\nThe report warned that indirect deaths, including disease and hunger resulting from the conflict\u2019s physical and economic destruction, already far outnumber those from direct causes.\n\nThe report: \u2018Assessing the Impact of Conflict on Development in North-east Nigeria\u2019 added that critical aspects of progress and development, including GDP, poverty, malnutrition, infant mortality, education, water availability and sanitation, may not return to pre-conflict levels even by 2030.\n\nUNDP stated that more than 90 per cent of conflict-attributable deaths are of children under the age of five.\n\nThe report said physical and economic destruction wrought by the insurgency had dismantled already fragile health and food systems.\n\nAccording to it, less than 60 per cent of health facilities in Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe States are fully functional, while a quarter are either completely destroyed or non-functional.\n\nThe report also lamented that attacks from insurgency have also led to massive internal displacement, with more than 1.8 million Nigerians displaced in Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe States, while the vast majority (nearly 1.5 million) are located in Borno.\n\nThe study also showed that in addition, 1.8 million students were out of school in 2020, and without increased investment in development efforts, the average Nigerian in the North-east would have lost a full year of education by 2030.\n\nThe statement, however, acknowledged that Nigeria has made great strides in retaking and stabilising large areas of the region, stressing that continued investment in development from both national and international stakeholders is needed.\n\n\u201cWithout continued investment in development as a long-term solution, the protracted conflict in north-east Nigeria will continue to impact other parts of the country and the entire Sahel region.\n\n\u201cThere is a need for international partners and national stakeholders to ensure that funds are invested not only on life-saving and humanitarian needs but also on mid-and long-term development priorities in order to enable Nigeria to achieve the SDGs and attain the AU 2063,\u201d the report quoted UNDP Resident Representative, Yahaya, as saying.\n\nThe report noted that to overcome the conflict, development efforts need to be focused on the stabilisation of affected areas through a community-level approach that enhances physical security and access to justice, rehabilitation of essential infrastructure and basic service delivery as well as the revitalisation of the local economy such as market stalls, schools and police stations.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Opposition to PIB grows with Shell\u2019s rejection of proposals on gas sector\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has said the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic increased global debt by $24 trillion, taking it to $281 trillion during the crisis.\n\nSpeaking at the 135th meeting of the Economic Commission Board (ECB) of OPEC, the cartel\u2019s Secretary-General, Dr. Sanusi Barkindo, urged member countries to be wary of the inflationary effect of their borrowings as the $24 trillion is more than the United States annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n\nBarkindo spoke just as the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) may, again, run into troubled waters this month as Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo) yesterday opposed the passage of the proposed legislation in its present state, seeking a review of its provisions on the gas sector.\n\nBarkindo also reiterated his earlier position that oil demand will hit pre-pandemic levels by the fourth quarter of 2021 to exceed 99 million barrels per day.\n\nThe meeting of the ECB, the organisation\u2019s statutory economic think-tank, which meets in advance of the ordinary meetings of the OPEC conference, focused on reviewing the conditions of the global oil market, emerging trends related to the oil industry, including demand, supply and stock movements, as well as the recovery prospects for the world economy.\n\nBarkindo highlighted the contributions of the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) of participating countries, which continue to support the global oil market through voluntary production adjustments in the interest of market stability.\n\nOn OPEC forecast for demand recovery, Barkindo stated that the market optimism was a reaction to the more than 2.4 billion vaccine doses that have now been administered globally.\n\nAlso, there are signs that the international community is ramping up its support to developing countries to help bolster their acquisition of life-saving vaccines.\n\nHe said these efforts were drawing the world closer to bringing the pandemic under control, and thereby helping accelerate the global economic recovery, as the latest market developments point to much better conditions and improved prospects.\n\nOn market fundamentals, Barkindo stated that in terms of the global economy, the GDP growth forecast has risen from 4.4 per cent in November 2020 to 5.5 per cent in June 2021.\n\nHe added that an upward momentum into the second half of the year is being expected.\n\nHe restated his earlier forecast that China and the US will see the lion\u2019s share of growth in 2021, with China\u2019s economy expanding by 8.5 per cent and the US by 6.4 per cent.\n\nAccording to him, India, despite having to confront a devastating second-wave of COVID-19 infections is still forecast to achieve a growth of 9.5 per cent.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe forecast for world oil demand has decreased from 6.2 mb/d in November 2020 to 6 mb/d in June 2021. The outlook for later this year looks especially promising with demand slated to exceed 99 mb/d in the fourth quarter. This prospect would bring us back close to pre-pandemic levels.\u201d\n\nHe stated that there are now encouraging signs that the worst of the pandemic is over, but warned that it is too early to jump to conclusions, especially with uncertainties surrounding mutations.\n\nBarkindo said meanwhile, debt levels in major economies continued to rise, fuelled by massive fiscal and monetary stimulus programmes, with government debt levels, after the COVID-19 lockdowns, reaching their highest to date in both advanced economies and emerging market economies.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe absolute amount of global debt has increased by more than $24 trillion over the course of the pandemic \u2013 this is more than the annual GDP of the US. World debt now stands at $281 trillion, comparing to the annual world GDP of around $80 trillion. With this in mind, the risk of rising inflation in the months to come will need to be closely monitored.\n\n\u201cLooking at the world oil supply, non-OPEC supply growth was revised down from 0.9 mb/d in November 2020 to 0.8 mb/d in June 2021. The main drivers for 2021 supply growth are anticipated to be Canada, Brazil, China and Norway, while US liquids supply is now expected to only grow by a marginal 0.03 mb/d y-o-y.\u201d\n\nHe expressed optimism that the return of Iranian production and exports will happen in a transparent and orderly fashion, supporting the deal by OPEC+ countries on ongoing efforts to rebalance the oil market and promote market stability.\n\nBarkindo also lauded the conformity to the production adjustments by member countries, which he puts at 114 per cent in April.\n\nOpposition to PIB Grows as Shell Kicks over Bill\u2019s Position on Gas Sector\n\nMeanwhile, Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) may, again, run into troubled waters this month as Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo) yesterday opposed the passage of the proposed legislation in its present state.\n\nThe company stated that the bill, if passed as it is, could throw the gas sector into more crisis and further stunt the growth of the sector, which the country is banking on for much of its revenue as the world moves towards cleaner sources of fuels.\n\nDuring the week, reports indicated that the bill, which has spent over 15 years in the National Assembly, may not be passed this month as promised by President of the Senate, Dr Ahmed Lawan, as key stakeholders pushed for final alterations to some specific parts of the document before it becomes law.\n\nSpeaking during an online forum organised by the British Nigeria Chamber of Commerce (NBCC), Managing Director of SNEPCo, Mr. Bayo Ojulari, called for a conference of all stakeholders, to be called by the Minister of State, Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, to resolve the differences.\n\nThemed: \u201cGas Economy: Maximising the Potential,\u201d the programme was overseen by the NBCC oil and gas group and attended, among others, by the Managing Director of the chamber, Mr Kayode Falowo, and Managing Director, Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) Limited, Mr Tony Attah.\n\nOther speakers at the event were the President of the Nigeria Gas Association (NGA) and Managing Director, Shell Nigeria Gas (SNG), Mr. Ed Ubong, and Gas Portfolio Manager, Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), Mr. Yemi Famori.\n\nOjulari stated that the PIB as it is today is not enabling enough and not fully aligned with the direction that Nigeria has articulated around the \u201cDecade of Gas\u201d as propagated by the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nHe called for a further review of the PIB to ensure that it delivers and contributes to the ambition that Nigeria has set for itself to be in the class of Qatar and Australia whose economies are largely run on revenues from gas.\n\nAccording to him, with the condition set for exportation of gas resources by companies operating in the sector, the proposed petroleum governance bill will stifle competition.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe terms and prices of gas development, especially for deep non-associated gas, need to be more competitive. Today, it is actually looking worse than it is in the current environment and that\u2019s an area that has not enjoyed a level of emphasis.\n\n\u201cToday, the PIB does not do any justice or to help to unlock the huge potential that we have in the non-associated gas environments. With the potential of gas to power our economy, the focus should be more on competitive discuss that will stimulate gas.\n\n\u201cCurrently, the version of the PIB that we have is not sufficient and will not enable us to incentivise investors to unlock the huge non-associated gas that we have.\u201d\n\nIn the domestic gas space, Ojulari said the PIB required the fulfilment of domestic gas obligation as a condition to export gas, which potentially puts long-term export gas supply at risk.\n\nHe added that the country needs to move away from the \u201cunproductive\u201d debate about satisfying local need before shipping gas abroad.\n\nHe called for a delicate balancing between the political drive and the business needs of the PIB, saying that many of those who discuss the matter are approaching it from the point of emotions, rather than reality.\n\nHe added: \u201c A lot of people who talk about the gas business in the gas value chain come from the emotional side. But emotion does not create a business, emotions do not attract investors, emotions do not sign contracts.\n\n\u201cSo, I will say that while we recognise those emotional elements, we need to create a platform where the companies and the entities that have these resources will come together in a conference facilitated by the minister of state and let us have that conversation.\u201d\n\nHe stated that everybody is currently doing the economics of the gas sector from their own point of view, and there\u2019s no consensus on the way forward for the gas sector in the PIB.\n\nHe wondered why the NLNG model was not adopted since it has been tested to be workable, explaining that there is sufficient gas resource that will meet both domestic and gas export.\n\nIn his remarks, Attah stated that energy has always been in transition, adding that there should be no surprise about the current talks about renewables.\n\nWith 7.8 billion persons on earth and an additional 2.8 billion by 2050, he said the world would always require energy to function, while gas will continue to be relevant.\n\nAccording to him, the energy of the future must look at the sustainability of the environment and which does not emit massive carbon like coal, oil and others.\n\nHe stated that gas is cheaper and could be either a transition or destination fuel, adding that a future without gas is almost inconceivable.\n\nBill to Be Laid Tuesday\n\nMeanwhile, President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, has assured the nation that the PIB would be laid on Tuesday by its joint committees on the bill.\n\nHe said: \u201cAt the moment, we are dotting the i\u2019s and crossing the t\u2019s on the PIB; the Petrol Industry Bill, and by the grace of God, our committees, the joint committees, will finish their work on it by the end of the week, hopefully. The reports would be laid on Tuesday in both chambers. This is what we have planned and this is what we\u2019re working towards.\u201d\n\nHe also said much work had been done on the Electoral Act Amendment Bill and it would be passed before the National Assembly proceeds on its annual vacation next month.\n\n\u201cWe also have some work to do on the Electoral Act (amendment) Bill. Our committee in the Senate and indeed, in the House have worked jointly and we have very little to do really, to get the reports and considered in the two chambers.\n\n\u201cWe expect that we\u2019ll do that before we go on our annual summer recess, which comes up on the 15th of July, by the grace of God. \u201cSo, before we go on summer recess, we should be able to pass the Electoral Act (amendment) Bill,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to him, the National Assembly will also work on the confirmation of nominees for the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) commissionership as well as passing the 2021 Supplementary Appropriation Bill sent to it last week by the president.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nThe Delta State Government yesterday called for the speedy reconstitution of the board of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) to avert the 2016 experience when the resurgence of militancy plunged Nigeria into recession.\n\nThe Deputy Governor, Dr. Kingsley Otuaro, while featuring yesterday on \u2018The Morning Show,\u2019 a programme on ARISE NEWS Channel, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers, described the non-constitution of the board as a flagrant abuse of the commission\u2019s Act.\n\nHe said the situation was doing more harm than good to the oil-rich region.\n\nHe described as untenable, the assurance of the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, that the board would be constituted after an ongoing forensic audit.\n\nOtuaro also allayed fears of a political storm in the state over the zoning arrangement for the governorship position, saying the issue would be resolved at the right time.\n\nHe said the non-constitution of the board of the NDDC could trigger militancy in the region following the recent ultimatum issued by the Ijaw Youth Council and oil communities\u2019 rights activist, Chief Government Ekpemupolo, known as Tompolo.\n\nHe stated that following Tompolo\u2019s ultimatum, Akpabio had engaged in wide consultations in the region.\n\nOtuaro said he was part of the consultative meetings and was also very much aware of the fact that consensus reached in the inner meetings was that the board would be constituted at the close of this month.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe expectation of all those who are involved in that critical engagement is that the board will be constituted at the close of this month.\n\n\u201cIf there is anything to the contrary, Senator Akpabio knows exactly what to do. He has to reach out because any gap in the circumstance will be misconstrued for something else.\n\n\u201cAnd for us in Delta State Government, we don\u2019t want a repeat of what happened in 2016 that boxed us up into a recessionary period, where there was a resurgence of militancy in the region. And then we observed the breaches of critical oil and gas facilities where the Trans-Forcados 48-inch line was breached and production output was cut.\u201d\n\nHe said the position of the state government was in tandem with the position held by critical stakeholders in the region.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have a strong opinion that the long delay and the non-constitution or the substantive board of the NDDC is a flagrant abuse of the Act, establishing the NDDC.\n\n\u201cThat is the position of the Delta State Government and like you have said, the NDDC cannot be like a sole proprietorship business, because it is not meant to be so.\u201d\n\nHe recalled that South-south governors met and in their resolution, they affirmed that the board should be constituted immediately.\n\nThe governors, he said, also recommended that financial receipts in favour of the NDDC should be lodged in an escrow account, adding that this was borne out of the fact that the sole proprietorship leadership \u2013 the interim leadership of the NDDC is unknown to the NDDC Act.\n\nHe stated that the recent visit by Akpabio to the region for consultation had calmed frayed nerves as the government may not have contained the likely unwholesome situation that would have arisen.\n\n\u201cThe recent spate of ultimatums given by the Ijaw Youth Council and some other critical stakeholders, including that of Government Ekpemupolo, is also in tandem with the position of the Senator Ifeanyi Okowa-led government and that of the South-south governors and that of PANDEF led by Chief EK Clark,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the state government was thankful to God that Akpabio, \u201cesteemed and distinguished for his transformation agenda while he was governor Akwa Ibom State had cause to come to the Niger Delta region to consult with the critical stakeholders and I\u2019m thankful to God that he came.\u201d\n\nOtuaro added that if the minister had sat in his office, there would have been some unwholesome scenes in relation to the ultimatum that they had given.\n\n\u201cSo I want to say that it is the expectation of the critical stakeholders that the board should be constituted,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, the position that the board would be constituted when the government is done with the forensic audit, is untenable against the backdrop of the fact that the board can be constituted and the forensic audit can be going on.\n\nOn the rising tension over zoning of the governorship position and the recent dissolution of the cabinet by Okowa, the deputy governor said the situation would be resolved at the right time.\n\nHe added that he reserved the right to run for the governorship election but was non-committal over whether or not he would run in view of the zoning arrangement in place.\n\nHe stated that it was within the powers of his boss to effect a change of cabinet.\n\n\u201cFirst, it is within the powers of the Governor, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa, to dissolve his cabinet and reappoint those he feels very strongly that can help us deliver on a stronger Delta Agenda, because that truly is our agenda, one that truly is stronger and more secured Delta State for tomorrow.\n\n\u201cSo, that is in the exercise of his power and there\u2019s no problem about that and we are happy with it and I think the people are also happy with it.\n\n\u201cAs to the questions you have thrown up with regards to contesting or indicating interest, zoning and all of that, I don\u2019t want to get myself into all of that. I am a Deltan; I am a Nigerian, like any other person. So, we all have the rights to aspire to elective positions. I have the right to aspire within the context of the law. I can aspire. But it is not my place to tell you if I want to,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, the zoning of the governorship seat to South, North or Central Senatorial Districts, are all politics.\n\nOtuaro stated that the leadership of the state, especially the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) will look into what is fair and just for the people of the state.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Deji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, has said the National Assembly will always follow due diligence in approving loan requests from the executive arm of government.\n\nLawan told journalists yesterday in Abuja after a closed-door meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari that the National Assembly will not approve frivolous loan requests from the executive as it will always ask for details before any loan is approved.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhat I want to assure Nigerians is that we are not going to be frivolously supporting or approving loans for the executive arm of government. Whenever we have to approve any loan, we have to insist on the details of what projects will be funded by those loans. We\u2019ll have to look at the conditions that are attached to the loans; they must be favourable conditions before we approve and we will be up to date with our oversight to ensure that what we have approved is directly deployed and on those projects that we have also approved for implementation.

First, we don\u2019t have the necessary revenues, Nigeria is poor, we shouldn\u2019t deceive ourselves. Nigeria is not rich, given the circumstances we live in, given the challenges we have; our resources are so low, our revenues are so low and therefore the option of not doing anything, just to sit because we have no money, we shouldn\u2019t go for infrastructure development is not even an option worthy of consideration. You cannot keep the economy stagnant.\n\n\u201cTwo, you cannot, in my view and judgment, tax Nigerians further for you to raise the money for infrastructure development. Other countries do that, but we have serious situation across the country, so you cannot put taxes on people.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Nigerian businesses face an avalanche of losses as the Twitter ban continues",
          "text": "On Saturday the 5th of June, Wunmi*, a digital marketer lost a gig worth \u20a6600,000 ($1,200). The marketing campaign was to start the next day but she got a call from the client telling her they couldn\u2019t proceed anymore due to \u2018orders from above.\u2019 She was dumbfounded.\n\nThat same day, about 39 million Nigerians woke up to realize that they couldn\u2019t access Twitter except via VPNs. Internet Service Providers (ISP) in Nigeria like MTN and Airtel had blocked all access to Twitter.\n\nWhen Peju, owner of Abebi Organics, describes the day the ban was enforced, she recounts how the jokes kept coming until one by one people found that they could not tweet anymore.\n\nIt\u2019s been more than two weeks since and the effects of the ban have been anything but humorous for businesses like hers who built their customer base on Twitter.\n\nThe ban happened a day after the Nigerian government announced an indefinite Twitter suspension. The minister of information had stated that the reason for banning Twitter was because the social media platform has \u201cconsistently made its platform available to those who are threatening Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\u201d\n\nWhile still mourning the loss of the first job, Wunmi lost another one for the same reason.\n\n\u201cEverything felt like a waste. What was worse was another \u20a6700,000 ($1,400) deal ended up in the mud. The client paid \u20a6150,000 ($333) at least for the little job I had done,\u201d she said.\n\nThe effect on businesses\n\nFor many Nigerians, this ban has affected how they stay informed, build relationships and get opportunities. Businesses on the other hand have experienced a decline in engagements and sales.\n\nIn the case of Nifries, an online food delivery service that relies on Twitter to reach its audience, its customers aren\u2019t responding as they used to.\n\nFeranmi Ajetomobi, the founder of Nifries, explained that the Twitter ban has affected anon (short for anonymous) sales which drive about 20% of sales at Nifries. Anon sales happen when people surprise strangers or friends by buying goods for them without revealing their identity.\n\nHi @TereSagay_, Anon just opened a tab of N15,000 for you to pick whatever you want from our Menu! \ud83d\ude0d\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nKindly visit https://t.co/rmQIkQXPkD and send a DM of what you want \ud83d\udc9b \u2014 Sexy Suya Burgers \ud83c\udf54 (@ni_fries) June 15, 2021\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve realised that when we reach out to a few people and there\u2019s no response, It\u2019s either because they\u2019ve taken a break or the Twitter ban has affected them. How we know it\u2019s the ban is because when these people we reach out to come online, they attribute their absence to the fact that using VPN is confusing,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Habib who runs Smiley Socks, a clothing company that also thrives on the \u2018anon sales\u2019 phenomenon, sales via Twitter have been affected. He\u2019s also noticed that engagements with tweets have reduced.\n\nThis has made him turn to other channels. He\u2019s had to pay more attention to his Instagram page and work on his SEO for his e-commerce website to maximise conversations.\n\nHe\u2019s also started experimenting with TikTok and so far, the results have been astounding. One day after he opened a new TikTok page, it already had 100 followers. The few videos he\u2019s posted already have at least 500 views, with the highest being one with over 4,000 views.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy when you think about the fact that it\u2019s a new page and we are not following anyone. Despite the engagement, there\u2019s a bigger question of how we\u2019ll convert these numbers into sales. For now, we\u2019ll just do more influencer marketing and affiliate marketing as we figure out what works,\u201d said Habib.\n\nWunmi* who has lost two deals worth over $2,500 is now considering focusing on unexplored channels like IG Reels and TikTok.\n\n\u201cFor clients that do not mind me using VPN, I go ahead and use Twitter. Unfortunately, those clients are very few. No one wants to offend President Buhari at this time for fear of being blacklisted by the government or worse, getting forcefully shut down. Clients think of many negative scenarios of how the government can strike back, they sometimes seem hilarious, but can you blame them?\u201d she said.\n\nComparing Twitter to other platforms\n\nCharles Isidi, a growth marketer and digital consultant, agrees with the need to pivot to other digital marketing channels but has a word of caution. He has experienced the effect of the decline first-hand on his personal account. With followership of about 17,000, his monthly impressions have gone from as high as 3.8 million, to under 500,000.\n\nCharles\u2019 Twitter Analytics for April\n\nCharles\u2019 Twitter Analytics for May\n\nCharles\u2019 Twitter Analytics for June\n\nHe says the ban will affect advertising spend and results across other digital marketing channels because Nigerian Twitter users who are using VPNs will also have their locations skewed across every other app.\n\n\u201cIf your most valuable audience is in another country that you do not know, then how can you reach them?\u201d he said.\n\nHe also raised the question of whether people know how to use VPNs safely.\n\n\u201cQuite a lot of people use free VPNs. In the next six months, we might start experiencing a lot of theft. We\u2019ll have to be looking at how much we\u2019ve lost due to cybercrimes.\u201d\n\nBusinesses might need to move to other social media platforms but Twitter offers more favourable returns in terms of marketing efforts.\n\nCompared to other advertising channels, Twitter is a cheaper and less stressful channel.\n\nHe\u2019s been trying to run a billboard campaign for the past 3 months and has been stuck waiting for Lagos\u2019 paid advertising approval. For digital adverts, in less than an hour, the advert is approved and has started delivering value for the business.\n\n\u201cUnlike other social media platforms, take Facebook as an example. A typical page with 10,000 followers reaches 3% of your audience with a post. Meanwhile, on Twitter, an organic post can be retweeted. In terms of shareability and virality, there\u2019s a reason why people love Twitter. I can say something and even if I have just 100 followers, 3 million people can see that tweet.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s difficult on Instagram where you have to make the explore page or use a hashtag that people love to get a similar kind of result.\n\nHow much is being lost\n\nCiting a scenario, he said, \u201cIf you\u2019re currently managing a brand that has 20,000 followers, it\u2019ll get 1-3 million impressions on average. To be conservative, at a 0.1% conversation rate, the brand will have an average of 1,000 \u2013 3,000 new customers.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we put the average transaction value per customer at $3 dollars per month, that\u2019s an average of $3,000 \u2013 $9,000 dollars lost due to the ban. Let\u2019s put it across all the businesses in that range and you see that the number is massive.\u201d\n\nWith the Twitter ban, Nigerian businesses that have previously relied on the massive reach of the platform now face an avalanche of losses if the decision is not reversed soon.\n\nAnd if we were to be a little hopeful and imagine a world where the ban is lifted, how much irreversible damage has been done to the potential audience reach these businesses used to have? We\u2019ll find out soon enough.\n\n*Name changed to protect their identity.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Google, this week, announced the launch of two new initiatives to support African-founded startups and women-led businesses in underserved communities on the continent.\n\nThe programs include a $3 million Black Founders Fund for African startups and a $3 million Google.org grant to help women in low-income communities develop entrepreneurial skills and access funding.\n\nThrough the latter, Google is looking to support access to economic opportunity for women in sub-Saharan Africa with a $3 million grant to the Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF). The foundation will then provide entrepreneurship training, mentorship, coaching, and access to networks and key markets for at least 5,000 women via its annual entrepreneurship program.\n\nIn addition, seed capital in the form of one-time cash grants will be given to 500 African female informal business-owners in rural and low-income communities across Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, and select francophone countries.\n\n\u201cWe believe this will enable and prepare these women who otherwise wouldn\u2019t have had the opportunity to navigate their independent business journey through the critical start-up and early growth phase,\u201d Google said in a statement on its website.\n\nBlack Founders Fund debuts in Africa\n\nThe Google for Startups Black Founders Fund provides grants and technical assistance to early-stage startups led by black and diverse teams, with a goal of advancing the black community.\n\nLaunched in 2020 as part of a series of racial equity commitments to close a funding gap experienced by black entrepreneurs, the program has seen proven success in the United States, Brazil, and Europe, according to Google.\n\nThe U.S. tech giant has now expanded the initiative to Africa, a continent where indigenous startups are faced with insufficient starting capital and a lack of angel investors, and also find it difficult to secure financial support.\n\nAccording to Bosun Tijani, CEO of Co-Creation Hub (CcHub), which is partnering with Google on the Black Founders Fund Africa, the shortage of funding for African startups is driven by several factors.\n\n\u201cOn the demand side, there is an increase in the number of ventures emerging to solve the pervasive challenges that exist. As the number of ventures increases, the requirement for funding increases,\u201d Tijani told TechCabal.\n\nHe adds that while there has been improved investor confidence as a result of the success stories that have come out of the ecosystem, investors remain sceptical about the potential for huge exit opportunities. \u201cThis highlighted risk often dampens the quantum of funding commitment the ecosystem gets.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the number of African venture capital firms closing their funding rounds is not growing as quickly as the number of emerging ventures; institutions with long-term liabilities (such as insurance companies, pension funds, endowments) that match the VC asset class are not willing to support the development of the ecosystem because it\u2019s still nascent; and there are not enough government incentives required to encourage investments into the tech ecosystem.\n\nIn light of these challenges, Google plans to allocate the $3 million non-dilutive fund across a pipeline of 50 investable startups in Africa, with each firm receiving up to $100,000 in equity-free cash awards. Each selected company will also receive $220,000 in Google Cloud Credits and Ad Grants, as well as mentoring, technical, and scaling assistance.\n\nThe company is working with the CcHub, a leading tech community hub with a presence in Nigeria, Kenya, and Rwanda, to distribute the funding to the 50 selected companies across Africa.\n\nThe CcHUB team will be actively involved in the process providing insight and technical support from the selection process through to the final deployment of the capital, according to Tijani. \u201cWe will monitor and evaluate the performance of the companies that benefit from this catalytic funding,\u201d he said.\n\nWhich startups can apply?\n\nApart from having a black founder, the Black Founders Fund Africa (BFFAfrica) is looking for a startup that is headquartered in Africa or has a legal presence on the continent; building for Africa and a global market; creating jobs, has growth potential to raise more funding, and making an impact; has proven early traction (product in the market / pilots / MVP live / early revenue).\n\nThe founding team should be diverse, with at least one black C-level founding member; directly supporting the black community, and has the relevant expertise on board to be successful (either through their background or an assembled team).\n\nIn addition, Google is looking for technology startups with a live product in the market or businesses where technology is core to their ability to scale (not for consultancies or not-for-profits) as well as compatibility with Google products.\n\nThe inaugural funding for Africa is open to startups in 13 countries \u2013 including Botswana, Cameroon, C\u00f4te D\u2019Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe.\n\n\u201cWe welcome all startups in these countries that meet the criteria to apply. Female-led startups that meet the criteria are also strongly encouraged to apply,\u201d Tijani said.\n\nApplications for the Fund are currently open until July 7th and eligible startups can visit goo.gle/BFFAfrica now to apply.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Jesse Forrester started an e-mobility company in Kenya after deciding against going to university",
          "text": "My Life In Tech is putting human faces to some of the innovative startups, investments, and policy formations driving the technology sector across Africa.\n\nIf you were to look at three different pictures of Jesse Forrester today, you will notice the same unmistakable red cap.\n\n\u201cIt was given to me by a dear friend and for me, it has just come to represent the people that have supported me and I carry them with me wherever I\u2019m going,\u201d Jesse said.\n\n\u201cI also think it\u2019s really cool.\u201d\n\nJesse Forrester and the Mazi Mobility team. Spot his red cap.\n\nHe pointed out how the hat contributes to his very pan-African life.\n\nJesse grew up in Nairobi, Kenya. After high school, he travelled to South Africa where he finished his A-levels at the African Leadership Academy (ALA).\n\nHis journey at ALA exposed him to several things including a wide network of pan-African thinkers.\n\nHis red cap has often gotten him mistaken as Nigerian, something he does not shy away from. But he never fails to remind people that the cap is actually from Tunisia in North Africa.\n\nAfter ALA, Jesse took up a fellowship. It was his first stab at being employed and he quickly found that it was not something that he fancied.\n\nThe idea of going to university didn\u2019t thrill him either. So he did something he\u2019d always wanted to do \u2013 he started his own business.\n\nToday, his company Mazi Mobility is backed by global venture builder, Satgana, and is aiming at implementing an electric vehicle ecosystem in Africa. To this end, they recently launched a new fleet of electric bodas or motorcycles.\n\nWhen he speaks of Africa and the possibilities that exist in the space of e-mobility, his excitement is almost palpable.\n\nHe started his company without a university degree and he is now preparing himself to dominate the African e-mobility space.\n\nHis name is Jesse Forrester and this is his life in tech.\n\nIf you look back, you see it\n\nJesse grew up in Huruma flats in the Eastlands. He lived with both his parents but more time was spent with his mother.\n\nAs a child, he wanted to be a pilot but his interests varied. On some days he wanted to just sit by the television and watch a NatGeo documentary on exotic animals in the thick Amazon and on other days his PlayStation 2 was all the entertainment he needed.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t an exact time when he decided he didn\u2019t want to be a pilot anymore. It was just one of those things that\u2019s there one day but slowly faded away with time \u2013 like a puddle drying in the sun.\n\nHis varying interests expanded to include his small businesses in school \u2013 selling lemonade and sweets. He also enjoyed tinkering with things \u2013 pulling them apart and putting them together.\n\nMazi Mobility, Jesse\u2019s startup, is making it easier for boda riders to own and use electric vehicles that help save the planet by reducing CO emissions.\n\nTo pinpoint when in his life he got the inspiration to want a cleaner Africa, you would need to consider two things; a minister who did his job and a matatu\u2019s smoke cloud.\n\nIn 2004, a man named John Michuki was the Minister of Transportation in Kenya. During that time, the state of buses, or matatus, in the country was terrible. These vehicles had no speed governors, seat belts and would often carry more passengers than they were supposed to.\n\nMichuki established the \u2018Michuki Rules\u2019 which served as a game-changer for the transport sector by providing strict guidelines for matatus at the time. But one thing they inadvertently did was inspire a prepubescent Jesse.\n\n\u201cI actually saw a meaningful change that had a huge impact. And according to my mum, I said I wanted to become something in transport like transport minister.\u201d\n\nFast forward to 2018 and Jesse was back from studying in South Africa and living in Nairobi again.\n\n\u201cI was walking around the city, just going on my errands, this massive matatu cuts me off and just as it\u2019s leaving and I have a mouth full of swear words, the thing just blows a huge amount of smoke in my face.\u201d\n\nSet 14 years apart, these two events paved the way for the creation of Mazi Mobility but also helped inform the decisions of a young man who really cares about his environment.\n\n\u201cJesse, meet Tech\u201d\n\n\u201cMy foray into tech really happened in secondary school, where I learned a lot about what actually makes up a game and how to actually make it,\u201d Jesse told me over our WhatsApp call.\n\nHis introduction to tech came in the form of MIT\u2019s Scratch Blocks. The program allowed people to develop programming skills by using blocks to code visually.\n\nHe didn\u2019t just explore software, his tinkering came in handy when he got a chance to work with Arduino motherboards which allow people to create complex computer systems from scratch.\n\n\u201cI wanted to be a good engineer, that was kind of my path because it would mix hardware and software.\u201d\n\nJesse\u2019s tango with tech did not end in high school. It followed him right into ALA.\n\nIn 2017, when bitcoin was still worth only $2,000, blockchain was primarily known as the technology behind bitcoin and not much else. For Jesse, it became an interesting tool.\n\n\u201cI was part of a blockchain club. I was running for treasurer [in student government], and the decision was to have the elections on the blockchain.\u201d\n\nHe would go on to win the elections and also create a project that would win his school $100,000.\n\nThe journey to Mazi by way of ALA\n\n\u2018Mazi\u2019 was not always \u2018Mazi Mobility\u2019. At one point, in the time before Jesse got into ALA, it was a photography collective \u2013 one of Jesse\u2019s many interests.\n\nBut getting into the Africa Leadership Academy was not the smoothest ride for him.\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing you must know, it is that Jesse Forrester sets high expectations for himself. He first heard of the Academy when he turned 12 and he knew he wanted to attend but the minimum age was 15 so he decided to wait.\n\nAt 15, he was in the middle of his high school education and decided not to apply until he was done. In his final year of high school, he finally applied.\n\n\u201cThey waitlisted me. So I had a chip on my shoulder where I had to prove that I\u2019ve got the leadership potential to get into the school.\u201d\n\nWhat followed was the creation of Mazi \u2013 a photography collective with a focus on creating discourse around the environment, speaking at a TEDx talk, and getting networking certifications.\n\nAnd what did he do with all these things? He sent ALA an update. They needed to know that he was meant to be there.\n\nThis time they listened. He was accepted and resumed in South Africa for his 2-year course.\n\nAt ALA, Jesse was a part of the team behind \u201cThe Living Machine\u201d a water treatment system that won them the $100,000 Zayed Sustainability Prize in 2019.\n\nAfter his encounter with the smoky matatu in 2018, Jesse decided he wanted to start a company that provided electric matatus.\n\n\u201cI wanted to start with putting solar panels on matatus but I quickly realised that was not smart because you need like 60 of them for one matatu.\u201d\n\nWith a few calls, he was able to connect with his co-founder and founding investor Troy Barrie.\n\nWhile they discussed kicking off the business, Jesse had to leave the country briefly to present a report on The Living Machine in Abu Dhabi. During this trip, he also got a chance to interview musician and investor, Akon.\n\nJesse with Akon\n\nWhen he returned and settled down, he quit his job and focused full time on Mazi. They made plans to begin getting investors. This was March 2020.\n\nBuilding Mazi through a pandemic and looking to the future\n\n\u201cSo now we are back to running a hardware business, in Africa, in a pandemic?\u201d Jesse laughed when he said this. It was ridiculous to even think about.\n\nThe potential investors all seemed to say the same things: \u201cSo we\u2019re focusing on our portfolio companies right now. Let\u2019s touch base in about a year.\u201d\n\nAnd who could blame them, 2020 was a weird year.\n\nBut he needed to raise money and to most people, Jesse just seemed crazy. While Jesse dealt with the anxiety and despair that came with 2020, he also had to get enough money to match his founding investor\u2019s investment.\n\nA $15,000 fund from ALA helped turn things around and in February the electric motorcycles landed in Kenya \u2013 sort of.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe thing is, when you import something from China, especially these bikes, you have no manuals whatsoever. So we had no way of knowing what to assemble because there was a huge language barrier, so it was incredibly challenging.\u201d Jesse said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really happy that one of my chief engineers is a really smart guy and a biker.\u201d\n\nFor the next month, the team would spend time figuring out the bikes and how to assemble them. They were working \u201cfrom eight to eight\u201d.\n\nA deadline for a prototype bike was fast approaching and during our call, Jesse reminisced about what it felt like at the time.\n\nThey were just four men in his living room, trying to put an electronic boda together. It was a Saturday when they decided they were going to have to work all night to figure it out. That night, they had ugali and eggs for dinner.\n\nBy 6 am on Sunday, with none of them having slept a wink, they had built their first product, by themselves, in Jesse\u2019s living room.\n\n\u201cAnd right now I\u2019m really proud to say that all the bikes we have are fully assembled here in Kenya, by Kenyans. And we have the capacity to assemble \u2013 with a really small team \u2013 over 200 bikes, a month from parts all the way up. Without investment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always tell investors, \u2018You guys give us X cash, you can imagine what we can do.\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nI asked Jesse Forrester, as I always do with these interviews, to tell me what plans he has for the future.\n\n\u201cThe total estimated addressable market right now stands at about $12 billion in East Africa, for electric motorbikes alone, and I say hey we want to capture a fraction of the market so I want to do over 1000 bodas by the end of next year. I want to get to over 5000 bodas by the end of 2023 with up to 200 tuktuks and 100 matatus.\u201d\n\nFrom your mouth to God\u2019s ears, Jesse.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "SEC approves Chaka as first licensed stock trading app in Nigeria",
          "text": "After months of uncertainty regarding regulations, Chaka has received a license from Nigeria\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to operate its digital platform for buying and selling stocks.\n\nChaka becomes the first to acquire the digital sub-broker license introduced by SEC in April of this year. As part of a major amendment to its Consolidated Rules and Regulations, SEC recognised sub-brokers who use digital platforms to serve multiple brokers.\n\nTosin Osibodu, the startup\u2019s CEO, said on a call on Wednesday that the acquisition took \u201ca tremendous amount of effort\u201d and is the fruit of frequent engagement with the capital markets regulator.\n\nOn the 19th of December 2020, the SEC published a statement that effectively barred Chaka from offering its services in Nigeria. SEC\u2019s complaint was that Chaka operated \u201coutside the regulatory purview of the Commission and without requisite registration, as stipulated by the Investment and Securities Act 2007.\u201d\n\nSEC ordered Chaka to stop advertising to users, justifying it as a need to prevent \u201cunscrupulous actors\u201d from harming the investing public. Though the order was particular to Chaka, it was the first major signal that regulation was coming to the investment-tech sector.\n\nThat December warning enabled Chaka to take the lead and open talks with the SEC. With the license now acquired, Osibodu says it affirms Chaka\u2019s commitment to full regulatory compliance and provides clarity to the market.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve built a great relationship [with SEC] that we think will be beneficial for the whole ecosystem moving forward,\u201d Osibodu said.\n\nHe said the license also means Chaka could now enable other stockbroking firms who want to have a digital presence. \u201cWe want this benefit to accrue to as many stockbrokers as possible.\u201d\n\nUntil now, Chaka\u2019s operations were based on a partnership with Citi Investment Capital Ltd, a Lagos-based broker licensed by the SEC. An official license now places the startup directly under SEC\u2019s supervision.\n\nChaka\u2019s app hosts over 4,000 stocks from publicly traded companies in Nigeria and the US. Founded in January 2019 by Osibodu with Olaolu Ajose as the chief technology officer, the startup bills itself as an \u201cinvestment passport\u201d which powers borderless investing for users.\n\nAnyone with an internet-enabled smartphone can download the app, sign up and begin investing with $2 or \u20a61,000. Chaka is only available in Nigeria at the moment.\n\nOsibodu did not specify what Chaka did, in terms of fees or filings, to receive the license.\n\nBut according to the SEC\u2019s recent amendment (pdf, page 3), a sub-broker license for digital platforms involves a minimum capital of \u20a610 million and a Fidelity Bond covering at least 20% of the minimum capital.\n\nOther requirements include four separate fees totalling \u20a6500,000, a number of SEC forms, company documents and other documentation about people involved with the company.\n\nDigital sub-brokers are also required to fully describe the technology that their infrastructure is built on, including details about security, backup and recovery processes.\n\nThey should have adequate Know Your Customer processes and have documented policies for managing technology risks. Also, they are expected to show how they assess the capacity of potential customers to use its platform for transactions, plus clear explanations of the features, risks, responsibilities, obligations and liabilities that come with using the app.\n\nIt is not clear if this license officially permits Chaka (and other fintechs in the sector) to offer stocks listed in foreign markets \u2013 like Tesla and Google \u2013 to Nigerians. In April, SEC sounded a warning that seemed to declare such offerings as being illegal.\n\nOsibodu\u2019s coy response was that Chaka is committed to SEC\u2019s objectives for financial inclusion in Nigeria by, among other things, increasing retail investor participation in the financial markets.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it to a whatsapp group or telegram channel.\n\n.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Good day,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nThe world\u2019s first 3D-printed school opening in Malawi\n\nLearning disabilities and assistive technology\n\nGoogle\u2019s delay in blocking third-party cookies in Chrome\n\nWorld\u2019s first 3D-printed school opens in Malawi\n\nPhoto credit: Nairametrics\n\nWhat happened? LafargeHolcim, a French-Swiss multinational company that manufactures building materials, has announced the world\u2019s first school built using 3D printing (3DP).\n\nHow did it happen? Dedicated to accelerating the provision of affordable housing in Africa, 14Trees, a LafargeHolcim and Colonial Development Corporation (CDC) Group joint venture, deployed cutting-edge 3D printing technology to build the school in Malawi.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy did it happen? Since one of Malawi\u2019s biggest education reforms \u2014 free primary education \u2014 in 1994, there has been a decline in infrastructure, among other things. Hence, LafargeHolcim attempts to alleviate infrastructural problems with 3D printing.\n\nIncredibly, the school\u2019s wall was printed in 18 hours, unlike conventional buildings, which require months to complete. Also, learning began on Monday, June 21, 2021.\n\nSound familiar? Maggie Grout, Founder of Thinking Huts \u2014 a nonprofit organisation that makes education accessible via 3D printed schools \u2014 partnered with humanitarian-driven technology company, Hyperion Robotics, and San-Francisco-based architectural design agency, Studio Mortazavi, to launch a 3DP school in Madagascar between December 2021 and March 2022.\n\nI think I find watching how a 3D building is made therapeutic. But, of course, it has its downsides.\n\nMore to come? LafargeHolcim plans to scale up the technology across Africa. There may be projects in the pipeline in Kenya and Zimbabwe.\n\nRead this for context.\n\nLearning disabilities (LDs) and assistive technology (AT)\n\nPhoto by Wulan Sari on Unsplash\n\nJust two questions before you proceed: What are learning disabilities? How many people do you know with learning disabilities?\n\nMany people in Africa cannot answer these questions. And just like mental health disorders, it\u2019s safe to say that many of them believe a learning disability is not an African issue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA good time to revisit this: Global Wellness Day: Protecting mental health with technology\n\nWhy should you care? It is almost impossible to tell how many people in Africa have LDs because there is inadequate data on them.\n\nAlso, some people with LDs are unaware of their situation, leaving them undiagnosed. As a result, their families are not well informed about providing the necessary care and support.\n\nHistorically, they have been attributed to witchcraft, stupidity, or dumbness. But, of course, that\u2019s erroneous because LDs are neurological disorders that affect how children and adults receive and process information. They do not affect intelligence but one or two cognitive processes related to learning.\n\nWhile a learning disability has no known cause, it is believed to be linked to premature birth, maternal illnesses, and complications during childbirth, reducing oxygen supply to the child\u2019s brain. In some cases, they are hereditary.\n\nAlthough there is no cure for LDs, technology has made learning easier for people with learning disabilities.\n\nAssistive technology (AT) can influence decoding, word recognition, reading fluency, and reading comprehension. It also offers reading, writing, studying, and organisational support for children with LDs.\n\nWhile AT helps people with learning disabilities to live healthy, independent, and productive lives, people with LDs need support from family, friends, classmates, and co-workers to reach their full potential.\n\nTo know how AT is helping children with LDs and the unique case of Africans with the condition, read this.\n\nGoogle delays plan to block third-party cookies in Chrome\n\nPhoto by Brett Jordan on Unsplash\n\nAnother announcement? Google has said that it will delay its plans to block third-party cookies in the Chrome browser until 2023, a year later than planned.\n\nWhile browsers like Safari and Firefox have already begun blocking third-party tracking cookies, I think Google\u2019s implementation may require finesse because its move will be significant to the ad industry.\n\nWhy the delay? Google said that the decision to block cookies in mid-2023 would be dependent on its engagement with the United Kingdom\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).\n\nIf Google fails to cut off third-party cookies, it might be criticised by regulators, privacy advocates, advertisers, and publishers for not protecting user privacy.\n\nWhat is Google doing concerning that? The company is developing Privacy Sandbox \u2014 its new privacy technologies \u2014 out in the open web.\n\nYou saw that coming, didn\u2019t you? Google claims that the Privacy Sandbox will help web technologies that protect people\u2019s privacy online and give companies and developers the tools to build thriving digital businesses to keep the web open and accessible to everyone.\n\nGoogle plans to remove support for third-party cookies in two stages: from late 2022, Chrome will give the advertising industry and publishers nine months to migrate their services, and in late 2023, Chrome will phase out support for third-party cookies within three months.\n\nIn case you missed it:\n\nMTN plans to invest $1.5 billion to boost broadband access in Nigeria.

          "text": "On Tuesday, June 22, 2021, Facebook announced interesting eCommerce updates coming to its products. The company disclosed this on its blog, Facebook Newsroom.\n\nStating that the COVID-19-induced lockdowns in 2020 made online shopping more appealing to people, Facebook wants to make shopping across its apps easier for users.\n\nStatista showed a rise in eCommerce sales in 2020, with global online sales increasing from $3.35 trillion in 2019 to $4.89 trillion in 2020.\n\nTo take advantage of this unprecedented rise, the company rolled out Facebook Shops on May 19, 2020. Today, the social media giant claims 300 million people visit 1.2 million Shops monthly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Facebook isn\u2019t halting its eCommerce strides there.\n\nAugmented reality and artificial intelligence\n\nImage source: Facebook\n\nThe social media giant is investing heavily in augmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence (AI) to make the shopping experience realistic.\n\nExplaining, Facebook says, \u201cwe\u2019re helping shoppers find new products, and with AR experiences, we\u2019re helping people visualise items before they buy.\u201d\n\nThe social media platform believes that the shopping experience begins with visual discovery making these innovations logical.\n\nAR is a visual technology that enables computer-generated imagery to interact with the real world through a camera.\n\nThis could be a potential solution for the \u201cwhat I ordered vs what I got\u201d problem. TechCabal, reveals this to be one of the factors impeding eCommerce growth in Africa.\n\nWith Facebook\u2019s new product, shoppers can try on a dress in the comfort of their homes before making a purchase.\n\nAI will also help shoppers discover new products based on what they like. Per Facebook, the technology would recommend similar products once a shopper taps on a product they want.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe AI will act as a store attendant, giving shoppers more options based on what they like. And with a single tap, customers will get similar options.\n\nWhile these new features will enhance the shopping experience, Facebook is now able to collect more data from users through their cameras and get more specific data on their preferences.\n\nAlso, Facebook Shops is coming to WhatsApp soon.\n\nThis new update means users can use the messaging app as an online store.\n\nMeanwhile, the new feature will not be available for Whatsapp users globally. However, while Facebook did not indicate which countries will enjoy these products, it said, \u201cSoon, we\u2019ll give businesses in select countries the option to showcase their Shop in WhatsApp.\u201d\n\nHow will it work?\n\nIt is not clear how the new feature works on the messaging app.\n\nOn Instagram and Facebook, people can find Shops on a business page through ads or stories. A collection of the products the seller offers is displayed, and customers can then place an order.\n\nAlthough WhatsApp reportedly has 2 billion global users, reach is limited to people known personally.\n\nThis could be a way the company is pushing revenue generation on the messaging app. In December 2020, WhatsApp gave an ultimatum for users to accept updated privacy policy. While the policy still stands, Facebook is not forcing users to accept it.\n\nThis could be a subtle way to bring back the policy and introduce targeted ads on WhatsApp.",

          "text": "The first 3D-printed school, a partnership between Holcim and CDC Group, has been unveiled in Malawi\u2019s Salima district.\n\nReportedly printed in just 18 hours, the school was officially handed over to the Kalonga village community in Salima district, and students started lessons on June 21.\n\nMiljan Gutovic, Region Head of Europe, Middle East and Africa at Holcim Group, said, \u201cI am very proud of how our colleagues at 14Trees have deployed cutting-edge 3D printing technology to solve such an essential infrastructure need. Now that we\u2019ve proven the concept in Malawi, we look forward to scaling up this technology across the broader region, with projects already in the pipeline in Kenya and Zimbabwe.\u201d\n\nJuliana Kuphanga Chikandila, Primary Education Advisor and a representative of the Director of Education, Youth and Sports in Malawi, revealed that the Salima district needs approximately 50 schools to meet the demand in the region as she expressed her belief that the new school would ensure that students who had left as a result of unavailable infrastructure would return.\n\nThe lack of infrastructure needed to teach students is a major challenge in most countries with low literacy rates. In Malawi, for example, UNICEF estimates that there is a shortage of 36,000 schools. Using conventional materials, it would take 70 years to bridge this gap, but 14Trees claims that it could take as little as 14 years with 3D printing.\n\nIn January 2021, Thinking Huts, a non-profit organisation, announced plans to build what would have been the world\u2019s first 3D-printed school in the summer of 2021-2022 (December to March). Going by this development, it is a title they can no longer claim.\n\nHowever, this points to what could be a game-changer for education in Africa. Unlike conventional buildings, with 3D printing, schools can now be built in days instead of months and at less cost. Building infrastructure is one reason many African children are out of school, and 3D printing could provide a way out. But this could come at a cost.\n\nExisting research on the effects of 3D printing on humans suggests that particles which form as materials are melted are small enough that they could be dangerous to the lungs. There is a growing body of evidence that points to its harmful effects, although more research is required.\n\nWhile 3D printing could be good for education, should we be cautiously optimistic if it becomes a big deal?",

          "text": "Despite the ban on the use of motorcycles as a means of human transportation in major cities in Nigeria, foreign investors are still able to sniff untapped opportunities in Nigeria\u2019s transport and motorcycle industry.\n\nAccording to data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the motorcycles usually imported from India, China, Indonesia, and Japan contributed N416 billion to the total imports in 2020, this is however a 14 percent drop from the N486 billion it contributed in the same period of 2019. The drop may be attributed to the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIn 2018, it achieved N204 billion, which represented an increase of 183 percent from the N72 billion realised in 2017; although data for the second quarter of 2017 was not available.\n\nAn example of manufacturers looking to tap into this market is Hero MotoCorp, one of the world\u2019s largest manufacturers of motorcycles and scooters, which has made investments to tap from Nigeria\u2019s $153 million two-wheelers industry through its specially made-for-Nigeria motorcycle named Hunter.\n\nThe Indian manufacturer recognised an active market in Nigeria which required specific conditions, as the machine offers multiple benefits of modern technology, best mileage, longer engine life, and a comfortable long seat at an attractive introductory price.\n\nThe machine also has a metallic bash plate protecting the engine on rough roads, a combi-lock to protect it from theft, and tyre pressure monitoring indicator (accessory) to prevent deflation and puncture while on rugged terrains. Furthermore, it has an industry-first 12-month or 75,000km Engine Warranty.\n\nBeyond the production of machines for Nigerian conditions, the company affirms that it is looking to grow its presence in Nigeria through the establishment of various outlets.\n\nRead Also: Manufacturers urge enabling policies, actions to drive economic growth\n\nAnil Sahgal, managing director, Automotive Division, Kewalram Chanrai Group, the exclusive distributor of Hero MotoCorp in Nigeria, says while they focus on satisfying consumers, the company aims to significantly increase its presence in the Nigerian market\n\n\u201cHero MotoCorp is also planning to have almost forty outlets in twenty towns across Nigeria and will have a pan-country presence through dealers and parts distributors. In addition, an extensive network of over five thousand trained technicians pan-Nigeria will ensure easy access to service and parts for all customers. Powerful Ride, Smart Technology, Unmistakably Stylish,\u201d he states.\n\nIn recent years, the importation of motorcycles in Nigeria has been significantly driven by rising urbanisation, growing youth population, and increased businesses and investment.\n\nThis also presents an opportunity for more investors to come in as the Nigeria Two-Wheeler Market report by Market Research reveals that the sector has a promising future in the country.\n\n\u201cNigeria two-wheeler market is projected to surpass $153 million by 2023. Growing demand for two-wheelers in Nigeria has been backed by their higher fuel efficiency and easy manoeuvrability.\n\n\u201cMoreover, their affordability coupled with rising prices of passenger cars are further anticipated to contribute to the growing demand for two-wheelers in Nigeria over the next five years,\u201d the report states\n\nEconomic experts believe that the coming of Hero will reduce the country\u2019s unemployment rate, which currently stands at 33 percent and in the same vein boosts economic activities through the inflow of Foreign Direct Investment.\n\nFollowing the ban on the use of motorcycles as a means of human transportation in Lagos, the most populated and the busiest city in Nigeria, the ingenuity of Nigerians was piqued and this resulted in a boom in the logistics services industry.\n\nWith a minimum of N700 and a maximum of N3,000, depending on the location, urgency, and package, people can easily send and receive products in less than 24 hours. The sector has become increasingly competitive with the increase in the number of entrepreneurs, particularly online vendors.\n\nAlthough motorcycle imports have increased despite the ban, this has simply fuelled activities in the logistics industry. This has also prompted manufacturers of motorcycles like Hero MotoCorp to still see limitless opportunities in the Nigerian market.\n\nGoldStein Market Intelligence in its Nigeria Two-Wheeler Market report reveals that as of 2019 Nigeria held the position of the second biggest market in Africa\u2019s two-wheeler industry; hence it has captured the attention of Chinese and Indian manufacturers\n\n\u201cNigeria represented the second-biggest offer in the African Two-Wheeler Market in 2019, this was due to insufficient public intra-city transport framework, expanding monetary action and rising interest for last-mile conveyance purpose,\u201d it states\n\nThe report also projects that the industry is also expected to grow at a CAGR of 13.31 percent.\n\nDespite the huge demand for motorcycles, Nigeria relies on the importation of Completely Knocked Down (CKD) parts from Asian countries, which are assembled in the country.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Thursday launched the online Portal for the continuous voters registration exercise nationwide.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s Chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu made the disclosure at the national headquarters of the Commission in Abuja.\n\nAccording to the chairman, the register of voters is at the heart of democratic elections, stating that \u201ca good register of voters is a precursor to a good election. For this reason, the registration of voters is a major function of the Independent National Electoral Commission under the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) and the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended)\u201d.\n\nHe noted that, \u201cIn exercising its powers under the law, the Commission undertook a fresh registration of eligible voters with every General Election until 2011 when the first reliable biometric register of voters was compiled. Thereafter, the Commission embarked on intermittent registration of voters on the eve of major elections. However, in April 2017, this Commission for the first time began the implementation of registration of voters on a continuous basis as provided in the Electoral Act. As a result, 14,283,734 new voters were added to the register by the time the process was suspended in August, 2018 in order to prepare for the 2019 General Election\u201d.\n\nThe chairman also said that, Monday 28th June 2021 remains sacrosanct, as the registration of voters will commence in full nationwide.\n\n\u201cWe are now ready to resume the CVR on Monday next week. We have acquired all the equipment for the exercise, updated our registration software and planned for the deployment of 5,346 staff to the 2,673 registration centres nationwide. Among the equipment for the exercise is a new registration machine called the INEC Voter Enrolment Device (IVED). This device is built around the concept of a Tablet computer and will replace the lap-top based old Direct Data Capture Machine (DDCM)\u201d.\n\nHe also noted that in the Commission\u2019s determination to serve Nigerians better during the CVR, and in response to repeated calls by stakeholders, the Commission is introducing a dedicated portal for online registration. The idea is for intending registrants to commence the process online by filling the forms and uploading their pictures and required documents, and then make an appointment on the web portal for a date and time to visit an INEC State or Local Government Area (LGA) office to give their fingerprints and complete the registration. In addition, those who are already registered as voters can carry out all the other activities such as transfers, correction of personal details and replacement of damaged or defaced Permanent Voters\u2019 Cards (PVCs) online. We hope that through this portal, we shall reduce overcrowding at our registration centres, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, make the registration processes generally easier, thereby giving Nigerians a pleasant electoral experience.\n\nThe exercise according to the Commission will be carried out continuously over a period of at least one year thereby, providing enough time for the Commission to reach all the nooks and crannies of the country. \u201cNo eligible Nigerian will be disenfranchised, the chairman noted.\n\nThe chairman also allayed the fears expressed by some Nigerians that many citizens may be disenfranchised by the new digital arrangement pointing out that, the Commission is aware that not all Nigerians have computers, smart phones, access to the internet or residing in urban and sub-urban areas. Some citizens may also have one form of disability or another to make it impossible for them to register online.\n\nThe Commission, Yakubu said is also aware of its responsibility under the law to provide every eligible Nigerian the opportunity to register irrespective of where they live or other circumstances of life. \u201cI wish to assure you that in addition to the online registration portal, there will be some 2,673 centres where citizens can register physically nationwide\u201d, he added.\n\n...",

          "text": "A court document has revealed how Lauretta Onochie, a presidential nominee for a sensitive Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) position, proudly declared her membership of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nMs Onochie, currently the Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Social Media, also confirmed in the document obtained by PREMIUM TIMES on Friday, that she is into active politics.\n\nShe also described herself as a \u201cvolunteer at the Buhari Support Organisation (BSO)\u201d, a vibrant network of Mr Buhari\u2019s staunch political supporters since the 2015 elections.\n\nThe document, which is her statement on oath filed in a pending suit, further confirms her widely known unapologetic partisanship, which has sparked public outrage against her recent nomination by Mr Buhari as a national commissioner of INEC.\n\nShe filed the statement on oath as part of a libel suit which she instituted at the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court, Abuja, in 2016.\n\nIn the suit marked CV/852/16, Ms Onochie seeks N1 billion in damages against Emeka Ugwonye, whom she accused of defaming her by referring to her as a trafficker of young girls for international prostitution, in a Facebook post of January 21, 2016.\n\nThe suit was amended and refiled on March 8, 2017.\n\nPREMIUM TIMES confirmed that Ms Onochie has appeared as a witness in the suit which is pending before Sylvanus Oriji, a judge in the Apo Division of the FCT High Court.\n\nShe was cross-examined by the defence team only last year, precisely on February 26 and March 3, 2020, when she also adopted all her claims contained in her statement on oath as true.\n\nThe lawyer she engaged to file the case is Festus Keyamo, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, who is the incumbent Minister of Labour and Employment in Mr Buhari\u2019s cabinet.\n\nMr Keyamo is a top APC figure from Delta State like her.\n\nAs her screening for the INEC job approaches amid growing public condemnation of her nomination for the appointment, a law firm has written to the Senate denying that she is a member of APC.\n\n\u201cThe onus to prove whether Lauretta Onochie is a card-carrying member of any political party, therefore, rest on her accusers,\u201d the lawyers wrote without stating that they were acting for Ms Onochie.\n\nSelf-confirmation\n\nThe court document obtained by this newspaper has, however, removed every doubt about her membership of APC and her strong political bias for the political interests of Mr Buhari.\n\nShe made the disclosure in the document, bragging to be an educationist and \u2018active politician\u2019, whose reputation was injured by the Facebook post complained of in her suit.\n\nShe stated that with the \u201cwords\u201d used in the post, her reputation \u201chas been seriously injured in her character, credit, reputation and integrity\u201d and \u201chas been brought to public scandal, odium, and contempt and has suffered damage\u201d.\n\n\u201cI am an educationist having served as Headmistress of Aunt Margaret International School Calabar and Principal of Holy Child Secondary School, Calabar. I have also served as a Lecturer at the Epping Forest College Essex United Kingdom,\u201d she said of her career as an educationist.\n\nRegarding her political career, she said, \u201cThat I am also engaged in active politics and a member of the Neighbourhood Watch and has also contested the Local Government elections under the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI am also a member of the All Progressives Congress and a volunteer at the Buhari Support Group.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted by PREMIUM TIMES over the phone on Friday, Ms Onochie requested that our reporter send her the enquiries in a text message.\n\nShe has, however, yet to respond to our reporter\u2019s text message asking if she instructed the lawyers who sent letter to the Senate denying her membership on the APC, and if she still stood by her statement on oath affirming her membership of the party.\n\nShe did not answer our correspondent\u2019s subsequent call.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, on October 13, 2020, read a letter from President Buhari requesting the confirmation of three nominees as INEC National Commissioners and one Resident Electoral Commissioner.\n\nMs Lauretta Onochie, who hails from Aniocha Local Government Area of Delta State, was nominated as National Commissioner of INEC to represent the South-south region.\n\nEight months after her nomination, the Senate, on June 9, referred Ms Onochie\u2019s name to its Committee on INEC to commence her screening for the appointment.\n\nMany Nigerians have condemned her nomination due to her unhidden partisanship.\n\nThe Nigerian constitution explicitly prohibits the appointment of a person like Ms Onochie, who belongs to a political party as an INEC national commissioner. Credible voices including senior lawyers, civil society groups and media organisations have also said this.\n\nPremium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism (PTCIJ), YIAGA Africa and nine other civil society groups, in their June 16, 2021 petition to the Senate, rejected Ms Onochie\u2019s appointment to INEC on many grounds, including her partisanship.\n\nThey cited section 156(1)(a) and Third Schedule, Part 1, Item F, paragraph 14 (1) of the 1999 Constitution, as disqualifying her from holding the post as a card-carrying member of APC.\n\nA former 2nd vice-president of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Monday Ubani, cited the same constitutional provisions in objecting Ms Onochie\u2019s nomination in a letter to the Senate.\n\nOther Nigerians and institutions have also raised objections to the nomination in separate letters and statements.\n\nMs Onochie\u2019s suit\n\nThe crux of the matter in the libel suit filed by Ms Onochie is about a post she credited to one Mr Ugwonye in a Facebook group, \u2018DUE PROCESS ADVOCATES,\u2019 on January 21, 2016.\n\nMs Onochie reproduced what she claimed to be the libellous statement posted by Mr Ugwonye, labelling her as a \u201cvicious trafficker of poor girls into international prostitution\u201d.\n\nThe post is titled, \u2018A MAJOR BREAK IN THE TRACKING OF THE DUBAI MADAMS AND THEIR AGENTS \u2013 A KEY MADAM REVEALED AS A SOCIALITE WITH APPARENT ON CONNECTIONS TO NIGERIAN POLITICIAN\u2019.\n\nIn the post which Ms Onochie reproduced in her suit, the the author accused her of engaging in the trafficking of young girls to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Italy, and Greece.\n\nIt was alleged in the post that she is known as \u2018Aunty Lolly\u2019 within her human trafficking circle in foreign countries.\n\nIt added that Ms Onochie is \u201cinto the business of recruiting young ladies, promising them a good life in Dubai and elsewhere, swearing their parents to shrines, selling them off for $5,000 to $15,000, making nude videos of them and using thugs to intimidate their parents.\u201d\n\nMs Onochie denied the allegations in her suit, demanding a retraction of the post and N1 billion in damages against the defendant.\n\nShe said the post was made to malign her reputation.\n\nShe said contrary to the allegation of her involvement in trafficking of girls in the Facebook post, she \u201cis at the foremost of the campaigning for the girl-child emancipation and woman empowerment.\u201d",

          "text": "The Borno State government through the Commissioner of Health and Human Services, Juliana Bitrus, has issued a query to the Provost, College of Nursing and Midwifery, Rukaiya Shettima Mustapha, for suspending some students on premise that they refused to join their colleagues in welcoming President Muhammadu Buhari to Maiduguri, the state capital on Tuesday, June 17, 2021.\n\nAdvertisements\n\n\n\n\n\nThe commissioner described the provost as being mischievous against Borno State government, because she acted on her own, without recourse to any official at her supervising ministry and without any directive from anyone in the state government.\n\nIn the query with reference number MOH/PER/752 V.I and dated June 25, which was made available to LEADERSHIP, the commissioner demanded that the provost responds within 48 hours, to advance compelling reasons why a disciplinary action should not be taken against her.\n\nThe commissioner said while Borno State has about eight state-owned tertiary institutions, it was curious that only at the College of Nursing and Midwifery that students were suspended through written letters addressed to them, in apparent effort to embarrass the state government.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe commissioner said even though it is a normal practice that students join in welcoming visiting the President all over Nigeria, such act is voluntary, noting that the students in question constituted far less than thousands of residents who freely trooped out to welcome the President in all parts of Maiduguri.\n\nThe commissioner explained that it was unbelievable to the ministry, when news came about the action taken by the provost, hence the ministry took time to investigate and confirm the act before issuing the query.\n\nThe commissioner was concerned that the provost may have simply used the president\u2019s visit to get at some students she may have had issues with.\n\nJuliana noted that Heads of States and Presidents have been visiting Borno State since 1976, and students do join in welcoming them, and no one ever expected 100 percent compliance in any public mobilisation.\n\nThe commissioner further said, that if any issue involving students was to be raised, how come it was not the Borno State University, which the President commissioned, or schools around projects commissioned by the President.\n\nIt would be recalled that President Buhari was in Maiduguri for appraisal of security situation, during which he commissioned first phase of 10,000 houses he approved for resettlement of IDPs in Borno State.\n\nBuhari, who was widely and spontaneously welcomed by thousands of residents at all points of his visit, also commissioned seven out of 556 capital projects executed by Governor Babagana Zulum in two years.",

          "text": "By Daniels Ekugo\n\nChoice International Group (CIG), manufacturers of Gree Air conditioner and a leading home appliances brand has introduced Stephanie Linus as its brand ambassador in Nigeria.\n\nThe event was graced by investors and the brand\u2019s business partners from Nigeria and China, who were delighted to witness the spectacular beginning of a new phase.\n\n\n\nSpeaking at the unveiling, the country manager, sale and marketing, Chibuzor Ogunka, said the brand in the last five years has made giant strides with a lot of reference projects.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cToday, we have a lot of reference projects in Nigeria as Gree Air Conditioner has powered key projects such as the Dangote refinery and the Nigerian Railway Cooperation project\u201d. \u201cWe have decided to continuously ensure that our Nigerian consumers are better engaged and catered for.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe believe that bringing our new brand ambassador on board will help us deliver better value to the consumers as Stephanie Linus is a global Icon and will take Gree Air conditioner brand to the number spot in Nigeria,\u201d Ogunka said.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring her speech, Stephanie Linus expressed her delight, narrating her personal experience with Gree ACs over the last few years and testifying to the brand\u2019s safety and durability.\n\nIn her words, \u201cMy experience with Gree is different. It circulates effectively, it\u2019s health-friendly, and it cools like winter.

          "text": "\u2026Farmers unable to go to farms due to banditry \u2013 el-Rufa\u2019i \u2026Food calamity looms unless\u2026- CAN \u202612.83m citizens in crisis levels \u2013 FOA, ActionAid \u2026We\u2019re finding it difficult to cope \u2013 Nigerians \u2026Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re combing bandits\u2019 hideouts \u2013 Military\n\nThe increasing security concerns in Nigeria especially in the North have made it difficult for farmers to go to their farms as they fear being attacked and have consequently fled their communities. BENJAMIN SAMSON in this report examines the effects of the ugly security situation on food production and availability.\n\nNigeria is currently facing security challenges in different areas; from the North-east that is ravaged by Boko Haram/Islamic State in West Africa (ISWAP), the North-west distressed by armed bandits, the South-east disturbed by the Independent People of Biafra (IPOB) secession group, and the North-central which is battling the age-long farmers,\u2019 herders\u2019 crises.\n\nel-Rufai\u2019s alarm\n\nGovernor Nasir el-Rufa\u2019i of Kaduna state recently said there is a looming food crisis as farmers are unable to go to their farms due to the activities of bandits.\n\nThe governor, who emphasised the role of the Department of State Services (DSS) in providing reliable information needed by the Police, Armed Forces and other security agencies for the total defeat of the insurgents, said, \u201cthere is urgent need by security agencies to strengthen intelligence gathering, to establish not just the identities, plans and locations of the criminals, but to actively disrupt their capacity to organise and mount attacks on the citizens.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the criminal gangs terrorising the North-west region have become more daring and dangerous since recovering from their near defeat in 2015, after the joint operation of the states stopped.\n\n\u201cAs Directors of the State Commands of the DSS in the North-west, you are all aware of the immense security challenges across the states in our region. The consequences of these serious security deficits have devastated the rural economy, taken lives and property and made simple travel an ordeal across federal, state and local roads.\n\n\u201cThe governors of the North-west states and Niger state appreciated this salient fact as far back as 2015. We came together to fund simultaneous operations by the federal military and security agencies across the largely ungoverned Kamuku-Kuyambana forest swathes that straddle about seven of our states up to Dajin Rugu in Katsina state. These operations disrupted the cattle rustling gangs, but were unfortunately not sustained as a continuous exercise to dominate these spaces and assert within them the authority of the Nigerian state.\n\n\u201cThat the criminal gangs have become more daring and dangerous since recovering from their near defeat in 2015 is obvious across the country,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added: \u201cAs the lead agency for domestic intelligence and counter-intelligence, the Department of State Services has a vital role to play in providing the reliable information needed by the Police and Armed Forces and other security agencies for the total defeat of these dangerous insurgents.\n\n\u201cThis is an urgent priority, in the face of the looming food crisis that we face if our farmers do not go to the farms. The rains are here, but farmers in various communities are unable to go to their farms; that is when they are lucky not to have fled their remote villages under pressure and attacks from the criminals. This cannot be allowed to continue.\u201d\n\nCAN\u2019s concerns\n\nSimilarly, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in the 19 Northern states and the Federal Capital Territory (Northern CAN), has noted that without mincing words, the current state of the nation has plunged the vast majority of the people into hunger, poverty, frustration and despondency.\n\nThis was contained in a statement signed by its the public relations officer (PRO), Rev. Jechonia Albert, to mark this year\u2019s Democracy Day.\n\nAccording to the statement, due to the prevailing economic and security challenges facing Nigerians, celebrating June 12 as a Democracy Day makes no meaning to the Nigerian populace; hence not worthy of celebration.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cJune 12, declared as Democracy Day by the current administration, was marked with mixed feelings across the country. Amid increasing insecurity, bad economy and undemocratic tendencies among the leaders, is there anything really worth celebrating? Certainly none!\n\n\u201cThe security situation in the country today has worsened with bandits, kidnappers and Boko Haram insurgents unleashing mayhem on Nigerians, killing innocent people and sacking communities.\n\n\u201cThousands of Nigerians, especially the in rural communities, have been rendered homeless by bandits. On a daily basis across the country, communities are being raided and people are being killed or abducted by rampaging bandits and other criminal elements.\n\n\u201cThe security situation has crippled the economy as travelling on the highways across the country has become a nightmare to Nigerians. The rains are here, but farmers cannot go to the farms for fear of being killed or abducted by bandits.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe implication of this is a looming food crisis and unless steps are taken to provide a secured environment for farmers to return to the farms, we may be in for more trouble with a hungry and frustrated population.\n\nFAO, ActionAid\u2019s alarms\n\nIn the same vein, the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has raised the alarm over the worsening state of food security in the country. It, therefore, stressed the need for urgent measures to protect the most vulnerable, keep the national agricultural supply chains functional and efficient, and mitigate the food security impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nFAO country representative Fred Kafero, who spoke at the 44th meeting of the National Council on Agriculture and Rural Development (NCARD), said the theme of the meeting, \u2018Nigeria\u2019s Agriculture and Food Security in the Face of Covid-19, Floods and Insecurity,\u2019 was a call to action, to cushion threats to the livelihoods of a large section of the population.\n\nAccording to him, the March-April 2021 Cadre Harmonis\u00e9 (CH) food security analysis conducted in 16 states and the FCT projected that a total of 12.83 million people in the affected states would be in crisis levels.\n\nAlso, the ActionAid country director Ene Obi raised concerns over the inability of women to go to farms for fear of being raped. She said being the major producers of food in the country, it is important for the government to fast-track its efforts at curtailing the rising insecurity.\n\nShe decried low budgetary allocation to the agricultural sector despite the fact that Nigeria is a signatory to the Maputo Declaration on the allocation of a minimum of 10 per cent to the sector.\n\nNigerians\u2019 lamentations\n\nMeanwhile, Nigerians who spoke with Blueprint Weekend have lamented the increase in prices of foodstuff. The high increase in the prices of food items has affected so many families as well as salary earners. Some of the civil servants who spoke with our reporter said they now find it difficult to cope with the skyrocketing increase in the prices of essential commodities.\n\nA civil servant told this reporter in confidence that, \u201cIt is like I am not working at all. I work with the Ministry of Labour and receive salary, but at the end of the month, I pay debts because I borrow weekly from friends to buy groceries for my family. How much is a mudu of beans? How much was it three months ago? That is what we are saying; it keeps increasing.\u201d\n\nAlso, Kabiru Abdullahi, a meat seller, blamed the increase in meat in the market on the rise of insecurity in some parts of the country, pointing out that a kilo of meat sold for 1, 500 three months ago is now 2, 500 to 3, 000 depending on the bargaining power of the customer.\n\n\u201cAnytime we go to the market, we come back with whatever we can afford. A cow that we used to buy for N300, 000 is now N600, 000, while that of 250,000 is now N500, 000 or even N450, 000.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe commodities are not scarce, but the problem is going to the market to get them due to the security situation in some parts of the country. We can\u2019t go to states like Katsina and Sokoto where cows are cheap; we now source them Kano, Bauchi or Gombe state,\u201d he said.\n\nIsa Mohamed, a farmer from Anzare village in Kajuru local government area of Kaduna state whose village was sacked by bandits in February, described as \u201cunfortunate\u201d the soaring prices of foodstuff and lamented that they have been unable to farm grains due to the activities of bandits.\n\nA pepper trader, who identified herself as Bilkisu, said: \u201cThe cost of food is very expensive, especially pepper and tomatoes. Two years ago, a basket of tomatoes went for N4, 000, but now, it is N18, 000 or N17, 000. I can\u2019t afford a basket because of the hike. The money we used to buy a basket of pepper and tomatoes is what we now use to buy the items in smaller quantities. Also, a quarter bag of pepper is now N6, 500. We bought one bag of Shombo for N13, 000 yesterday. Today, I could not afford the price, and so I had to buy in bits from other traders.\n\nMilitary\u2019s assurances\n\nHowever, the Defence Headquarters said it had begun the bombardment of bandits\u2019 hideouts in the North-west, North-central and some parts of the North-east. It stated that operational efforts of the Armed Forces of Nigeria (AFN) in various theatres of operations have led to the reduction in criminal activities across the country.\n\nThe director, Defence Media Operation (DMO), Brig.-Gen. Bernard Onyeuko, stated this recently while briefing journalists on the operational activities of the AFN across the country between June 3 and 16, 2021.\n\nHe said, \u201cTroop\u2019s operational activities in Operation Hadarin Daji theatre of operation between June 3 and 16, 2021, were characterised with ambush operations, aggressive fighting patrols, air raids, sustained air intelligence surveillance reconnaissance patrols as well as cordon and search operations.\n\n\u201cThese operations yielded attendant successes in the period under review. Troops, during an ambush operation on June 3, intercepted and neutralised some gunrunners who were in possession of assorted arms and ammunition between Naimaimai Village and Sabon Birni Town in Sabon Birni local government area of Sokoto state.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, on June 4, 2021, troops, following credible intelligence report, conducted cordon and search operation along Gurbin Baure \u2013 Jibia Road in Katsina state. During the operation, troops intercepted and neutralised some armed bandits.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari\u2019s stern order\n\nThe senior special assistant on media and publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, had in an interview with the Hausa Service of the BBC in March, said President Muhammadu Buhari had ordered a crackdown on bandits terrorising farmers across the country.\n\nAlso, during his interview with Arise Television recently, the president said he had ordered security agents to shoot on sight bandits carrying AK-47 rifles.\n\nFood imports\n\nThe rise in agricultural imports has continued unabated due to insecurity despite many Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN\u2019s) initiatives aimed at achieving food sufficiency.\n\nA recent foreign trade report released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) indicated that Nigeria\u2019s agricultural imports increased by 140 per cent in the first quarter of this year.\n\nNigeria imported agricultural items worth N630.18 billion in the period compared to N262.1 billion in first quarter of 2020.\n\nThis represents the highest quarterly agric import recorded by Nigeria since 2016. In the past two years, between the second quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2020, Nigeria has spent N3.1 trillion on agricultural imports.\n\nSome of the programmes, as stated by the apex bank in its last MPC briefing, include N631.4 billion to 3.11 million small-holder farmers cultivating 3.8 million hectares of land, under the Anchor Borrowers\u2019 program. Also, 29, 26 beneficiaries received N111.7 billion for the AGSMEIS, while 548,345 beneficiaries have received N253.4 billion under the Targeted Credit Facility.\n\nThese interventions notwithstanding, agric imports have continued to rise, triggered by multiple de-valuations of the naira; demand for higher input raw materials, and rising inflation. Much of Nigeria\u2019s food consumption still relies significantly on the importation of food items to stimulate local production.\n\nFor example, wheat remains an imported production input costing Nigeria about N222 billion in the first quarter of 2021 alone. It was N252 billion in the 4th quarter of 2020, translating to an annualised cost of N1 trillion ($2 billion). The country\u2019s food index has increased by 32.3 percent between September 2019 and April 2021 which is only a weighted aggregate of the market reality.\n\nAccording to a market survey report which studies the prices of food items in major markets in Lagos state, a bag of pepper surged by as much as 85.7 per cent in May 2021, while beans increased by 15.1 per cent in the same period. Other items that have witnessed significant increases recently include flour, egg, tomatoes, noodles, pasta, bread, beverages, just to state a few.\n\nFor Suleiman Dikwa, the CEO of Green Sahara Farms, a major cause of the surge in agric imports is the inability of the country to produce sufficiently for local consumption",

          "title": "Russia Mandates Vaccinations for Some as Virus Cases Surge",
          "text": "They tried grocery giveaways and lotteries for new cars and apartments. But an ambitious plan of vaccinating 30 million Russians by mid-June still has fallen short by a third.\n\nSo now, many regional governments across the vast country are obligating some workers to get vaccinated and requiring the shots to enter certain businesses, like restaurants.\n\nAs many Western countries lift coronavirus restrictions and plan a return to normal life after mass vaccinations, Russia is battling a surge of infections \u2014 even though it was the first in the world to authorize a vaccine and among the first to start administering it in December.\n\nDaily new cases have grown from about 9,000 in early June to about 17,000 on June 18 and over 20,000 on Thursday, with Moscow, its outlying region and St. Petersburg combining for about half of all new infections.\n\nOfficials have blamed Russians\u2019 lax attitude toward taking necessary precautions and the growing prevalence of more infectious variants. But perhaps the biggest factor is the lack of vaccinations.\n\nOnly 20.7 million people, or 14% of its population of 146 million, have received at least one shot as of Wednesday, and only 16.7 million, or about 11%, have been fully vaccinated.\n\nExperts say those numbers are due to several factors, including the public\u2019s wariness of the rushed approval and rollout of the Sputnik V vaccine; an official narrative that Russia had tamed its outbreak; criticism on state TV of other vaccines as dangerous; and a weak promotional campaign that included incentives such as consumer giveaways.\n\nIn light of the surge, at least 14 Russian regions \u2014 from Moscow and St. Petersburg to the remote far-eastern region of Sakhalin \u2014 made vaccinations mandatory this month for employees in certain sectors, such as government offices, retail, health care, education, restaurants, fitness centers, beauty parlors and other service industries.\n\nMoscow authorities said companies should suspend without pay employees unwilling to get vaccinated, and they threatened to temporarily halt operations of businesses that don\u2019t meet the goal of having 60% of staff get at least one shot by July 15 and both shots by Aug. 15.\n\nAs of Monday, all Moscow restaurants, cafes and bars will admit only customers who have been vaccinated, have recovered from COVID-19 in the past six months, or can provide a negative coronavirus test from the previous 72 hours. City officials also limited most elective hospital care to those who are fully vaccinated or can provide tests showing they have antibodies to fight the infection.\n\nThe moves seem to be an act of desperation by authorities.\n\n\u201cThey backed themselves into a corner, they have no choice now,\u201d said Judy Twigg, a political science professor specializing in global health at Virginia Commonwealth University.\n\n\u201cThey overhyped this vaccine so that people didn\u2019t trust it. Then they took a series of measures that were clearly attempted to make it seem as though the government had everything under control, the pandemic was no big deal. \u2026 And now they\u2019re in this situation, not surprisingly, where low vaccination rates have left an opening for the delta variant to come in,\u201d she said.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov insisted Thursday the vaccinations in Moscow were \u201cvoluntary,\u201d because those refusing to get the shot can still seek a different job.\n\nThe governor of the southern region of Krasnodar, home to the Black Sea resort of Sochi, said hotels and sanitariums will only accommodate vacationers with a negative coronavirus test or a vaccination certificate starting July 1. As of Aug. 1, only vaccinated individuals will be admitted.\n\nThe mandates have drawn mixed responses, with some saying they are welcome if they prevent closures of businesses, while other say it\u2019s unclear how employers can persuade those who don\u2019t want the shots.\n\n\u201cMost restaurateurs believe that vaccination is necessary,\u201d said Sergei Mironov, founder of a restaurant chain and vice president of the Federation of Restaurateurs and Hoteliers. \u201cBut it is necessary to create (the right) conditions for the vaccination (drive).\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are too many rumors, and even doctors say different things,\u201d and convincing younger employees to get vaccinated is especially difficult, he said.\n\nTatyana Moskalkova, the government\u2019s human rights commissioner, said the unvaccinated have cited discrimination by employers, with threats of dismissal or withholding bonuses.\n\nAt a TV awards ceremony Tuesday, popular actor Yegor Beroyev wore a yellow star akin to those worn by Jews under the Nazis in World War II, and he spoke of \u201cwaking up in a world where (COVID-19 vaccination) became an identification mark of whether you are a citizen, \u2026 will you be able to visit institutions and events, will you enjoy all the benefits and rights.\u201d\n\nAs proof of vaccination for entering a restaurant, customers must visit a government website and get a QR code, a digital pattern designed to be read by a scanner.\n\nRestaurant owners won concessions Thursday when Moscow agreed the QR codes aren\u2019t needed for the next two weeks at establishments with outdoor terraces, and underage customers won\u2019t have to provide documentation if accompanied by their parents.\n\nStill, the situation for many restaurants \u201cis hard and will be harder by the day,\u201d Mironov said.\n\nIn Moscow, online searches for fake inoculation documents increased shortly after the mayor announced mandatory vaccinations, social anthropologist Alexandra Arkhipova told an online lecture on vaccine hesitancy.\n\nPolice quickly cracked down, launching 24 criminal cases last week against sellers of fake vaccination certificates. Still, several accounts offering the bogus documents could be found easily on the Telegram messaging app this week.\n\nThe number of such offers has grown about 19% every month since March, said Evgeny Egorov, digital risk protection analyst at Group-IB, a Singapore-based cybersecurity company. In mid-June, Group-IB found at least 90 active offers, he said.\n\nThe independent pollster Levada Center said polls show about 60% of Russians are unwilling to get vaccinated.\n\nLevada director and sociologist Denis Volkov said the vaccination mandates could change the minds of many because it\u2019s a clear signal from the government that the shots are necessary.\n\n\u201cI often hear (from respondents) that they wouldn\u2019t do it, are afraid and so on, but if there are restrictions, and it is required for travel, state services, or at work, then yes,\u201d Volkov said.\n\nIt could be starting to change attitudes. Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova said the average vaccination rate across Russia has almost doubled in the past week, and long lines have been seen at pop-up vaccination clinics in Moscow shopping malls.\n\nA demand for vaccines could also lead to shortages. As of mid-May, just over 33 million doses were produced in Russia, and a significant amount was exported.\n\nSeveral regions have reported supply problems this week, but Peskov said those were \u201ctemporary logistical difficulties.\u201d",
