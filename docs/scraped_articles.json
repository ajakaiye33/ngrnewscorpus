Tukur Buratai (retd.), has met with the President of the French-speaking West African nation, Patrice Talon.\n\nBuratai met with the Beninese President on Tuesday during the official presentation of his letter of credence.\n\nAlso, the Ambassador of Germany to Benin Republic, Michael Derus; as well as those of Ghana, Gabon, and Norway also presented their letters of credence to Talon.\n\nBuratai\u2019s meeting with the Beninese President occurred amid the planned extradition of wanted Yoruba nation activist, Sunday Adeyemo, also known as Sunday Igboho, who was arrested in Cotonou on July 19, 2021 while he tried to catch a flight to Germany.\n\nA member of Igboho\u2019s legal team, Pelumi Olajengbesi, had said Buratai asked for the extradition of Igboho to the headquarters of the Department of State Services in Abuja, Nigeria but Benin Republic disappointed him.\n\nBuratai, Nigeria\u2019s Chief of Army Staff between July 2015 and January 2021, was deployed as Nigeria\u2019s envoy in the Benin Republic in June 2021.\n\nBefore then, the Nigerian President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), had presented Buratai\u2019s nomination to the Senate and the upper chamber of the National Assembly had confirmed the ex-COAS\u2019 nomination despite public outcry of some crimes against humanity allegedly committed by the Nigerian Army under Buratai\u2019s leadership.\n\nIn a statement, the Beninese Government said Talon granted audience to each of the new ambassadors and discussed with them on the revitalisation and strengthening of bilateral cooperation between these different countries and Benin.\n\nTalon was also said to have received a brief update on the state of cooperation between Benin, Nigeria and the other countries.\n\n\u201cThe President of the Republic also took the opportunity to invite the new Ambassadors to work more on consolidating and strengthening the warm relations that already exist between their countries and Benin,\u201d the statement added.\n\nIt was, however, not clear whether or not Buratai discussed Igboho\u2019s extradition with the Beninese President.\n\nIgboho, an arrowhead of the secessionist agitation for Yoruba nation, has been in detention since July 19, 2021 when he was arrested by Interpol at the Cadj\u00e8houn Airport in Cotonou around 8pm.\n\nIgboho was arrested after the Nigerian Government notified its West African neighbours \u2013 including Benin Republic \u2013 that he should be hunted.\n\nHe was arrested with his wife, Ropo, but the Cour De\u2019appal De Cotonou ordered the release of the Germany-based wife of the activist, saying there were no allegations against her.\n\nThe Beninese court, on Monday, however, ordered that Igboho be remanded in a prison facility in the country while further investigations were carried out on the case against the agitator.\n\nIgboho is facing allegations bordering on trafficking in arms, inciting violence and causing disunity in Nigeria.\n\nSome of the other offences said to have been committed by the activist include entering Benin Republic illegally as well as alleged planned intent to cause social unrest in Benin Republic.\n\nThough currently in detention, the court granted the 48-year-olf agitator access to medical care while his lawyers continue to battle for his release and kick against his extradition to Nigeria.\n\nRecall that Igboho fled Nigeria after the DSS declared him wanted for allegedly stockpiling arms to cause mayhem under the pretext of Yoruba nation but the activist denied the allegation.\n\nIgboho had narrowly escaped the DSS raid on his Ibadan residence on July 1, 2021 around 1am when the secret police killed two of his associates and arrested about 12 of them.",

The dual law being applied by the state is also a cause for concern as Bandits, terrorists, and kidnappers in certain parts of the country are treated to sumptuous dinners with state actors while agitators for self-determination of their people are hounded and treated as common criminals.\n\n\u201cThe Gestapo invasion of Chief Sunday Igboho\u2019s house, the killing and abduction of his associates and his eventual arrests in Benin Republic at the request of this government are testaments of this government\u2019s effort at ensuring that their lawlessness remains unchecked.\n\n\u201cWe, as a Yoruba self-determination group, sees it\u2019s time that this government and its actors of impunity are reminded that nothing lasts forever.

          "title": "APC chairmanship: Fixing a dysfunctional party system",
          "text": "By Wale Bakare\n\nAs the APC Congress draws near, political patronage is central to what ails the political party administration viz-a-viz system of governance.\n\nWe must not continue depicting Nigeria as a soft state and a weak nation, where it is unable to apply the law equally to all its citizens.\n\nIt is no longer news that our political parties and institutions are captives of the oligarchy and serve mostly their interest and that of the few rich allies and powerful politicians. Our leaders failed to unite and inspire our diverse peoples as a nation.\n\nThese are symptoms of political patronage, peripherals feeding on themselves, defining us after many decades of this practice.\n\nOur dysfunctional democracy gets its root from failed party system and administration is one that can best be described as a failure of an electoral system to excise the virus of the politics of patronage that has infected our so-called elections.\n\nThis vicious politics of patronage has allowed few oligarchs and bosses to rule us from colonial times to post-colonial times, and their rule has brought us nothing but a facade of democracy, its mirage but not its miracle.\n\nFurthermore, the agenda of the oligarchy, the political dynasties, clans and cabals who get their candidates sponsored by their overburdened influences in party administration and get elected allow their legitimate capture of state institutions.\n\nThey build on this dominance and perpetuate themselves in power, positions and wealth. It is unfortunate that all these deformities are intertwined and protected by the lapses of adhering to our 1999 Constitution. And this clearly call for a paradigm shift both from the political parties and to the system of governance.\n\nThe best that can happen to any of our political parties is having an enigmatic leadership that is full of energy, vibrancy, intellectualism, focus-driven and free of all liability baggages. The country needs leaders who will lead and not hide behind the power to escape accountability. There must be an agenda with patriotism as the hallmark for all those seeking party and public offices. Those that don\u2019t require us reading between the lines. At this time what we don\u2019t need are the many of them that usually go to the extent of using God in courting votes but they\u2019re actually after their personal interests. As the public expect more drama to unfold, the bunch of aspirants seeking the Chairmanship of the party is a welcome development for a party in governance. And this is starring the party and its various leadership groupings.\n\nOther political alliances may also step in as the election fever heats up. At this point, however, neither of those in the old class or maintaining status quo deserve a place in the new party leadership, the APC deserve it better now than ever to maintain the lead and improve its electoral fortunes. To all of the aspirants to the Chairmanship, the decision to go for it should be as sacred as going to the poll booth to vote. Since the vote is sacred, there is a bigger responsibility on the part of potential leaders to decide and prepare to be a leader of this party and country. The APC vision of the future and the nation\n\nA Chairmanship candidate must bring before the APC members, by extension the people, a vision of the future and the nation, which he will strive to realise if he is fortunate enough to get elected. That vision must be personal, shared by his party and supporters if he is lucky. He cannot substitute for this the vision or record of his predecessor or political godfathers; in the end he must lead alone. Any of the aspirants could quickly become serious and viable candidate for the party\u2019s highest office if he can do things differently when he announce his candidacy in the coming party Congress ones he can do the needful. First, he should run on a platform of conviction politics \u2013 of his fundamental values as a new breed politician, and what he believe will best serve the party and its purposes.\n\nSecond, he should go against the grain of the entrenched political culture of dynastic politics, sectionalism, favouritism, money politics, parasitism on the public payroll, cronyism and patronage. From the foregoing, it will not be out of place to give a brief of the possible contenders to the position of National Chairman of the APC. In recent weeks, names of former governors, ex-ministers and serving senators such as Tanko Al-Makura, Danjuma Goje, George Akume, Abdulaziz Yari, Mallam Saliu Mustapha, Abdullahi Adamu and Mohammed Sani Musa have been well pronounced as the likely successor to the former national chairman, Adams Oshiomhole.\n\nNo doubt, they are all eminently qualified and loyal to the party; one of the most unassuming contenders on everyone\u2019s lips is Senator Mohammed Sani Musa \u2013 the Senator representing Niger east in the 9th Senate. Senator Sani Musa can quickly become a credible and potentially winning candidate if he can mold a vision for the party which will eventually translate to the nation and the future that the people can believe in, Musa is a plausible alternative candidate because he has chalked up a long and creditable record of service in both private and public sectors, his performance especially in the legislature stands him high despite been in it for just a little more than two years. The exercise of power will not be foreign to him. Senator Sani Musa longtime student and observer of the Nigerian political space, he must have been learning the scheming skills a goal getter and researching more on what a candidate must bring to the office in order to succeed as a true party leader. It can well be said that this coming APC Congress will be an election about the future, not the past. Hence the real intentions of those seeking party and public office must be ideologically defined and promoted on the basis of shifting grounds from the status quo to a \u201cnew vision \u2013 new direction\u201d doctrine that Senator Musa so believed in.\n\nConviction politics needed\n\nDespite APC seeking a consensus to the emergence of a new Chairman, conviction politics should be the main drive; the party need someone that will campaign based on his own fundamental values or ideas rather than attempting to represent an existing consensus or simply take positions that are popular in polls. And from various analysis it is keen to mention that only a thorough-breed new political actor can best be described to fit in to this category and from all indications Senator Sani Musa is on this radar. There are a number of arguments for conviction politics of Senator Musa.\n\nOne is that he is seen to be more honest to be accepted by the various interest and groups that form the APC; he is a politician that simply say what he believe rather than shading his opinions to be more palatable to his audience. Another is that he is always voicing strong opinions, push public debate forward and promote a genuine discussion of political issues. Even if he lose, he will have promoted his particular political ideas and persuaded some voters of his value. There are also more instrumental reasons why Sen. Musa is best for the party at this time. He is known to be forceful in arguing for his positions during deliberations and campaigns, he is a politician that many believe he will be more able to pursue the goals of transforming the party once in office. Also, proponents argue that a conviction politician like Sen. Musa is more likely to win.\n\nWhen he was a candidate to the Senate in 2011 for his Senatorial District, Sani Musa stated: \u201cAs usual and more often, our way of playing politics has been so cruelly, but for me one of the deepest connection I have with others is to disagree and agree, I do not shy away from speaking the truth and they know at least that I will tell the truth.\u201d While some strategists focus on positioning candidates on issue after issue, for Senator Musa he believes that most voters focus more on whether the candidate has integrity and character on the whole than mere propaganda, and this is the hallmark of demonstrating the conviction that he is a man that always take a stand, which is what the APC need most at this time. Pundits argued that coming APC leadership should position the party for big, bold changes, grounded in the central principles of the driver\u2019s ideology.\n\nThe party needs selfless, self-made and contented personality, who cannot be compromised easily with mouth watering offers, but a honourable decisive personality that will set policies for the party based on clear and firmly held principles and which many believe Senator Sani Musa can accomplish for the APC. A need for a new Political culture Reform of the political culture is another challenge APC next Chairman must address because Nigeria politics has been disfigured by practices and false values that have festered for many decades.\n\nPolitical culture is defined by the International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences as \u201cthe set of attitudes, beliefs and sentiments which give order and meaning to a political process, and which provide the underlying assumptions and rules that govern behavior in the political system.\u201d It encompasses both the political ideals and operating norms of a polity. Political culture is thus the manifestation in aggregate form of the psychological and subjective dimensions of politics. A political culture is the product of both the collective history of a political system and the life histories of the members of the system and thus it is rooted equally in public events and private experience.\n\nNigeria politics will never mature for as long as we are unwilling to end dynastic politics, reject cronyism and check money politics in our elections. Whoever happens to be the Chairman of APC will face a herculean task of fixing the mess that has shrouded the party just as it is same with PDP and all other political parties in Nigeria. Despite all the challenges that the APC is facing as a party and by extension as a nation, the unwavering desire of Sani Musa\u2019s \u201cnew vision new direction\u201d will truly bring back the trust and confidence of a new beginning which will be reassuring to the teaming APC party faithfuls nation wide.\n\nBakare, a public commentator and analyst, wrote from Abuja.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "As NiCAFE opens in Abuja\n\nBy Chioma Obinna\n\nAs the maiden edition of the Nigerian Conference of Applied and Field Epidemiology, NiCAFE, opened in Abuja, the Federal Government on Tuesday disclosed that Nigeria despite responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, the country is faced with increasing cases of multiple concurrent disease outbreaks.\n\nThe Minister of Health, Dr Osagie Ehanire who disclosed this in his opening address at the NiCAFE said in the last one month, the country has been responding to an outbreak of cholera across states, an increasing number of Lassa fever cases, monkeypox case reported in the US with travel history from Nigeria, as well as weekly reports of yellow fever and measles cases.\n\nEhanire who blamed the outbreak of diseases in Nigeria on the tropical climate in Nigeria, population density, high number of international travels and local movements among others added that, all these factors put Nigeria at of infectious disease outbreaks.\n\nHe said in the last five years, the federal government has prioritised measures to strengthen health security.\n\n\u201cFrom the establishment of the NCDC National Reference Laboratory in 2017, NCDC led the establishment of at least one molecular laboratory in every state in 2020. From the establishment of the National Public Health Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) in 2017, the NCDC has led the establishment of State Public Health EOCs across the country\n\n\u201cAdditionally, the Government of Nigeria through the Federal Ministry of Health and its agencies has become an active contributor to global science. We conducted the largest population-based HIV survey globally in 2019 and have continued to implement studies from that survey to strengthen our knowledge of the epidemiology of other vaccines preventable diseases.\n\n\u201cThe last one year, we have conducted population-based surveys for COVID-19 and published several papers describing our experience with the COVID-19 response and lessons that can be adopted in other countries. The Federal Government of Nigeria has continued to prioritise investments in health security.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on NiCAFE, the Minister said by organising scientific conferences such as the NiCAFE, the government not only recognise the unique situation the country is in with annual outbreaks but shows responsibility and leadership in developing measures to prevent, detect and respond to the outbreaks.\n\nCorroborating his views in his welcome address, the Director-General of the Nigeria Centre of Disease Control, NCDC, Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu noted that the COVID-19 pandemic has turned the lives of Nigerians upside down.\n\nNoting that Nigeria has had over 170,000 infections and more than 2,000 deaths, he expressed sadness that there is a possibility that the country is yet to see the worst of the pandemic.\n\nHe said the country is not only faced with a pandemic in Nigeria, but multiple concurrent disease outbreaks.\n\n\u201cIn the last one month alone, we have been responding to an increasing number of COVID-19 cases, an outbreak of cholera in several states, panic associated with the detection of a monkeypox case in the US with travel history from Nigeria.\n\n\u201cEvery week, we detect cases of yellow fever, Lassa fever, measles and other infectious diseases that are endemic in Nigeria. That is our reality \u2013 our tropical climate, population density, poor socio-economic factors leave us at risk of annual, multiple, concurrent disease outbreaks in Nigeria. Therefore, we must be one step ahead of these pathogens,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe said Nigeria must also think of the other public health challenges that lie ahead of the country as the population is growing at a rapid phase and will have an incredible impact on the health system.\n\n\u201cGlobally, there is a rise in antimicrobial resistance, and this will affect the prevention and management of infectious disease cases. We are also faced with increasing risks and prevalence of non-communicable diseases.\u201d\n\nIhekweazu said the last one year spent responding to the COVID-19 pandemic has presented the country with lessons from leadership and governance to building the laboratory systems and risk communications.\n\nStating that the lessons from COVID were a wakeup call, he said the NiCAFE will provide an opportunity for Nigerian experts and leaders to hear from eight exceptional plenary speakers who work at global, regional and country levels on various aspects of global health and health system strengthening.\n\n\u201cWe will also hear from the staff of NCDC, our field epidemiologists, public health professionals from across Nigeria and African countries on the work they do in contributing to national, regional and global health security.\n\nWe recognise that this is a difficult period where several colleagues are working extremely hard in response to an increasing number of COVID-19 cases. But, it is also important that we reflect on lessons learned so far, and think together on how we can strengthen our response to COVID-19 and other disease outbreaks, \u201che stated.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "The Consulate-General of Nigeria in New York says it is making arrangement to enrol Nigerians within its jurisdiction for the National Identification Number (NIN) in line with the directive from the Federal Government.\n\nThe Consul-General, Amb. Lot Egopija, stated at a hybrid Town Hall meeting held at Nigeria House in New York for Nigerian nationals within the jurisdiction.\n\nEgopija said the Consulate had received a directive from the headquarters (Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs) to enrol its nationals.\n\nThe Nigerian envoy said the Consulate would soon conclude arrangements with the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC).\n\nEgopija recalled that when he assumed office few months ago, he pledged to be having regular interactive sessions with Nigerians to get their feedback and to update them with developments at the Consulate.\n\nHe said that the Consulate had improved services in the areas of passport delivery, passport issuance and also in the processing of passport and visa documents.\n\n\u201cWe have been able to reduce the waiting hours and we have removed our nationals from the street. Before now, we used to have our nationals loitering around the building.\n\n\u201cBut we have created a holding room to accommodate our nationals and give them a new lease of life whereby they feel they belong to Nigeria House.\n\n\u201cWe have also improved our consular services in the area of dissemination of information through upgrading our website and making it more friendly.\n\n\u201cAlso, we have opened a WhatsApp platform to disseminate information to all the members of associations registered with the Consulate to ensure timely communication,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nEgopija said the Consulate was working with Nigeria Immigration Services (NIS) to get sufficient passport booklets to meet the need of Nigerians within New York jurisdiction.\n\nHe said that the office had improved on its mailing services and was working with a telephone company to reconfigure a direct phone line in a way that any Nigerian could call and be answered immediately.\n\nThe Nigerian envoy explained that the Consulate would embark on cultural diplomacy aimed at promoting Nigeria\u2019s image by organising cultural shows, saying \u201cwe need to export our culture\u201d.\n\nOn trade and investment, Egopija said he was in talks with the New York Chamber of Commerce and would be extending it to other Chambers of Commerce in the U.S. to boost trade relations between Nigeria and the host country.\n\n\u201cNigerians deserve the best from us and we will give Nigerians the best always,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe Permanent Representative of Nigeria to the UN, Prof. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, said it was important to interact with the compatriots to better inform them on efforts being made to serve them better and to get feedback from them.\n\n\u201cAnytime any agency deliberately sets out to improve its services, it should be commended and I\u2019m happy to participate in this interactive session,\u201d he said.\n\nSimilarly, a Nigerian community leader, Mr Francis James, commended the Consul-General for his achievements in just three months in office especially the transformation he had carried out to effect positive changes.\n\n\u201cWhen we see opportunities for change, we must work together and give who wants to truly make this change happen an opportunity to deliver.\n\n\u201cI have seen tremendous improvements over the last three months much more than we have seen over the last five years. Ambassador Lot is a man of his words.\n\n\u201cHe realised that in order to serve better, he needed to engage with relevant stakeholders and he started by engaging some representatives of Nigerian communities led by the Organisation for the Advancement of Nigerians,\u2019\u2019 the official said.\n\nJames also commended the Consul-General for fixing the problems of Nigerians loitering around in Nigeria House.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not taking these achievements for granted because Egopija can stay for five years and not do anything. I\u2019m happy to tell Nigerians we have the opportunity to turn things around.\n\n\u201cWe want what is happening in New York to be replicated in our other missions globally.\n\n\u201cDialogue produces better and lasting solutions than protests,\u2019\u2019 he said.

          "text": "The Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, HURIWA, has alleged that the attack on Enugu community by armed Fulani herdsmen has given the impression that the destruction of the Eastern Security Network (ESN) by President Muhammadu Buhari was a systematic plot to expose the region to herders attacks.\n\nThe Sunday night\u2019s attack reportedly saw the gruesome deaths of many Igbo farmers in Uzo-Uwani Local Government Council of the state.\n\nAccording to the rights group, the killings of farmers and destruction of farmlands and properties, which was curbed by the emergence of ESN, have now restarted after the Buhari government colluded with governors in the region to destroy the security network.\n\nThe group noted that it was more worrisome that the recent incident in Enugu and that of Ebonyi State, in which over 50 lives of Igbo villagers were lost, are coming few months after the clampdown and crushing of members of ESN across the south eastern states.\n\n\u201cThey, alongside hordes of cattle, invaded farmlands making a mess of the crops planted by the poor village farmers. Sadly, in most cases, these killer herdsmen even violently attack and kill the farmers if they have the gut to question them,\u201d HURIWA noted.\n\n\u201cThese evil activities took place in all parts of the South East: from Abia to Imo; from Anambra to Enugu and Ebonyi states respectively. The people were crying especially in the face of the emphasis the Federal Government places on agriculture. None of the herdsmen was reported to have been arrested and persecuted by the law enforcement agencies. Yet, the evil acts continued unabated.\n\n\u201cHURIWA as a media affiliated Civil Rights body, has been concerned about this and we have followed lamentations and reports of what the rural farmers went through before the advent of the embattled ESN.\n\n\u201cWe cried out when the Ozuitem community in Bende area of Abia State was invaded and attacked by the herdsmen and nobody did anything. People were slaughtered and properties destroyed. A month later, another community in the same Abia State, Ndi Okereke Abam in Arochukwu council, was equally attacked by the herdsmen. Nothing was done.\n\n\u201cIn the early hours of April 6, 2019, the herdsmen attacked farmers\u2019 settlement in Anambra West Council of Anambra State. They burnt farm houses, killed the men and raped the women they captured, yet nobody came to their rescue.\n\n\u201cCould the youths have kept beating about the bush while their people were being taken to slaughter houses day after day? What about the dastardly attack on Umuawa-Ibu community in Okigwe council area of Imo State. In all these cases, HURIWA cried to high heavens, petitioned here and there, and complained everywhere, yet the authorities never bothered.\n\n\u201cThe internal outcry over these atrocities became deafening. Reportedly also, these herdsmen also butchered a whole family and a Catholic seminarian on apostolic work in Nkanu.\n\n\u201cThe story is the same in Ebonyi and Imo States. In Imo State, armed Fulani herders reportedly unleashed terror in Oguta, Ohaji-Egbema and Orlu as well as other parts of Igbo land.\n\n\u201cThe killing of Ozoemena Iriaka from Umuekpu in Agwa community in the same Oguta council area was added to the list of casualties of these murderous herdsmen.\n\n\u201cFor almost a decade, people of south east endured the agony of murder, rape and molestation in the hands of killer herdsmen; a minority group that appears to be \u2018sacred cows\u2019 because they control all state apparatus and hence are unleashing violence on the people.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the rights group said that the international community has rated these herdsmen as the fourth deadliest terror group in the world but the Nigerian government has refused to speak.\n\nCompared to the Eastern Security Network, HURIWA stated that the Ebubeagu Security Network of the South-East Governors has failed in its entirety to address the security challenges in the Southeast zone rather has compromised the security of the Igbo Nation States.\n\nThe rights group stated that the Ebubeagu Security Network from realities on ground only exists on the pages of newspapers as their operatives and operations can\u2019t be found in any community of the south eastern states.\n\n\u201cUnlike their counterparts from the West who have made effort to combat terrorism in their territory through Amotekun, we wonder why governors of the Southeast have allowed themselves to become fragmented for fear of displeasing their masters.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately too, some of the Igbo political leaders have allowed themselves to be cajoled and intimidated to the point where they now deny their own identity.\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly, the unending assault on the nation\u2019s grundnorm by the institution which has the onus to promote and protect it, has rendered Nigeria as a lawless state.\n\n\u201cAny national or state government that fails to protect its people through national security apparatus has created a lacuna for the latter to seek self-defense as an alternative to reliance on government security outfits.\u201d\n\nRecall that the ESN was recently accused of carrying out various deadly attacks, including the destruction of Imo prison and police headquarters in Owerri, the state capital.",
          "summary": "The Sunday night\u2019s attack reportedly saw the gruesome deaths of many Igbo farmers in Uzo-Uwani Local Government Council of the state.\nSadly, in most cases, these killer herdsmen even violently attack and kill the farmers if they have the gut to question them,\u201d HURIWA noted.\n\u201cIn the early hours of April 6, 2019, the herdsmen attacked farmers\u2019 settlement in Anambra West Council of Anambra State.\nWhat about the dastardly attack on Umuawa-Ibu community in Okigwe council area of Imo State.\nIn Imo State, armed Fulani herders reportedly unleashed terror in Oguta, Ohaji-Egbema and Orlu as well as other parts of Igbo land.",

          "text": "Sunday Adeyemo (Igboho), standing trial in the Benin Republic has told the court that he fled Nigeria to avoid being killed.\n\nThe Yoruba Nation agitator, who was arrested on July 19 with his wife while attempting to travel to Germany, has been charged with illegal entry into the Benin Republic.\n\nHe is also explaining his mission in Cotonou, the Benin Republic capital.\n\nThe court ruled that he should be relocated to prison from police custody.\n\nIgboho\u2019s lawyer, David Ibrahim Salami, told The Nation in Cotonou what transpired at the Benin Court of Appeal on Monday where the agitator appeared before three judges.\n\nHe was in court from 7:30 am till about midnight.\n\nSalami, a Professor of Law in a Beninoise University, said: \u201cWhile defending himself on the criminal allegations put on his head by Nigeria, Igboho told the judges that he had never been tried for any crime in his life.\u201d\n\nAccording to Salami, Igboho said he had neither been invited to any police station nor any formal charges brought against him as a result of his agitation for the separation of Yoruba nation from Nigeria.\n\nHe explained that he was only trying to free \u2018his people\u2019 from the atrocities of killer-herdsmen, which made him incur the wrath of some powerful individuals in government.\n\n\u201cWhen the judge asked him how and when he entered the Benin Republic, who housed him and who took him to the airport, Igboho told the court that his coming to the Benin Republic was to flee from his traducers who wanted to kill him in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cHe stressed that he spent less than one day in Cotonou before attempting to travel to Germany,\u201d Salami added.\n\nThe lawyer spoke further: \u201cWhat amazed me is the fact that the judge was explicit that Igboho\u2019s continued detention is not as a result of his issues with Nigeria, that he is being sent to prison because of infractions committed here in the Benin Republic.\u201d\n\nSalami said Igboho was sent to prison to allow investigation into how he came into Cotonou and why.\n\nSalami said no date had been fixed for the continuation of trial because the authorities would need time to investigate how Igboho entered the country.\n\nHe said Benin Republic law allows Igboho to be admitted to bail pending the outcome of the investigation.\n\nOn why the trial is behind the curtain, he added that it is when investigations are concluded that the judgment can be read in the open court.\n\nIgboho, according to the lawyer, showed discomfort as a result of bruises he suffered when the Department of State Services (DSS) attacked his residence on July 1.\n\nAs a result, Igboho was allowed to sit throughout Monday\u2019s court sessions instead of standing before the judges.\n\nAs a prison inmate, he will be entitled to medical services if there is a need, unlike when he was in police custody.\n\nSalami said Igboho\u2019s trial, which began from an extradition request from the Nigerian authorities, is now centred solely on whether or not he broke the laws of the Benin Republic.\n\nThe primary task now is to establish whether the embattled activist entered Cotonou through legal or illegal routes, and what his mission was meant to achieve, the lawyer said.\n\nSalami said the Nigerian authority had not filed any papers against Igboho.\n\n\u201cWe have also not seen any written complaints from Nigeria being placed before the court. It is a case between the Benin Republic and Sunday Igboho \u2013 nothing more,\u201d he explained.\n\nExplaining why Monday\u2019s proceeding was prolonged, Salami said it needed to be so because the trial is being handled by three judges whose functions and powers are different but complementary: prosecution judge, investigative judge, and judge of liberty or detention.\n\nHe said the matter before the prosecution judge office did not commence until 2 pm. Reason: the enormity of tasks the prosecutor\u2019s office needed to handle. The trial then moved to the investigative judge by 3 pm, lasting till around 6pm.\n\nIt was the judge of liberty or detention, who took over from his investigative colleague at night that ruled that more time is needed for the court to establish the true reasons behind Igboho\u2019s coming to the Benin Republic.\n\nLike hundreds of Igboho\u2019s supporters who came to show solidarity on Monday, his wife, Ropo was also in court.\n\nThroughout the day, she was seen entering and coming out of the special room where her husband was kept in the court. She had earlier been released and her German passport released to her.",

          "title": "2023: Abia Charter of Equity should be respected \u2013 Eze Kalu Ogbu, Abiriba monarch",
          "text": "By Vincent Kalu\n\nThe Enachioken of Abiriba Kingdom, Eze Kalu Kalu Ogbu, has called on Abia State politicians to respect the Abia Charter of Equity, signed by the founding fathers of the state on power rotation.\n\nIn an interview with Daily Sun, the monarch, who would be called to the Nigerian bar today, said, the challenges of the throne drove him to be well-adjusted and prepared for the present and the future.\n\nHow do you feel being called to the bar?\n\nI am indeed very happy to be called to the Nigerian bar. It\u2019s an honour. I give God all the glory.\n\nWhat informed your going back to school at this stage?\n\nA combination of factors led me into this academic pursuit. These include my love for education and my quest to be well informed in order to serve my people better and more effectively. Again, the challenges of the throne drove me to be well-adjusted and prepared for the present and the future.\n\nHow were you able to combine the enormous responsibilities/challenges of ruling Abiriba and the rigours of academic work?\n\nCoping was not easy at all. The challenges were enormous. But I succeeded due to my vision, dedication and hard work.\n\nAgain, my lieutenants were very helpful. They supported me in no small measure. I\u2019m grateful to HRH Eze Uche Benjamin Agu (Effa of Agboji-Abiriba), HRH Eze Eme Uguru Ikpoka (Ukpaghiri of Amogudu-Abiriba), HRH Eze Ukiwe Otisi Ukiwe (Alioke of Ihungwu \u2013 Abiriba) and all the 17 village heads of Abiriba Kingdom. They and others too numerous to mention here were very helpful each time I left the kingdom for school activities. I\u2019m eternally grateful to all of them. They are part of this success story.\n\nI also acknowledge God\u2019s grace and the support and motivation by Chief Leslie Ebueme Ezikpe (Dike Eji Ejemba of Abiriba) and Chief Jackson Agbai Abbah (Kukunda of Abiriba).\n\nWhat next, are you going into private practice or the bench?\n\nI am going into practice. I intend to contribute my quota in the area of human rights and alternative dispute resolution (ADR).\n\nMeanwhile, I will not stop in my quest for further education. I have already been admitted to pursue my master\u2019s degree in law (LLM) in Abia State University, Uturu.\n\nWith this new feat, what more should Abiriba expect?\n\nAbiriba people are also part of this story. They should expect more informed decisions from the palace in furtherance of our over 500 years\u2019 administration of justice system. They should expect more purposeful and God-fearing leadership in the kingdom.\n\nAbout 11 years ago, Abiriba was embroiled in a tussle for the throne; how were you able to unite all parties for the progress of the community?\n\nI take no glory in what is happening now in Abiriba. We as a people return all the glory to the Most High God. He is our God and we trust him always.\n\nThere was a time Abiriba indigenes had a good percentage of industries in Aba. What are your plans to make Abiriba people think home towards industrializing the community so that, if a state were created, your people would not find their investments in another state that may not be friendly to them?\n\nWe recall with nostalgia the glorious years of industrialisation in Abia State championed by Abiriba people. In spite of the current challenges, we still have a crop of young entrepreneurs that are prepared to continue the legacies.\n\nTo bring some of these industries back home to improve the economic fortunes of the kingdom is a work in progress. The discussion is on the front burners of current issues in Abiriba and we believe that something more visible will be seen in this direction.\n\nAmong its neighbouring communities, Abiriba seems to be the only community whose rich cultural heritage and traditional values have not been very much eroded. Why?\n\nIt\u2019s very true that we have held to our cultural heritage and traditional values for more than 500 years. Within this period, it has been a running battle with modernity in various ways.\n\nHowever, we have sustained these values through the instrumentality of two major institutional frame works, to wit: Age grade system and the matrilineal system. Today, unfortunately, these two systems are under intense attack by enemies of the kingdom, within and outside. It\u2019s indeed the last fight and we shall conquer. But a lot of work is required for us to maintain a sustainable tradition and custom in the kingdom.\n\nWhy is Abiriba nicknamed, \u2018Small London\u2019?\n\nThe name, \u2018Small London\u2019 was given to us by the Great Zik of Africa, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe (Owelle of Onitsha). This happened in the 1950s, when he visited Abiriba on a campaign trail. He was pressed and requested to ease himself. He was shown a convenience room. When he got there, to his surprise, it was a water cistern.\n\nHe immediately recalled that it was only in London that he had seen a similar cistern. In awe, for seeing such in a place like Abiriba at the time, he openly called Abiriba \u2018Small London\u2019. This is the thread of history behind the name.\n\nWhat is it that makes Abiriba people successful in every endeavour, especially in trade and commerce?\n\nAbiriba is a kingdom of great entrepreneurs. It\u2019s really in our DNA.\n\nBy 1752, Abiriba as a people had already developed a guild of blacksmiths. They were known to have produced several implements like hoes, knives and machetes. This was achieved through the \u2018Nkuma Asaa of Abiriba Kingdom.\n\nSince then, Abiriba people have produced several entrepreneurs in all areas of trade and commerce. This entrepreneurial spirit from our forebears is at the root of our success stories. And it is sustained by the guild system, the age grade system and mentorship scheme introduced by our fathers. This combination has remained effective in sustaining the success stories in this regard.\n\nAre you not worried over the security in the country, and what is your solution to the problem?\n\nThe security challenges in the country are a bad omen. I have made my position known in a number of fora. The government needs to step up in this direction. To start with, they need to be proactive in dealing with security issues in the country. Secondly, violent criminals and terrorists should be called what they are to be treated accordingly. There is no need in giving them baptismal names of bandits, herdsmen or unknown gunmen.\n\nThen again, it is very helpful and important that the President and leaders of the country should not be speaking from both sides of the mouth. Finally, I suggest to the Nigerian government that this is a time for dialogue and not the time of acting tough. Let us jaw-jaw, instead of war-war.\n\nThere is said to be Abia Charter of Equity on rotation of governorship in the state. For 2023, which area should produce the governor?\n\nAbia State is built on a strong and sustainable foundation of equity. Anybody that has the love of the state at heart must not be seen to do anything that will touch on this foundation negatively. Our political class should be careful not to do anything that will directly or indirectly affect this foundation.\n\nThe Abia Charter of Equity has served us well and I therefore align my self with the position of many elder statesmen like Ezeogo Dr. Anagha Ezikpe.\n\nSince the inception of the current democratic dispensation, Abia State has been peaceful. The governorship position has rotated among the senatorial zones in an unwritten gentleman\u2019s agreement. This started with Abia North, then to Abia Central and finally Abia South.\n\nSince the three zones have taken their turns, it is important that it starts again from Abia North. This is the sensible thing to do for the enduring peace that have prevailed in the state to continue.\n\nI believe in our political class. They will not like to upset the peace in the state. They will do the right thing at the right time. God bless Abia State, the God\u2019s Own State.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nBenin Republic government has filed fresh charges, including illegal migration to the country, dubious connivance with immigration officers and attempt to cause civil unrest, against Yoruba nation agitator, Chief Sunday Adeyemo, also known as Sunday Igboho, before Palaise Du Justice, Court D\u2019Appal, in Cotonou.\n\nOne of the counsels to Igboho, Ibrahim Salami, made this known,yesterday, in an interview with British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) Yoruba service in Cotonou.\n\nSalami said the nine-man legal team that appeared before the court on Monday to defend Igboho were surprised that fresh charges were brought against him by the Beninese government, while the three charges from Nigeria were dropped.\n\n\u201cFirst, the judge ruled that Sunday Igboho entered into Benin Republic through an illegal means. They also want to investigate how Sunday Igboho conspired with others to enter Benin Republic through wrong means. They also want to know how long he has been in Benin Republic and his plans in the country. They also raised a charge on whether he wants to come and cause unrest or social disturbance in Benin Republic.\u201d\n\nSalami said trials in Beninese courts usually follow three stages. The first stage, he said, is with the prosecutor, who is a judge, while the second stage is with a judge that will investigate the case. The third stage, he said is with the judge that would determine whether the accused person should be put in prison custody or not pending the determination of the case.\n\nHe said the three initial allegations against Igboho that were argued at the first two stages of the trail bordered on gunrunning and stockpiling of arms to cause war in Nigeria, while the second allegation had to do with inciting people to destabilise Nigeria. The third allegation, he said, was based on purported moves by Igboho to break up Nigeria into two or three countries.\n\nSalami said it was a surprise to the legal team to note that other allegations were brought against Igboho at the third stage.\n\nHe said with the new development, Igboho now has a case with the government of Benin Republic, revealing that Nigeria neither filed any charge against Igboho, nor was it represented at the court proceedings on Monday in Cotonou.\n\nThe judge at the third stage, according to Salami, was the one that ruled that Igboho should be remanded in prison custody pending the conclusion of investigation into the fresh charges brought against him by Benin Republic.\n\nHe said the case against Igboho has not reached the final determination stage, as the legal team would have to go back to the judge at the second stage to know the adjournment date. Salami said the fresh allegations against Igboho are serious crimes in Benin Republic.\n\nHe said Igboho sustained injury when he jumped the perimeter fence of his house to escape the raid on his house on July 1, 2021, adding that the injury prevented him to stand up for a long time in the court on Monday. He said he was given a chair to sit on, while the trial was ongoing, and that he would require medical attention.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "title": "CBN stops $110m weekly forex sale to BDCs",
          "text": "By Uche Usim (Abuja), Adewale Sanyaolu and Chinwendu Obienyi\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria CBN Governor, Mr Godwin Emefiele, Tuesday disclosed that the $110million weekly allocation and sale of foreign exchange to Bureau De Change (BDC) operators in the country has stopped.\n\nThe Governor, who made the disclosure at a media briefing shortly after the July Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting of the bankin Abuja noted that the BDCs have become a fulcrum for corrupt Nigerians to launder money to wreck the economy.\n\nHe also described them as conduits for fraudsters to conduct illicit flows all to the detriment of the country.\n\nThe CBN boss also announced that the MPC chose to retain all policy parameters, including leaving the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) at 11.5 per cent; asymmetric corridor of +100/-700 basis points around the MPR; the CRR at 27.5 per cent; and Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent.\n\nOn ending forex supplies to BDCs, Emefiele said the apex bank can no longer fold its hands and allow their unwholesome practices to blossom.\n\n\u201cThey have turned themselves away from their objectives. They are now agents that facilitate graft and corruption in the country. \u201cWe cannot continue with the bad practices that are happening at the BDC market.\n\n\u201cSeveral international organisations, embassies patronise BDC through illegal forex dealers to fund their institutions.\n\n\u201cWe will deal ruthlessly with Nigerian banks that deal with illegal BDCs and we will report foreign organisations patronising them.\u201d\n\nEmefiele noted that there was evidence of prevailing ownership of several BDCs by the same promoters to procure multiple foreign exchange from the apex bank.\n\nHe added that the forex hitherto allocated to them will now be channeled to Deposit Money Banks (DMBs) to manage, warning banks not to hoard forex as customers have been asked to contact the CBN and report such illicit acts.\n\nEmefiele explained that bank customers who meet the criteria for forex should get it without delay, stressing that the move was not punitive but to ensure financial stability.\n\nReacting to the development, Nigeria\u2019s professor of the capital market, Prof Uche Uwaleke, told Daily Sun that the decision by the CBN to stop forex sales to BDCs has merits and demerits.\n\n\u201cI think it is in the best interest of the Nigerian economy.\n\n\u201cOn the positive side, it is consistent with the move by the CBN to unify Exchange rates and bring more transparency to the forex market. Exchange rate unification is in line with the IMF and World Bank\u2019s recommendations and so improves the country\u2019s profile and credit standing before International financial institutions. It signifies that the country is serious in her reform efforts.\n\n\u201cIt will slow down the rate of depletion in external reserves. The move is likely to check round tripping of forex and reduce supply of forex in the parallel market.\n\n\u201cFurther, speculative demand for forex is also likely to reduce. \u201cOn the flip side, this measure will wipe out the employment opportunities created in the sector with over 5000 BDCs with several others waiting to be licensed.\n\nThis action is probably counterproductive because the CBN may be underestimating the size of demand outside the official market and the policy change will do little to address the sharp disparity in the official and parallel market exchange rates. Whosoever is advising Emefiele and his cohorts are not doing a good job at all. We think this move is correcting a long-standing anomaly. BDCs are licensed to meet demand for personal and business travels and not for big-ticket items that should translate to demand of over $100 million a week.\n\nCommenting on the development, on television program yesterday, Head of Retail Investments at Chapel Hill Denham, Ayodeji Ebo, while reacting to the development on Channels TV said the decision of the CBN to bar BDCs will have some impact on the parallel market. He noted that the BDCs are a major player in the foreign exchange market and any decision of CBN will definitely impact them\n\nGovernor Emefiele noted that the CBN is the only central bank in the world that sells foreign exchange to BDCs. Some market operators also note that \u201cthere is nothing that BDCs do that banks cannot do better\u201d and that over 6,000 BDCs add little or no value to the market today.\n\nThat said, we also think financial markets will react to news and the announcement is expected to spark volatility in the parallel market for foreign exchange, more so because of the timing of the announcement. The move is coming in late July when demand for foreign exchange for personal travel and school fees is typically high.\n\nHe noted that the BDCs are a major player in the foreign exchange market and any decision of CBN will definitely impact them.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "By Chukwudi Nweje\n\nFounder and Chancellor of Afe Babalola University, Ado-Ekiti (ABUAD), Aare Afe Babalola, has said the way forward for Nigeria to remain an indivisible country is to adopt a brand new constitution founded on the principles of true federalism, with a parliamentary system of government and one chamber legislature before the 2023 general election.\n\nHe said the new constitution must also prioritise the multi-religious, multi-cultural, multi-linguistic nature of the country, in order to be more involving, even as a single chamber legislature would be less expensive to operate.\n\nBabalola said this in a goodwill message he delivered at the university during the 5th Ife Institute of Advanced Studies, Summer Institute Programme, on Monday, where he was special guest of honour.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is my considered view that a new constitution must be in place before the next election, otherwise we will be recycling the same failed leaders who have brought Nigeria to where it is today. The proposed constitution will spell out the number of political parties and percentage of women representation, among others. It will also enable knowledgeable, selfless, patriotic and non-tribalistic Nigerians to emerge as leaders and make governance less expensive.\n\n\u201cIn addition, it will discourage politics from being the most lucrative business in Nigeria. In considering this new constitution, priority attention must be accorded to the multi-religious, multi-cultural, multi-linguistic nature of the country made up of over 400 ethnic groups speaking over 295 dialects. Particular attention must be paid to the issue of poverty, reduction of population by limiting the number of children per couple. This will prevent the present untoward situation where the offer of a mere N5,000 could induce poor Nigerians to vote against the dictates of their conscience.\u201d\n\nThe senior lawyer also proposed the inclusion of specific clauses in the constitution to prevent those he described as \u2018transactional leaders\u2019 from getting into public offices, even as he said 60 percent of the membership of the unicameral parliament should consist of professional bodies, while the remaining 40 percent will be contested by Nigerians who met the constitutional requirement to contest for the office.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

Savi.ng was founded in 2018 by VFD Microfinance and currently has ten thousand plus downloads on Google Playstore. PiggyVest\u2019s android app on the other hand has got one million-plus downloads.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more of a team acquisition,\u201d PiggyVest co-founder, Joshua Chibueze, explained to TechCabal over a call.\n\nThe team behind Savi are reputed to have solid expertise in finance and are savvy with financial tools.

Last year, it paid back NGN90 billion ($220 million) to users which currently numbers up to 3 million.\n\nThe move also signals a positive trend for Africa\u2019s local startup ecosystem \u2013 that it is possible to build for the sole purpose of selling to a larger player in the same sector.\n\nPiggyVest did let TechCabal know that there are more acquisition announcements to come in the year.

          "text": "South African payments and software platform, Yoco, has secured $83 million in Series C funding, bringing the total funds raised to date by the startup to $107 million.\n\nThe company plans to deploy the funds to develop more tools that enable small micro and medium businesses (SMMEs) thrive in the digital economy. It also plans to expand beyond South Africa as the demand for digital payments among African small businesses grows.\n\n\u201cLooking ahead, this investment will unlock capacity for us to accelerate product development for our merchants and continue on our growth trajectory in South Africa and beyond,\u201d CEO Katlego Maphai said.\n\nThe latest round is the largest single investment raised by a payments company in South Africa and the largest ever by a small business-focused payments platform in the Middle East and Africa (MENA).\n\nThe Yoco founding team (L-R): Katlego Maphai (Chief Executive Officer), Carl Wazen (Chief Business Officer), Bradley Wattrus (Chief Financial Officer) and Lungisa Matshoba (Chief Technology Officer). Image credit: Yoco\n\nThe Yoco journey\n\nLaunched in 2015, Yoco was known initially for its portable card machines. Today, the company offers a wide array of financial services including online and in-store payments, business software, and capital to small business merchants.\n\nYoco\u2019s service offerings were needed to empower South Africa\u2019s payments ecosystem as millions of businesses lacked access to electronic payments, despite more than three-quarters of adult consumers carrying a card.\n\n\u201cWhen we started to plunge deeper into the problem, we found that traditional banks made it challenging and a privilege for businesses to get a card machine. Traditional POS systems come with high monthly and transaction fees and appeal to mainly the established business operation,\u201d Maphai told TechCabal.\n\nYoco was launched to lower these barriers and enable small businesses to thrive. \u201cOur expertise and efforts centre around driving financial inclusion and lowering the barriers of entry for our customers (small businesses),\u201d Maphai said.\n\nIn less than six years, Yoco has become the payments partner for over 150,000 small businesses across South Africa, processing more than $1 billion in card payments per year.\n\nThe company\u2019s growth has been driven almost exclusively by small, independent businesses that were previously cash-only.\n\nOpportunity for further growth\n\nAccording to Carl Wazen, Yoco\u2019s chief business officer, the company is still at the beginning of its journey despite being the largest payments platform in South Africa. This, he explained, is because there are over 6 million small businesses in South Africa and well over 100 million across the MENA region that still transact only in cash.\n\n\u201cRecent consumer behaviour shows a shift away from cash and businesses must rapidly adapt to this change. This presents a huge opportunity and it is our mission to support that transition,\u201d Wazen said.\n\nTo seize the opportunity, Yoco plans to deepen its operations in South Africa in addition to a pan-African expansion goal. The company is currently piloting its technologies in Mauritius with plans to add another country in the MENA region by the beginning of 2022.\n\n\u201cAs a relatively young company, we\u2019re intently focused on our immediate goals and objectives and on getting the basics like customer value and consistent delivery exactly right,\u201d Maphai said. \u201cBut we still have our eyes firmly fixed on our ambitious longer-term goal: expansion of our operation into a respected, truly pan-African brand.\u201d\n\nThe goal, according to Wazen, is to reach at least a million merchants within the next four years. Yoco aims to increase its team by 200 people within the coming year to support the growth plans.\n\nAlready, the startup has attracted top veterans to its executive ranks from companies such as Monzo, iZettle/Paypal, and Uber. A new Chairman has also been brought on board: Juan Fuentes, former Managing Director of Pagseguro, a business that he grew into a $19 billion payments giant in Brazil.\n\nThe Series C round included new investors such as Dragoneer Investment Group, which is making its Africa investment debut, after having previously backed fintech giants like Chime, Nubank, Mercado Libre, Square, and Klarna.\n\nAlso joining the round were Breyer Capital, HOF Capital, The Raba Partnership, 4DX Ventures, TO Ventures, and several current and former executives from global tech leaders such as Coinbase, Revolut, Spotify, and Gojek.\n\nExisting Yoco investors including Partech, Velocity Capital Fintech Ventures, Orange Ventures, and Quona Capital also took part in the round.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nMaphai is confident that this latest funding and Yoco\u2019s unique small business-focused approach, coupled with its depth of talent and now the backing of some of the world\u2019s leading investors, positions the digital payments platform on a springboard to significant and long term growth.\n\n\u201cWorking so closely with small businesses during a global pandemic, we have a first-hand account of how agile these businesses need to be in a rapidly changing world,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cRemoving barriers and levelling the playing field by creating access to financial tools is a big part of answering these challenges. This new capital injection translates into an acceleration of access for small businesses in our region and beyond, bringing our vision of open commerce forward.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "In the first half of this year, investments in African startups have risen back to pre-covid levels. While there\u2019s more excitement about big investment firms like Sequoia and Tiger Global who are making bold statements about their interest in Africa with their investments, some newer players are looking to take part in the action.\n\nOne of such players is Expert DOJO, a US-based early-stage fund that has decided to commit up to $5m to invest in African startups this year. It\u2019ll be making 20 to 50 new investments.\n\nSince the firm\u2019s first fund launched in 2018, Expert DOJO has invested in over 100 companies at pre-seed and seed stages across 30 countries. Some of these companies include Shipsi, Squadra and Woodpecker.\n\nExpert DOJO decided to focus more on Africa when it noticed that some of the strongest performers in its portfolio were from across Africa.\n\nSetting itself apart from other global accelerators, Expert DOJO has assembled an entire Africa-dedicated team plus cross-functional experts and Entrepreneurs in Residence (EIRs).\n\nIn addition to its new fund, the firm will dedicate an Africa-only cohort this September 2021 (currently accepting applications) to startups targeting the African market. Similar to the international cohort program, for this cohort, Expert DOJO, is looking to provide $100,000 in funding and a three-month virtual accelerator program.\n\nWhich startups qualify for this? Tech-enabled startups with a proven and scalable product. These startups also must have their main operations based in Africa and generate at least $5,000 monthly recurring revenue.\n\nStarNews Mobile, a mobile video network for Africa, is one of the first African startups Expert DOJO invested in. It currently has over 10m mobile subscribers across Africa and has secured content partnerships with Universal and Sony Music distribution as well as marketing partnerships with Pan-African mobile operators MTN, Orange, and Moov.\n\nHow was Expert DOJO helpful to StarNews Mobile? \u201cThey helped with introducing us to service providers like Accountant, legal counsel and digital marketing. They also provided strategic advice,\u201d Guy Kamgaing, the company\u2019s CEO, said.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t necessarily looking for investment in 2019 when Expert DOJO invested. But the turning point for him was when he realized that apart from money, Expert DOJO had a support network and were focused on understanding Africa better.\n\n\u201cOver the years,\u201d Kamgaing said, \u201cExpert DOJO has been consistent in terms of their interest and commitment to African companies.\u201d\n\nBrian Mac Mahon (Expert DOJO) and Guy Kamgaing (StarNews)\n\nFor Brian Mac Machon, the founder of Expert DOJO, they were motivated by the success of startups like StarNews to invest further in Africa.\n\n\u201cOne commonality we\u2019ve seen throughout our Africa portfolio is these founders\u2019 focus on growth from day one, with extraordinary resilience, grit, and most importantly, results. We\u2019ve witnessed these startups take the tools and resources provided in the DOJO accelerator and scale at super speed, well beyond industry standards,\u201d Mac Machon said.\n\nWhat\u2019s different about Expert DOJO?\n\n65% of DOJO\u2019s portfolio companies are women or minority-led. \u201cWith a valuation of $32M and the third most active startup accelerator in the United States, Expert DOJO aims to close the global inequities in venture capital funding: \u201cWe\u2019re investing in founders who represent the diverse society we live in, and not just the privileged Silicon Valley elite,\u201d Mac Mahon said.\n\nAnother of Expert DOJO\u2019s notable investments is Klasha, a female-led Nigerian fintech startup.\n\nJess Anuna, CEO of Klasha shared her DOJO experience by saying that DOJO works relentlessly to secure funding for their startups and ensure they\u2019re being introduced to the right investors that will help their company scale, invest in future rounds, and strategically align with their company\u2019s needs.\u201d\n\nFor startups that go through Expert DOJO\u2019s acceleration program the support received goes beyond the three months. Victoria Mehran, an Investment associate at Expert Dojo explained this saying, \u201cWe\u2019re committed to supporting them for life. We are hopping on growth strategy calls with all our founders. Brian is on the phone with founders from 5 am to 11 pm and same thing with other members of the team.\u201d\n\nExpert Dojo\u2019s inaugural Africa cohort is only the beginning of its plans in Africa. The hope is that they will start an Africa-only fund in the near future.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Investors in the round include Breyer Capital, HOF Capital, 4DX Ventures, Partech, Orange Ventures, Velocity Capital Fintech Ventures, Quona Capital, and first time investors, Dragoneer Investment Group.\n\nFounded in 2013 by Bradley Wattrus, Carl Wazen, Katlego Maphai, and Lungisa Matshoba, the startup digitises payment for South African businesses, most of whom still receive cash payments. It currently has about 150,000 businesses using its services to collect payments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore this round, the startup had raised a $3m Series A and a $16m Series B in 2017 and 2018, respectively.\n\nYoco began by providing offline payment options before gradually rolling out an online payment offering accelerated by the coronavirus pandemic last year.\n\nYoco\u2019s Series C round is one of the largest by an African fintech startup and puts it behind only Flutterwave and Chipper Cash \u2014 for now.

While it is a grocery delivery startup, the company\u2019s operations differ slightly from most businesses in its space. After users sign up on the platform, a delivery box is installed at their doorstep and orders are delivered between midnight and 6 a.m. the next day. This way, users have no contact with those who make the delivery.\n\nEgyptian startups have seen increased funding activities this year having already surpassed the $190m raised by startups in the country in 2020.\n\nFor GoodsMart, this fresh funding signifies that investors see the potential of grocery delivery startups in Africa, with most of the activities in the sector so far focused on European and American startups.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more: Egyptian grocery delivery startup, GoodsMart raises $3.6 million for country-wide expansion.\n\nJulaya\u2019s pre-series A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJulaya team.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJulaya, a fintech startup based in France and Ivory Coast is today announcing the raise of its $2 million pre-series A round. Investors that participated in this round include Orange Ventures, MFS Africa Frontiers, Saviu Ventures, Launch Africa Ventures, 50 Partners Capital and angel investors from Africa and Europe.\n\nJulaya was founded in 2018 by Mathias L\u00e9opoldie and Charles Talbot who had both worked at French payment fintech startup, LemonWay. The startup which operates in the B2B payments sector seeks to leverage the wide coverage of telecom operators to offer payment options to businesses.\n\nTo achieve this, the startup provides African businesses and public institutions with an online platform to disburse payments to mobile money and mobile banking wallets and counts eCommerce giant, Jumia as one of its clients.\n\nExplaining the motivation behind founding the startup, co-founder and CEO, Mathias L\u00e9opoldie, said, \u201cHaving worked in the nascent mobile money industry, we realized that the large consumer penetration of telecom operators would benefit businesses that wanted to reach the unbanked and make fast payments. Our platform Julaya enables companies to streamline their accounting. They improve their operational efficiency by digitizing their payments to workers and suppliers.\u201d\n\nHabib Bamba, Director of Transformation, Digital and Media at Orange C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, explains the reason behind this investment for Orange Ventures: \u201cFintech\u2019s environment in Africa is distinguished by its competitiveness and strong dynamism. Orange Group, through its technology investment fund, intends to participate in this boom by supporting fintechs such as Julaya.\n\n\u201cThe goal is to target local technology champions at the service of the transition to a more digital and responsible world. This funding will allow Julaya to grow and conquer West Africa with Orange Digital Center team\u2019s support.\u201d\n\nOn a call with Techpoint Africa, L\u00e9opoldie reveals that unlike other fintech payment startups, they are only focused on outbound payments rather than paying and receiving funds with no plans to process B2C payments in the future. The startup makes money by charging a fee for every transaction on the platform.\n\nCurrently, the startup has 50 corporate customers and processes about $1.5 million monthly. According to the startup, the funds raised will be used to expand their market share in Ivory Coast and West Africa, launch new digital payment products, and expand their team.\n\nL\u00e9opoldie lists the fragmented nature of payments, regulation, and human resources as some of the challenges the startup has faced since inception. With this fresh injection of capital, the startup plans to expand across West Africa beginning with Senegal.\n\nAcross the world, fintech startups are courted by investors and Africa has not been left out with fintech startups responsible for a huge chunk of the funding that comes to the continent. In spite of the number of players currently in the sector, the fact that 66% of Africans are unbanked means that there is a large market for anyone bold enough to throw their hat in the ring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Inside details of how Glencore employees bribed Nigerian officials over NNPC oil contracts",
          "text": "Details have emerged of how a former United Kingdom-based trader for Glencore Plc, Anthony Stimler, bribed officials in Nigeria in exchange for favourable contracts from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC.\n\nCourt documents obtained exclusively by PREMIUM TIMES show that Mr Stimler, acting through subsidiaries of Glencore, conspired with others to make millions of U.S. dollars in corrupt bribe payments to officials in Nigeria.\n\nThe former trader pleaded guilty over what prosecutors in the United States described as his role in a scheme to bribe.\n\nA Bloomberg report said that Mr Stimler admitted to conspiring to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and commit money laundering at a hearing in Manhattan federal court conducted by video.\n\nProsecutors said millions of dollars in bribes were paid to officials in Nigeria, in exchange for NNPC awarding oil contracts and providing \u201cmore lucrative grades of oil on more favorable delivery terms.\u201d\n\nBribery Scheme\n\nProsecutors alleged that in Nigeria, in exchange for the bribes, officials caused the Nigerian state-owned and state-controlled oil company (NNPC) to award oil contracts and to provide more lucrative grades of oil on more favorable delivery terms to Glencore, two wholly-owned subsidiaries of the company, and their business partners.\n\nAside conspiring with others to make millions of U.S. dollars in corrupt bribe payments to officials in Nigeria and elsewhere, prosecutors added that Mr Stimler conspired to obtain and retain business for and to direct business to Glencore and its subsidiaries.\n\nDetails showed that in furtherance of, and to promote the corrupt bribery scheme, Mr Stimler and others conspired to transmit the bribe payments from Switzerland to and through the United States, and from the United States to other countries, particularly Nigeria.\n\nProsecutors alleged that the manner and means by which Mr Stimler and his co-conspirators sought to accomplish the purpose of the conspiracy included, among others, using and paying inflated and fraudulent invoices submitted to the company and its subsidiaries by intermediaries to disguise the nature and purpose of bribe payments made to government officials, which payments were made in order to obtain and retain business and to obtain business advantages for Glencore and its subsidiaries.\n\nCo-conspirators\n\nAlthough the court papers did not name the co-conspirators, and none of them was charged, it referred to seven of such individuals and companies from several countries in the bribery scheme, which prosecutors said ran from 2007 to 2018.\n\nOne of the parties listed in the alleged scheme was tagged \u201cIntermediary Company 1\u201d, a Nigerian company used by Glencore and its subsidiaries to allegedly pay bribes to Nigerian officials in order to obtain Nigeria oil cargoes from NNPC. The intermediary company contracted directly with Glencore from in or around 2007 until in or around 2011, and with one of its subsidiaries from in or around 2011 until in or around 2014.\n\nThe second \u201cIntermediary Company\u201d was a Cyprus-incorporated entity used by the subsidiaries to pay bribes to Nigerian officials in order to obtain Nigeria oil cargoes from NNPC. This other intermediary company is said to have an affiliated company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands which used the same name as the Cypriot company.\n\nThe first alleged individual co-conspirator referenced in the court papers was a Nigerian and U.K. citizen and a resident of Nigeria and the United Kingdom. He is said to be the owner and principal employee of the first intermediary company.\n\nThe second co-conspirator was a United Kingdom citizen and resident, a trader at one of the subsidiaries from in or around March 1993 until in or around December 2009, and a consultant from in or around January 2010 until in or around December 2012 and again from in or around April 2015 until in or around March 2017. He also acted on behalf of the company in procuring crude oil from Nigeria.\n\nThe third co-conspirator was a United Kingdom citizen and resident, and a trader at the second subsidiary from in or around July 2011 until in or around August 2019. The fourth, according to court papers, was a citizen of Mexico and Spain, and a trader at the second subsidiary company of Glencore from in or around July 2009 until in or around October 2012.\n\nThe fifth was a United Kingdom citizen and resident, a risk manager at one of the subsidiary companies starting in or around April 2009, and, since in or around 2013. The sixth co-conspirator was a French citizen and resident, and was employed by the British Virgin Islands affiliate of the second intermediary company. The seventh co-conspirator, however, was an Israeli citizen and resident, and was employed by the second intermediary company of Glencore.\n\nMr Stimler himself is a United Kingdom citizen and resident. He was a trader who worked on the West Africa desk of Glencore from in or around 2002 until in or around 2009 and then again from in or around June 2011 until in or around August 2019. In that role, he had responsibility for crude oil purchases from, among other places, Nigeria, and acted on behalf of Glencore in procuring crude oil from Nigeria.\n\nThe only Nigerian official referenced in the court papers is said to be \u201ca high-ranking Nigerian government official from in or around 2010 until in or around 2015\u201d.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAllegations\n\nThe court documents showed that from at least in or around 2007 up to and including in or around 2018, in the Southern District of New York and elsewhere, Mr Stimler and others willfully and knowingly did combine, conspire, confederate, and agree together and with each other to commit offenses against the United States, in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d).\n\nThe officials were said to have willfully and corruptly made use of the mails and a means and instrumentality of interstate commerce to act in furtherance of an offer, payment, promise to pay, and authorization of the payment of money.\n\nThey were also alleged to have offered, gifted, promised to give, and authorized the giving of a thing of value to a foreign official, and to a person, while knowing that all and a portion of such money and thing of value would be and had been offered, given, and promised, directly and indirectly, to a foreign official, for purposes of influencing, inducing and seeking improper advantage.\n\nIn effect, Mr Stimler and the co-conspirators were alleged to have used coded language, including references to \u201cnewspapers\u201d in discussing bribe payments to foreign officials in Nigeria and elsewhere. There was also an email exchange between Mr Stimler and other conspirators, discussing the need for a \u201cfiling,\u201d a coded reference to a bribe payment to Nigerian officials.\n\nIn or around December 2013, Mr Stimler was said to have agreed with three other co-conspirators to more than triple the fees paid to an intermediary company for certain transactions for the purpose of paying bribes to an NNPC official in order to obtain favorable dates and grades of oil.\n\nIn or around March 2014, the defendant equally requested and received approval for a subsidiary of Glencore to make a $500,000 payment to the first intermediary company, intending for one of the co-conspirators to pass on a portion of the payment to an official in Nigeria to assist Glencore and the subsidiaries in obtaining business advantages, including eligibility to purchase oil cargoes from the NNPC.\n\nOn or about September 25, 2014, one of the co-conspirators allegedly sent an email to Mr Stimler advising that the Nigerian official had stated that \u201call the customers of NNPC are giving in advance [$300,000] each month/cargo plus a certain amount which varies at the moment\u201d in connection with a then-upcoming political election.\n\nBy October 3, 2014, in response to the information communicated, Mr Stimler caused a subsidiary to send a wire transfer of approximately $300,000 from the subsidiary\u2019s bank account in Switzerland, through a bank in the Southern District of New York, to the intermediary Company\u2019s bank account in Cyprus.\n\nBy October 5, 2014, Mr Stimler allegedly sent an email to two of the co-conspirators wherein he stated, in substance and in part, that the subsidiary company\u2019s management had approved the payment and wrote, \u201c[S]o please please make sure on your side, NNPC perform[s] . . . .\u201d\n\nOn or about April 20, 2015, while in the United States, Mr Stimler also received an email in which the sixth co-conspirator offered to pay a bribe to a Nigerian official of approximately $50,000 per oil cargo for four cargoes of NNPC oil to be delivered in May and June 2015. By April 20, 2015, while in the United States, the defendant replied to the email, expressing interest in one of the June 2015 NNPC oil cargoes. By May 5, 2015, he would receive an invoice from the second intermediary company for $50,000 as an \u201cAdvance Payment\u201d against the June cargo discussed. On or about May 5, 2015, Mr Stimler thereafter caused the subsidiary company to pay the second intermediary company\u2019s invoice through a wire transfer of approximately $50,000 from a bank account in Switzerland, through a bank in the Southern District of New York, to the intermediary company\u2019s bank account in Cyprus.\n\nIn the second count, prosecutors accused the defendant of conspiracy to commit money laundering, among other offences.\n\nMeanwhile, prosecutors argued that as a result of committing the offense alleged, Mr Stimler shall forfeit to the United States \u201cpursuant to Title 18, United States Code, Section 981(a)(1)(C) and Title 28, United States Code, Section 2461(c), any and all property, real and personal, which constitutes or is derived from proceeds traceable to the commission of said offense, including but not limited to a sum of money in United States currency representing the amount of proceeds traceable to the commission of said offense.\u201d\n\nThey argued further that if any of the assets had either been sold, deposited with a third party, or diminished in value, it is the intent of the United States to seek forfeiture of any other property of the defendant up to the value of the forfeitable property described in the forfeiture allegation.\n\nGlencore speaks, NNPC silent\n\nThere hasn\u2019t been any reaction from the Nigerian government or the NNPC since the allegations became public Monday.\n\nThe spokesperson of Nigeria\u2019s state-owned oil company, NNPC, Kennie Obateru, did not return a phone call as of press time Wednesday morning.\n\nHowever, in a statement issued on Monday, Glencore Plc, described Mr Stimler\u2019s plea as unacceptable, adding that \u201cthe conduct has no place in Glencore.\u201d\n\n\u201cGlencore has cooperated fully with the department of justice and other authorities in their investigations and continues to do so,\u201d it said. \u201cGlencore has taken a number of remedial measures in light of what it has learned during the investigation. Glencore has significantly enhanced its ethics and compliance programme over the last few years with a view to developing a best in class programme.\u201d\n\nEarlier in March, former Glencore oil trader Emilio Jose Heredia Collado pleaded guilty in San Francisco to manipulating a key oil price benchmark.\n\nThe Justice Department has been investigating Glencore\u2019s business dealings in Nigeria, Venezuela and the Democratic Republic of Congo. U.K. and Swiss authorities have also been examining possible corruption involving Glencore, and various governments have investigated other large oil traders.",
          "summary": "The former trader pleaded guilty over what prosecutors in the United States described as his role in a scheme to bribe.\nThis other intermediary company is said to have an affiliated company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands which used the same name as the Cypriot company.\nThe seventh co-conspirator, however, was an Israeli citizen and resident, and was employed by the second intermediary company of Glencore.\nGlencore speaks, NNPC silentThere hasn\u2019t been any reaction from the Nigerian government or the NNPC since the allegations became public Monday.\nThe spokesperson of Nigeria\u2019s state-owned oil company, NNPC, Kennie Obateru, did not return a phone call as of press time Wednesday morning.",

They are not smugglers. We are praying this committee to look into the matter deeply to see how customs can perform their functions so that it won\u2019t affect the people and all the surrounding towns.\n\n\u201cWe do not know how the officers were performing their duty that the smuggled goods crossed almost 50 towns before coming to Iseyin, about 200 kilometres from the border.\n\n\u201cWe want compensation for the deceased because they have dependents, we pray this committee to help us ensure those affected are compensated.\u201d\n\nUmar Lawal, assistant legal adviser of NCS, however, denied the allegation, saying its officers only averted a mob action.\n\n\u201cMen of the NCS are not supposed to be interrupted when performing their duty by virtue of the law; in the event that ensued while they were conveying the seizure, the mob tried to attack the officers on the road,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cLooking at what was going on, the officers swiftly shot into the air to disperse the mob and successfully dispersed the mob and conveyed the seizure to their base at Iseyin.\n\n\u201cHaving arrived at the based, a marmot crowd arrived at the base wherein two officers were caught by the mob and injured and they were taken to a hospital in Ibadan and were referred to Lagos for treatment.\n\n\u201cSo the leader of the base made a call and contacted the Nigerian army for help. Before the arrival of the army, the mob disposes one of the injured officers of his riffle.\n\n\u201cWhen the soldiers arrived, they work with the officers on the ground, recovered the rifle and restored calm in the area. The mob was armed with cutlasses, sticks and were pelting the officers with stones, and inflicted machete cuts on the officers; nobody was killed by men of the NCS, there was no incident of killing\u201d.\n\nNot satisfied by Lawal\u2019s explanation, the committee accused the officers of negligence.\n\nLeke Abejide, chairman of the committee, ruled that custom\u2019s area controller and the deputy controller enforcement appear before the lawmakers to offer more explanation on the killings.",

The fundamental issue is the question of the extent to which APC leaders and members are responding to challenges. Are we taking responsibility? The good thing is that, in APC, leaders are not in denial of the challenges.

Beyond questions of sustainability, there is the issue of public awareness and the associated challenges of public support and endorsements.\n\n\u201cIt is not enough for government to initiate programmes and projects as responses to challenges facing the country.

          "text": "A 23-year-old bricklayer, Adebayo Kingsley, who said he hails from Ibillo in Akoko-Edo Local Government Area of Edo State, has allegedly killed his 46-year-old lover, a widow and mother of four, Rosemary Ifeoma, popularly called Mama Samuel from Orogun in Ughelli North Local Government Area of Delta State.\n\nHe was said to have hit the lady with a plank and had carnal knowledge of her thereafter.\n\nHe was earlier accused of hitting the head of her 13 years old boy and then pounced on the woman, thinking the son was dead.\n\nConfirming the incident on Tuesday, Police Public Relations Officer, Edo State Command, Kontongs Bello, said the suspect would be charged to court once investigations are concluded.\n\nThe incident happened in Darlington Ogbeifun Street, off Ogbekan Village Road, Ugbor in Oredo Local Government Area.\n\nEyewitness\u2019 account\n\nA resident in the area, who simply gave his name as Peter, said: \u201cThis woman we popularly called Mama Samuel was a widow with four children and the last one, who is 13 years, stays with her.\n\n\u201cShe was having difficulties paying her rent and then approached a woman in the area whose brother was building a storey building that has been roofed, to allow her stay there pending when she can raise money from her business to get a new accommodation.\n\n\u201cShe had a lover, who is a bricklayer, that was coming to see her and people around here know them.\n\n\u201cIt was early in the morning on July 16 that her 13 years old son, after regaining consciousness from his confrontation with the suspect in the night, ran to inform neibghours of what has happened.\n\n\u201cHe was rushed to the hospital for treatment and later narrated the story of how the suspected attacked them.\n\n\u201cHe led others to the place where the suspect was working and immediately he sighted the boy, he took to his heels until he was pursued and arrested by the police.\u201d\n\nConfession\n\nWhen confronted, the suspect confessed to the crime but said he did not hit the victims with a log.\n\nRather, he said, in the course of an argument with the woman, \u201cshe wanted me to help her with cement to do a caravan.\n\n\u201cBut when we did not agree on how to do it, she said I should leave her house. I actually left but missed my way and strayed back to the house.\n\n\u201cBut by this time, they had locked the gate, so I jumped into the compound through the fence and entered their room.\n\n\u201cHis son threatened to stab me, went into the room and came back with a knife. I rushed at him and pushed him.\n\n\u201cHe hit his head on the wall and collapsed. The woman then came after me and held me, but in trying to push her away, she fell and hit her head on the ground and blood was coming from her head.\n\n\u201cI quickly took the boy to the room and put him on the bed and then left. I did not hit anybody with log and I did not sleep with the woman.\u201d Vanguard\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "A 23-year-old bricklayer, Adebayo Kingsley, who said he hails from Ibillo in Akoko-Edo Local Government Area of Edo State, has allegedly killed his 46-year-old lover, a widow and mother of four, Rosemary Ifeoma, popularly called Mama Samuel from Orogun in Ughelli North Local Government Area of Delta State.\n\nHe was said to have hit the lady with a plank and had carnal knowledge of her thereafter.\n\nHe was earlier accused of hitting the head of her 13 years old boy and then pounced on the woman, thinking the son was dead.\n\nConfirming the incident on Tuesday, Police Public Relations Officer, Edo State Command, Kontongs Bello, said the suspect would be charged to court once investigations are concluded.\n\nThe incident happened in Darlington Ogbeifun Street, off Ogbekan Village Road, Ugbor in Oredo Local Government Area.\n\nEyewitness\u2019 account\n\nA resident in the area, who simply gave his name as Peter, said: \u201cThis woman we popularly called Mama Samuel was a widow with four children and the last one, who is 13 years, stays with her.\n\n\u201cShe was having difficulties paying her rent and then approached a woman in the area whose brother was building a storey building that has been roofed, to allow her stay there pending when she can raise money from her business to get a new accommodation.\n\n\u201cShe had a lover, who is a bricklayer, that was coming to see her and people around here know them.\n\n\u201cIt was early in the morning on July 16 that her 13 years old son, after regaining consciousness from his confrontation with the suspect in the night, ran to inform neibghours of what has happened.\n\n\u201cHe was rushed to the hospital for treatment and later narrated the story of how the suspected attacked them.\n\n\u201cHe led others to the place where the suspect was working and immediately he sighted the boy, he took to his heels until he was pursued and arrested by the police.\u201d\n\nConfession\n\nWhen confronted, the suspect confessed to the crime but said he did not hit the victims with a log.\n\nRather, he said, in the course of an argument with the woman, \u201cshe wanted me to help her with cement to do a caravan.\n\n\u201cBut when we did not agree on how to do it, she said I should leave her house. I actually left but missed my way and strayed back to the house.\n\n\u201cBut by this time, they had locked the gate, so I jumped into the compound through the fence and entered their room.\n\n\u201cHis son threatened to stab me, went into the room and came back with a knife. I rushed at him and pushed him.\n\n\u201cHe hit his head on the wall and collapsed. The woman then came after me and held me, but in trying to push her away, she fell and hit her head on the ground and blood was coming from her head.\n\n\u201cI quickly took the boy to the room and put him on the bed and then left. I did not hit anybody with log and I did not sleep with the woman.\u201d Vanguard\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "Ibrahim Salami, the lawyer to Sunday Igboho has revealed what the Yoruba Nation agitator told the Benin appeal court in a session that lasted up til midnight on Monday.\n\nIgboho told the court that he fled Nigeria to avoid being killed, his lawyer revealed to a correspondent of The Nation.\n\nIgboho also explained his mission in Cotonou.\n\nSalami, a Professor of Law in a Beninoise University, said: \u201cWhile defending himself on the criminal allegations put on his head by Nigeria, Igboho told the judges that he had never been tried for any crime in his life.\u201d\n\nIgboho said he had neither been invited to any police station nor any formal charges brought against him as a result of his agitation for the separation of Yoruba nation from Nigeria.\n\nHe explained that he was only trying to free \u2018his people\u2019 from the atrocities of killer-herdsmen, which made him incur the wrath of some powerful individuals in government.\n\n\u201cWhen the judge asked him how and when he entered the Benin Republic, who housed him and who took him to the airport, Igboho told the court that his coming to the Benin Republic was to flee from his traducers who wanted to kill him in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cHe stressed that he spent less than one day in Cotonou before attempting to travel to Germany,\u201d Salami added.\n\n\u201cWhat amazed me is the fact that the judge was explicit that Igboho\u2019s continued detention is not as a result of his issues with Nigeria, that he is being sent to prison because of infractions committed here in the Benin Republic.\u201d\n\nSalami said Igboho was sent to prison to allow investigation into how he came into Cotonou and why.\n\nSalami said no date had been fixed for the continuation of trial because the authorities would need time to investigate how Igboho entered the country.\n\nHe said Benin Republic law allows Igboho to be admitted to bail pending the outcome of the investigation.\n\nOn why the trial is behind the curtain, he said it is when investigations are concluded that the judgment can be read in the open court.\n\nSalami said Igboho\u2019s trial, which began from an extradition request from the Nigerian authorities, is now centred solely on whether or not he broke the laws of the Benin Republic.\n\nThe primary task now is to establish whether the embattled activist entered Cotonou through legal or illegal routes, and what his mission was meant to achieve, the lawyer said.\n\nSalami said the Nigerian authorities have not filed any papers against Igboho.\n\n\u201cWe have also not seen any written complaints from Nigeria being placed before the court. It is a case between the Benin Republic and Sunday Igboho \u2013 nothing more,\u201d he explained.\n\nExplaining why Monday\u2019s proceeding was prolonged, Salami said it needed to be so because the trial is being handled by three judges whose functions and powers are different but complementary: prosecution judge, investigative judge, and judge of liberty or detention.\n\nHe said the matter before the prosecution judge office did not commence until 2 pm. Reason: the enormity of tasks the prosecutor\u2019s office needed to handle. The trial then moved to the investigative judge by 3 pm, lasting till around 6pm.\n\nIt was the judge of liberty or detention, who took over from his investigative colleague at night that ruled that more time is needed for the court to establish the true reasons behind Igboho\u2019s coming to the Benin Republic.",

          "title": "{ICYMI) \u2018It is sacrilegious for Afenifere to compare Igboho to Prophet Muhammad\u2019",
          "text": "The Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC), has demanded unreserved apology from Afenifere, the Yoruba socio-cultural group, for comparing Sunday Adeyemo, a.k.a Igboho, to Prophet Muhammad.\n\nAfenifere had compared Igboho\u2019s current travail in Benin Republic to that of Prophet Muhammad in Madinah.\n\nIn a press release issued by the director of MURIC, Prof. Ishaq Akintola, the human rights group said Afenifere\u2019s statement was not only sacrilegious but outrageous and audacious.\n\nMURIC advised Afenifere to compare Igboho to any of the Yoruba heroes if they must idolise him.\n\nAccording to the statement, the Yoruba socio-cultural group, Afenifere, has compared Sunday Adeyemo, a.k.a. Igboho, to Prophet Muhammad.\n\n\u201cThis is totally unacceptable. It is not only sacrilegious but outrageous and audacious. Afenifere has manifested categorical desertification of discernibly coupled with an alarming height of tramadolised hero-worshipping. It is provocative, preposterous, repugnant and nauseating.\n\n\u201cThe circumstances surrounding the migration of Prophet Muhammad in 622 C.E. to Madinah differ a lot from those that sent Igboho to Benin Republic in July 2021. Muhammad was invited to Madinah by the Madinese whereas Igboho was not invited by the people of Cotonou. Muhammad was a prophet of God, Igboho is not. Muhammad\u2019s constituency is the whole world while Igboho\u2019s activities are restricted to South Western Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt was therefore an exercise in excessive exaggeration for Afenifere to have compared Igboho to a universal prophet whose followers in their billions spread across all the continents and countries of the world. This, to say the least, is an attempt to diminish the immense popularity of Prophet Muhammad, whittle down the influence of Islam on the world as a whole and trivialise the essence of the Abrahamic faiths.\n\n\u201cWe remind the supporters and fans of Igboho to be wary of the antics of Afenifere. They should note that a thick fog of mystery still covers the travails of the great Chief Obafemi Awolowo and Alhaji Moshood Kashimowo Abiola. We are not sure that the hands of Afenifere are clean in both matters of these great sons of Oduduwa. They should not allow the same Afenifere to goad Igboho into oblivion,\u201d the statement said.\n\nMURIC added that Igboho is not to blame in this blasphemous matter, as he never compared himself to any prophet.\n\nIt added: \u201cTherefore, MURIC has nothing against him. Our problem is Afenifere. People should not give labels that are above Igboho to him. Afenifere did not stop at comparing Igboho to Muhammad. It also compared him to Moses (Prophet Musa, peace be upon him). Moses was a prophet of God for crying out loud. But is Igboho a prophet?\n\n\u201cWhat does Afenifere want to turn Igboho to? Another prophet? Afenifere\u2019s goal is to exert influence on Igboho and to gain total control of him. Afenifere should leave Igboho alone. It should stop playing politics with the young man\u2019s life.\n\n\u201cIf Afenifere is so desperate to compare Igboho to a great personality, the Yoruba socio-cultural group should pick any of the heroes of the Yoruba people. Or is Afenifere no longer proud of Yoruba heroes? We know that the Yoruba people parade a host of great men and women. Why not compare him to one of them? Why raise this young man to the clouds without any pillar to support his feet?\n\n\u201cOgedengbe Agbogungboro of Ijeshaland, Timi Agbale Olofa Ina of Ede, Bashorun Ogunmola and Ibikunle of Ibadan, Sango and Gbonka in Oyo are all Yoruba heroes. Why couldn\u2019t Afenifere pick one of them? None of them were armchair heroes. They were highly mobile, always on the move. Even the female among them, Moremi Ajasoro of Ile-Ife, (Olowo Aremo, Abowo gboogbo ti yo omo re lofin). Why did Afenifere look down on Yoruba heroes and by-passed them to pick a faraway prophet of God from Arabia? Is it inferiority complex?\u201d\n\nAccording to MURIC, \u201cthis is a bitter lesson for Yoruba Muslims who have swallowed the Yoruba nation propaganda hook, line and sinker. We told you before that Afenifere has no respect for Muslims. You have entered \u2018one chance\u2019. They opposed our civil shariah, stigmatised our hijab and shunned our Islamic banking. Afenifere has never deemed it fit to intervene in any of the cases of persecution faced by Yoruba Muslims.\n\n\u201cJust as Yoruba Muslims are not given any special recognition in Yorubaland, just as their daughters, their wives and their mothers are treated with contempt and publicly humiliated in schools, hospitals and public offices, their prophet, the Seal of all prophets, the greatest man that ever lived, Muhammad the son of Abdullah, is now being denigrated.\n\n\u201cIt is just a taste of the pudding. This is just a tiny fraction of what awaits Yoruba Muslims in an Oduduwa republic. MURIC calls on all Yoruba Muslims who are supporting the Yoruba nation agenda to retrace their steps with immediate effect if indeed they believe in Allah and in Prophet Muhammad as the last prophet. We will not follow those who deride our prophet.\n\n\u201cNo true Muslim will do that. They know the eschatological consequences. Any Muslim who fails to withdraw his support for the Oduduwa Republic campaign after Afenifere insulted Prophet Muhammad will be held accountable by Allah yaom al-Qiyamah (on the Day of Judgement). This is not a fatwah. Rather, it is a fundamental teaching of Islam that Muslims must withdraw their support from those who malign their faith.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that Sahara Reporters, the media house which published Afenifere\u2019s blasphemous statement, has apologised. We take its apology in good faith. Sahara Reporters has shown respect for the sensibilities of Nigerian Muslims. It now behoves Afenifere to follow the footsteps of the media house by tendering its own apology. We will soon know whether or not Afenifere has any scintilla of respect for Yoruba Muslims, nay, Nigerian Muslims.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the interest of peaceful coexistence and mutual cooperation, and on behalf of the teeming population of Nigerian Muslims, we hereby demand unreserved apology from Afenifere for denigrating the person of Prophet Muhammad whom Muslims throughout the world hold in high esteem.\u201d",

          "text": "Barely 24 hours after kidnapping the paramount ruler of Jaba Chiefdom, Kpop Ham, Jonathan Gyet Maude in Jaba local government area of Kaduna state, his abductors have demanded N100 million as ransom for his release.\n\nA close family source who spoke under anonymity, said the kidnappers made the demand Tuesday through a telephone call with a family member of the embattled first class traditional ruler.\n\nThe monarch is believed to be the oldest traditional ruler across Northern Nigeria.\n\nHe was abducted Monday at about 2pm by gunmen suspected to be kidnappers while working on his farm located at Gitata, a border community between Kaduna and Nasarawa states.\n\nHowever, it was gathered that the 83-year-old royal father went to the farm along with his driver and security guard.\n\nBut the source said the kidnappers allowed the driver and the guard to leave while kidnapping the monarch.\n\nEl-Rufai parleys Sule\n\nMeanwhile, Governor Nasir El-Rufai has said the state government was collaborating with the Nasarawa state government and security agencies from the two states to rescue the paramount ruler.\n\nSpeaking when he led some government and security officials to the palace of the Kpop Ham in Jaba Chiefdom Tuesday, the governor who was represented by the state commissioner for internal security and home affairs, Samuel Aruwan, assured the people of the chiefdom that the government of the two states would do everything possible to ensure the speedy rescue of the first class traditional ruler, especially considering his age and fragile health.\n\nOn his part, a leader in the community and a former senator, Zico Azeez, appealed to both the government and security agencies to intensify efforts to ensure the safe return of their chief whose abduction, he said, had created a big vacuum in the palace and the entire Jaba local government area.\n\nDPO, 6 bandits die in attack\n\nIn a related development, the Imo state Police Command has confirmed the death of CSP Fatmann Dooiyor, a Divisional Police Officer (DPO) in an attack on Omuma, the hometown of Governor Hope Uzodimma in Oru East local government area of the state.\n\nThe command also said six bandits died in the gun duel with the police.\n\nPolice Commissioner Abutu Yaro confirmed the incident in a statement signed Tuesday by the command\u2019s spokesperson, Micheal Abattam.\n\nYaro said police operatives repelled the attack and killed six of the bandits while 11 others were arrested.\n\nHe further said tactical teams of the command had been mobilised to comb the communities in the area to arrest the fleeing bandits.\n\n\u201cOn 26/7/2021 at about 16:20 hours, bandits in convoy of three vehicles were repelled in Omuma town in Oru East LGA of Imo State.\n\n\u201cAccording to the Area Commander, ACP Benjamin Abang of Omuma Area Command, the bandits were sighted moving in convoy into Omuma town.\n\n\u201cThe area commander immediately alerted the tactical teams of the command who swung into action.\n\n\u201cThey (teams) ambushed and launched a surprise attack on the convoy of the bandits which resulted in the neutralizing of six of the bandits, while 11 of them were arrested.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the Divisional Police Officer, CSP Fatmann Dooiyor, paid the supreme price.\n\n\u201cThe teams recovered the three vehicles abandoned by the bandits, including two Toyota Highlander SUV vehicles with registration numbers Abia MBL517AT and LAGOS JJJ984EL.\n\n\u201cPresently, the command\u2019s tactical teams and Special Forces led by ACP Evans Shem are combing the bush for possible arrest of the bandits that fled into the bush,\u2019\u2019 the commissioner said.\n\nYaro warned bandits with penchant for sporadic incursion from neighbouring states to keep off the state or face dire consequences.\n\nNine travellers abducted along Sokoto-Gusau road\u2019\n\nAlso, the police in Zamfara state Tuesday said nine travellers were abducted along the Sokoto-Gusau road Sunday, and not 60 as widely reported.\n\nSpokesman of the command, Muhammad Shehu, stated this in a statement Tuesday in Gusau.\n\nIt said: \u201cOn Sunday 25th July, 2021, a large number of armed bandits blocked a Toyota Bus Vehicle belonging to Sokoto State Mass Transit and abducted eleven (11) passengers who were travelling from Sokoto \u2013 Abuja along Sokoto \u2013 Gusau Road in Bakura LGA.\n\n\u201cPolice Tactical operatives attached to Operation Restore Peace were alerted, and they quickly mobilized to the location and dislodged the hoodlums who blocked many vehicles for abduction.\n\n\u201cThe road was instantly cleared for motorists and other road users and reinforced by more police operatives to improve the security and safety of the commuters.\n\n\u201cIn the course of mopping up the scene, a Toyota Bus Vehicle belonging to Sokoto State Mass Transit was sighted empty and it was revealed that eleven (11) passengers including the

          "text": "Tunisia lurched further into political uncertainty Wednesday, as President Kais Saied sacked more officials, days after he suspended parliament and assumed executive powers in what opponents labelled a \u201ccoup\u201d.\n\nKey civil society groups warned against any \u201cillegitimate\u201d extension of Saied\u2019s 30-day suspension of parliament, and demanded in a joint statement a timeline for political action.\n\nAfter suspending parliament and sacking Hichem Mechichi as prime minister on Sunday, dismissing the defense and justice ministers on Monday, Saied then issued orders dismissing a series of top officials.\n\nLate Tuesday, 63-year-old Saied, a former law lecturer who was a political newcomer when he won a landslide 2019 election victory, issued decrees sacking a long list of senior government officials, including the army\u2019s chief prosecutor.\n\nHe has also lifted the parliamentary immunity of lawmakers, and assumed judicial powers.\n\nSaied says his actions are justified under the constitution, which allows the head of state to take unspecified exceptional measures in the event of an \u201cimminent threat\u201d.\n\nPolitical, economic, health crises\n\nThe moderate Islamist Ennahdha party, which was the largest faction in the coalition government, has labelled the power grab a \u201ccoup d\u2019etat\u201d, while the US, EU, and other powers have voiced strong concern.\n\nOn top of the political turmoil, the North African nation is struggling with a crippling economic crisis including soaring inflation and high unemployment, as well as surging Covid-19 infections.\n\nTunisians are waiting anxiously for clarity on the next political steps.\n\nSaied, an austere legal academic who has said he is determined to revolutionise the political system through the law, said he would assume executive power \u201cwith the help\u201d of a government whose new chief he would appoint himself.\n\nNames of possible candidates circulated Wednesday after Saied met with representatives of national organisations late Monday.\n\n\u201cPresident Saied will be very careful in choosing the future head of government because he wants a trustworthy and loyal person who would adopt the same policies as him,\u201d said political scientist Slaheddine Jourchi.\n\nThe young democracy had often been cited as the sole success story of the Arab Spring, the tumult sparked across the region after Mohamed Bouazizi, a Tunisian university graduate who could only find work as a fruit vendor set himself on fire in December 2010.\n\nBut, a decade on, many in the nation of 12 million people say they have seen little improvement in living standards, and have grown infuriated by protracted political deadlock with infighting among the elite.\n\nThe ousted government had also been criticised for its handling of the Covid pandemic. Tunisia has one of the world\u2019s highest official per-capita death tolls.\n\n\u2018A great challenge\u2019\n\n\u201cPresident Saied is faced with a great challenge: to show Tunisians and the world that he made the right decisions,\u201d added Jourchi.\n\nAfter violent clashes outside the army-blockaded parliament on Monday, the Ennahdha party said \u201corganised thugs\u201d were being used to \u201cprovoke bloodshed and chaos\u201d.\n\nIt urged its supporters \u201cto go home in the interests of maintaining the peace and security of our nation\u201d.\n\nOn Tuesday Ennahdha said that, \u201cfor the sake of the democratic path,\u201d it is \u201cready to go to early legislative and presidential elections\u201d while demanding \u201cthat any delay is not used as a pretext to maintain an autocratic regime.\u201d\n\nNoureddine B\u2019Hiri, a senior Ennahdha leader, said the party had \u201cdecided to campaign peacefully to defeat\u201d the president\u2019s plans.\n\nBut before any elections, \u201cparliament should resume its activities and the military end its control,\u201d B\u2019Hiri told AFP.\n\nIn the 10 years since Tunisia\u2019s popular revolution toppled dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, Tunisia has had nine governments.\n\nSome have lasted just months, hindering the reforms needed to revamp the country\u2019s struggling economy and poor public services.\n\n-AFP",

Her dream to stand at the pinnacle, with the rising sun on her heart, was not to be,\u201d reported Sports Hochi, a Japanese daily sports newspaper.\n\nThe stock of Japanese tennis racket maker Yonex, one of her major corporate sponsors, plunged Tuesday, just as she lost to former French Open finalist Marketa Vondrousova of the Czech Republic 6-1, 6-4 in the third round. The stock recouped some of the losses but ended down 1.8%.\n\nThe disappointment came just four days after Osaka left the nation teary-eyed by running up a Mount Fuji-like set at the National Stadium and lighting the Olympic cauldron with her torch to open the Olympics.\n\nFor many here, the Japan-born Osaka, whose father is Haitian, has grown to personify a ray of hope for diversity in a nation long linked with discrimination and intolerance for differences. \u201cUndoubtedly the greatest athletic achievement and honor I will ever have in my life,\u201d Osaka had written on Instagram about her role in her first Olympics. Some Japanese said it broke their hearts to imagine how much Osaka had wanted to win the gold for her country. \u201cShe has her principles about her pride for Japan, and playing for Japan, while also being proud of her diverse roots in having a Haitian father and living in the U.S.,\u201d said lawyer Atusko Nishiyama, who was already starting to worry Osaka might get attacked for her loss. Nishiyama said she had been impressed by Osaka\u2019s statements on Black Lives Matter, such as last year when she wore masks bearing names of black people who had been killed. \u201cCompared to her courage, it is so sad some people are still at a very low level,\u201d Nishiyama said. While news reports speculated whether it hurt her not to play for two months and referred to how Osaka had talked about her bouts with depression and then sat out Wimbledon, Japan\u2019s response was overwhelmingly one of doting love.",

          "text": "The White House is strongly considering requiring federal employees to show proof they\u2019ve been vaccinated against the coronavirus or otherwise submit to regular testing and wear a mask \u2014 a potentially major shift in policy that reflects growing concerns about the spread of the more infectious delta variant.\n\nThe possible vaccine mandate for federal employees \u2014 regardless of the rate of transmission in their area \u2014 is one option under consideration by the Biden administration, according to a person familiar with the plans who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss deliberations that have yet to be made public. The White House is expected to announce its final decision after completing a policy review this week.\n\nAccording to an analysis from the federal Office of Management and Budget, in 2020 there were more than 4.2 million federal workers nationwide, including those in the military.\n\nPresident Joe Biden suggested Tuesday that expanding that mandate to the entire federal workforce was \u201cunder consideration,\u201d but offered no further details. The Department of Veterans Affairs on Monday became the first federal agency to require vaccinations, for its health workers.\n\nThe broader requirement under consideration would be the most significant shift by the Biden administration this week as the White House grapples with a surge in coronavirus cases and hospitalizations nationwide driven by the spread of the delta variant and breakthrough infections among vaccinated Americans.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reversed its masking guidelines and said that all Americans living in areas with substantial or high coronavirus transmission rates should wear masks indoors, regardless of their vaccination status.\n\nAnd just like that, masks were back at the White House.\n\nBy Tuesday afternoon, when the latest CDC data found that Washington, D.C., is facing substantial rates of transmission, White House staff were asked to begin wearing masks indoors starting Wednesday. Press were asked to follow suit, and those staff and reporters remaining in the White House were already masking up.\n\nAn aide for Vice President Kamala Harris passed out masks to the reporters covering her events earlier that day, asking them to put them on before walking in to her meeting with Native American leaders on voting rights.\n\nMasks will also be required again at the U.S. House.\n\nCiting the new CDC guidance, the Capitol\u2019s Attending Physician Brian P. Monahan issued a memo late Tuesday reinstating the mask requirement for all individuals, vaccinated and not, when entering the House chamber or other interior spaces in the complex when others are present. Fines that had been established under previous House rules can be imposed for offenders, though exceptions will be allowed when lawmakers are recognized to speak during proceedings.\n\nFor the Senate, with far fewer members, the masks are being recommended but not required for the chamber and other indoor spaces.\n\n\u201cAll individuals should wear a well-fitted, medical-grade filtration mask,\u201d Monahan wrote in a similar letter obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nBiden dismissed concerns that the new masking guidance from the CDC could create confusion among Americans, saying those who remain unvaccinated are the ones who are \u201csowing enormous confusion.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe more we learn, the more we learn about this virus and the delta variation, the more we have to be worried and concerned. And there\u2019s only one thing we know for sure \u2014 if those other 100 million people got vaccinated, we\u2019d be in a very different world,\u201d he told reporters after speaking to intelligence community employees at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence on Tuesday.\n\nBut the whiplash on masking and vaccinations \u2014 just the day before, White House press secretary Jen Psaki had avoided questions over why the administration had yet to require vaccines for federal workers \u2014 reflects the uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus.\n\nVarious state and local governments, private companies, hospital administrators and universities across the nation have reverted to indoor mask mandates and instituted vaccine mandates in recent months, but just 60% of American adults have been completely vaccinated, and the latest wave of the coronavirus is hitting those communities with low vaccination rates particularly hard. The nation is averaging more than 57,000 cases a day and 24,000 COVID-19 hospitalizations.\n\nBut the Biden administration had thus far avoided embracing a vaccine mandate for its own employees \u2014 in part because officials are wary of further politicizing an already fraught issue by coming down too hard on the side of vaccine mandates.\n\nPsaki acknowledged Tuesday that administration officials are aware of the risk that Biden\u2019s support for vaccine mandates could harden opposition to vaccines among his detractors.\n\n\u201cThe president certainly recognizes that he is not always the right voice to every community about the benefits of getting vaccinated, which is why we have invested as much as we have in local voices and empowering local, trusted voices,\u201d she said.",

          "text": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revised upward its growth forecast for the Nigerian economy in 2022 by 0.3 per cent to 2.6 per cent compared to its earlier projection in its April edition while it retained its growth forecast for 2021.\n\nDivision Chief, Research Department, IMF, Malhar Nabar, revealed the growth projections while responding to a THISDAY question, during a virtual media briefing on the World Economic Outlook (WEO) on Tuesday.\n\nSpeaking on the theme of the WEO, \u201cFault Lines Widen in the Global Recovery,\u201d he stated that the reemergence of fuel subsidy and rise in security was hindering growth.\n\nAccording to Nabar, \u201cIn terms of our forecast for Nigeria this year, we have maintained an unchanged forecast of 2.5 per cent and we have upgraded slightly for 2022 to 2.6 per cent. The reason for the unchanged forecast for this year is because it is a product of opposing developments. We saw activities as elsewhere respond a lot stronger than what we expected earlier in the year.\u201d\n\n\u201cLooking out ahead, we think that up take in cases in the rest of the continent is going to pose a downside risk factor and is going to drag on growth going forward.\n\n\u201cIn terms of our upgrade in 2022, it is related to the improvements in terms of trade, the oil production we expect to increase going forward would lift growth for 2022. It is also predicated on continued in external financial conditions which recently have been very supportive of growth and it important that continues in order for this growth forecast to pan out.\u201d\n\nHe further noted the recent access to its emergency financing facilities was able to relieve some of Nigeria\u2019s foreign exchange (FX) liquidity problems.\n\nHe added: \u201cNigeria has been a beneficiary of our IMF funding; it has accessed our emergency financing facilities last year and that is also contributing to this outlook by alleviating some of the liquidity needs the Nigerian economy face.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, on emerging market economies, the report projected fiscal deficit for 2021 is 7.1 per cent of GDP which is 0.5 percentage point smaller than in the April 2021 WEO.\n\nOn Nigeria, the report states: \u201cIn low income developing countries, the overall fiscal deficit in 2021 was revised up by 0.3 percentage points from the April 2021 WEO, mainly because of the reemergence of fuel subsidies as well as the additional COVID-19 and security related support in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cStill, at 5.2 percent of GDP, the overall fiscal deficit remains well below that of advanced and emerging market economies, reflecting financing constraints about 60 percent of Low income and developing countries (LIDCs) are assessed to be at high risk of or in debt distress. The public debt-to-GDP ratio for 2021 is projected at 48.5 percent. Several LIDCs have announced an intention to restructure their debts and some have sought debt relief under the G20 Common Framework (Chad, Ethiopia, and Zambia). Once the recovery is firm, achieving debt sustainability while pursuing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals will require raising domestic revenues, improving spending efficiency, developing medium-term fiscal frameworks, and undertaking structural reforms to facilitate private sector activity.\u201d\n\nIt added: \u201cAs part of preparing medium-term fiscal plans, countries should undertake an analysis of risks and mitigation measures. This is important given lower buffers, an uncertain outlook, and fiscal vulnerabilities including COVID-19 loans and credit guarantees to firms that could be realized over several years. As with growth, risks across countries also diverge. Countries, particularly those with high debt and non-reserve currencies, will have less room to maneuver if global interest rates rise more than expected.\u201d\n\nOn Sub-Saharan Africa, it stated that the projection also remains unchanged from its previous predictions, which it pegged at 3.4 percent, \u201chowever we had a slight adjustment upwards by 0.1 percent for 2022 to 4.1 per cent growth. The 2021 forecast for sub-Saharan Africa is unchanged relative to the April WEO, with an upgrade for South Africa following a strong positive surprise in the first quarter offset by downward revisions in other countries. The worsening pandemic developments in sub-Saharan Africa are expected to weigh on the region.\n\n\u201cIn some emerging market and developing economies in sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East and Central Asia, food prices have increased significantly amid shortages and the rise in global food prices. Currency depreciation has also lifted prices of imported goods, further adding to overall inflation. Core inflation which removes the influences of energy and food prices however remains contained for the most part.\u201d\n\nNume Ekeghe",

          "text": "The Chairman of Nigeria\u2019s Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC), Prof. Bolaji Owasanoye, on Tuesday said the private sector was responsible for over 60 per cent illegal movement of funds from Africa to foreign countries.\n\nOwasanoye made this known during the visit of council members of the African Bar Association (AFBA) led by its President, Mr. Hanniba Uwaifo, to the agency\u2019s corporate headquarters in Abuja.\n\nThe ICPC boss was quoted in a statement to have said perpetrators of illicit financial flows (IFFs) channel such funds through commercial activities enabled by the private sector.\n\n\u201cA bulk of corruption going on in the country is caused or perpetuated by the private sector. About 60 per cent of funds taken or stolen away from Africa through illicit financial flows are being done by the private sector, basically through commercial transactions, seemingly harmless transactions that are put together by accountants, auditors and bankers,\u201d he said.\n\nThe ICPC chairman who also commented on attacks on staff of the commission and other anti-corruption agencies by suspects under investigations, said it was fuelled by impunity and weak laws.\n\nNoting that corruption was debilitating in the country, Owasanoye explained that the ICPC was focusing on public sector corruption because of its impact on the country and the private sector.\n\nHe listed some of the progress made by the commission to include: de-emphasising confession-based investigation, a world-class forensic lab, staff auditing, and capacity building.\n\nHe charged the AFBA to play a positive role in regulating lawyers\u2019 effectiveness in the fight against corruption and pledged the commission\u2019s commitment to support the up-coming anti-corruption conference of the AFBA scheduled to hold in Niamey, Republic of Niger.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, AFBA\u2019s President, Mr. Hanniba Uwaifo, traced the problem in Africa to corruption which, according to him, had led to the underdevelopment of the continent.\n\nHe stressed that the continent cannot grow unless corruption was uprooted, adding that the world was worried about the level of corruption in Africa.\n\nUwaifo lamented that public sector corruption by government officials had held the country back from achieving its great potentials.\n\nHe also highlighted some of the corrupt practices perpetuated by government officials to include election malpractices, banditry and influencing the employment of lackeys into anti-corruption agencies in order to aid their corrupt practices.\n\nSpeaking on improvement, Uwaifo noted that issues of preventing corruption from taking place in the anti-graft agencies can be enhanced through constant audits of staff and materials.\n\nHe commended the ICPC for its due diligence and rule of law in the prosecution of accused persons.\n\n\u201cI want to commend the ICPC for performing creditably and not engaging in media trial and abuse of the rights of accused persons.
