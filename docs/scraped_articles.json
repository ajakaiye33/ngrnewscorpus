          "title": "Minister walks out on students protesting ASUU strike",
          "text": "Students of tertiary institutions under the aegis of the National Association of Nigerian Students on Monday protested in parts of the country, including the Federal Capital Territory, against the ongoing waning strike by members of the Academic Staff Union of Universities.\n\nIn Abuja, protesting students grounded activities at the secretariat of the Federal Ministry of Education after the Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, walked out on them during a meeting.\n\nThe students, who were demanding an immediate end to the ongoing strike by ASUU had stopped at the National Assembly, demanding to speak with the leadership of the Assembly but the security operatives on the ground shut the gate against them.\n\nThe protesting students then decided to take their protest to the ministry and demanded to speak with the minister, a request that was granted\n\nAt the meeting with the minister, President of NANS, Sunday Ashefon, demanded an immediate end to the ongoing strike while negotiations continue.\n\nHe also called for the inclusion of the students in the negotiation process, threatening that students may ground activities nationwide as done during the #EndSARS protest.\n\nThe visibly angry minister said he was disappointed with the NANS leadership, adding that the government had done what was expected of it since the commencement of the strike.\n\n\u201cI must begin by telling you that I am very disappointed if this is the way you want to put your case across to us,\u201d he said.\n\nHe then staged a walk out of the meeting.\n\nThe protesting students shut the gates of the ministry for hours to deny the minister and workers of the ministry entry and exit.\n\nThey marched round the building chanting songs such as \u201cAdamu must go\u201d.\n\nIn Plateau State, the protesting students locked out federal and state workers.\n\nThey gathered in front of the National Library, Yakubu Gowon Way in Jos around 8am and later moved to the federal secretariat located within Tudun Wada community and locked the gate, therefore preventing workers from going in while those already inside were trapped in their offices.\n\nSome of the civil servants told The PUNCH in Jos on Monday that the students, after locking the gate of the federal secretariat for some hours, moved to the nearby state secretariat where they also locked the gate.\n\nIn Ebonyi State, students embarked on a peaceful protest to register their anger over the strike.\n\nThey barricaded the Presco Campus section of the Abakaliki-Enugu Highway, demanding immediate end to incessant strikes in the country.\n\nThe students were led by the Acting Deputy Coordinator of Zone F, Ewa Chukwumaijem; and the Joint Campus Committee Chairman-elect in the state, Ituma Kelvin.\n\nIn Oyo State, the Zone B of NANS berated the Federal Government and ASUU for the ongoing strike.\n\nThe students staged a protest against the strike and called on the Federal Government and ASUU to resolve the issues that led to the strike without further delay.\n\nThe Coordinator of NANS in the South-West, Fiyinfolu Tegbe, said during the protest in Ibadan that students would block all federal roads in the region from Tuesday if the Federal Government and ASUU failed to resolve the strike issue.\n\nMembers of NANS from the University of Calabar and University of Cross River State took to the streets of Calabar to protest the strike.\n\nThe students asked the Federal Government to listen to ASUU and end the strike once and for all.\n\nIn Osun State, students embarked on a peaceful protest in Osogbo.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the protesters, the chairman, NANS/JCC Osun Axis, Oyelayo Oyewole, said they stormed the streets to make ASUU and the Federal Government end their disagreement that had disrupted academic activities in universities.\n\nIn Minna, Niger State, NANS threatened to shut down government activities in the state if the impasse between the Federal Government and ASUU is not resolved.\n\nNANS\u2019 zonal coordinator, Hussaini Ebbo, made this threat in Minna during the NANS peaceful protest.\n\n\u201cThe next time we are up on the street to demonstrate, we will ensure that we shut down all ministries and parastatals,\u201d he threatened.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Unfortunately, the provision of the law that says at least five per cent of employment opportunities should be reserved for PWDs has not been implemented, and if you look at our institutions today, there is no compliance to this,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Vice-Chancellor of Lagos State University, Prof Ibiyemi Olatunji-Bello, who was represented by Dr Tajudeen Olumoko, commended the sensitisation, urging citizens to see PWDs as part of the human race.\n\nThe Chairman, Punch Nigeria Limited, Mrs Angela Emuwa, at the event, said, \u201cIt is incumbent on all of us to recognise the rights of people living with disabilities to have a life of dignity, enjoying the same access to equal opportunities as every other person in society.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "By Ikechukwu Nnochiri\n\nDetained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu is very much alive and still being detained in the facility of the Department of State Services, DSS, his lawyer, Mr. Ifeanyi Ejiofor disclosed on Monday.\n\nEjiofor, in a statement he published on his official Facebook page, gave an update on his legal team\u2019s routine visit to Kanu at the DSS headquarters in Abuja.\n\nAccording to him, the IPOB leader declined to step out of his detention cell, in protest against the refusal of the DSS to allow him to see his lawyers on three occasions.\n\nHe said efforts were being \u201cintensified to pacify\u201d Kanu to have a one-on-one discussion with his legal team led by human rights lawyer, Chief Mike Ozekhome, SAN.\n\nThe statement, read: \u201cOur routine court-ordered visit to our indefatigable Client was led by the distinguished Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Prof. Chief Mike Ozekhome, SAN, who is also the Lead Counsel in Onyendu Mazi Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s case.\n\n\u201cOur esteemed team of Lawyers comprising of the Learned Silk, myself and Bar. Aloy Ejimakor, were all cleared most promptly upon our arrival, and consequently allowed to proceed with the business of the day- to pay Nnamdi Kanu a visit as his lawyers.\n\n\u201cWe were immediately ushered into the room designated for the visit. All the protocols were duly observed, as we willingly submitted ourselves to same, in line with the DSS stipulated routine guidelines.\n\n\u201cWe waited until minutes turned into an hour, and there was no signal that we would have Onyendu brought to us.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the erudite Silk leading our team raised alarm and demanded to have the attention of the DSS superiors for explanation on why a court-ordered visit which, ordinarily, should not extend beyond two hours was taking almost one and half hour waiting time, with no hope of meeting with Onyendu.\n\n\u201cFollowing the stout protest by the erudite Silk, we were consequently brought in, to meet with some superior officers at a meeting where all superior personnel connected with the matter were invited.\n\n\u201cFar-reaching contacts were made to establish the fact that our Client- Onyendu Mazi Nnamdi Kanu was presumably protesting the previous three visits which were aborted by the DSS.\n\n\u201cAll efforts made to move the visit to his very location of detention were not granted by the DSS, as they insisted that our request ran contrary to their procedure and guidelines.\n\n\u201cEffort is presently being intensified to pacify Onyendu to have one-on-one discussion with his legal team, to enable us brief him on legal steps we may be compelled to take and measures to be adopted to assure him that there are legal consequences for flagrant violations of court orders by the DSS.\n\n\u201cWe are quite hopeful that this needless impasse will be resolved between now and tomorrow morning,to enable the legal team led by Chief Ozekhome, SAN, to conduct the visit tomorrow. That has so far been assured us.\n\n\u201cWe can authoritatively confirm to you all at this stage that ONYENDU MAZI NNAMDI KANU is very much alive, and still being detained in the facility of the State Security Services (DSS) National Headquarters, Abuja.\n\n\u201cWe shall continue to keep you updated on matters connected with this visit to our indefatigable Client- Onyendu Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, and any other compelling attendant concerns thereto.\n\n\u201cThank you all, UMUCHINEKE and remain richly blessed\u201d.\n\nThe IPOB leader is answering to a 15-count treasonable felony charge the Federal Government preferred against him.\n\nThe charge against him borders on his alleged commission of act of terrorism, felony, incitement, unlawful importation of a radio transmitter, and headship of an illegal organization.\n\nTrial Justice Binta Nyako had ordered the DSS to allow Kanu to have access to three visitors, two days in the week.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Minister of Power, Engr. Abubakar Aliyu\n\nThe Ministry of Power says some sections in the new Electricity Bill 2022 will dilute the powers of the ministry to effectively supervise agencies under it.\n\nMinister of Power, Mr Abubakar Aliyu, raised the concern of the Ministry on Monday at a public hearing on Electricity Bill 2022, organised by the Senate Committee on Power.\n\nAliyu said it was the position of the ministry that the role of the minister as the coordinator with overall supervisory authority and its agencies needs to be strengthened in the Bill.\n\nThis, he said, would ensure that the oversight functions, which are necessary to drive government policies, are preserved.\n\nAccording to him, under the Electric Power Sector Reform Act ( EPSR Act 2005), supervisory powers of the minister to oversee the power sector and offer policy directions were unencumbered.\n\nThe minister said: \u201cIn the bill, these powers appear to be severally diluted as they are in several areas subject to prior consultation with the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), (Sections 5(1)(b);5(1)(c);5(1)(g) and 5(2).\n\n\u201cAny such limitation on the power of the minister has the potential to hinder efficient coordination of the ministry and its agencies, impede the minister\u2019s ability for accountability as it hinders seamless reporting to the President.\n\n\u201cIt may also be a challenge to the President\u2018s mandate to direct and formulate government policies.\n\n\u201cFurther, it has the unintended effect of subjugating the role of the minister to agencies under him on policy matters.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, appeal to this esteemed Committee to retain the issue of consultation between the ministry and its agencies as contained in Section 33 of the EPSR Act 2005,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said another area of concern in the Bill was the huge discretion given to the agencies to submit reports to the minister.\n\n\u201cNo such discretion should be permitted rather the requirement to submit report as the minister may demand should be made mandatory,\u201d the minister said.\n\nHe also raised concern over inclusion of oversight powers of the National Assembly in the Bill, saying that it was duplication.\n\nAliyu said the powers of the legislature are clearly provided in the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as amended.\n\nALSO READ: Suspected herdsmen kill, bury victim in shallow grave in Delta\n\nHe also said that there was the need to include in the Bill an Act to establish the National Power Training Institute of Nigeria (NAPTIN).\n\n\u201cUnlike all other agencies mentioned in the ESPR Act, there was no specific mention or reference to the establishment of the training institute in the Act.\n\n\u201cIt is our considered opinion that there is the need to specifically enact a law establishing the institute to define its objects and functions.\n\n\u2018\u201cThe appointment of Director-General, Directors, Governing Council and Board of Directors should also be considered.\n\n\u201cCondition of service of its directors and chief executive, including other principal officers, tenure, power sector policy on training and capacity development, minimum certification for professional,\u201d he said.\n\nHe commended the Senate Committee for the steps to improve the power sector through the enactment of a unifying law to facilitate inflow of investors and improve power generation and distribution to Nigerians.\n\nSimilarly, Chairman of the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC),Dr.Sanusi Garba, also faulted a section of the Bill proposing the establishment of Electricity Tribunal.\n\nGarba said that it would create confusion in the sector as the tribunal might negate the regulatory responsibilities of NERC.\n\nEarlier, Chairman of the Committee, Sen.Gabriel Suswam, said the public hearing was designed to seek inputs from stakeholders towards the passage of the Bill.\n\nSuswam said the Bill was designed to provide a uniform law for the sector, drive and promote investors\u2019 confidence and ensure sustainable power sector in Nigeria.\n\nPresident of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, who declared the event open, said it was time for Nigeria to enact a new electricity law in line with global trends in the sector.\n\nLawn said the Bill, when passed would further attract investors and address the challenges in the sector.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that stakeholders present at the first day of the public hearing includes the Nigerian Electricity Management Services (NEMSA), Energy Commission of Nigeria (ECN), Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading (NBET).\n\nOthers are Rural Electrification Agency (REA), Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN). Some officials of Distribution Companies (DisCos) and Generation Companies (GenCos) ,among others were also in attendance.\n\n(NAN)\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Dowen College, Lagos, has begun installation of Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) cameras following the death of a 12-year-old student, Sylvester Oromoni Jnr.\n\nA teacher and houseparent at the college, Mr Ahmed Ayomo, made the disclosure on Monday before an Ikeja Corona\u2019s Court unraveling the circumstances sorrounding the student\u2019s death.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the student died on Nov. 30, 2021.\n\nHis family is alleging that he died from injuries he sustained in an attack by five senior students of Dowen College for refusing to join a cult.\n\nThe family also alleges that the late student was forced to drink an obnoxious substance by his attackers.\n\nAdvice by the Lagos State Directorate of Public Prosecutions released on Jan. 4, however, disputed the allegations.\n\nIt stated that an autopsy revealed the cause of the student\u2019s death as acute bacterial pneumonia due to severe sepsis.\n\nAyomo, an Islamic Studies Teacher, who has been employed by Dowen College for 13 years, made the disclosure while answering questions from the Coroner, Mr Mikhail Kadiri.\n\nAyomo, who served as a guardian to the late student, also told the court that, to ensure safety and security of students, additional apartments for houseparents were being built on each block of hostels in the college.\n\nRegarding the bullying allegation, Ayomo said that he was not aware if the school management took any disciplinary action against the student that asked the deceased to describe the private part of his elder sister.\n\n\u201cThe Assistant Director of the hostel, Mr Valentine, punished the student for the act but I am not aware if the management as a whole took any disciplinary action against him,\u201d he said.\n\nKadiri asked, \u201c As a father, if it were you, how would you feel? Would you still have confidence in the school?\u201d\n\nAyomo responded that he would not feel happy but he would still have confidence in the school.\n\nEarlier, while being cross-examined by counsel to the Oromoni family, Mr Andrew Efole, the witness said that the late student never complained to him about some senior students demanding for his provisions.\n\nEfole, referencing to the statements of witnesses to the police, disputed Ayomo\u2019s claim.\n\nHe said that he was aware that the deceased informed the teacher about some senior students wanting to take his provisions from him.\n\nEfole enquired again if the deceased ever complained to Ayomo, as his house parent, that his provisions were being taken away by some senior students.\n\nThe witness then replied in the affirmative.\n\n\u201cIf I confront you with a document to the effect that he complained to you, would you want the court to regard you as a witness that lacks integrity?\n\n\u201cI want to refer the court to a statement made by the witness dated Dec.12, 2021, at the State Criminal Investigation Department (SCID) Panti, Yaba, Lagos.\n\n\u201cIt reads: \u2018Sylvester Oromoni was well known to me as his houseparent. He complained that some people were begging him for his provisions, that he would like to be keep the provisions in my house for protection\u2019.\n\n\u201cThis statement was written by you,\u201d Efole said.\n\nThe witness replied in the affirmative, noting that it was his document.\n\nQuestioning Ayomo further, Efole asked, \u201d As a houseparent, can you tell the court when the principal became aware that the boy was sick?\u201d\n\nResponding, Ayomo said: \u201d On Nov. 23 2021, I went to the principal to collect exit card from the principal for the deceased. On Nov. 28, the principal became aware of the deceased\u2019s sickness.\n\n\u201cOn Nov. 27 2021, I called the mother to ask about the deceased. She said they were in a church.\n\n\u201cOn Nov. 28, 2021, I called the principal and said that one of boys was at home and he was staying too long, and I gave the mother\u2019s number to the principal.\n\n\u201cAs the principal was talking with the mother, the deceased was screaming.\n\n\u201cThe mother told the principal that they were massaging his body, the principal prayed for him,\u201d the witness said.\n\nThe coroner adjourned proceedings until Feb. 28 for continuation of hearing.

With that, we will be able to fly out trades as health sector practitioners,\u201d he said.\n\nProf. Saad Ahmed, Medical Director, FMC Jabi, added that the surgeries were conducted with the support of the Save the Heart Foundation.\n\nThe medical director called on philanthropists, corporate bodies and well-meaning Nigerians to donate to the facility\u2019s medical fund, so as to generate funds for the treatment of patients.\n\n\u201cThe essence is to domesticate it and make it a routine procedure for the Federal Medical Centre in Abuja,\u201d he added.\n\nDr Alex Tosan, Chairman, Board members, FMC Jabi, commended the medical director, top management and the team that carried out the surgeries.\n\nHe added that the surgeries which were done at subsidised costs were carried out by Nigerian experts.\n\n\u201cThe patients are doing very fine as most of them are even surprised to find out that the surgery had been conducted.\n\n\u201cWithin 48 hours, all of them were up and about. None of them suffered from any pain, they are not suffering from any post-traumatic stress that accompanies major surgeries,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "By Eric Ikhilae and Sanni Onogu, Abuja\n\nIf governors have their way, ongoing effort by the Senate to amend the Electricity Act through the Electricity Bill 2022 would be an exercise in futility.\n\nThe governors rejected the Bill, which they argued, is against the interest of the states because it seeks to re-establish a centrally-controlled electricity sector.\n\nTheir position is contained in a letter by the Chairman of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) Dr. Kayode Fayemi, to the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Power, Gabriel Suswan.\n\nThe governors had an ally in Power Minister Abubakar Aliyu, who said the Bill if passed, would erode his supervisory powers.\n\nIn a statement, NGF spokesman Abdulrazaque Bello-Barkindo, noted Fayemi, who is Ekiti State governor, in the letter dated February 22, argued that the governors were averse to the Electricity Bill in the version currently before the Senate.\n\nThe governors faulted Suswam\u2019s claim in an article that the Electricity Bill 2022 is based on recommendations put together by a team of consultants engaged by the Senate Committee on Power.\n\nAccording to them, the Electricity Bill before the Senate Committee is neither a true and fair reflection of stakeholders\u2019 interest in the electricity sector, nor a true and fair reflection of the Federal executive arm.\n\nThe governors argued that contrary to the views of the Chairman of the Senate Committee of Power, \u201cClause 2(2) of the Bill is rather injurious to the constitutional rights of states with regards to electricity generation, transmission, and distribution.\n\n\u201cLimiting the powers of state governments to build generation plants, transmission and distribution lines only in areas not covered by the national grid, shrinks the powers of states to make laws for electricity within their state jurisdictions,\u201d the governors said.\n\nThey urged the Senate to engage the House of Representatives on existing Bills on the electricity sector, particularly the Electricity Power Sector Reform Act (EPSRA) Amendment Bill 2020 among others, which also infringe on the constitutional rights of states to make laws for electricity, with a view to harmonising it into a single draft electricity bill.\n\nThe letter reads: \u201cWe write concerning a matter that has now become one requiring urgent national attention.\n\n\u201cIt has come to the attention of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) that the Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria has before it a Bill for a law to repeal the Electric Power Sector Reform Act, 2005, consolidate various laws relating to the electricity sector and for many other matters both connected and unconnected herewith.\n\n\u201cWe wish to point out that \u2018electricity\u2019 is not an exclusive federal matter. It is guided by the provisions of the Concurrent Legislative List. Articles 13 and 14 clearly provide that the power to make laws for the generation and transmission of electricity are concurrent.\n\n\u201cAlso, Article 14 reserves exclusively to the State the power to make laws for the distribution of electricity within a State as it also does the power to make laws for the generation and transmission of electricity exclusively within the borders of a State.\n\n\u201cWe also wish to note that the National Electric Power Policy, 2001, the only extant Federal Government general policy statement on the electricity sector, in Chapter Three, is very clear that the States and State Governments are key stakeholders in the electricity value chain.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the reality of the states as key partners in the achievement of universal electricity access by all Nigerians must not only be accepted by the Federal Government but must be legislated by the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cIt would be unconstitutional and an unjustifiable act of overreach for the Senate to consider and pass a Bill that continues to treat the Federation as one single electricity jurisdiction or sector.\n\n\u201cWhile a single Electric Power Sector Reform Act may have been useful as a catalyst for the sector in the early years of the Fourth Republic, the states have all come of age, literally and metaphorically, and the arrangements must change in a way that accepts and respects the maturity of the states in electricity matters; a reality that this Senate Electricity Bill does not recognise and take account of, but at best, only pays the most cursory lip service.\u201d\n\nDismissing the Bill as not addressing any of the challenges facing the power sector, the governors said: \u201cThe re-establishment of the same single national electricity market that has brought neither growth in capacity, nor socio-economic development for the nation and as stated earlier, the continued absence of a clear path for the market to exit permanently from its long-running insolvent status.\n\n\u201cThe Bill also re-establishes the existing Federal Government entities and a number of other new ones as key players in the sector.\n\n\u201cFinally, perhaps the most egregious feature that runs throughout the Bill is the establishment of a single Federal Government appointee, the Minister of Power, as the de facto head and statutory supervisor of all the key FG electricity sector MDAs, including the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), in a supposedly privatised electricity sector.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, the minister\u2019s extensive powers over the sector are shared with the National Assembly through the mechanism of legislative oversight responsibilities.\n\n\u201cThe NGF does not support this Electricity Bill in the version currently before the Senate, except these amendments are reflected.\n\n\u201cThis is because it is unconstitutional and maintains the policy of Federal Government overreach in the electricity sector that has not yielded development to the country.\n\n\u201cWe state in very clear terms that this Electricity Bill Is not a solution to the pressing challenges summarised above. It is also premature in that it does not follow from a comprehensive national dialogue on a completely revised national electricity policy.\u201d\n\nOn the way forward, they reminded the lawmakers that \u201celectricity is a vital matter of national security that, by virtue of the 1999 Constitution, is in the concurrent list and should, therefore, be made into law only with the collaboration and concurrence of the states of the federation.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to close collaboration between the NGF, the National Assembly and the Federal Executive Branch in charting a new and productive path towards bringing energy security to our county.\u201d\n\nKicking against the Bill, the Power minister insisted that some sections of the Electricity Bill 2022 would dilute the powers of the minister to effectively supervise the sector.\n\nAliyu maintained that rather than weaken the ministry, it should be strengthened in the Bill for the performance of its oversight functions to drive government policies are preserved.\n\nAccording to him, under the Electric Power Sector Reform Act (EPSR Act 2005), supervisory powers of the minister to oversee the power sector and offer policy directions were unencumbered.\n\nAliyu said: \u201cIn the Bill, these powers appear to be severally diluted as they are in several areas subject to prior consultation with the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), (Sections 5(1)(b);5(1)(c);5(1)(g) and 5(2).\n\n\u201cAny such limitation on the power of the minister has the potential to hinder efficient coordination of the ministry and its agencies, impede the ministers\u2019 ability for accountability as it hinders seamless reporting to the President.\n\n\u201cIt may also be a challenge to the President\u2019s mandate to direct and formulate government policies.\u201d",

          "text": "By Nwanosike Onu, Awka; John Ofikhenua, Frank Ikpefan, Abuja; Toba Adedeji, Osogbo; Simon Utebor, Yenagoa; Ernest Nwokolo, Abeokuta; Okungbowa Aiwerie, Asaba; Yinka Adeniran, Ibadan; Chris Njoku, Owerri and Elo Edremoda, Warri\n\nLagos, Abuja, Ibadan, Osogbo worst-hit\n\nTUC mulls industrial action\n\nPetrol scarcity worsened across the country yesterday, crippling cities and hitting businesses hard.\n\nCoupled with an epileptic power supply, life has become tougher for artisans, who rely on petrol-powered generators to earn a living.\n\nThe cost of transportation also increased across the country as the scarcity entered its fourth week.\n\nNigerians have been spending hours on queues since the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited announced the discovery of \u201cemulsion particles\u201d in the Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) cargoes shipped to Nigeria from Artway, Belgium, by its agents.\n\nThe Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA), on February 1, said methanol above Nigeria\u2019s specification was discovered in a limited quantity of petrol in the supply chain.\n\nThe government blamed the scarcity on efforts to quarantine un-evacuated volumes of the toxic petrol.\n\nDespite NNPC\u2019s promise that about 2.5 billion litres of PMS were being expected by the end of last month, the situation has worsened.\n\nThere were lamentations in many states yesterday.\n\nIn Osun, residents decried hike in fares, which increased by over 100 per cent.\n\nMotorists and motorcyclists kept vigil at petrol stations, with queues stretching over several kilometres.\n\nSome petrol stations sold for between N200 to N250 per litre in Ilesha, Ife, Otan, Ila, Ede, Iwo, Okini and Ikirun.\n\nA motorist, Mr Segun Adeyemi, said: \u201cI bought petrol this morning at the rate of N200 per litre. I paid N3,000 for fuel but the attendant deducted N100 while dispensing.\u201d\n\nAnambra residents lamented the scarcity, with pump prices varying in different stations.\n\nIn Awka, the state capital, some filling stations sold petrol at N175 per litre; others sold at N200.\n\nIn the commercial city of Onitsha, the pump price rose to as high as N300. Some service stations sold at N250 per litre.\n\nMost of the petrol stations in Nnewi sold for between N185 and N210.\n\nMany stations in Anambra have remained shut since last week.\n\nIn Yenagoa, the Bayelsa State capital, the price remained at N250 per litre.\n\nIt was worse two weeks ago when some stations sold at between N500 and N600 per litre.\n\nIt was learnt that the adjustment in price was due to an agreement reached between the independent petroleum marketers and the government.\n\nThere has also been an increase in transportation fares and prices of products.\n\nIn Imo State, a litre of petrol was sold at between N180 and N200, resulting in increased cost of goods and services.\n\nResidents of Warri, Effurun and environs also felt the effects of the scarcity.\n\nIn Warri/Sapele, Effurun/Sapele and PTI Roads in Warri South and Uvwie council areas, most filling stations were closed.\n\nThe few stations that opened at intervals sold above pump price.\n\nAt one of the stations, the product was sold at N200 per litre.\n\nIt was gathered that others that opened briefly sold between N185 and N210.\n\nSome motorists alleged marketers were hoarding the product.\n\nIn Asaba, the Delta capital, and environs, a litre of petrol was sold for N220 per litre.\n\nIt was the same in Ibuzor, Oshimili North, Ogwashi-Uku, Aniocha South and Isselu-Uku and Aniocha North local government areas.\n\nMany petrol stations have been under lock due to the non-availability of the products.\n\nThe scarcity also led to a hike in transportation fares within the Asaba.\n\nCommercial tricycles charge N100 for a distance within Asaba that normally cost N50, while transport fares for commercial buses shuttling between Asaba and Onitsha have increased from N150 per trip to N500.\n\nIn Ogun State, most service stations did not have the product.\n\nFrom Ajebo to Sapon, there are 13 filling stations, but none of them sold fuel in the day.\n\nIt was the same at Abiola Way stretching through Olorunsogo and beyond.\n\nIt was learnt that few of the marketers that had the product resorted to selling between N185 and N210 per litre. They mostly sold from around 6.30p.m.\n\nThe scarcity bit hard in parts of Ibadan, the Oyo State capital.\n\nIn some filling stations, hoodlums coordinated vehicles, collecting at least N500 from each motorist before allowing them in.\n\nPetrol attendants also asked motorists to part with at least N1,000 depending on the volume of fuel purchased.\n\nThe scarcity of the product worsened in Abuja and Lagos.\n\nThere were endless vehicular queues around all the petrol stations that sold the product.\n\nIPMAN urges NNPC to increase supply\n\nThe Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) National President, Alhaji Debo Ahmed, urged the NNPC to increase the supply of petrol to 21 inland depots across the country.\n\nHe noted that there was a need to decentralise the depots from which the marketers lift the product.\n\nHe told one of our correspondents that marketers were lifting the product from private depots in Lagos, which he said makes the supply process cumbersome for the marketers.\n\nThe IPMAN boss explained that the break in the supply chain during the issue of the toxic fuel created a supply gap that has not been bridged.\n\n\u201cIf there is a break in demand chain it is always difficult to meet up. Moreover, it is only NNPC who imports. So, NNPC has to increase its importation level to meet up the demand.\n\n\u201cThey should import to those 21 government depots so that they can increase availability.\n\n\u201cIf they have the product they should increase availability by pumping to these 21 inland depots.\n\n\u201cEverybody is buying from private depots. The time gap between Lagos, Maiduguri, Abuja and other places is still part of the problem. It depends on when you get your product.\n\nOrdinarily, it takes seven days to transport the product from Lagos to Maiduguri. The whole thing is compounding because everybody has to go to Lagos.\u201d\n\nOn the ex-depot price, he said: \u201cThe private depots are selling between N180 to N182 per litre.\u201d\n\nNUPENG talks tough\n\nIPMAN and the Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) are at loggerheads over the pump price of petrol.\n\nAs fuel scarcity worsened in many parts of the country in the last fortnight, many fuel stations increased the pump price of petrol higher than the official N165 per litre.\n\nNUPENG issued a 24-hour ultimatum to IPMAN members on Sunday to revert to the official pump price of N165 per litre of petrol, but IPMAN says such directive is not within the former\u2019s purview.\n\nChairman, IPMAN Benin Depot, Mr Douglas Iyike, said NUPENG\u2019s ultimatum was misplaced.\n\nHe emphasised that NUPENG as a union had no powers to take over the duties of regulatory agencies in the petroleum sector.\n\nAccording to him, the increment was due to the hike in the ex-depot price of petrol which should be the area where NUPENG should direct its threat rather than directing same at marketers.\n\n\u201cWe have read in newspapers the supposed 24-hour notice issued to marketers regarding the increment in the pump price of petrol.\n\n\u201cWe want to place it on record that the increment is not due to any fault of oil marketers because we can only sell based on the price at which we buy petrol from the depots.\n\nThere has been an increment in the ex-depot price which has left marketers with no option but to increase the pump price of petrol above the official N165 per litre in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cWe believe that addressing the issue of the ex-depot price should be the focus of NUPENG and not attempting to picket petrol stations which might lead to a breakdown of law and order,\u201d he said.\n\nIyike urged NUPENG to channel its energy to the activities of some of its members who engage in reckless driving, illegal charges and diversion of petroleum products.\n\nTUC reviews sit-at-home directive\n\nThe Trade Union Congress (TUC) has said it would review reports on the challenge of fuel scarcity across the country before taking a decision today.\n\nIts President, Quadri Olaleye, said reports from the field would determine if the Congress would direct its members to stop going to work or not.\n\nThere is a standing instruction from the TUC directing workers in statutory corporations and government-owned companies to stop going to work if the challenge of fuel scarcity across the country persists for the next few days.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere is a standing instruction to declare sit-at-home for our members. We will only reinforce that standing instruction.\n\n\u201cI will have a meeting with cabinet members tomorrow (today to refresh the consultations with our National Administrative Council.\n\n\u201cWe need to get reports from those we assigned to review if fuel queues have resurfaced in the country and take appropriate action.\u201d\n\nNLC angry over scarcity\n\nThe Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) decried the scarcity, saying it has brought untold hardship to millions of commuters and drivers.\n\nIts President, Ayuba Wabba, in a statement, called on all petrol marketers to show sensitivity to the difficulties faced by Nigerians and ensure prompt discharge of petrol to consumers.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cThe Nigeria Labour Congress condemns the current petrol scarcity all over the country which has exposed millions of Nigerian drivers and commuters to great hardship.\n\n\u201cWe understand that the current situation is as a result of petroleum products hoarding.\n\n\u201cWe call on all petrol marketers to show sensitivity to the difficulties faced by the generality of Nigerians and ensure prompt discharge of petrol to consumers.\n\n\u201cWe also call on relevant regulatory agencies of government to rein in the activities of unscrupulous petroleum products marketers who go devilish miles to make dishonest gains and at the detriment of their fellow citizens.\n\n\u201cWe also state that this situation reinforces our argument for domestic refining of petroleum.\u201d",

          "text": "From Fred Ezeh, Abuja and Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nThe National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS), yesterday, disrupted activities at the National Assembly Complex and Federal Ministry of Education, in Abuja, as it staged a peaceful protest to register their discontent with the periodic industrial actions by university lecturers under the umbrella of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) and failure of Federal Government to meet their demands.\n\nThe aggrieved students in their hundreds marched through the streets of Abuja with placards, chanted solidarity songs and blocked the gates of both buildings for several hours.\n\nNigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\nCarrying mattresses, cooking gases and other utensils, the students threatened to occupy NASS complex and Federal Ministry of Education until they were assured that concrete measures have been put in place by government to end the lecturers strike.\n\nThe students asked the Federal Government to honour agreements it freely entered into with ASUU and renegotiate areas that needed renegotiation. They also tasked ASUU to be open-minded, progressive and realistic in their terms.\n\nNANS President, Sunday Asefon, who led the protest decried the situation where ASUU had gone on strike for more than four years cumulatively since 1999.\n\nHe urged government to persuade ASUU to suspend the strike and return to classrooms to ensure continuity in academic calendar. He also tasked the government to consider urgent investments in revitalising public tertiary institutions to accommodate the country\u2019s growing population and its emerging needs.\n\nThe students said if their positions were not acted upon immediately, they would continue to protest every week, and even pick a more strategic venue that would impact the economy significantly.\n\n\u201cWe demand that Nigerian students who are victims of the incessant ASUU strike must be represented in all negotiations between the Federal Government and ASUU, and both parties must show proof that their children attended or are attending a public university in Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Ibadan, Oyo State, NANS issued a 24-hour ultimatum to Federal Government and ASUU to end the ongoing nationwide industrial action or it would shut down the country by barricading all federal roads.\n\nThe students, who stated this during a peaceful protest in Ibadan, advised the Federal Government and ASUU to resolve their dispute and safeguard the future of Nigerian students.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nThe protest, which kicked off at the press centre of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Oyo State Council, Iyaganku, Ibadan, was led by the South West coordinator of NANS, Fiyinfoluwa Tegbe.\n\nThe protesters, who carried placards with various inscriptions, specifically accused university lecturers of being responsible for the way the Federal Government has been treating them alleging that some ASUU members had facilitated the rigging of election results for politicians, and had lost the respect of the political leadership.\n\nSome of the inscriptions on the placards displayed during the protest read: \u201cFG and ASUU, stop the madness,\u201d \u201cStop the strike and revitalise our education,\u201d \u201cAfter the end of strike, only students lose,\u201d \u201cFG should learn to respect agreement,\u201d \u201cAge is irreversible, house rents are not refundable, stop disrupting our life plans.\u201d\n\nSaid Tegbe: \u201cWe are calling on the Federal Government to learn how to respect agreement. We have seen on many occasions when the Federal Government and ASUU reached agreement, but the Federal Government failed to fulfil the pledge.\n\n\u201cAgain, ASUU members should have ways to deal with issues, rather than going on strike all the time, because they are wasting our time. We are appealing to the Federal Government and ASUU to resolve this crisis and allow us go back to our classes.\u201d\n\n\u2022Kano, Plateau students appeal for dialogue\n\nSimilarly, students from some tertiary institutions in Kano State staged a peaceful protest. The students carried placards with different inscriptions, and marched round some areas in the Kano metropolis.\n\nThe students\u2019 leader, Yazid Tanko, said ASUU\u2019s strike \u201cis always causing a setback to their education. We are indigenes of Kano State, and we are schooling in Kano State. That is why we went to the Ministry for Higher Education to show our grievances, so that they will convey our message to the Federal Government.\u201d\n\nIn Jos, Plateau State, Na\u2019allah Nanzim, public relations officer (PRO), NANS Zone C, said education is a right and the consistent strikes were gradually killing the education system.We want the government to know that we are critical stakeholders in the education sector and these strikes are really affecting our academic journey. When ASUU and government have issues, it is the students that suffer and this protest is to show how unhappy we are over the strikes.\u201d\n\nNanzim said the students would continue to hold such protests until ASUU and government reached a reasonable agreement.",

The ban applies from February 27, 2022, 3pm It is initially valid for three months.\u201d\n\nThe ministry added that humanitarian aid flights were exempt from the ban.\n\nThe Italian government said on Twitter that it was closing its airspace to Russian aircraft on Sunday, following a similar action.\n\n\u201c#Ukraine \u2013 Italy has decided to close its airspace to Russia, starting from 15.00 today,\u201d the statement said.\n\nFrance also said it would shut \u201cits airspace to Russian aircraft and airplanes from this evening onwards,\u201d according France\u2019s Transport Minister, Jean-Baptiste Djebbari, in a tweet yesterday.\n\nDjebbari said, \u201cTo the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Europe responds with total unity.\n\n\u201cFrance is shutting its airspace to all Russian aircraft and airlines from this evening on.\u201d\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Germany would allocate \u20ac100 billion for its armed forces as it looks to increase defense spending in the light of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that we need to invest more in the security of our country in order to protect our freedom and democracy,\u201d Scholz said while delivering a statement on Ukraine at a special parliament session.\u201d\n\nScholz said the German army needed to have \u201cnew strong competences,\u201d including better devices and equipment which \u201ccost a lot of money.\u201d He announced the \u20ac100 billion special fund for this purpose as part of the 2022 budget.\n\nHe added that the country would invest more than two per cent of its Gross Domestic Products (GDP) in defense every year from now on, and accused Putin of wanting to have a Russian empire and to change Europe.\n\nScholz said, \u201cThose who read Putin\u2019s explanation about history, those who have seen him how he announced the war on TV, and before that I had talked to him for hours, so I cannot have any doubt that he wants to have a Russian empire. He wants to change Europe according to his imagination.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the United States\u2019 Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, announced that the US was sending nearly $54 million in humanitarian aid to Ukraine to assist those affected by Russia\u2019s invasion.\n\nIn a statement released yesterday, Blinken said the funds would go to international humanitarian organisations to provide food, water, shelter and health care to Ukrainians in need and help reunify families who have been separated amid Russia\u2019s attacks.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cThe United States commends the hospitality of the neighbouring countries in the region hosting fleeing Ukrainians, and we are engaging diplomatically to support their efforts to keep their borders open and assist those seeking international protection\n\n\u201cAs with any refugee situation, we call on the international community to respond to the needs of those seeking protection in a way consistent with the principle of non-refoulement and our shared obligations under international law.\u201d\n\nThe US has provided nearly $405 million in humanitarian aid to Ukraine since Russia first invaded Ukraine in 2014, according to the press release.\n\nBP to Exit 19.75% Shareholding in Rosneft\n\nThe BP board announced that it would exit its shareholding in Rosneft. BP had held a 19.75% shareholding in Rosneft since 2013.\n\nThe company, in a statement on its website, also disclosed that its chief executive officer, Bernard Looney, was resigning from the board of Rosneft with immediate effect.\n\nThe other Rosneft director nominated by BP, former BP group, chief executive Bob Dudley, similarly would resign from the board. The resignations would require BP to change its accounting treatment of its Rosneft shareholding and, as a result, it expects to report a material non-cash charge with its first quarter 2022 results, to be reported in May.\n\nBP chair Helge Lund said, \u201cRussia\u2019s attack on Ukraine is an act of aggression, which is having tragic consequences across the region. BP has operated in Russia for over 30 years, working with brilliant Russian colleagues.\n\n\u201cHowever, this military action represents a fundamental change. It has led the BP board to conclude, after a thorough process, that our involvement with Rosneft, a state-owned enterprise, simply cannot continue. We can no longer support BP representatives holding a role on the Rosneft board.\n\n\u201cThe Rosneft holding is no longer aligned with BP\u2019s business and strategy and it is now the board\u2019s decision to exit BP\u2019s shareholding in Rosneft. The bp board believes these decisions are in the best long-term interests of all our shareholders.\u201d\n\nLooney added, \u201cLike so many, I have been deeply shocked and saddened by the situation unfolding in Ukraine and my heart goes out to everyone affected. It has caused us to fundamentally rethink BP\u2019s position with Rosneft.\n\n\u201cI am convinced that the decisions we have taken as a board are not only the right thing to do, but are also in the long-term interests of BP. Our immediate priority is caring for our great people in the region and we will do our utmost to support them. We are also looking at how BP can support the wider humanitarian effort.\u201d\n\nLooney had been a director of Rosneft, as one of two BP-nominated directors since 2020. Bob Dudley had been a director of Rosneft since 2013.\n\nAs a result of the resignations of BP\u2019s nominated directors, BP determined it no longer met the criteria set out under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for having \u201csignificant influence\u201d over Rosneft. BP will, therefore, no longer hold equity account for its interest in Rosneft, treating it now as a financial asset measured at fair value.\n\nAs BP now is exiting its interest in Rosneft, it has removed Rosneft dividend payments from its financial frame. BP also disclosed that it would exit its other businesses with Rosneft within Russia.\n\nFG Secures Exit Routes for Fleeing Nigerians\n\nThe Nigerian government secured exit routes for Nigerians fleeing Ukraine, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs revealed.\n\nThe ministry in a signed statement by its permanent secretary, Ambassador Gabriel Aduda, yesterday, said visa free passage had been secured for Nigerians fleeing the troubled country.\n\nAduda advised that Nigerians fleeing Ukraine should make the move through Hungarian Zahony border and Romanian Suceava, Tulcea, Satu Mare County and Maramures.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs is fully abreast of all the challenges Nigerians crossing into countries bordering Ukraine, especially the Polish border, are facing and we are taking adequate measures to assuage these challenges.\n\n\u201cThe Honourable Minister of Foreign Affairs has spoken with his counterpart, the Foreign Minister of Ukraine on these unsavoury development and both are working on alleviating the suffering of Nigerians, including deploying the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) to the border to ensure easier access to all Nigerians and other nationals.\n\n\u201cFor now, movement to the Hungarian Zahony border and Romanian Suceava, Tulcea, Satu Mare County and Maramures borders is advised, as they have approved visa free access to all Nigerians coming from Ukraine and arrangements for accommodation and feeding before evacuation is arranged.\u201d\n\nAduda said, \u201cParents, guardians and wards of Nigerians in Ukraine are enjoined to remain calm as the Federal Government of Nigeria is working very hard to get them all home safely.\u201d\n\nRussians Rush for Dollars as Sanctions Threaten Ruble Collapse\n\nRussians are lining up at cash machines around the country to withdraw foreign currency as new sanctions to punish the Kremlin for its invasion of Ukraine sparked fear the ruble could collapse.\n\nThe rush for foreign currency came despite some lenders selling dollars at more than a third higher than the market\u2019s close on Friday, and well past the psychologically important level of 100 rubles per dollar that many economists said would trigger an interest-rate hike by the Bank of Russia.\n\nThe shock came as Russians were still digesting news that Europe was closing its airspace to them and popular payment systems like ApplePay would stop working, Bloomberg news reported.\n\nFIFA bans matches in Russia, 3 European countries refusing to play country in World Cup qualifiers\n\nMeanwhile, FIFA said no international football matches will be played in Russia and the country\u2019s flag and anthem will be prohibited from matches abroad. The governing body FIFA announced this in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIt said Russia\u2019s national teams would henceforth compete only as the Football Union of Russia (RFU), and its games would be held with no fans and on \u201cneutral territory\u201d.\n\nThe ban came after Sweden, Poland, and the Czech Republic refused to play Russia in the 2022 World Cup playoffs next month amid the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe decision by the three countries could disrupt the UEFA World Cup qualifiers, and leave FIFA president Gianni Infantino with the responsibility to find a solution within the next month.\n\nSweden and Poland made the decision on Saturday, and the Czech Republic followed Sunday.\n\nUS Hypocritical about Russia-Ukraine War, Says Senator Sanders\n\nDemocratic and ranking Senator Bernie Sanders slammed the United States as hypocritical for kicking against Russia\u2019s on-going onslaught against Ukraine, accusing the American government of illegitimately overthrowing a \u201cdozen\u201d of regimes in other countries.\n\nIn a video seen by THISDAY, Sanders, who spoke before the war between Russia and Ukraine broke out, pointed out on the US Senate floor that the American government was selfish and would have flexed its military muscles against Ukraine, were it to be in Russia\u2019s situation.\n\nSanders stated, \u201cPutin may be a liar and a demagogue, but it is hypocritical for the United States to insist that we do not accept the principle of \u2018spheres of influence\u2019. For the last 200 years, our country has operated under the Monroe Doctrine, embracing the premise that as the dominant power in the western hemisphere,\u201d explained Sanders, \u201cthe United States has the right to intervene against any country that might threaten our alleged interests.\u201d\n\nUnder this doctrine, noted the US senator, America had committed various atrocities on foreign lands.\n\nThe Democratic senator stressed, \u201cWe have undermined and overthrown at least a dozen governments. In 1962 we came to the brink of nuclear war with the Soviet Union in response to the placement of Soviet missiles in Cuba, 90 miles from our shore, which the Kennedy administration saw as an unacceptable threat to our national security.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cAnd the Monroe Doctrine is not ancient history. As recently as 2018, Donald Trump\u2019s Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, called the Monroe Doctrine \u2018as relevant today as it was the day it was written\u2019. In 2019, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, John Bolton, declared \u2018the Monroe Doctrine is alive and well\u2019.\u201d\n\nFurther condemning the US grandstanding and hypocritical response to the Russia-Ukraine crisis, Sanders explained, \u201cTo put it simply, even if Russia was not ruled by a corrupt authoritarian leader like Vladimir Putin, Russia, like the United States, would still have an interest in the security policies of its neighbours.\u201d\n\nThe Almanac of American Politics calls Sanders, serving his third term in the US Senate after winning re-election in 2018, a \u201cpractical and successful legislator.\u201d\n\nThe one-time American presidential aspirant did not mince words expressing his displeasure against the US government\u2019s subversiveness against Russia.\n\n\u201cDoes anyone really believe that the United States would not have something to say if, for example, Mexico was to form a military alliance with a US adversary?\u201d said Sanders. \u201cCountries should be free to make their own foreign policy choices, but making those choices wisely requires a serious consideration of the costs and benefits.\u201d He further pointed out that \u201cthe fact is that the US and Ukraine entering into a deeper security relationship is likely to have some very serious costs \u2013 for both countries.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Concerns as NNPC Recorded Zero Remittance to Federation Account in January",
          "text": "* Petrol subsidy gulped N210bn\n\n*OPEC+ trims forecast for 2022 oil market surplus\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nDespite the rising international prices of oil, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited failed to remit its statutory funding to the Federation Account which is jointly operated by the federal, state and local governments, in January 2022.\n\nThat was the second time in less than a year that the national oil company (NOC) would be unable to deliver a kobo to the joint account, following the same occurrence in April last year, when the firm announced zero remittance for the month.\n\nIn addition, a document detailing NNPC\u2019s activities for the month under review, presented during the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) held last Thursday, indicated that the NOC expended a whopping N210.38 billion on petrol subsidy during the month.\n\nTHISDAY recalls that with a deficit of approximately N2 trillion out of its projected N2.511 trillion, the NNPC was unable to remit roughly 80 per cent of its projected contribution to the Federation Account in 2021.\n\nFor the entire 12 months of last year, the NNPC disbursed N542 billion as against the budgeted N2.511 trillion, despite a monthly contribution estimate of N209.3 billion. The N542 billion represented just about 21. 6 per cent of the total expected contribution of the NNPC to the joint account.\n\nThe development underscored how a combination of factors, including declining oil production, rising subsidy payments and high oil production costs, have hobbled the organisation\u2019s performance despite the increasing oil prices which overshot $105 per barrel last week.\n\nEarlier in the year, President Muhammadu Buhari had backtracked on the planned full deregulation of the downstream sector, including the wholesale removal of petrol subsidy, citing the negative impact it would have on the poor in the country.\n\nFor decades, Nigeria\u2019s attempt to fully free the downstream oil and gas industry has met with a brick wall. The latest effort has also been pushed forward by about 18 months, effectively exempting the current administration which will exit by May 2023 of any burden.\n\nA THISDAY\u2019s analysis in January 2022, had shown that total deductions for petrol subsidy or what the government terms under-recovery was about N1.43 trillion for 2021.\n\nThe journey to zero remittance in January was envisaged by close watchers of the industry as the NNPC only delivered a paltry N14.8 billion, N10.54 billion and N20 billion in October, November and December respectively last year.\n\nIn December, the three tiers of government shared N675.946 billion as FAAC revenue for the month of November while in January, it shared N699.82 billion for December.\n\nBut the total funds shared in February markedly decreased to N574.66 billion, raising concerns over the capacity of sub-nationals to meet their current financial obligations.\n\nThe amount shared by the federal, state and local governments dropped to a four-year low this month, a huge blow to states that are already struggling to survive.\n\nBut in the latest monthly presentation to FAAC held on February 24, obtained by TheCable, NNPC pointed out that the N210 billion shortfall included a December 2021 value of N176.48 billion plus the outstanding value shortfall recovery of N33.90 billion accruing from 2021.\n\nFurthermore, the oil firm stated that it would deduct N242.5 billion, which was the about N143.7 billion for January 2022 recovery and November spot arrears of N98.8 billion, during next month\u2019s FAAC meeting. It, however stated that the national oil company recorded N383 billion as gross revenue from crude oil sales in January, a dip from the projected N414.9 billion.\n\nThe fall would significantly negatively affect states that are presently experiencing fiscal stress and had been kicking against deductions of the shortfall from FAAC remittances.\n\nWhile an ad-hoc committee of the National Economic Council (NEC) had recommended gradual deregulation of petrol prices by February 2022 to reduce the pressure on revenue accruing to states, recently Buhari asked the National Assembly to approve the N2.557 trillion budget for petrol subsidy in 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies OPEC+ have revised down forecast for the 2022 oil market surplus by about 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 1.1 million bpd, according to a base scenario in a technical committee report seen by Reuters on Sunday.\n\nThe data which is part of a report the Joint Technical Committee (JTC) prepares for OPEC+ ministers \u2013 also showed stocks in the developed world standing at 62 million barrels below the 2015 to 2019 average by the end of the year.\n\nIn a previous forecast it had predicted the stocks would reach 20 million barrels above the same average by that point.\n\nMinisters from OPEC and allies led by Russia, a group known as OPEC+, will meet on March 2 to decide whether to increase output by 400,000 bpd in April.\n\nSources from the group told Reuters their output deal is showing no cracks so far after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, and the group is likely to stick to a planned output rise despite crude topping $100 a barrel.\n\nData from a separate JTC report also showed the group produced in January 972,000 bpd less than the targets outlined by the deal, compared with 824,000 less in December.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "APC Governors Still Divided Over Zoning of Party Offices",
          "text": "*Buni expected to come up with list of offices across board\n\n*Party names Buni, Abiodun, Sanwo-Olu, Abdulrahman, others in convention sub-committees\n\n*Governors meet tomorrow, likely to deliberate on election timetable\n\nAdedayo Akinwale in Abuja and Peter Uzoho\n\nA prominent governor of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), yesterday, said division has continued to plague the party over the zoning formula that was made public last week.\n\nSome of them argued the list was sprung on them and the party never adopted it before it was announced. They have, therefore, argued that it could not stand, thus dismissing the zoning arrangement in circulation as mere suggestion.\n\nThey also argued that it was not governors who should announce zoning of party offices; that it should be the function of the party and not governors.\n\nHowever, while they have agreed that the next chairman of the APC should come from the north and the party\u2019s presidential candidate from the southern part of the country, its leaders, mostly governors, were not comfortable with the zoning formula for other positions in the party, THISDAY learnt yesterday.\n\n\u201cIt is the issue of the deputy chairman and others that they are dealing with. Under the current arrangement, they want to retain John James Akpanudoedehe as secretary; Ken Nnamani as Deputy National Chairman and make Farouk Aliu Deputy Chairman, north, which is where the conflict is, because the north-west governors don\u2019t want him to be deputy chairman,\u201d the source explained yesterday.\n\nThe acting Chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary National Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the party, Mai Mala Buni, was expected to come up with a zoning arrangement of offices across board to deliberate upon and perhaps adopt, but that is yet to happen.\n\nBut, with the release of INEC timetable, which has left little room for any further machination, there is renewed urgency to get things done quickly. Between the March 26 date for the party\u2019s convention and beginning of primary season on April 4, according to INEC timetable released on Saturday, there is no enough time for the expected new NWC of the party to prepare for the primaries.\n\nHowever, APC governors would be meeting tomorrow, and their meeting is not be unconnected to the election timetable recently released by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), and the unusual duration between primaries and the general election.\n\nThe governors are also likely to deliberate on the contentious zoning list that is receiving a lot of pushback from party stakeholders.\n\nAccording to the THISDAY source with knowledge of the happenings in APC, who preferred anonymity, the division in the party was telling, adding that some three governors from the north had usurped the powers of the CECPC.\n\nHe said what was widely circulated as zoning formula was no more than a proposal by some elements in the party, which was yet to be approved by the Caretaker/Extraordinary National Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of APC.\n\nThe source claimed that, contrary to the impression being created by those promulgating the unofficial zoning formula, it was just an idea mooted by some people and sold to the party leadership.\n\nHe contended that the zoning arrangement had not undergone proper review by critical stakeholders, let alone getting the approval of the APC leadership led by Buni.\n\nAccording to the source, who was not pleased with some of the recent happenings in the party, the three governors, also from the north, have literally seized the powers of the caretaker committee and were driving the affairs of the party, thereby undermining Buni, for obvious self-interest.\n\nThe source said some of the meetings of the party leadership last week agreed on a new convention date, adding that President Muhanmadu Buhari, might have settled for a former governor of Nasarawa State, Abdullahi Adamu, from North Central, as the consensus choice for national chairman.\n\nThe source, thus, noted that the next president of the country would come from the south for the purpose of geo-political and ethnic balancing, stressing that anything short of this basic understanding could spell doom for the party.\n\nThese, nonetheless, the APC, last night, named the Deputy Senate President Ovie Omo-Agege; Mai Mala Buni, Prince Dapo Abiodun, Abdulrasaq Abdulrahmnan, Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu; and Governor of Cross River State, Ben Ayade, as Chairmen of the national convention sub-committees amongst others, ahead of the party\u2019s convention slated for March 26.\n\nBut in further explaining the involvement of his three northern colleagues in issues relating to the national convention, the source said, Buni had never taken any decision without consulting Buhari, whom he said was Chairman of the National Executive Council (NEC) of the party.\n\nThe three governors, he claimed, had been railroading the party\u2019s leadership into taking many decisions without consulting other members. He contended that this did not augur well for the APC, as these actions had been mostly driven by personal ambition rather than the overall interest of the party.\n\nThe governor said, \u201cObviously, a few governors are trying to usurp the powers of the party. For instance, the postponement of the national convention and the zoning list announced to the press, the governors and other stakeholders of the party never discussed or agreed on it; we just heard it in the media.\n\n\u201cAs far as some of us are concerned, that zoning list making the rounds is only a proposal by those few governors. The party may well adopt it or may set up a zoning committee, which to some of us is the right thing to do. The ideal thing was for us to have set up a zoning committee that would agree on the zones to allocate the party positions to.\n\n\u201cSo, by announcing a list that was not agreed on as the party\u2019s position, was more like an imposition. No decision was taken. The president only said all he wanted was to make sure we have a consensus. No decision and they just went and organised a press conference with a zoning list.\n\n\u201cThe proper thing is for the party to have a zoning committee that would consult and arrive at the zoning formula. Even if they are going to arrive at the same answer, they must be seen to have consulted with members of the party. That is very important so that our party is not seen as a party in confusion, like the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), would like to make Nigerians believe.\n\n\u201cThere was a meeting to announce the postponement of the convention and some governors were unhappy that the convention was being postponed and they were not aware and that really got the governors upset.\u201d\n\nThe governor also disclosed that based on the decision to zone the APC national chairman to the north, the party\u2019s presidential candidate must come from the south.\n\nHis words, \u201cThe presidential candidate is going to come from the south and it is likely going to be a Christian presidential candidate. You cannot have the chairman of the party to be a Muslim and a presidential candidate a Muslim, it is not possible.\n\n\u201cAnd if the presidential candidate is a Christian, the vice is going to be a Muslim from the north, invariably, you cannot have a Christian vice president from the north, when the presidential candidate is a Christian.\u201d\n\nThe source, who further buttressed his position with the setting up of zoning committee by the party, contended that he had been vindicated by that development, adding that the route earlier taken was synonymous with placing the cart before the horse.\n\nWhile condemning the activities of the three northern governors, he said the Buni-led committee should be commended for the stability it brought to the party. He claimed that a lot of the APC governors were happy with Buni, because of how he had been able to resolve the disputes in the APC states without undermining the governors.\n\nHe stressed, \u201cBut some have remained antagonistic and have been scheming to have their way obviously, because of their selfish political interests and despite benefiting immensely from Buni\u2019s decision to recognise the excos.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that Buni didn\u2019t betray the governors, because this same man, if not for him, most of the governors would not have had their excos as the recognised party structures in their states. He made sure every governor got what he wanted, which is unprecedented.\n\n\u201cThe governors would have been battling with their contenders or the former governors in their states. But Buni made it favourable for the governors by making sure that right from the ward to the state EXCO levels, the governors have those they wanted in charge.\n\n\u201cThis same man (Buni) was also able to bring in the Zamfara, Ebonyi and Cross River governors, to the party. So, Buni has helped in stabilising the party. That was why when some persons were accusing him of misconduct and were making noise, the man said he would resign if they continued the noise and everybody calmed down.\u201d\n\nThe source, however, reiterated that Buhari wanted the chairman of the party to come from North-central and has settled for Adamu as the next party chairman as well as the deputy chairmen, a decision he said the president had communicated to the CECPC.\n\n\u201cHowever, Buni told the president that he wants to retain the Secretary of the CECPC as the party\u2019s secretary, which he has agreed to, but when some governors heard it, they were up in arms, because everybody as you know has different interest.\n\n\u201cEverybody wants to have party leadership that they feel would do their bidding, because we all have our different ambitions,\u201d he said.\n\nOn sub-committee membership for national convention, the party, in a short statement, named other members of the sub-committees as Governor of Ebonyi State, Dave Umahi, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, among others.\n\nNational Secretary of the party, Senator John Akpanudoedehe said the 20 sub-committees constituted by the party were in line with the schedule of activities for the National Convention as resolved by the caretaker committee.\n\nThe party noted that each of the committees, except the Central Planning Committee, had a 12-man team with all Caretaker Committee as members.\n\nThe party added that the Secretariat Support Committee had a seven-man team, while the Accreditation Committee has 41 members and other committees were made up of 40 members each.\n\nAccording to APC, the Central Planning Committee is chaired by Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni; Screening Committee is chaired by Kwara State Governor, Abdulrasaq Abdulrahmnan; while the Election Committee is chaired by Ogun State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun.\n\nMr. Emmanuel Emeka is the secretary.\n\nGovernor Hope Uzodima heads the Screening Appeal Committee, Governor of Kastina State, Aminu Bello Masari would serve as Election Appeal Committee chairman, while the Legal Committee is headed by the Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami.\n\nGovernor of Zamfara State, Bello Matawalle heads Accommodation Committee, while Venue/Decoration/Site Servicing Committee has Governor David Umahi of Eboyin State as its chairman, and Governor Simon Bako Lalong of Plateau State heads Transport/Logistics Committee.\n\nGovernor of Gombe State Inuwa Yahaya will chair Budget Committee, and Finance Committee is headed by Governor Abubakar Badaru of Jigawa State, while Digital Committee has Kashifu Inuwa as chairman, and Convention Legacy and Rapporteur Committee has Borno State Governor, Prof. Babagana Zulum as chairman.\n\nOther committees are: Media/Publicity headed by Sanwo-Olu, Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State heads the Security/Protocol Committee, while Entertainment/Welfare Committee has Deputy Speaker, Hon Ahmed Wase, as chairman. THISDAY was reliably informed that some alterations may still be effected on the list.\n\nAPC had earlier fixed February 26 for its national convention before it was rescheduled last week after a meeting of the party\u2019s governors with Buhari.\n\nAt the meeting, the party also agreed to zone the national chairmanship position to the North-central, while the north would swap other party positions with the south as obtained in the Adams Oshiomhole National Working Committee (NWC).\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022PANDEF, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Middle Belt Forum hail Buhari for signing electoral law\n\nDeji Elumoye and Chuks Okocha in Abuja, Christopher Isiguzo in Enugu and Seriki Adinoyi in Jos\n\nFollowing the signing of the new electoral bill into law by President Muhammadu Buhari, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) yesterday released a new timetable for the 2023 elections, with the conduct of party primaries, including the resolution of disputes arising from them now scheduled for April 4, 2022, to June 3, 2022.\n\nThis is coming as the apex Igbo socio-political organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo; Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) and the Middle Belt Forum (MBF) have hailed President Buhari for signing the electoral bill.\n\nUnder the new timetable for the 2023 general election, INEC has shifted the presidential and National Assembly elections from February 18 to February 25, 2023, while the governorship elections will hold on March 11, 2023.\n\nAddressing a press conference yesterday, INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, said the presidential and National Assembly elections would now hold on February 25 next year instead of the earlier announced date of February 18.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the commission has decided to adjust the dates of the 2023 general election to ensure compliance with the provisions of the new law.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, the presidential and National Assembly elections will now hold on Saturday, February 25, 2023, while the governorship and state Houses of Assembly elections will hold two weeks later on Saturday, March 11, 2023. With this adjustment, the 2023 general election is now 363 days away,\u201d he explained.\n\nYakubu disclosed that under the law, there are critical time-bound activities from the publication of notice of election to the conduct of polls, which form the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for elections.\n\nAccording to him, some of the critical activities and their dates of implementation are as follows: \u201cPublication of Notice of Election \u2013 Monday, February 28, 2022;\n\n\u201cConduct of party primaries, including the resolution of disputes arising from them \u2013 Monday, April 4, 2022, to Friday, June 3, 2022.\n\n\u201cSubmission of nomination forms to INEC via the online portal for Presidential and National Assembly election \u2013 9.00 am on Friday, June 10, 2022, to 6.00 pm on Friday, June 17, 2022;\n\n\u201cSubmission of nomination forms to INEC via the online nomination portal for Governorship and State Assembly elections \u2013 9.00 am on Friday, July 1, 2022, to 6.00 pm on Friday, July 15, 2022;\n\n\u201cCommencement of campaign by political parties for Presidential and National Assembly elections -Wednesday, September 28, 2022; commencement of campaign by political parties for governorship and State Assembly elections \u2013 Wednesday, October 12, 2022; last day of the campaign by political parties for Presidential and National Assembly elections \u2013 midnight on Thursday, February 23, 2023; last day of the campaign by political parties for governorship and State Assembly elections \u2013 midnight on Thursday, March 9, 2023,\u201d Yakubu further explained.\n\nThe INEC chairman stated explained that the Notice of Election would be published in INEC offices in all the states of the Federation as required by law on Monday, February 28, 2022.\n\nYakubu said that with the coming into force of the Electoral Act 2022, the commission would work assiduously to conclude and publish new Regulations and Guidelines for the Conduct of Elections that are consistent with the Act.\n\n\u201cThese Regulations and Guidelines, as well as Manuals issued by the Commission, are all part of the legal regulatory framework for elections.\n\n\u201cTheir timely publication will enable all stakeholders in the electoral process to become conversant with their provisions as they prepare for the 2023 general election,\u201d he said.\n\nThe INEC chairman, who described the new electoral law as historic said that it was because it was the fourth time since the restoration of democracy in Nigeria in May 1999 that the Electoral Act was repealed and re-enacted.\n\nHe explained that the 1998 \u2013 1999 elections were administered by transitional decrees until the 2001 Electoral Act was passed into law.\n\nThen, he said, the Act was repealed and re-enacted as the Electoral Act 2002 which was in turn repealed and re-enacted in 2006, 2010 and now we have the 2022 Electoral Act.\n\nHe said that in 2017, the commission decided to establish fixed dates for general elections in Nigeria, explaining that the decision was based on INEC\u2019s determination to create certainty in the electoral calendar and to enable all stakeholders in the electoral process to prepare adequately for elections.\n\n\u201cBy that decision, presidential and National Assembly elections shall hold on the third Saturday of February of each general election year, while governorship and state Houses of Assembly elections shall follow two weeks later,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said the 2023 general election was initially scheduled to commence on February 18, 2023, with the presidential and National Assembly elections, followed by the governorship and state Houses of Assembly elections on March 4, 2023.\n\nHe, however, pointed out that the Commission could not release the detailed Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the General Election, as it normally would, because of the pending enactment of the Electoral Act 2022.\n\nWith the bill now being signed into law, therefore, he said, the Electoral Act 2022, together with the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended), form the legal basis for conducting all elections in Nigeria.\n\nIn particular, he said that the Electoral Act provides strict timelines for the implementation of electoral activities based on the date of the general election.\n\n\u201cOne of the significant timelines is the publication of Notice of Election not later than 360 days before the day appointed for holding an election, which has now lapsed,\u201d he added.\n\nHe reminded stakeholders, especially the political parties, of their responsibility to adhere strictly to the timelines in this Timetable and Schedule of Activities, as well as all other timelines established by the commission.\n\n\u201cIt is necessary that all political parties comply with the extant legal framework, ensure proper organisation and management of party primaries and the nomination of qualified candidates to prevent unnecessary litigations and rancour,\u201d Yakubu told all shareholders.\n\nSpeaking on the capacity of INEC to transmit all elections results in real-time, Yakubu said that from the reports available to the commission and its independent assessment INEC can transmit elections results to all the 774 local government areas and the 120,000 polling wards across the Federation.\n\nOn the BVAS, the INEC cha\u00ecrman said so far in the six by-elections in Ondo, Imo, Plateau and Cross Rivers states that there were no complaints against its operations\n\nHe pointed out the commission is not anticipating any extra budget to implement the new electoral law.\n\nPANDEF, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Middle Belt Forum Hail Buhari for Signing Electoral Law\n\nMeanwhile, the apex Igbo socio-political organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo; PANDEF and the MBF have hailed President Buhari for signing the electoral bill.\n\nOhanaeze Ndigbo\u2019s National Publicity Secretary, Chief Alex Chiedozie Ogbonna, told THISDAY yesterday that it was a welcome development that the president finally signed the bill into law.\n\nHe, therefore, challenged the INEC to ensure that nothing jeopardises the credibility of the 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cThe president had assured Nigerians that he will leave an improved electoral system by the time he serves out his tenure and we are glad that today, we now have an Electoral Act that substantially captures the key ingredients of a working, responsible and responsive democracy.\n\n\u201cThe President and National Assembly members have done their parts; it is now left for INEC to deliver. Let them know clearly that there\u2019s no room for excuses any longer,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Ohanaeze spokesman however declared that the law would not completely remove malpractices from the nation\u2019s electoral system, explaining that the political actors would always seek ways of circumventing the system in their desperation for power.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always had laws and the politicians know about that. One clear thing is that the malpractices are induced by the political elites. They will always find ways of achieving their plans. We are however hopeful that the situation will be appreciably reduced,\u201d he added.\n\nOn its part, PANDEF has also applauded President Buhari for signing into law the Electoral Act Amendment Bill.\n\nThe Forum, in a formal reaction by the spokesman, Hon. Ken Robinson, also called on the INEC to ensure the full implementation of the new electoral law.\n\nDescribing the president\u2019s assent to the bill as a welcome development after all the dilly-dally, Robinson said the action was perhaps the best thing President Buhari has done in terms of strengthening the nation\u2019s democratic process.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari and the National Assembly both deserve commendation. The ball is now in the court of the electoral commission to ensure that the Act is implemented to the letter in the entire electoral process, with adherence to every detail, in all parts of the country,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident of the MBF, Dr Bitrus Pogu, has also congratulated President Buhari for signing the Electoral Act into law, describing it as a welcome development.\n\nHe said Nigerians yearned to have a process that would translate to a transparent election that every Nigerian would trust.\n\nThe page however said it was not yet over, pointing out that INEC would need to do more to complement what the President has done, and ensure a credible election.\n\n\u201cWe welcome and congratulate Mr President for signing the Electoral Act into law.\n\n\u201cHaving signed, the job is not over yet, because we would want a two-stage transmission of results. First, INEC must ensure that in an election, the figures of accredited voters are first transmitted from the polling unit before the result of the election. This is to ensure that the figures of election results do not exceed the figures of accredited voters.\n\n\u201cIf that is not done, we are back to square one. The riggers out there will manipulate the system by writing the results at the polling units and asking the electoral officers to transmit what they have written. But if the accredited voters\u2019 figures are transmitted first, that will be difficult because the figure\u2019s results cannot be bloated above the accredited voters\u2019 figures.\n\n\u201cStage two is for the election results to be transmitted from the polling unit; these results must tally with figures of accredited voters in that polling unit.\n\nSo, we are calling on the National Assembly and INEC to ensure that this two-stage process is adhered to, to have a transparent and credible election.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Aggregate money supply rises to N44.56tn\n\nFestus Akanbi\n\nIn line with the resolve of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to halt a regime of arbitrage in the foreign exchange market, some Nigerian banks have started exposing the identities of customers, who allegedly obtained dollars by false pretence, and traded them at a profit in the parallel market.\n\nThis is coming as the aggregate broad money supply, M3 Money, which represents the amount of money circulating in the economy, rose to N44.56 trillion in January, representing a 1.70 per cent growth year-to-date, a report by the CBN, has shown.\n\nSome bank customers have been taking advantage of the lucrative 37 per cent differential between the official and black market exchange rates by obtaining the dollar at the official rate of about N416, only to subsequently sell in the unauthorised market at a more expensive average rate of about N570.\n\nThese customers can beat regulations by presenting false travel documents, prompting the apex bank to direct banks to notify their customers of an impending crackdown on saboteurs in the forex market.\n\nHowever, a report by Bloomberg yesterday revealed that some banks have begun to implement the CBN\u2019s directives by publishing the names of clients found to have filed suspicious claims for forex transactions on their websites last week.\n\nFor instance, Zenith Bank Plc, the nation\u2019s biggest lender by market value, has published 987 names of customers engaging in the illegal practice on its website, Fidelity Bank Plc identified 83 customers; First City Monument Bank Plc listed eight names so far, while Wema Bank published one name. The list of banks that complied also included the United Bank for Africa Plc.\n\nThe apex bank had directed banks to identify such customers and ensure they refund the hard currency. The regulator first alerted banks of the ongoing practice last year.\n\nThe CBN had said: \u201cConsequently, further to the various measures already put in place, all banks are hereby directed to publish on their websites the names and BVN of defaulting customers who present fake travel documents or cancel their tickets and fail to return the purchased PTA/BTA within two weeks as stipulated in the customer declaration form signed by them.\u201d\n\nSome deposit money banks acting on the directive of the CBN had sent notices to their customers warning that identities and Bank Verification Number (BVN) of those who contravene the apex bank\u2019s new forex policy on overseas personal and business travels would be published.\n\nThe CBN had also directed that travellers who buy foreign exchange from banks for travel purposes but fail to embark on the trip after two weeks of their scheduled travel date must return the forex to the banks.\n\nThe banks in their notices also pointed out consequences for those customers who engage in fraudulent and unethical practices with regards to the purchase of Personal Travel Allowances (PTA) and Business Travel Allowances (BTA).\n\nIn its notice to customers, one of the Tier 1 banks had said: \u201cWe have been directed by the Central Bank of Nigeria to inform all our customers that unethical practices to circumvent the new CBN policy on the sale of forex, such as the presentation of false travel documents, visas, and the cancellation of flight tickets, after purchasing personal travel allowance and business travel allowance, will no longer be tolerated.\n\n\u201cDefaulting customers who present fraudulent travel credentials or cancel their tickets and fail to refund the purchased PTA and BTA within two weeks, as stated in the signed customer declaration form, will have their identities and bank verification numbers published.\n\n\u201cWe aim to implement this policy immediately as an organisation that is fully compliant with the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s rules and regulations.\n\n\u201cOur bank is committed to partnering with the CBN to ensure a transparent, efficient and stable FX Market that meets the needs of all legitimate users.\u201d\n\nAggregate Money Supply Rises to N44.56tn in January\n\nMeanwhile, the aggregate broad money supply, M3 Money, which represents the amount of money circulating in the economy, rose to N44.56 trillion in January, representing a 1.70 per cent growth year-to-date, a report by the CBN, has shown.\n\nA recently released Depository Corporations Survey by the apex bank, quoted by Cowry Asset Management Limited, showed that the growth was driven by a 1.46 per cent increase in M2 to N44.46 trillion and a sharp increase in CBN bills to N107.38 billion, from N100 million in the preceding month) amid efforts to rein in surplus liquidity.\n\nM2 is a measure of the money supply that includes cash, checking deposits, and is easily convertible near money\n\nHowever, analysts from Cowry Asset Management Limited noted that the growth in central bank bills also came with its cost implications, as well as increased indebtedness of the apex bank.\n\nAccording to the latest edition of Cowry Financial Markets Review, Outlook & Recommended Stocks, growth in Broad Money supply was on the back of increases in Quasi Money (consisting of time deposits, near-maturing securities, foreign currencies, etc) and Narrow Money or M1 Money (comprising demand deposits and currency outside banks) by 0.34 per cent and 3.03 per cent to N25.74 trillion and N18.72 trillion, respectively.\n\n\u201cIncreases in quasi money may not be unconnected to, among other things, growing appetite of pension funds administrators to place retirement savings with commercial banks at relatively attractive interest rates. \u201cAs reported in the February 11, 2022 edition of our CWR, we observed that money moved out of T-bills securities to Local Money Market Securities (LMMS), especially bank placements,\u201d the report stated.\n\nIt noted that the total funds invested in this investment category rose by 20.04 per cent to N2.03 trillion in December 2021 (lifting its share of the total assets to 15.09 per cent), from N1.69 trillion in December 2020 (or 13.71 per cent of total assets).\n\nThe CBN document was quoted as saying that that Reserve Money rose by 2.36 per cent to N13.61 trillion as bank reserves with the Central Bank increased by 3.51 per cent to N10.32 trillion (partly in tandem with increased deposits at the banks), to partly offset by a 5.52 per cent decline in currency outside banks to N2.78 trillion.\n\nOn the asset side, Net Domestic Credit grew by 2.49 per cent to N49.73 trillion as Credit to the Private Sector upped by 0.73 per cent to N35.45 trillion while Credit to the Government increased by 7.13 per cent to N14.28 trillion. However, Net Foreign Assets moderated by 1.79 per cent amid pressures on Nigeria\u2019s foreign sector.\n\nMeanwhile, Cowry Assets analysts have warned that the rise in the Narrow Money without a faster rise in GDP may result in higher inflation in 2022.\n\nIt noted that in 2021, the velocity of Narrow Money moderated to 10.16 times from 11.49 times in the preceding year even though Narrow Money rose by 14 per cent over the period, saying the productivity of the country needs a lot of improvement going forward.\n\nThe report warned that the escalation of hostilities between Russia and Ukraine and the attendant instability in the global oil market will exert pressure on the nation\u2019s external reserves.\n\nIt said: \u201cMeanwhile, in the wake of the Russian Invasion of Ukraine, we are concerned that Nigeria would not optimally benefit from any ensuing rise in crude oil prices due to its suboptimal crude oil production. This would increase pressure on the external reserves as well as exchange rates as oil dollar revenues, its primary foreign currency earner, would struggle to meet the higher cost of imported refined products in addition to other imports.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

It is raging across the country, from air, land and sea. It must stop now,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cRussian missile and air bombardments are pounding Ukrainian cities day and night. The capital, Kyiv, is encircled from all sides.\n\n\u201cIn the face of the continuing attacks, Kyiv\u2019s three million residents are being forced to seek safety in their homes, improvised bomb shelters, and in the city\u2019s subways.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe Ukrainian government has distributed a meaningful number of arms to the population with the stated objective to participate in the defence of the country. According to UNHCR, half a million of Ukrainians have already fled across the country\u2019s borders.\n\n\u201cAlthough Russian strikes are reportedly largely targeting Ukrainian military facilities, we have credible accounts of residential buildings, critical civilian infrastructure and other non-military targets sustaining heavy damage.\n\n\u201cThis escalating violence \u2014 which is resulting in civilian deaths, including children \u2014 is totally unacceptable. Enough is enough. Soldiers need to move back to their barracks. Leaders need to move to peace. Civilians must be protected. International humanitarian and human rights law must be upheld.\n\n\u201cThe sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine, within its internationally recognised borders, must be respected in line with the General Assembly resolutions.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also expressed worry over Putin\u2019s recent directive to put nuclear forces on \u201chigh alert\u201d, adding that the action isn\u2019t justified.\n\n\u201cWe are facing a tragedy for Ukraine, but also a major regional crisis with potentially disastrous implications for us all. Yesterday, Russian nuclear forces were put on high alert. This is a chilling development. The mere idea of a nuclear conflict is simply inconceivable. Nothing can justify the use of nuclear weapons,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe face what could easily become Europe\u2019s worst humanitarian and refugee crisis in decades, with the numbers of refugees and internally displaced multiplying by the minute.\n\n\u201cI am grateful for the compassion, generosity and solidarity of Ukraine\u2019s neighbours who are taking in those seeking safety.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is important that this solidarity is extended without any discrimination based on race, religion or ethnicity. The neighbouring countries will need all our support in the days and weeks to come. The United Nations will continue to assist with these efforts.\u201d",

It is raging across the country, from air, land and sea. It must stop now,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cRussian missile and air bombardments are pounding Ukrainian cities day and night. The capital, Kyiv, is encircled from all sides.\n\n\u201cIn the face of the continuing attacks, Kyiv\u2019s three million residents are being forced to seek safety in their homes, improvised bomb shelters, and in the city\u2019s subways.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe Ukrainian government has distributed a meaningful number of arms to the population with the stated objective to participate in the defence of the country. According to UNHCR, half a million of Ukrainians have already fled across the country\u2019s borders.\n\n\u201cAlthough Russian strikes are reportedly largely targeting Ukrainian military facilities, we have credible accounts of residential buildings, critical civilian infrastructure and other non-military targets sustaining heavy damage.\n\n\u201cThis escalating violence \u2014 which is resulting in civilian deaths, including children \u2014 is totally unacceptable. Enough is enough. Soldiers need to move back to their barracks. Leaders need to move to peace. Civilians must be protected. International humanitarian and human rights law must be upheld.\n\n\u201cThe sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine, within its internationally recognised borders, must be respected in line with the General Assembly resolutions.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also expressed worry over Putin\u2019s recent directive to put nuclear forces on \u201chigh alert\u201d, adding that the action isn\u2019t justified.\n\n\u201cWe are facing a tragedy for Ukraine, but also a major regional crisis with potentially disastrous implications for us all. Yesterday, Russian nuclear forces were put on high alert. This is a chilling development. The mere idea of a nuclear conflict is simply inconceivable. Nothing can justify the use of nuclear weapons,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe face what could easily become Europe\u2019s worst humanitarian and refugee crisis in decades, with the numbers of refugees and internally displaced multiplying by the minute.\n\n\u201cI am grateful for the compassion, generosity and solidarity of Ukraine\u2019s neighbours who are taking in those seeking safety.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is important that this solidarity is extended without any discrimination based on race, religion or ethnicity. The neighbouring countries will need all our support in the days and weeks to come. The United Nations will continue to assist with these efforts.\u201d",

          "title": "Development finance institutions are looking to Africa\u2019s digital frontier for impact and returns",
          "text": "Development finance institutions have long funded traditional finance and infrastructure projects in Africa; now they\u2019re increasingly backing Africa\u2019s digital future. What will this mean for the continent?\n\nOn the about page of the UK government\u2019s overseas investment arm, the CDC Group declares its goal to be \u201cdo good without losing money\u201d. That may well be the universal motto of its counterparts like Proparco, the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) or any of the many institutions that recently jointly committed to investing $80 billion in African businesses over the next 5 years.\n\nIn theory, these \u201cImpact-first\u201d funds typically focus on how to move the development needle when they invest. This is even more true in Africa, where both development and the capital it needs are sorely lacking. However, what is arguably more important than how much capital is available is how the capital is allocated. Now that development finance institutions (DFIs), which represent the bulk of available capital in Africa, are looking to technology startups to support development goals and find returns, players in that ecosystem, and Africa in general, need to step up the thinking and conversations that should shape the future of Africa\u2019s digital economy.\n\nDFI interests and money are not new\n\nTo be clear, DFIs are not new in Africa. They have been here, at least since the Colonial Development Corporation was set up by the UK\u2019s Overseas Resources Development Act in 1948. That Colonial Development Corporation became the Commonwealth Development Corporation Group (CDC Group) and will become British International Investment (BII) later this year. Both the CDC Group and peers like Proparco, FMO, and others have been active in Africa for decades. What is interesting is the role they play in funding technology startups and funds in Africa. They are, after all, impact investors, and asking how much impact potential they see in Africa\u2019s insurgent tech startups is a legitimate question.\n\nAt a surface level, the implication of more capital from DFIs going to African VC funds or technology businesses is clear. It means capital for experiments and growth will probably be less of a headache. This can mean a variety of things, depending on how it is executed and engaged with by relevant stakeholders. For example, it can mean growth stage capital is here, that is if DFIs, which are notoriously slow and bureaucratic, can fix their processes. It can mean more opportunities unlocked as DFI money de-risks investment in high risk but critical business models. In short, it can mean everything that better access to capital brings plus development impact.\n\nAfrica\u2019s telecoms infrastructure, the backbone of its digital growth today, is an example of DFI money doing good while making returns. Image source: Wikimedia\n\nBut it can also mean DFIs\u2019s public money competing with private investors over the best (or less risky) deals, and there is some ugly history that makes this scenario, wild as it may seem plausible. It can mean that we are deepening our vulnerability to public money that is itself vulnerable to political currents, especially foreign public money. Of course, the reality is that we lack significant options and, on the balance, this is a much better deal than where we are coming from.\n\nSo, why are we seeing this interest and influx of capital backing the funds that invest in African startups, and in some cases, directly backing startups? Ido Sum, a partner at TLcom Capital thinks this activity is happening because individual pioneers in development finance institutions \u201csaw the potential and ignited internal processes in their respective institutions to consider VC as an impactful and material asset class.\u201d\n\nThat makes sense. DFIs have been active on the continent for decades. Mo Ibrahim\u2019s Celtel, (later acquired by Bharti Airtel) is a good example of how DFI activity supported the development of Africa\u2019s telecommunications infrastructure. That first-mover advantage or least \u201cactively-prospecting\u201d advantage in growth markets can enable them to see and take advantage of opportunities early on. Sum agrees. He says that \u201c[DFIs] were able to see the changes in dynamics and in the creation of a new generation of startup companies through working with early managers on the continent like ourselves [TLcom Capital] and others.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cAfter supporting the establishment of the African PE industry, with the help of some entrepreneurial team like ourselves, several DFIs decided in late 2015 to try and support the establishment of a local VC industry on the continent\u2014that hardly existed before. With EIB and AfDB being the pioneers, and Proparco, BIO, IFC and CDC following shortly after.\u201d\n\nFollowing this first foray into backing \u201cfund of funds,\u201d TLcom Capital, for instance, became the first institutionally backed commercial VC in Africa, when it closed $40 million for its TIDE Africa Fund in 2017. Since then, DFI money backing VC funds have only gone up, and in some cases, they have invested directly into ventures.\n\nThis is a long-winded way of saying more money than ever is coming into African startups because DFIs judge technology businesses to be a good way to deliver their impact mandates and make handsome returns\u2014or at least, not lose too much in a market as immature as Africa.\n\nDo we need DFI money?\n\nYes, in short, and more specifically, yes because the capital that Africa needs to develop her economies is in short supply. When DFIs invest in emerging markets for example, their investments should ideally skew towards the more difficult or riskier businesses that private investors almost automatically avoid. In other words, DFI money is welcome because it can enable founders to take on tough problems. Tough problems and sometimes obstinate legacy monopolies that thrive on maintaining friction need tough money to break through seed-stage business. That type of growth capital needs to be substantial. \u201cToday, a fund can raise capital up to say $50 million from family offices and high-net-worth individuals. [But] larger funds still require DFIs, almost without exception,\u201d says David van Dijk, investment advisor and co-founder of African Business Angel Network.\n\nThere is some indication that local limited partners (LPs) are stepping up. For the first close of TLcom Capital\u2019s $150 million fund, FBQuest, and Sango Capital committed additional funds, doubling down on their earlier commitments to TLcom Capital. However, traditional sources of capital for funds investing in African companies remain locked out. As long as the doors of pension funds, insurance companies, or university endowments remain closed, DFIs will continue to play a strong role in financing what you might call Africa\u2019s future. It\u2019s not what can be. It is what is.\n\nThat does not mean DFIs are going it alone. Far from it. A number of DFIs explicitly make it a part of their mandate to \u201cinspire\u201d third-party capital to come alongside them. This co-investment strategy rests on the back of the fact that the public component of DFI money is, in theory, willing to shoulder a greater share of the risk. The Dutch entrepreneurial development bank FMO, for example, leverages a first-loss guarantee to encourage private investors to co-invest alongside. This de-risked investment\u2014the near-technical name for how DFIs/MFBs enable private investor partners to put up money\u2014is lacking or insufficient in Africa.\n\nAn obligatory note here on \u201cde-risked capital\u201d from impact funds. Nimrod Zalk, Industrial Development Advisor in the Office of the Director-General of the South African Department of Trade, Industry and Competition, notes that it is unclear if the much-talked-about \u201cblended finance principles\u201d de-risk projects to enable development, or if they simply de-risk investor returns through complex financial engineering, regardless of impact outcomes.\n\nThere is a cost for over dependence on DFIs\n\nEverything has a price, even capital, and sometimes we will only truly know how much after the fact. That said, the biggest obvious risk of overly depending on DFI funding to build Africa\u2019s nascent technology businesses is ownership. Not just equity ownership, but ownership of the direction, the data and the results that technology can create for Africa.\n\n\u201cIt is unclear if the much-talked-about \u201cblended finance\u201d de-risk projects to enable development, or if they simply de-risk investor returns through complex financial engineering, regardless of impact outcomes.\u201d \u2013 Dr. Nimrod Zalk, Advisor, South African Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)\n\nIt\u2019s easy to celebrate the latest fundraise from startup X. Almost everyone agrees that building an impactful and profitable business is difficult, but there is surprisingly little conversation around what building a truly Africa-led ecosystem that is both sustainable and economically viable means.\n\nAlso because DFIs especially foreign DFIs or multilateral financial institutions (MFBs) are run from offices geographically distant from where their target investments are located, the question of competent allocation remains. There is also the small matter of how little data is available and how much less is shared. The result? Everyone operates in self-contained silos from London, Paris, or Amsterdam, or even (looking at you AfDB) Abidjan. \u201cHow are you able to invest in these companies if you\u2019re not on the ground?\u201d asks David van Dijk, himself a seasoned investor.\n\nWhere leadership is lacking, impact is a fairytale.\n\nBeing African-led does not refer to a nominal leadership. Instead it means a system that is driven by targeted investments and solutions in the most pressing problem areas in Africa. In a perfect world, DFI and MFB activity in Africa\u2019s fairly young venture space should be led (not nominally) by African development finance institutions. In the real world of today, however, these organisations do not even have sufficient capital to lead the original impact mandates for which they were created.\n\nWho will own Africa\u2019s digital future? Image source: Olumide Bamgbelu/Unsplash\n\n\u201cA lot of African countries have a challenging fiscal environment. The governments cannot finance their development banks. This is where the big multilateral development banks can help,\u201d says Zalk. He adds that national development banks in Africa are themselves plagued by a myriad of issues that affect their performance. \u201cThere are issues around governance. They have made bad loans and bad investments in the past that might have been driven by corruption or lack of technical know-how.\u201d All of this combines to lock out the type of capital scale that is needed to say nothing of directing these funds towards something as alien as venture capital. To unlock and direct capital better, Zalk suggests that national development institutions in Africa should be consolidated. That should help these institutions gain more financial clout and firepower to direct African technology to the areas of greatest need.\n\nFor example, Zalk who is also a non-executive director on the board of the South African Industrial Development Corporation is unconvinced about the hype around service-based technology. \u201cA lot of attention has been focused on things like payment based systems like M-pesa and shopping on ecommerce stores. I believe what is being missed out is [the opportunity] to industrialise,\u201d he argues, \u201cHistorically, manufacturing is one of those places where countries have been able to adapt technology for development.\u201d He believes that the convention of discouraging local production over imports is faulty, \u201cOver the last few decades, there has been discouragement from conventional policy advice about building local production systems, and a view that you can always import the things you need. But the COVID crisis points to the need to change the structure of African economies. It is no longer sufficient to export primary and semi-processed commodities, we must find ways to add much more local value, and construct more sophisticated production structures.\u201d\n\nRather than directing \u201cimpact money\u201d to the latest shiny software technology, Zalk believes that investing in agricultural research and 21-century relevant education for example, are more important. That \u201cindustrialisation over software\u201d argument is one that is very nuanced and nationally disparate. Africa is, after all, not one country or even a functioning union of countries. What one country needs may not necessarily be what the other will need. The point again is that by passively accepting that \u201cDFIs bring the money\u201d, we unconsciously give up the more subtle type of ownership in how what is being built is built.\n\nNo one disputes today that Africa needs and welcomes DFI money. We simply do not have, or have not unlocked, enough capital from here, and there are a myriad of issues why. But, we are beginning to see local players step up, especially in MENA and South Africa.\n\nKnowledge yield is a missing \u2018key\u2019\n\n\u2018Knowledge yield\u2019 is my fancy term for how much knowledge return on investment (KROI) an investment brings. It is basically asking alongside any investment update, \u2018What is my money teaching me?\u2019\n\nWhere money comes from is not as relevant as what it teaches. Within some contexts, capital conveys information. So, beyond simply looking at impact metrics and returns, it is important to ask what businesses that have received investments teach in the short to medium term about the African consumer and market landscape. This is a big conversation, not just something for the stage, but something that should intimately concern every person invested in the future of Africa.\n\nKnowledge yield is not obvious on balance sheets as traditional returns on investment typically are. It is the result of deliberately seeking non-intuitive market data to judge assumptions and verify claims because capital in itself, is a zombie. Instead of simply fighting to have a piece of the DFI pie, companies, governments and even private investors can redirect their energy towards learning from the data yield of past and current investment, building better data systems so that they can more artfully distribute capital.\n\nYes, Africa still clearly needs the so-called patient capital from DFIs. We also need to learn how lead that capital, to transform the continent.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Payroll tech heats up in Africa, on the heels of a booming fintech sector",
          "text": "Across Africa, innovation in the fintech space is at an all-time high as consumers increasingly rely on mobile financial services, startups roll out newer digital finance solutions, and venture capital investors incrementally back founders playing in this landscape.\n\nLast year, fintechs accounted for nearly $3 billion, or two-thirds of all the investment secured by African startups, per a report by markets insights firm Briter Bridges. That\u2019s more than double the $1.35 billion raised by fintechs in 2020 and three times the amount secured in 2019.\n\nAmid the fintech boom, new frontiers are being explored by African entrepreneurs in the sector, one of which is payroll and corporate benefits management. In this sub-segment, a number of startups have sprung up\u2014each with similar but distinct business models\u2014looking to tap into the human resources management (HRM) market on the continent that\u2019s historically relied on analog back-office processes.\n\nTraditional payroll payment processes typically take three or more days to fulfil. But it\u2019s possible to reduce this process to minutes by deploying new payment methods being championed by tech startups. Through web portals or mobile self-service apps, companies can track time, process a locally compliant payroll, and pay their employees.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nOne of the most notable players in this market is Bento Africa, a Nigerian startup founded in 2019, whose cloud-based solutions help African businesses automate the disbursement of salaries and other statutory remittances, including taxes and pension.\n\nThe company currently serves over 900 active Nigerian businesses across sectors, Bento co-founder and CEO Ebun Okubanjo told TechCabal in an interview. Last December, the startup announced an expansion to Ghana, Kenya, and Rwanda, and plans to set up operations in six other markets in Africa by the end of this year.\n\nThat announcement came a month after YC-backed Workpay, a Nairobi-based startup that also plays in the payroll and HR management space, expanded in the other direction aiming to tap small and medium-sized businesses in West Africa.\n\nFounded in 2019, Workpay allows SMEs to easily manage and pay their employees from anywhere in Africa, and in a marked difference from Bento\u2019s offerings, Workpay makes it possible for companies with remote teams to pay in 15 currencies across the continent as well as hire in Africa legally without the need to set up a local entity.\n\nWorkpay claims its platform currently supports 400 businesses and counts among its clients Flutterwave, Paystack, and Yoco. As of November 2021, the company processed $2.5 million in monthly payroll disbursements to banks and mobile wallets.\n\nA snapshot of the Bento Africa website. Image credit: Bento.\n\nFrom payroll to employee benefits\n\nBroader ecosystems are being created around the payroll fintech space in Africa, with startups doing much more than process paychecks and offering complementary benefits, including salary advances, loans, pension, health, and insurance covers.\n\nBento, for instance, leverages its payroll data to provide tailored credit solutions to employees on its platform. Okubanjo told TechCabal that the startup offers better rates than traditional retail lenders and disbursement is done in minutes, leveraging its proprietary credit engine built in partnership with Tarya, Israel\u2019s largest P2P lending firm.\n\n\u201cI believe it\u2019s where the opportunity lies as the credit culture is only just beginning to take root in Africa,\u201d the CEO said. Bento has partnerships with 5 banks, 2 of which power its loans. According to Okubanjo, the startup has processed up to \u20a61 billion ($2.4 million) in loans since its launch, offered at flexible interest rates (between 2-5% per month), and with a default rate of around 1%.\n\nBento\u2019s goal is to \u201credefine the intersection of work and life and transform the way people earn, spend and borrow on the continent.\u201d To achieve this, it plans to start offering employees on its platform access to other third-party products and services, such as unemployment insurance, savings, and investments, all of which come at no cost to their employers.\n\nZuberi is a Ghana-based earned wage access platform. Image source: Zuberi.\n\nMore recently, a fast-emerging category in the payroll fintech space is earned wage access (EWA) platforms. Fintechs in this subcategory\u2014such as Nigeria\u2019s Earnipay and Ghana-based Zuberi Pay\u2014partner with employers and financing companies to give employees flexible access to earned wages.\n\nSalaried workers in need of quick cash between paydays have historically relied on borrowing from payday lenders, taking bank loans, or applying for salary advances. But these often come with exploitative interest rates, and the latter can plunge an employee into debt.\n\nUK-born Julian Owusu founded Zuberi in 2020, a couple of years after he returned to Ghana as a footballer, and saw how his colleagues, in need of urgent money before payday, would borrow from loan sharks at interest rates as high as 50-60%.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t really care because the pressure was on them and they just needed money today,\u201d Owusu recalled in an interview with TechCabal. \u201cThat\u2019s how I experienced the problem firsthand but it took a few years after I\u2019d stopped playing football and became a product manager that I moved to solve this problem.\u201d\n\nUsed by over 300 medium-to-large-sized businesses, Zuberi is an on-demand mobile employee benefits platform whose core product is a salary streaming feature that allows workers to access a part of their salary daily after they have worked. So rather than waiting till the end of the month, employees have the opportunity to withdraw their pay on-demand.\n\n\u201cPersonal cash flow is too slow for somebody living in such a volatile market as Africa,\u201d Owusu said. \u201cThere are so many unplanned events that completely throw people off any type of financial plan they have at the start of a month.\u201d While the Zuberi service is free for organisations, the platform charges employees a transaction fee every time they use the app to access their salary early.\n\nSnapshots of mobile platform Zuberi. Image credit: TechCabal.\n\nIn an earlier interview with TechCabal, Earnipay co-founder and COO Busayo Oyetunji explained that the app allows employees to withdraw up to 50% of their daily accrued salary as earned at the time of access, at any time of the month.\n\nAt the end of the month, the employer deducts the amount withdrawn from their salary, refunds Earnipay, then pays the employee the balance. Earnipay makes money from transaction fees, which are grouped in tiers. Withdrawing \u20a65,000-\u20a610,000 ($12-$24) attracts a fee of \u20a6500 ($1.21), and withdrawing \u20a610,001-\u20a650,000 ($24.11-$120) attracts a \u20a61,000 ($2.41) fee.\n\nEarnipay currently serves over 22 businesses with close to 5,000 employees, including outsourcing firms and HR solution providers in Nigeria. Some of its clients include Eden Life and Thrive Agric, whose \u201cthousands of employees\u201d have used the app to access their salary over 1,000 times, according to company figures.\n\nIn addition to offering employees an interest-free mobile alternative to digital loans, the plan for Zuberi, according to Owusu, is to be an all-in-one platform \u201chosting a suite of products that allows African workers gain access to various benefits that impact their lives instantly.\u201d\n\nGaining investors\u2019 attention\n\nAs with almost all sub-sectors in fintech, payroll-focused startups have attracted notable venture capital funding in recent years.\n\nIn August 2020, Workpay received $2.1 million in seed funding to accelerate expansion to other markets, beginning with Nigeria. The funding was led by Kepple Africa Ventures\u2014which previously invested $100,000 in the startup in 2019\u2014with participation from Y Combinator and several VC and angel investors. The startup also got equity-free funding from Google. At the time, WorkPay was processing payrolls for more than 25,000 employees in Kenya and had more than 300 small and medium businesses on its platform.\n\nIn January, SeamlessHR, a Nigeria-based company that offers HR and payroll software closed a $10 million Series A funding round, led by pan-African VC firm TLcom Capital, for its next phase of growth and regional expansion. The company\u2019s eponymous product is a cloud-based, end-to-end HR software that helps businesses manage and streamline their entire human resource processes and workflow. Its product suite includes management systems including payroll.\n\nEarlier this month, Earnipay announced a $4 million seed financing round led by early-stage venture capital firm Canaan. YC-backed South African wage access startup FloatPays, which plans to expand across the continent, also recently grabbed $1 million in funding from Naspers Foundry, topping up the $4 million round it announced in January.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why investors are backing payroll fintechs or broadly tech startups digitising the administrative stack for companies. For one, the appetite for cloud computing solutions by organisations is growing in Africa. From an estimated market size of $14.2 billion in 2021, the Middle East and Africa\u2019s cloud computing industry is expected to grow to $31.4 billion by 2026.\n\nBrendan Dickinson, general partner at Canaan, said the VC firm has seen earned wage access grow rapidly in many markets and believes it\u2019s \u201ca natural fit\u201d in Africa while explaining the rationale behind backing Earnipay.\n\nHowever, the size and readiness of the African economy for software services is relatively small and nascent compared to a market like the United States. \u201cIf we were an American company, we\u2019d probably be doing 6x growth for the efforts we put in because the economy is bigger,\u201d SeamlessHR CEO Emmanuel Okeleji told TechCabal during the company\u2019s fundraising announcement.\n\nFor EWA fintechs looking to enhance the financial well-being of employees, some of the threats inherent in loan-taking and salary advances may come up. Earnipay founder and CEO Nonso Onwuzulike noted that an earner unable to manage their personal finances may unnecessarily dip into their salary before payday, and still struggle to control their finances.\n\nZuberi\u2019s Owusu added that it\u2019s crucial to bring onboard companies that are committed to paying salaries on time in order to run a successful flexible salary fintech. And to increase chances of repayment, Bento Africa requires employees that apply for its loans to take unemployment and health insurance covers.\n\nThese are some of the challenges that payroll and employee benefits platforms in Africa have to grapple with as they build and scale. Nonetheless, the emerging tech sub-sector is surely one to keep tabs on as Africa\u2019s broader fintech space continues to thrive.\n\nAlso, as financial wellness gains precedence across organisations, these fintechs are well-poised to serve a generation of a financially literate and tech-savvy workforce. And for employers, offering EWA as part of a robust HR benefits package through startups is an opportunity to provide a high-value benefit for a relatively low cost.\n\n\u201cIt can demonstrate a company\u2019s commitment to the wellbeing of its workforce, helping employers stand out from the crowd in the competition for talent and talent retention,\u201d Earnipay\u2019s Onwuzulike added.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 caused many employers to rethink the concept of work, and remote work promptly became a thing. However, it didn\u2019t take long before individuals, companies, and governments alike began decrying the work-from-home (WFH) concept, given the psychological toll it took on people due to seclusion.\n\nIt was only a matter of time before people began cherishing, once again, human interaction, with calls for a hybrid work model appearing to be the best solution. A solution that Microsoft, Google, and other global tech companies have since adopted.\n\nThe article isn\u2019t concerned with the call for balance but the long-term implication of what remote work may be enabling.\n\nThe reality\n\n\u201cAfrican developers are building for the world\u201d was Google\u2019s summary of a study it carried out on African software developers in 2020 in partnership with Accenture. And indeed, a new report from 2021 echoes the same claim.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Africa Developer Ecosystem Report 2021 suggests that 8% of African developers work for at least one company outside the continent, even as the estimated number of developers on the continent increased from 700,000 in 2020 to 716,000 in 2021.\n\nTo a large extent, this increasing number is serving the local ecosystem, as revealed in the report, a situation contingent on the significant amount startups received in investment in 2021 \u2014 over $4 billion, 2.5x the value recorded in 2020.\n\nFair enough, countries with the highest amount of VC funding \u2014 South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, and Kenya \u2014 have a larger percentage of this developer stream.\n\nIn the report, a C-level executive at a South African talent pipeline company posited that international companies are the biggest competitors for African talents.\n\nAccording to the stats, 38% of the 1,600 developers surveyed work for at least one company headquartered outside Africa. Some developers revealed that they learned to code solely to get international prospects. However, most of those working with international companies have an average of six years of experience, while those with fewer years get into local companies.\n\nPossible implications\n\nI suspect \u2014 which was also inferred in the report \u2014 that the trend would be local startups hiring most of the junior to mid-level developers \u2014 despite the high risks \u2014 while the senior developers move to international companies somewhat on the account that the local startups can\u2019t compete based on compensation.\n\nMy conversation with several startup founders finding it difficult to get the right talents also reflects this. In hindsight, it isn\u2019t exactly a problem of unavailability of talents, but competing with international companies for the available ones.\n\nIt almost seems like working as a developer for a local startup is only to get immediate employment while building enough capacity to move to a foreign company. Interestingly, remote work further fuels this, mildly cloaking the talent exodus argument since no one has to leave the continent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdditionally, a cursory look at some developer training institutes and talent outsourcing startups in Africa shows a pretty reasonable representation of international hirers on their clientele network.\n\nOne can argue that developers\u2019 attraction to international opportunities paints a dreary image for the local market in the long term. The major concern is not having enough talents to go around eventually.\n\nAccording to the report, the numbers are still tilting in favour of the local ecosystem. But what happens when the attractiveness of the gig economy and wanting to raise purchasing power on the part of the developer thins out this advantage?\n\nThis is the situation North America\u2019s tech ecosystem is currently in.\n\nResearch done by Rest of World to compile salary data of tech workers in Latin America revealed the exodus of tech workers to American tech companies. The article cumulated in a compilation of founders\u2019 experiences having to live with this challenge. Even though the proximity of these two locations appears to make it worse, remote work has fuelled it to a worrisome level.\n\nIs the African situation one that can be nipped in the bud earlier, or does the ecosystem have to wait till it spirals out of control?\n\nThe need to make a hyperlocal effort in creating a unique work culture and environment for developers and tech workers to retain them is an enduring one, but isn\u2019t there so little that local startups can do?\n\nAs a Nigerian founder looking to hire a developer recently said following unsuccessful attempts, it appears \u201ctalents are fast becoming more unaffordable than they are scarce.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nThere are two types of people in the world right now: those following the Ukraine-Russian tensions religiously and the others who are tired of any news related to the conflict. For now, I\u2019m neither.\n\nIn the last one week, we\u2019ve seen stocks rise and fall, Internet \u201crestrictions\u201d, new Internet connections (thank you, Elon Musk), crypto donations \u2014 more on this later \u2014 mass immigrations, and unfortunately, lives lost as tensions rise and the conflict drags on.\n\nWe\u2019ve also seen sanctions \u2014 effective or not \u2014 club owners banned (Hello, Emmanuel Paul), Twitter bants on different ends of the spectrum, and more troops deployed. I think I speak for most people when I say we do not want to see World War 3.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHopefully, we don\u2019t, but for now, the show must go on. We\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nThe implications of Flutterwave\u2019s Fintech as a Service\n\nCrowdfunding a war, crypto style, and\n\nThe 5G lights turning on in Zimbabwe\n\nThe implications of a Fintech as a Service\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease follow this journey: By 2030, the global embedded finance \u2014 or Fintech as a Service (FaaS) \u2014 market is expected to be worth $7.2 trillion.\n\nCurrently, according to the Google Africa Developer Ecosystem Report 2021, due in part to increased fundraising, the need for software developers on the continent has skyrocketed, with startups creating 50% of that demand. We also can\u2019t forget all the poaching stories and talent scarcity that we bemoan on Twitter.\n\nLast week, we told you about Flutterwave\u2019s recent launch of its own FaaS platform. And from what the company says, this means startups can now embed card issuance, account opening, and wallet features into their services using its infrastructure.\n\nWhat does this mean for the African tech ecosystem? For one, a student wanting to build a grocery platform doesn\u2019t have to worry about building out any financial services aspects. Plug in Flutterwave\u2019s API, and they are good to go.\n\nTwo birds, one stone: And for Flutterwave, it means they get to cash in on an untapped but pretty valuable market.\n\nBut there\u2019s more, and you can find out here: What Flutterwave\u2019s fintech as a service means for the African tech ecosystem\n\nCrowdfunding a war\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the first things people note about war \u2014 apart from the lives and potentials lost \u2014 is this: war costs money. It is a costly endeavour and has seen national coffers wiped out for it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring World War 1, the UK and Germany sold war bonds to fund their war efforts \u2014 they still had to pay back, though. In 2014, Ukrainians called for help, with private citizens like Vitaliy Deynega, a freelance IT specialist, setting up Come Back Alive on Patreon to raise money to buy equipment. In 2021, Myanmar rebels crowdfunded their resistance to the military coup in July.\n\nCrowdfunding is not a new phenomenon in war, and Ukraine has some experience in that department. But on Saturday, February 26, 2022, things took an exciting turn.\n\nThe Ukrainian government tweeted, saying it was now accepting cryptocurrency donations. While federal governments may have sought crypto donations before, this appears to be the first of its kind. It is even more surprising considering the general wariness towards crypto from national authorities.\n\nInterestingly, this is not the first time crypto has been used in the Ukraine-Russia conflict, as donations appear to have been steadily creeping in since 2018. At press time, the Ukrainian government had raised $8 million worth of cryptocurrency.\n\nSidebar: Remember when the #EndSARS protests in Nigeria began receiving support in cryptocurrency?\n\nThere are also rumours that Russia may also be receiving funding via crypto as an alternative due to the sanctions being imposed. There are also concerns about how cryptocurrency could worsen issues with corruption in Ukraine.\n\nEither way, the world\u2019s first crypto \u2018war\u2019 is creating some interesting precedents.\n\nZimbabwe joins the 5G league\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto Credit: Ivan Radic Flickr via Compfight cc\n\nWhenever I see news about 5G, my mind automatically goes to Nigeria and how far we\u2019ve come in our 5G journey. Last we heard, MTN and Mafab Communications Ltd have made complete payment for their licenses, and the 3.5 GHz spectrum needed for deployment has been handed over to the Nigeria Communications Commission (NCC). But that\u2019s not on today\u2019s menu.\n\nGood news for Zimbabweans: On Friday, February 25, 2022, telecom operator, Econet, in partnership with global technology infrastructure suppliers Ericsson and ZTE, launched the 5G network in Harare, Zimbabwe\u2019s capital.\n\nThe Southern African country becomes the third African country to enjoy the high-speed 5G network after South Africa and Kenya. For now, it would only be rolled out in Harare for individual and enterprise customers, with more cities to come.\n\nBy the end of April, Econet said it should have deployed 22 base stations countrywide.\n\nEconet has the largest market share in the Zimbabwean telco market \u2014 61% \u2014 and it is no surprise it is the first telecom to launch the 5G network ahead of Telecel and State-owned NetOne Cellular. It was also the first to launch the 4G network in the country in 2013. However, there is no accurate representation of the amount of 4G coverage.\n\nZimbabwe joins the 78 other countries where 5G has been launched, while Econet could very well be the 201st network operator.\n\nMeanwhile, in other parts of Africa, Ghana has a proposed launch date of 2023, Egypt has no set launch date, and Nigeria\u2019s January 2022 deadline has passed.\n\nLast week on Techpoint Africa\n\nWhat I\u2019m listening to/watching/reading\n\nOpportunities\n\nIdentitypass is hiring.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA few days after announcing its Series D round that sent its valuation over the $3 billion mark, African fintech startup, Flutterwave, at a virtual event, announced additional services to its existing offering. In addition to its payment infrastructure, the startup unveiled the addition of Apple and Google Pay, Grow (its SME financing service), and fintech as a service (FaaS).\n\nStartups can now embed card issuance, account opening, and wallet features into their services using its infrastructure. The announcement is the first of its kind in Africa\u2019s burgeoning ecosystem, and this article provides some insight into the implications for African startups.\n\nWhat is fintech as a service?\n\nAkurateco, a Dutch software provider, defines fintech as a service as offering financial technology as a service. Startups that provide FaaS often provide an API that enables other startups or institutions to provide various financial services, including payments, wallet provision, and card issuance.\n\nUnder this arrangement, the technology provider is completely responsible for developing and maintaining its platform, while the startups it serves focus on providing unique services for their customers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlutterwave founder and CEO, Olugbenga Agboola\n\nAfrican API fintech startups have gained more attention in recent years, but they often focus on a few services. While startups like Mono and Okra concentrate on providing financial data and payment APIs, Flutterwave intends to provide an API that meets all of a business\u2019 financial needs.\n\nIn Flutterwave\u2019s case, a grocery delivery startup, for instance, that signs up to use its FaaS API can choose a custom offer that enables it to provide a wallet and payment option for its customers while it focuses on aggregating meal choices for its customers.\n\nHow does FaaS affect the ecosystem?\n\nIn a statement explaining why B Capital invested in Flutterwave\u2019s Series D round, Matt Levinson, a partner at the firm, said, \u201cFlutterwave may ultimately build one of the most consequential fintech businesses in the world, enabling hundreds of thousands of merchants to transact online and connect Africa to the global economy.\u201d\n\nBy including fintech as a service in its offerings, Flutterwave is definitely on the path to doing that, but how does this affect other startups in Africa?\n\nImproved customer service\n\nCustomers are usually the biggest beneficiaries when businesses make changes to their business model, which could well be the case. By enabling other companies to integrate financial services to existing offerings, they allow the businesses to expand already existing offers.\n\nAll things considered, this should enable them to focus on their core business, providing customers with a better experience and increasing competition among startups.\n\nFaster time to market\n\nThe time needed to add a new feature to a startup could take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months, but with fintech as a service, a startup could launch a new feature in as little as days. This cuts down their time to market and allows them to receive feedback faster.\n\nHowever, the tech is not all they stand to benefit from. Providing financial services often means that businesses deal with customers\u2019 data. Consequently, regulators often have to step in to ensure that there are no abuses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIntegrating Flutterwave\u2019s FaaS API will help them bypass most regulatory requirements. Yet, while it allows them to get to market faster, it also reduces the startup\u2019s ability to innovate and could reduce the quality of its services.\n\nPrivacy concerns\n\nAn individual\u2019s financial data could be used to exploit the person, and that explains why the fintech industry is probably the most regulated sector in Nigeria. Providing a FaaS API is not limited to fintech companies, with other industries capable of integrating with them.\n\nOutsourcing the provision of their fintech services could, therefore, leave startups at the mercy of the service provider as they often lose control over the quality and security of their fintech service.\n\nAccording to Jan Chapman, Co-founder and Managing Director of MSP Blueshift, \u201cwhen a startup outsources its fintech services, it is often required to share sensitive data with its service provider. This can put the startup\u2019s data at risk and expose it to fraud or identity theft. The startup may also be limited in its ability to control how its data is used and may not have the same level of security as it would if it developed its fintech platform.\u201d\n\nIncreased regulatory oversights\n\nProviding FaaS services to startups would see Flutterwave dealing with data from the businesses that sign up and could open it up to increased regulatory oversight.\n\n\u201cThere are definitely possibilities of more regulatory oversights in niche cases, especially if it involves private data, but generally, standardisation and provision of FaaS through APIs means that there is more compliance built right from the go,\u201d says Rafiq Lightwala, Founder of Investify, a Pakistani fintech startup.\n\nWhile Flutterwave\u2019s FaaS offering is a welcome development for startups that may need to ride on its infrastructure, it could also throw up quality control, regulatory, and security issues. However, going by some of its appointments in the past year, the startup seems prepared for problems that may arise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

Retail deposits grew by N146 billion from N1.72 trillion in 2020 to NGN1.87 trillion in 2021.

          "title": "Crude shortfall rids Nigeria of price gains",
          "text": "Nigeria has remained far from reaping the benefits of the high oil prices in the international market, as its production falls below the quota set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).\n\nOil prices had reached above $105 a barrel as at last Thursday, being the first time since 2014.\n\nCommenting on the oil price increase recently, the minister of state for petroleum, Timipre Sylva, regrets that Nigeria is not able to take advantage of the high prices due to production shortfalls.\n\nAccording to Sylva, being a net importer of refined petroleum products places Nigeria at a difficult position to enjoy the benefits of the oil price.\n\nHe said, \u201cRise in crude oil prices is not something to celebrate. In Nigeria, right now we are a net importer of petroleum products and when the price of crude oil goes up it affects the prices of petroleum products.\n\n\u201cSo, for us who are the net importers, it is not very good. What we are saying is that if you are going to produce more and you get more dollars from your production, then it gives you more money for your imports.\n\n\u201cBut if you are now producing less and then you still have to make sure that the Nigerian market is supplied fully with petroleum products, then you will see that there will be a shortfall.\n\n\u201cWe are not happy at all that we are not able to take advantage of the high prices of oil that we have seen today. So, it is our loss. But we are doing everything to ensure that we are able to bring back our production and meet our OPEC quota.\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s monthly crude oil production stayed low in the year 2021, below 1.86mb/d projection as production for the months January, February, March and April were 1.58mb/d, 1.62mb/d, 1.65mb/d, 1.63mb/d.\n\nData from the OPEC monthly oil market report show that Nigeria produced 1.41mb/d, 1.39mb/d, 1.38mb/d, 1.27mb/d and in the months of May, June, July, August and September 2021, respectively, which falls below 1.54mb/d OPEC production quota.\n\nThe minister noted that local production was beginning to climb up gradually, adding that Nigeria may completely regain production to meet OPEC quota before the end of 2022.\n\nSpeaking on the Nigeria International Energy Summit (NIES), which is expected to take place from February 27 to March 3, 2022 in Abuja, Sylva noted that there had been great outcomes from previous summits that have been embraced by governments, policy makers and the industry as a whole.\n\nAccording to him, the conversation around Nigeria\u2019s Decade of Gas initiative, exit of government from Joint Venture cash call funding emanated from previous summits.\n\n\u201cOther programmes from previous summits include; the push to diversify Nigeria\u2019s economy and drive industrialization through focus on domestic utilization of natural gas, which culminated to the declaration of 2020 as the year of natural gas for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAfter several years of planning, the National Gas Transportation Network Code (NGTNC) was finally launched at this summit.\n\n\u201cThe United States Trade Development Agency (USTDA) signed a phenomenal deal to finance the development of 1.35 megawatts power plant here in Abuja with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) at the summit,\u201d he said.\n\nHe further noted that key international and indigenous companies like Shell Petroleum and Development Company Limited, Total Exploration and Production, Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) Limited, Dangote Refinery, Waltersmith Petroman and a host of others used the summit platform for special presentations to drive their aspirations and launch major projects.\n\nRead also: Naira slips while OPEC currencies jump\n\n\u201cWith the theme of the summit, \u201cRevitalizing the Industry: Future Fuels and Energy Transition\u201d, our objective is to drive a new narrative and make energy transition the cornerstone of the country\u2019s industry policy.\n\n\u201cThe objective of the summit from inception is to deliver the biggest and best African Petroleum Technology and Business Conference that will be the definitive platform, not just for Nigeria, but also for Africa to engage the global energy community. I believe that we have delivered on that with every edition.\n\n\u201cSome of our confirmed international guests include The Honourable Minister of Energy, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Abdulaziz bin Salman Al Saud, who will be represented by Nasser AlDossary.\n\n\u201cOthers are Tom Alweendo, Minister of Mines and Energy, Namibia, H.E Gabriel Mbaga Obiang Lima, Minister of Mines and Hydrocarbons, Equatorial Guinea and H.E Aime Ngoy Mukena, Minister of Hydrocarbons, Democratic Republic of Congo. The global energy leader and the Secretary General of Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo has also confirmed his attendance,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "New law shifts pressure on INEC",
          "text": "Almost seven years after assuming office, President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday, February 25, 2022, signed the amended 2010 Electoral Act into law. The first time he would do so. The Bill was forwarded for assent by the Clerk of the National Assembly via a letter dated January 31, 2022.\n\nThe former law was signed into law by former President Goodluck Jonathan in 2010.\n\nHowever, Nigerians have commended the president for taking a decisive action to sign the bill expected to ensure a credible electoral process in the coming Osun and Ekiti gubernatorial elections as well as the 2023 general election.\n\nBut the development may have shifted the pressure to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as Nigerians expect the electoral umpire to hit the ground running with preparations toward the elections.\n\nThe president had four times in the past rejected assent to the bill, a development that generated speculations. The first time was as a result of the re-ordering of election sequence. The president also declined to sign the bill on the account of drafting errors.\n\nThe president rejected the bill for the third time due to what his aides described as \u201csome drafting issues\u201d that were not addressed. And in December 2021 he declined to assent to the Electoral (Amendment) Bill for the 4th time\n\nInteresting, Friday\u2019s presidential assent came few days after a coalition of civil society groups protested in Abuja over the delay in signing the bill into law.\n\nThe substance of the Bill is both reformative and progressive as it comes with a great deal of improvement from the previous Electoral Bills.\n\nAs Buhari noted while signing the bill, \u201cThere are salient and praiseworthy provisions that could positively revolutionise elections in Nigeria through the introduction of new technological innovations. These innovations would guarantee the constitutional rights of citizens to vote and to do so effectively.\u201d\n\nThe Bill is also expected to improve and engender clarity, effectiveness and transparency of the election process, as well as reduce to the barest minimum incidences of acrimony arising from dissatisfied candidates and political parties.\n\nFor instance, sections 3, 9(2), 34, 41, 47, 84(9), (10) and (11) among others, are noteworthy which will help to enhance the democratic efficacy of the Bill.\n\n\u201cThese commendable efforts are in line with our policy to bequeath posterity and landmark legal framework that paves the way for credible and sound electoral process that we would all be proud of\u201d, said the president.\n\nAmong the key provisions of the new electoral act are the following: Clause 50 gives INEC the legal backing for electronic transmission of election results.\n\nClause 94 allows for early commencement of the campaign season. By this provision, the campaign season will now start 150 days to the Election Day and end 24 hours before the election.\n\nClause 29(1) stipulates that parties must conduct primaries and submit their list of candidates at least 180 days before the general elections.\n\nClause 65 states that INEC can review results declared under duress.\n\nClause 3(3) states that funds for general elections must be released at least one year before the election.\n\nClause 51 says that the total number of accredited voters will become a factor in determining over-voting at election tribunals.\n\nClause 54(2) makes provisions for people with disabilities and special needs.\n\nClause 47 gives legislative backing for smart card readers and any other voter accreditation technology that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) deploys.\n\nClause 34 gives political parties power to conduct a primary election to replace a candidate who died during an election.\n\nClause 84 stipulates that anyone holding a political office \u2013 ministers, commissioners, special advisers and others \u2013 must relinquish the position before they can be eligible to participate in the electoral process either as a candidate or as a delegate.\n\nThe act also provides for consensus candidate with a proviso that for that to take place, all the aspirants in any given election must give written consent to the decision of the party\n\nHowever, Clause 84 appears to be the most controversial. Even President Buhari stated so in his remarks before signing the law.\n\nThe Clause states that \u201cNo political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the Convention or Congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, section 84(12), constitutes fundamental defect, as it is in conflict with extant constitutional provisions\n\n\u201cSection 84 (12) constitutes a disenfranchisement of serving political office holders from voting or being voted for at Conventions or Congresses of any political party, for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election in cases where it holds earlier than 30 days to the National Election.\n\n\u201cThe provision has introduced qualification and disqualification criteria that ultra vires the Constitution by way of importing blanket restriction and disqualification to serving political office holders of which they are constitutionally accorded protection,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe practical application of section 84(12) of the Electoral Bill, 2022 will, if assented to, by operation of law, subject serving political office holders to inhibitions and restrictions referred to under section 40 and 42 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended).\n\n\u201cIt is imperative to note that the only constitutional expectation placed on serving political office holders that qualify, by extension as public officers within the context of the constitution is resignation, withdrawal or retirement at least 30 days before the date of the election\n\n\u201cHence, it will be stretching things beyond the constitutional limit to import extraneous restriction into the constitution on account of practical application of section 84(12) of the bill where political parties\u2019 conventions and congresses were to hold earlier than 30 days to the election.\n\n\u201cArising from the foregoing, with particular regards to the benefits of the Bill, industry, time, resources and energy committed in its passage, I hereby assent to the Bill and request the Nationally Assembly to consider immediate amendments that will bring the Bill in tune with constitutionality by way of deleting section 84(12) accordingly,\u201d Buhari concluded.\n\nAnother criticism of the new law is the financial burden it imposes on both politicians and the Independent Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nFor example, the provision for direct primaries by the existing 18 political parties is seen by observers as imposing too much financial burdens on the parties. The difference between this and the general election is small because it allows for all Nigerians to come about and say their opinions.\n\nRead also: Electoral Bill: Buhari meets Lawan, Gbajabiamila, Yakubu, swears in new INEC commissioners\n\nThis means that we would need to repeat the general elections 18 times. Today, INEC requires N305 billion for the 2023 general elections. Now if the general election, which is not the newly proposed electoral system, will cost this much, how much will it cost to do the same election in each of the two leading political parties the APC and PDP? It might cost a conservative N200 billion because it will involve everyone.\n\nAlthough the good side of the law is that INEC is required to monitor it. Therefore, if it is assumed that every political party will spend N200 billion, how much will then be spent in conducting the same primary election in 18 political parties just to produce a qualified candidate?\n\nLet\u2019s assume there are about 60 million politicians in the country, what about the remaining over 160 million Nigerians who have nothing to do with politics? Are we fair to them?\n\nAll the people want are good projects, good roads portable drinking water, good education, school feeding programme and the rest of them.\n\nAre we fair to the 160 million Nigerians using their wealth just to conduct primary elections to produce a party candidate, despite other demands by the public?\n\nAs rightly observed by Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN) to spend a whopping N305 billion by INEC and the about N200 billion to be given to the political parties is not fair to the remaining 160 million Nigerians who have no business with politics and political appointments. Their business is just a better life in Nigeria.",

These criminals have no hiding place; we would make the state hot for them.\u201d\n\nThe governor further noted, \u201cWe cannot reveal all information available to us now because the investigation is ongoing. Security is our collective responsibility and the Ubiaja incident should be our watchword as the cooperation led to some recoveries in that robbery attack.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the Deputy Commissioner of Police, Operations, Miller Dantawaye, said mechanisms have been put in place to ensure that such incidents don\u2019t reoccur and perpetrators of the dastardly act are brought to book.\n\nHe noted, \u201cThis type of incident will not happen again in Edo State.

          "text": "Zenith Bank Plc has recorded a double-digit growth of 10% in gross earnings in its full year 2021 report, ended December 31, 2021.\n\nThe lender\u2019s gross earnings rose to N765.6 billion from N696.5 billion reported in the previous year. This is despite a challenging macroeconomic environment aggravated by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\n\nAccording to the bank\u2019s audited financial results for the 2021 financial year presented to the Nigeria Exchange Group (NGX), the Group achieved year-on-year (YoY) growth in gross earnings of 10% from NGN696.5 billion reported in the previous year to N765.6billion. This was on the back of 23% YoY growth in non-interest income from N251.7billion to N309billion and a 2% YoY growth in interest income from N420.8billion to NGN427.6billion.\n\nProfit before tax also grew by 10% from NGN255.9 billion to NGN280.4 billion in the current year. The increase was due to growth in the top-line and very strong management of the treasury portfolio that increased efficiency, resulting in a drop in interest expense by 12% from NGN121.1 billion in 2020 to NGN106.8 billion in the current year. This further led to a 7% increase in net interest income of NGN320.8 billion in 2021 from NGN299.7 billion in 2020.\n\nCustomer deposits increased by 21%, growing from NGN5.34 trillion in the previous year to NGN6.47 trillion in the current year. The growth in customer deposits came from both corporate and retail customers. Retail deposits grew by NGN146 billion from NGN1.72 trillion in 2020 to NGN1.87 trillion in 2021. The Group\u2019s continuous drive for retail deposits combined with the strategic rebalancing of its funding base helped to reduce the cost of funding from 2.1% to 1.5% in the current year. Although operating expenses grew by 13% YoY, growth remains below the inflation rate, and the Group improved its Earnings per Share (EPS) which grew by 6% from NGN7.34 to NGN7.78.\n\nTotal assets increased by 11%, growing from NGN8.48 trillion in 2020 to NGN9.45 trillion in 2021, mainly driven by growth in customer deposits. With the steady recovery in economic activities, the Group prudently grew its gross loans by 20%, from NGN2.9 trillion in 2020 to NGN3.5 trillion in 2021, with moderated NPL ratio from 4.29% to 4.19% YoY. The Group recorded impressive liquidity and capital adequacy ratios of 71.6% and 21.0%, which remained above regulatory thresholds of 30% and 15%, respectively.\n\nIn 2022, the Group intends to consolidate on the gains achieved in the previous year in all business segments and combine leadership in the industry, innovation and technology to drive improved performance and deliver enhanced returns to all stakeholders.\n\nAs a testament to its commitment to its shareholders, the bank has announced a proposed final dividend payout of N2.80 per share, bringing the total dividend to N3.10 per share.\n\nZenith Bank has continued to distinguish itself in the Nigerian financial services industry through superior service offerings, unique customer experience and sound financial indices. The bank remains a clear leader in the digital space with several firsts in deploying innovative products, solutions and an assortment of alternative channels that ensure convenience, speed and safety of transactions.\n\nIn recognition of its track record of excellent performance, Zenith Bank was voted as Best Commercial Bank in Nigeria in the World Finance Banking Awards 2021, Best Bank in Nigeria in the Global Finance World\u2019s Best Banks Awards 2020 and 2021, Bank of the Year (Nigeria) in The Banker\u2019s Bank of the Year Awards 2020, and Best in Corporate Governance \u2018Financial Services\u2019 Africa 2020 and 2021 by the Ethical Boardroom. Also, the bank emerged as the Most Valuable Banking Brand in Nigeria in the Banker Magazine Top 500 Banking Brands 2020 and 2021, Number One Bank in Nigeria by Tier-1 Capital in the \u201c2021 Top 1000 World Banks\u201d Ranking by The Banker Magazine and the Retail Bank of the year at the BusinessDay Banks and Other Financial Institutions (BOFI) Awards 2020 and 2021.\n\nSimilarly, Zenith Bank was honoured as Bank of the Decade (People\u2019s Choice) at the ThisDay Awards 2020 and emerged winner in four categories at the Sustainability, Enterprise, and Responsibility (SERAS) Awards 2021, carting home the awards for \u201cBest Company in Reporting and Transparency\u201d, \u201cBest Company in Infrastructure Development\u201d, \u201cBest Company in Gender Equality and Women Empowerment\u201d, and the coveted \u201cMost Responsible Organisation in Africa.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

I commend the Ministry of Works and internal and external consultants for the thorough supervision they have done to ensure quality delivery.\n\n\u201cI want to enjoin the road users to continue to observe precautions and put the infrastructural facilities into good use. They should see this as theirs which must be properly maintained and treasured.\n\n\u201cI use this occasion to commend our party members for believing in us as being demonstrated in all we do, it is our hope that our party and government would continue to wax stronger and stronger\u201d, Oyetola added.\n\nIn her remarks, the immediate past Deputy Governor of the State, Mrs. Titilayo Laoye Ponle, lauded the Governor\u2019s noble foresight that had brought about the construction of the flyover.\n\nShe said the project has given the capital city a facelift of development thus adding value to the socio-economic life of the people of the State capital in particular and the State in general.\n\nMrs Ponle who is an indigene of Osogbo said \u201cour people are extremely happy and very grateful to the Governor for doing this for us because the flyover is the first of its kind in our dear State.\n\n\u201cThis would in no doubt advance the socio-economic activities in Osogbo and by extension the entire State.

You\u2019ve left yesterday but you are not yet in your future. So it takes a lot of courage, boldness to focus on the future that God has shown you.\n\n\u201cNigeria has gone through a very difficult history in the past few years and Nigeria is bleeding and we trust God that this will be an opportunity for the Lord to show us mercy and bring us into the nation\n\nof our dreams.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe have a dream that in our lifetime, that the green passport will be well coveted and loved by everyone in the world; that what seems to be a pariah nation in the past will be coveted and desired by many. It\u2019s my heart desire that I will live to see the Nigeria of our dreams.\n\n\u201cAs people of God we\u2019re praying (towards the 2023 elections); we will continue to pray. There\u2019s nothing God can\u2019t do to a prayer. Having said that, I believe that darkness is a backdrop for light to shine.\n\nSo where we are is a great opportunity for us to make anything wrongin history to be right and we trust the Lord in return for our best.\n\n\u201cI speak to Nigerians. Let\u2019s rise up to take advantage of our civic responsibility. Number one, register; number two, vote. Go out there and do the needful and please, please don\u2019t let anybody buy your\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nconscience. Vote your heart, vote your conscience and don\u2019t be bought easily .

While the Reps seat escaped a robbery attack by God\u2019s grace, the state assembly candidate was shot in the leg but will soon recuperate. By God\u2019s grace, the mandate will be recovered.\n\n\u201cI commend the national and state working committees of our party under the transparent leaderships of Ayu and Hassan who have demonstrated honesty, sincerity, commitment, loyalty, zeal, maximum respect for the party and teamwork in the course of their work. I commend the PDP governors for their encouragement, inspiration and support to the state. The new PDP has moved from the immediate past and returned to the people, hence this renewed hope and energy.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI Congratulate Hon Agah and Da Dasat for an impressive and intimidating outing in the bye- elections. I commend all the hardworking members of our great party who, inspite all odds, have remained undaunted and strong\u201d.\n\n\u201d I want to especially appreciate the leadership of the state Chairman Hon Chris Hassan and his entire exco, who have provided good and sensitive leadership to the rank and file of the party. His leadership has proved clearly that where there is honesty, transparency, fear of God and sheer will determination, the sky\u2019s the limit for change. The political will of the current state leadership is inspiring, encouraging and stimulating. The openness and mutual respect is overwhelming, hence the beautiful benefits and rewards being harvested\u201d.\n\nGolu chided the APC- led state government for failing to learn good lessons of democracy from veterans across the world whose penchant for impunity and disrespect for the rule of law and due process has never lasted no matter how long it seems.\n\n\u201cIt always has expiry dates.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe hundreds of millions spent on just five wards in Pankshin South Constituency by the state government in which all government functionaries and key APC stakeholders woefully lost their units is pitiful and a signal that the end has come for those who have unrepentant penchant for manipulation.\n\n\u201cEven the ghost 20millions from the village boys could neither shake nor intimidate the voters. The masses are not moved by the newest billionaires in town who are accumulating and stockpiling monies for 2023. Our people are determined to change the change within the polity. I commend the dogged and resilient people of Pankshin South and Jos North/ Bassa constituencies for coming out enmass to reject those who have taken for granted the people of the state and have derailed democracy. This is a sign of what to expect in 2023 because there is no going back on the resolve to free and emancipate the Plateau.\n\nAccording to Golu, the quality of democracy has dwindled and gone down in the state in the last six years, adding that he is prepared to rekindle the people\u2019s hope if elected Governor come 2023.",

          "text": "Nigerian students caught in the Russia-Ukraine war cannot cross to Poland despite instructions by the federal government to do so.\n\nEven though the government said yesterday that the students should move to the Hungarian and the Romanian borders, many of them are facing perilous situations.\n\nHowever, following the reported difficulties faced by Nigerians trying to escape the war-torn country through the Polish border, the federal government has advised those affected to move to the Hungarian Zahony border and Romanian Suceava, Tulcea, Satu Mare County and Maramures borders.\n\nThis was disclosed in a statement issued yesterday by the permanent secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Gabriel Aduda.\n\nThere is sequel to reports that Nigerians trying to access the Polish border were being molested, extorted and denied entry into Poland among other threats.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe statement read, \u201cThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs is fully abreast of all the challenges Nigerians crossing into countries bordering Ukraine, especially the Polish border, are facing and we are taking adequate measures to assuage these challenges.\n\n\u201cThe minister of Foreign Affairs has spoken with his counterpart, the Foreign Minister of Ukraine, on these unsavoury developments and both are working on alleviating the suffering of Nigerians including deploying the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) to the border to ensure easier access to all Nigerians and other nationals.\n\n\u201cFor now, movement to the Hungarian Zahony border and Romanian Suceava, Tulcea, Satu + Mare County and Maramures borders is advised, as they have approved visa free access to all Nigerians coming from Ukraine and arrangements for accommodation and feeding before evacuation is arranged.\n\n\u201cParents, guardians and wards of Nigerians in Ukraine are please enjoined to remain calm as the Federal Government of Nigeria is working very hard to get them all home safely.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMeanwhile, the Nigerian Embassy in Bucharest, Romania, has informed Nigerians arriving from Ukraine that arrangements had been put in place to receive them at the Romanian entry points.\n\nThe embassy hotlines are: Consular officer +40747309174 and Head of Chancery, +40786091964\n\nThe arrangement is in addition to those made by the Romanian authorities to welcome evacuated /repatriated nationals of every country from Ukraine.\n\n\u201cNigerian nationals are advised to arrive at every entry point with valid documents and cooperate with the Romanian Immigration Officers at the border,\u201d the embassy said in a statement yesterday.\n\nNigerians Recount Ordeals\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLolade Lawal has had her life turned upside down in a way she never imagined.\n\nThe third-year medical student from Nigeria is coming to terms with the effects of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine that started last week.\n\n\u201cIt is scary, very scary. I\u2019m very worried. People are running for their lives. We are hiding in groups so we can keep an eye on each other,\u201d Lawal told Al Jazeera over the phone as she sheltered with other students at a safe bunker in the northeastern city of Sumy.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no escape. Trains have stopped working. Most supermarkets are closed and those that are open are running very low on food stocks.\n\nATMs are not working and everyone is desperately looking for money,\u201d Lawal said, as sirens went off in the background.\n\nThere are no official figures on the number of African students currently studying in Ukraine but Lawal said \u201cthere are hundreds of us in our city\u201d.\n\n\u201cAt my university, there are about 100 Nigerian students. I\u2019m sheltering with some of them,\u201d Lawal added.\n\nSome students have managed to cross the border into Poland.\n\n\u201cI live in Kyiv. I have been living here since March last year,\u201d Somto Orah, a student at the State University of Telecommunications in Kyiv, told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cWe have received no support from any government authorities. The school only gave us a bomb shelter to hide when the air raid siren is on. The sirens came on and off for about five times yesterday before I left,\u201d Orah, a Nigerian national, added.\n\n\u201cThere is little food. I couldn\u2019t access cash for two days now. Every ATM on the road has no cash.\u201d\n\nOthers have had even less luck. Samuel George, a first-year software engineering student, fled Kyiv after the shelling and sirens got too much for him to handle.\n\n\u201cI drove from Kyiv. We are trying to survive. We don\u2019t want to die in a foreign country,\u201d George said.\n\nAs he neared the Polish border, Samuel\u2019s luck ran out. He said he had a minor road accident with a vehicle carrying Ukrainians because the road was narrow.\n\nHe said they took his money and stopped him from driving any further.\n\n\u201cThey are not officials, police or military. They are normal citizens who stopped us Africans from driving to the border. They let Ukrainians pass through but not us,\u201d George said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m now walking to the border. I have no other option. I don\u2019t know how much further the border is. They even took our money. It is like\n\nthey are not human beings,\u201d George said, adding that he could no longer talk on the phone because his hands were freezing in the sub-zero temperature.\n\nOn Saturday, the Polish Ministry of Internal Affairs said more than 115,000 people had crossed into Poland from Ukraine, adding thateveryone from Ukraine was allowed to enter, even those without a valid passport.\n\nBut for Somto and several other students, crossing the border into Poland has not been easy. \u201cI will be heading to Nigeria from Poland if I\u2019m able to cross. But if I see a school offer around Schengen, I will take it up because I don\u2019t want my school life to be disrupted,\u201d he said as he joined the queue at the border gate.\n\nRussian Military Puts Nuclear Weapons On High Alert\n\n\u2026Kyiv to hold talks with Moscow\n\nMeanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he is moving Russia\u2019s nuclear deterrent to \u201cspecial alert\u201d as a response to NATO \u201caggression\u201d\n\nPutin ordered his military command to put deterrence forces \u2013 a reference to units which include nuclear arms \u2013 on high alert, citing statements by NATO leaders and economic sanctions against Moscow.\n\n\u201cAs you can see, not only do Western countries take unfriendly measures against our country in the economic dimension \u2013 I mean the illegal sanctions that everyone knows about very well \u2013 but also the top officials of leading NATO countries allow themselves to make aggressive statements with regards to our country,\u201d Putin said on state television.\n\nThe move does not mean Russia intends to use the weapons even as the US has condemned the move as \u201cunacceptable\u201d\n\nBBC Frank Gardner said Russia\u2019s announcement that its nuclear deterrent has been put on \u201cspecial alert\u201d is a sign of both President Putin\u2019s anger at the West\u2019s anti-Russian sanctions and his enduring paranoia that his country is under threat from NATO.\n\nMeanwhile Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Kyiv will send a delegation for talks \u201cwithout preconditions\u201d with Moscow at the Ukraine-Belarus border.\n\nThis comes after a phone call between Zelenskyy and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. \u201cWe agreed that the Ukrainian delegation would meet with the Russian delegation without preconditions on the Ukrainian-Belarusian border, near the Pripyat River,\u201d Zelenskyy said in a statement after holding a phone call with Lukashenko.\n\nHe did not give a precise time for the meeting, but said Lukashenko, a Putin ally, \u201chas taken responsibility for ensuring that all planes, helicopters and missiles stationed on Belarusian territory remain on the ground during the Ukrainian delegation\u2019s travel, talks and return.\n\nAs the war rages across Ukrainian cities Regional Governor Oleh Sinegubov said Ukrainian troops have full control of the country\u2019s second-largest city, Kharkiv, after street fighting with Russian forces.\n\nKyiv\u2019s mayor said there are no Russian soldiers in the capital, and that the city\u2019s defences are holding firm.\n\nMore than 360,000 Ukrainians have fled the country since the beginning of Moscow\u2019s assault, the UN said\n\nPMB Expresses Worry Over Treatment Of Nigerians, Africans Fleeing Ukraine Through Poland\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday expressed worry over a ill-treatment meted in Nigerians nationals and citizens of other African countries trying to flee troubled Ukraine through Poland.\n\nA statement by the Senior Special Assistant to the President media and publicity, Garba Shehu called for equal treatment for everyone scampering for safety in the war zone.\n\nThe president noted that all those who flee a conflict situation have the same right to safe passage under UN Convention and the colour of their passport or their skin should make no difference.\n\n\u201cBut, for that reason, it is paramount that everyone is treated with dignity and without favour,\u201d the president said.\n\n\u201cWhile efforts to begin talks between Russia and Ukraine are underway, paramount on our minds is the safety and human rights of some four thousand Nigerian citizens and many others from friendly African nations today stranded in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThere is a long history dating back to decades of Nigerians and other Africans studying in Ukraine, particularly medicine. The majority of Nigerian citizens in the country today are university-enrolled students.\n\n\u201cFrom video evidence, first-hand reports, and from those in contact with their wards and/or Nigerian consular officials there have been unfortunate reports of Ukrainian police and security personnel refusing to allow Nigerians to board buses and trains heading towards the Ukraine-Poland border.\n\n\u201cIn one video widely circulating on social media, a Nigerian mother with her young baby was filmed being physically forced to give up her seat to another person.\n\n\u201cThere are also separate reports of Polish officials simply refusing Nigerian citizens\u2019 entry into Poland from Ukraine,\u201d the president said.\n\nAccording to the statement, one group of Nigerian students having been repeatedly refused entry into Poland have concluded they have no choice but to travel again across Ukraine and attempt to exit the country via the border with Hungary.\n\n\u201cWe understand the pain and fear that is confronting all people who find themselves in this terrifying place.\n\nWe also appreciate that those in official positions in security and border management will in most cases be experiencing impossible expectations in a situation they never expected.\n\n\u201cAs a nation, we are proud of those educated in Kyiv and Kharkiv and other cities and centres of learning who have returned to Nigeria to perform great service for our nation and our people.\n\n\u201cWithout the generosity of spirit of the Ukrainian people that would never have been possible,\u201d he added.\n\nPresident Buhari, however, prayed for those directly affected by this conflict as he said Nigeria, with it\u2019s 200 million people, support all and every diplomatic effort to bring this war to an end.\n\nUkraine Will \u2018Prevail\u2019 Amid Russia\u2019s Assault, Says foreign Minister\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Russia\u2019s goal is to \u201cdestroy Ukraine as a state, but we will not fall,\u201d Kuleba said in a televised address.\n\n\u201cThis is a war between President Putin and the people of Ukraine. We are determined to fight back fiercely as long as it is needed, to defend our land and our people \u2026 and I am sure that we will prevail. We will not give up a single inch of our territory,\u201d he added.\n\nFrance Closes Airspace To Russian Aircraft\n\nFrance has announced that it will follow other European countries in shutting its airspace to Russian aircraft to punish the country for invading Ukraine.\n\n\u201cFrance is shutting its airspace to all Russian aircraft and airlines from this evening on,\u201d Transport Minister Jean-Baptiste Djebbari tweeted.\n\nKyiv\u2019s defence Holding Firm, Says Mayor\n\nKyiv\u2019s mayor says there are no Russian troops in the Ukrainian capital, adding the city\u2019s defence is holding firm against attacks from Moscow\u2019s forces.\n\n\u201cOur military, law enforcement and territorial defence continue to detect and neutralise saboteurs,\u201d Vitali Klitschko wrote on his Telegram messaging channel.\n\nUkraine Has Full Control Of Kharkiv, Regional Official Claims\n\nUkraine has full control of Kharkiv, Sinegubov said.\n\n\u201cControl over Kharkiv is completely ours! The armed forces, the police, and the defense forces are working, and the city is being completely cleansed of the enemy,\u201d he wrote on the Telegram messaging service.\n\nAl Jazeera was unable to independently verify the regional governor\u2019s claim.\n\nOver 360,000 Ukrainians Flee Country\n\nAt least 368,000 people have now fled Ukraine into Poland and other neighbouring countries in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion, the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) says.\n\nThe number has risen rapidly since Moscow launched its onslaught and is expected to continue to climb quickly.\n\nMore European States Bar Russian Planes\n\nA string of European countries, including Germany and Finland, have said they are preparing to close their airspace to Russian planes, mirroring measures already taken by other states on the continent.\n\nSweden, Denmark and Iceland were alongside Berlin and Helsinki as the latest to take action.\n\nGermany said its ban will last for three months and apply to all Russian flights from 14:00 GMT yesterday as the screws tighten on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine. Only humanitarian flights will be exempt from Berlin\u2019s measure.\n\nThe United Kingdom, Poland, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and Romania, as well as Baltic states Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, have also moved to shutter their airspace to Russian planes.\n\nGreece To send Defence Supplies To Ukraine\n\nGreece is sending defence supplies to Ukraine in response to a request from Kyiv, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis\u2019s office said.\n\nTwo C-130 military transport planes will carry the supplies to Poland, from where they will be transported onwards to Ukraine, the office said.\n\nThe move comes after Athens said on Saturday that 10 Greek nationals had been killed and six others wounded by Russian bombings near the city of Mariupol, in southeastern Ukraine.\n\nEU Should Fund Weapons, Fuel For \u2018Heroic\u2019 Ukraine, Says Borrell\n\nThe European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief has said he will propose using the bloc\u2019s funds to help finance weapons and other supplies for Ukraine during a meeting of its foreign ministers later.\n\n\u201cI will propose to [EU foreign] ministers to use the European Peace Facility for two emergency assistance measures,\u201d Josep Borrell said in a statement before the virtual meeting.\n\n\u201cThese aim to finance the supply of lethal material to the heroic Ukrainian army, which is fighting with fierce resistance against the Russian invaders and provide urgently needed non-lethal supplies, such as fuel.\u201d",
          "summary": "Nigerian students caught in the Russia-Ukraine war cannot cross to Poland despite instructions by the federal government to do so.\nThe sirens came on and off for about five times yesterday before I left,\u201d Orah, a Nigerian national, added.\nWe don\u2019t want to die in a foreign country,\u201d George said.\nBut for Somto and several other students, crossing the border into Poland has not been easy.\n\u201cThere are also separate reports of Polish officials simply refusing Nigerian citizens\u2019 entry into Poland from Ukraine,\u201d the president said.",

          "title": "ACF, Ohanaeze Set Justice, Equity As Criteria For 2023 Presidency",
          "text": "As presidential hopefuls continue to woo top Nigerian leaders for the top seat ahead of the 2023 general election, prominent socio-cultural regional bodies have urged the \u2018kingmakers\u2019 in the country to ensure they are guided by justice and equity.\n\nSpecifically, they were referring to former President Olusegun Obasanjo; former military president, Gen Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida, and former head of state, Gen Abdulsalami Abubakar.\n\nIn the past few months, the homes of these three former Nigerian leaders had become a Mecca of sorts by presidential aspirants since the race for the 2023 presidency began in earnest.\n\nSpeaking exclusively with LEADERSHIP on what Nigerians should expect from these prominent leaders, the apex Igbo socio-cultural organization, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, said the elder statesmen should prioritise justice and fairness ahead of 2023.\n\nNational publicity secretary of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Alex Ogbonnia, said, \u201cOutside endorsement, Obasanjo and others should talk to other leaders to ensure that the person who will emerge in 2023 will actualise justice and fair play.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOn its part, the apex northern socio-cultural group, Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), said beyond endorsing candidates, the leaders should remain as statesmen.\n\nSpokesperson of the forum, Emmanuel Yawe said, \u201cThe ACF cannot speak for these people. They have their spokesmen and also always speak for themselves. What the ACF expects of them is that they will continue to be statesmen and nothing more ahead of the 2023 election\u201d.\n\nAlso, the Movement for the Survival of Izon Ethnic Nationality in the Niger Delta (MOSIEND) said the former leaders should be talking about how to unite Nigerians rather than endorsing candidates for the 2023 general election.\n\nSpeaking with LEADERSHIP in Port Harcourt, president-general of MOSIEND, Kennedy Tonjo West, wondered why the former leaders were shying away from guiding Nigerians into the path of unity.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWest stated: \u201cRight now, it appears to us that these elder statesmen, the Abdulsalami Abubakars, the Babangidas, the Obasanjos and the Gowons are not talking about how to unite this country.\n\n\u201cAnd the only way to unite this country is when you give justice to the so-much oppressed regions. All of them are on their departure lounge. Yet, they are saying away from telling Nigerians what to do.\u201d\n\nThe MOSIEND leader called for the jettisoning of the 1999 constitution and the drafting of a new constitution, insisting that the existing laws were imposed on Nigerians.\n\nHe said: \u201cOur take on the endorsement being given by national leaders to one politician or the other is not what is going to solve the problem.\n\n\u201cThere should be no election in 2023 until the 1999 constitution, which was imposed on Nigerians is jettisoned and a fresh constitution be drafted that will address constitutional abnormalities, constitutional frictions that are tearing this country apart.\n\n\u201cWe have issues of restructuring everywhere, we have issues of Biafra wanting a secession, and we have issues of Oduduwa wanting a country of their own.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFor its part, the Middle Belt Forum (MBF) urged the leaders, especially those of the northern extraction, to ensure power shifts to the South.\n\nLEADERSHIP reports that even though it is not explicitly stated in the constitution, Nigeria has been sharing power between the North and the South, Christians and Muslims.\n\nThe incumbent president, Muhammadu Buhari, who is of the Muslim North extraction will complete a two term of eight years by 2023.\n\nBut interest from politicians from all parts of the country, especially those from the North to take over from Buhari has been raising concern.\n\nWhile the Southern governors under the leadership of Ondo State governor, Rotimi Akerodolu, has declared that the South must produce Buhari\u2019s successor, some northerners, especially politicians have viewed the comment as insulting, insisting that since they have the population and the voting strength, power should remain in the North.\n\nSpeaking with LEADERSHIP, president of the Middle Belt Forum (MBF), Dr Bitrus Pogu, warned that if the Nigerian leaders fail to intervene and power does not shift to the South, it will affect the unity of the country.\n\n\u201cThe leader and a statesman is supposed to lead people in the way of Justice and fair play,\u201d Pogu said, adding that if Abdulsalami, IBB and Gowon do not prevail on politicians of the Northern extraction to bury their presidential ambition in favour of the South in the 2023 general election, it will affect the unity of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThey must look at the issues, analise them and see what will bring peace and progress,\u201d Pogu told the former Nigerian leaders.\n\nHe continued: \u201cWe have looked passionately at the Nigerian situation. The insecurity In the North, the economy has gone bad, we hope people that are entrepreneurs will come in and resolve the issue.\n\n\u201cIf a northerner is here and the North is being ravaged by insecurity, we need somebody from the South that will ensure justice. We need somebody who is not going to be nepotism or tribalistic. We need somebody who will look at the problem as a leader. We know that as a country, some sections have not had a shot in the presidency.\n\n\u201cWe must look at that region that has not had a shot, and select someone credible from there. We want the issue of rotation of power to continue.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve said it here that by 2023 the presidency should go to the South. In the South, the people know that the South East are the most marginalized. Our own goal is to suggest, shout, and make contribution. But at the end of the day, anyone selected from the South should be the next president\u201d.\n\nAccording to him, as Abdulsalami, IBB and Gowon keep receiving presidential candidates across the country, they should be told the truth that power should shift to the South.\n\n\u201cIn their endorsement, Gowon, IBB and Abdulsalami should ensure that they tell the candidates that power should go to the South. They are elder statesmen and we believe they want good for the country. We believe they are going to ensure that Nigeria remains indivisible and peaceful\u201d.\n\nHe further noted that if power goes to the South, many Nigerians will believe in the oneness of the country. It\u2019s not about population alone. It is about carrying everyone and every part of the country along. It is time we continue to pursue unity.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, former deputy governor of Kaduna State, James Bawa Magaji, has said that power rotation is not constitutional, insisting that anyone interested in the seat should be allowed to contest for the office of president come 2023.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with LEADERSHIP, Magaji recalled that Moshood Abiola won the 1993 presidential election not as a result of zoning.\n\nMagaji said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe in zoning because it is not democratic. It is a shenanigan that robs Peter to pay Paul. After all, Abiola won election in 1993, not based on zoning but his wide spread acceptability across Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSo also president Muhammadu Buhari who won election because of his wide spread acceptability and followership across the country. The presidency of Nigeria is not child\u2019s play. Therefore, anybody who wants to be president must undertake a self-internal capability test. And if he has what it takes, he should run for president irrespective of where the person comes from. This will likely bring positive result to the person rather than zoning which has no general voter guarantee,\u201d Magaji said.\n\nMagaji who notes that in a democracy every person, people and group have the rights to vote and be voted for charged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to ensure the conduct of a credible election in 2023.\n\nWhile calling on Nigerians, irrespective of region, to participate fully in the next election, he said they should vote for people of integrity.\n\n\u201cNigerians must vote for people with capacity to do the job. We must never again go down the road of voting based on non-entitic and idiotic primordial bases. Ethnicity, religion, sectional and all of these sentiments have never led us anywhere other than sorrow, tears and deaths,\u201d Magaji added.",

          "text": "\n\nNo fewer than nine persons were reportedly killed and many others seriously injured when gunmen suspected to be loyalists of the late militia leader, Terwase Akwaza (Gana), attacked mourners at Mbacher council ward of Katsina-Ala local government area of Benue state.\n\nLocals said the gunmen stormed the venue of the burial of a tax collector, Zaki Atser Nor, Saturday and started shooting at the mourners, killing nine persons on the spot while also leaving other persons critically injured.\n\n\n\nOne of the locals, who spoke to journalists but pleaded anonymity, said the attack may be a retaliation of the killing of some armed militia men loyal to the late Gana last Thursday and Friday by troops of Operation Whirl Stroke (OPWS).\n\n\n\nChairman of Katsina Ala local government area, Mr Alfred Atera, who confirmed the development to journalists Sunday, said nine persons were killed during the attack.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, one of the boys popularly known as Janta was killed by soldiers few days back, a development that resulted in the reprisal by the boys.\n\n\n\nThe council boss explained that only four out of the nine persons killed were from Katsina-Ala, while five others, including an in-law to the deceased man who was from Vandeikya local government area, were also killed by the unknown gunmen.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe gunmen only wanted to make a statement by storming that burial and killing people. It\u2019s not that they had anything against the man that was being buried. In fact, one of the in-laws from Vandeikya who provided the coffin for the burial of the deceased man was sadly gunned down by the invading gunmen.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe family unfortunately refused to go with security personnel for the burial as was the usual practice for fear of the unknown gunmen. What they feared most eventually happened to them,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nAtera also said a kindred head, Zaki Isaac Vaatyouhh Gande was among those who were killed while the three others sustained injuries from gunshots and later taken to a nearby clinic for first aide treatment before they were transferred to bigger hospital for proper medical attention.\n\nArmy denies reprisal\n\nBut when contacted, Force Commander of OPWS, Major-General Kevin Aligbe, who confirmed the attack, however dispelled insinuation that it was a retaliation of an earlier killing of some wanted armed militias by his troops.\n\n\n\nAligbe, who noted that there was an ongoing raid of bandits\u2019 hideouts in the entire Sankera area, however vowed that all perpetrators of the dastardly acts as well as other criminal elements within the area would be smoked out.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is true that we are on operation around that area. The reason is that these guys (bandits) have been killing people and extorting people. So, whatever happened yesterday (Saturday) is not as a result of what we are doing because some of them (bandits) have submitted weapons within the last two weeks or something like that.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey have just made up their minds that they are going to make the place unsafe to law abiding citizens. But in the next two weeks we are going to get all of them. That is sure promise to Benue people,\u201d Aligbe promised.\n\nNiger bandits\n\nIn a related development, bandits at the weekend ransacked 12 villages in Lavun local government area of Niger state killing eight people while over 5000 villagers were reportedly displaced.\n\nThe attack on the communities, it was learnt, was still on Sunday afternoon as the bandits spread to more communities.\n\nChairman Lavun local government council, Hon Ibrahim Limanko Pata confirmed the incident in a condolence message to his people.\n\n\n\nHe commiserated with victims of the attacks which occurred in Ebbo and Ndagbegi communities under Egbako Ward.\n\nHowever, it was learnt that the bandits had spread to more villages as villagers fled the area.\n\nAn eyewitness account said: \u201cThe attack lasted all through to Sunday morning, during which the gunmen overran about 12 communities, leaving over 5,000 displaced.\u201d\n\nThe witness who pleaded anonymity listed the communities overran by the bandits to include Egbako, Ndaruka, Ebbo, Ndagbegi, Tshogi, Gogata and Ndakogitu, all in Lavun local government area.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time gunmen could launch a major offensive on the area, regarded as a-no-go area due to the people\u2019s strong hold on the power of their tradition.\n\nUnfortunately, the bandits are spreading to more villages of Satifu, Yekoko, Sokiara and moving into Batita village,\u201d he said.\n\nThe gunmen also reportedly disrupted a wedding ceremony at Gbacitagi village, kidnapped the bride and one other girl.\n\nThe hoodlums, according to reports, also carted away all the monies realised at the wedding ceremony, including other valuables\n\n\u201cThey also rustled a number of cattle belonging to the villagers. However, while on their way out of the communities and heading towards Akare community in Wushishi local government area of the state, with their rustled cattle, the gunmen got stuck at Akere when they discovered that the only bridge linking the community with Akare had collapsed,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother source close to Akere community, said the gunmen were currently stranded at the point of crossing with the cattle as the animals refused to enter the river.\n\nIt was learnt that the bandits eventually abandoned the cattle at the Akere river bank when all efforts to cross the animals were not successful, and that they decided to retreat back to Sheshi community to find a possible exit out of the community.\n\nBlueprint learnt that this was where the bandits were engaged in gun battle by local vigilantes during which two vigilantes and four locals also died.\n\nThe gunmen, according to the locals, later shared themselves into three groups with one group at Dabban community, another group at Shegba, while the third group was said to be heading towards Ndaruka community.\n\nHowever, Blueprint gathered that the bandits entered Bida, the traditional headquarters of the Nupe Kingdom at about 2pm Sunday.\n\nLocals are said to be fighting the bandits with a means to repel the attackers.\n\nA source said the bandits were confirmed to be at the Ilorin motor park in Bida where they entered in confusion.\n\nIt was learnt that the Sagi in Bida is leading the battle of Bida against the bandits.\n\nWe\u2019 rounded them up \u2013 NGSG\n\nBut the government of Niger state has said security operatives have rounded up the terrorists who invaded several communities in Bida emirate and that eight of the bandits were neutralised while others are holed up along the flanks of River Kaduna.\n\nCommissioner for Local Government, Chieftaincy Affairs and Internal security Emmanuel Umar stated this in a press briefing after an emergency security meeting at the Government House Minna.\n\nHe explained that the bandits entered the area about two days ago and were apparently aware of heavy security presence along the Wushishi cattle routes which made them to turn to Lavun and Kutigi local government areas of the state.\n\n\u201cHowever, security and local vigilantes engaged the bandits in gun battle during which 8 bandits were killed. They moved over to Laun and Kutigi local governments and to the flanks of river Kaduna up to Dabban community. They are currently rounded up in the area and we hope to neutralise them,\u201d Umar said.\n\nThe commissioner said security agencies had fully mobilised to the area and supported by air strikes.\n\nHe, however, described the report that bandits have entered Bida as untrue, adding that \u201cI also got that report that the bandits were in specific area in Bida but I called the Area Commander who said the report is false.\u201d\n\nHe advised people to disregard such fake report, adding that \u201cgovernment is committed to flush out the terrorists from the state. I am happy to tell you that the security agencies and the local communities are more committed to wiped out the terrorists as we employ new strategy\u201d.\n\nISWAP kills 11 farmers in Borno\n\nIn a related development, about 11 farmers have been killed by suspected members of the Islamic State of West African Province (ISWAP) during an attack in the southern part of the Borno State on Saturday.\n\nIt was learnt that ISWAP had stormed a remote village, Sabon-Gari in Damboa Local Government Area of the state on Saturday. The village is located about 125 kilometres from Maiduguri, the state capital.\n\nAccording to a security source, about seven bodies were recovered Saturday before an additional four were found Sunday afternoon.\n\nAnother source disclosed that a woman was among the casualties.\n\n\u201cWe(combined security forces) recovered a total of 11 dead bodies of farmers, they were all shot several times, they will be buried later in the day according to Islamic rite.\u201d the source said.\n\nZamfara\n\nAnd in what looks like a reprieve, the rescue operations to free abducted victims in Zamfara state has yielded some dividends as the state police command, in a joint operation, rescued seven kidnapped victims.\n\nThe command\u2019s public relations officer, SP Muhammad Shehu said this at press briefing in Gusau Sunday.\n\n\u201cOn 25th February , 2022, the Tactical operatives of the command in Collaboration with the military deployed along Dansadau axis in Maru LGA of Zamfara State have Successfully rescued seven (7) Kidnapped victims who are natives of Chibade village in Rijau LGA of Niger State,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said during debriefing, the victims informed the Police that, on 21st February, 2022 bandits in large number, stormed their village (Chibade) and abducted seven of them to unknown location in Dansadau forest of Zamfara State.\n\n\u201cJoint Police and Military operatives while on a coordinated bush clearance around Dansadau axis, successfully rescued the affected victims and brought them to Yariman Bakura Specialist Hospital, Gusau where they received medical check,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe police image-maker stated that all the victims would be handed over to the Commissioner of Police Niger State Police Command for further appropriate action.\n\n\u201cThe Commissioner of Police Zamfara State Command, CP Ayuba N.

          "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin laid out conditions on Monday for ending his invasion of Ukraine, as Moscow\u2019s forces shelled the country\u2019s second city and Western nations prepared even more sanctions.\n\nPutin\u2019s ultimatum came as Moscow and Kyiv held their first talks since the outbreak of war last Thursday, which shocked the world and provoked a massive diplomatic, economic, cultural and sporting backlash.\n\nShortly before the talks broke up, agreeing merely to hold a second round of negotiations \u201csoon\u201d, Putin laid out his prerequisites for ending the war in a phone call with French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\n\u201cPutin stressed that a settlement is possible only if Russia\u2019s legitimate security interests are unconditionally taken into account, including the recognition of Russian sovereignty over Crimea, the demilitarisation and denazification of the Ukrainian state and ensuring its neutral status,\u201d the Kremlin said.\n\nREAD ALSO: Nigeria Does Not Condone Russia\u2019s Invasion Of Ukraine \u2013 Onyeama\n\nFighting continued to rage during the dialogue, with at least 11 people killed by Russian attacks in Ukraine\u2019s second largest city of Kharkiv, near the Russian border.\n\nMore than 350 civilians, including 14 children, have been killed during the invasion, Ukraine says, while more than a half a million people have fled the country.\n\nOleg Sinegubov, the governor of the region that includes Kharkiv, said the \u201cRussian enemy is bombing residential areas of Kharkiv, where there is no critical infrastructure, where there are no positions of the armed forces\u201d.\n\nAn AFP photographer in the city inspected damage caused by fighting on Sunday, finding a destroyed school, as well as several burned out Russian infantry vehicles.\n\nRussian corpses in army fatigues could also be seen in the streets.\n\nIn Kyiv, many were preparing for a fresh assault with makeshift barricades dotting the streets.\n\nThe Russian army urged Ukrainians to leave Kyiv \u201cfreely\u201d on one highway out ahead of what is an expected Russian offensive to capture the capital.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency said it was \u201cgravely concerned\u201d as Russian forces advanced towards Ukraine\u2019s largest nuclear plant, strongly warning against any military action that could threaten the Zaporizhzhia facility.\n\nRuble plummets\n\nLong queues for groceries snaked through the streets of Kyiv on Monday after a strict 36-hour military curfew was lifted and volunteer militias learned how to make home-made explosives.\n\n\u201cWe will greet them with Molotov cocktails and bullets to the head,\u201d bank employee Viktor Rudnichenko told AFP. \u201cThe only flowers they might get from us will be for their grave.\u201d\n\nThe Russian ruble crashed to a record low as sanctions imposed by the West over the weekend had an immediate impact in Moscow, forcing the central bank to more than double its key interest rate to 20 percent.\n\nPutin also announced emergency measures intended to prop up the ruble, including banning residents from transferring money abroad.\n\nMany Russians raced to withdraw cash.\n\nRetired soldier Edward Sysoyev, 51, fidgeted impatiently while in line at a bank in Moscow.\n\n\u201cNinety percent of Russians are going to rush to withdraw their rubles and change them into dollars, property or even gold\u2026 it\u2019ll be ordinary people who pay for this military bun-fight,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Moscow Stock Market was closed Monday to prevent an expected mass sell-off.\n\n\u2018Unprovoked armed aggression\u2019\n\nAlso on Monday an emergency special session of the UN General Assembly \u2014 just the 11th held in the United Nations\u2019 77-year history \u2014 debated a resolution condemning Moscow\u2019s \u201cunprovoked armed aggression\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf Ukraine does not survive, the United Nations will not survive. Have no illusions,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s UN ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya said.\n\nA vote on the non-binding resolution is expected on Wednesday.\n\nMoscow\u2019s UN ambassador meanwhile said that 12 members of Russia\u2019s diplomatic mission to the UN have been ordered to leave the US by the end of March.\n\nIn further reaction to the Russian invasion, the International Criminal Court announced it was launching an investigation.\n\n\u201cI am satisfied that there is a reasonable basis to believe that both alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity have been committed in Ukraine\u201d since 2014,\u201d ICC prosecutor Karim Khan said.\n\nAnd Turkey said it would implement an international treaty to limit ships passing through the Dardanelles and Bosphorus straits, a move requested by Ukraine to block the transit of Russian warships.\n\nIn Russia, there were more signs of rare dissent among the usually ultra-loyal oligarchs who surround the Russian leader \u2014 in addition to anti-war demonstrations that saw an estimated 2,100 people arrested on Sunday.\n\nRussian tycoon Oleg Deripaska said \u201cwe need real crisis managers and not fantasists\u201d, while billionaire banker Oleg Tinkov said \u201cinnocent people are dying every day, this is unthinkable and unacceptable!\u201d\n\nWestern defence officials and the Kyiv government say Ukrainian troops have so far kept the country\u2019s major cities out of Russian hands despite incursions in the capital and Kharkiv over the weekend.\n\nHowever the small southern city of Berdyansk has been occupied, Ukraine said.\n\nMoscow claimed it had \u201cgained air superiority over the entire territory of Ukraine\u201d, while accusing Ukrainian troops of using civilians as human shields.\n\nHowever Olivier Kempf, a security analyst at the Foundation for Strategic Research think tank, said that Russian forces were \u201cnot bogged down\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is war, so there are difficulties. They may have logistics issues. But regardless of what we\u2019re told, they are making progress,\u201d he told AFP. \u201cOnly in video games do you conquer a country in two days.\u201d\n\nKicked out of World Cup\n\nThe weekend featured a momentous series of announcements from Europe, with Germany unveiling a historic change to its defence policies, and the EU saying it would buy and supply arms to Ukraine, the first such move in its history.\n\nOn Monday the European Union said it would add Russian oligarchs and the Kremlin\u2019s spokesman to its sanctions blacklist while traditionally neutral Switzerland said it would adopt the bloc\u2019s sanctions.\n\nAn aide to French President Emmanuel Macron added that the EU and its allies were preparing new sanctions to \u201craise the cost of the war\u201d for Putin and \u201cchange his calculations\u201d.\n\nHowever the EU poured cold water on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s request for \u201cimmediate\u201d membership to the bloc, saying the process to join takes years.\n\nThe response from the world of sports also gathered steam, as Russia was expelled from the World Cup and the country\u2019s clubs and national teams were suspended from all international football competitions \u201cuntil further notice\u201d, FIFA and UEFA said.\n\nPoland has taken in more than half of the 500,000 people who have fled Ukraine, according to the UN.\n\nKaterina Zaporojets, a laboratory worker from the central city of Cherkassy, said it took her 24 hours to arrive at the western Shegyni border post \u2014 and she will likely wait another 48 hours before crossing.\n\n\u201cThe trip was really hard,\u201d the 31-year-old told AFP. \u201cIt\u2019s calmer here, but the drive was really scary.\u201d\n\nAFP",

Hundreds of people have fled the country since Vladimir Putin launched the attack on its neighbours.\n\nThe Nigerian government had in the wake of the invasion rolled out plans to evacuate its citizens from Ukraine, although many faulted their move for being belated.

Even invalid documents were being accepted to cross the border and Covid-19 restrictions were lifted, she added.\n\nNigeria is not the only African with evacuation plans for its citizens stranded in the conflict. A group of South Africans, mostly students, have been stuck at the Ukrainian-Polish border, the country\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman, Clayson Monyela, said on Twitter.\n\nThe South African ambassador to Warsaw was at the site trying to get them through, according to Monyela who on Sunday had said Africans were being \u201ctreated badly\u201d at the Polish-Ukraine border.\n\nGhana\u2019s government said it would meet with parents of students stuck in Ukraine on Tuesday and sent embassy officials to border points to help.\n\nIvory Coast, which according to state media has 500 nationals in Ukraine, said it was also making arrangements for their evacuation.\n\nKenya\u2019s foreign affairs ministry said 201 citizens were in the country, most of them students.

Russia has now been removed from qualification for this winter\u2019s World Cup, and its remaining club side will no longer compete in the Europa League.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nUefa also announced that it is to cancel a long-standing and highly lucrative sponsorship deal with the Russian gas company, Gazprom. The suspension means that Russia will not be able to face Poland in a World Cup play-off semi-final next month, while its women\u2019s team will also be barred from this summer\u2019s European Championships in England.\n\n\u201cThese decisions were adopted today by the Bureau of the Fifa Council and the Executive Committee of Uefa, respectively the highest decision-making bodies of both institutions on such urgent matters.Football is fully united here and in full solidarity with all the people affected in Ukraine. Both Presidents hope that the situation in Ukraine will improve significantly and rapidly so that football can again be a vector for unity and peace amongst people.\u201d\n\nThe International Olympic Committee\u2019s executive board issued a recommendation to international sports federations earlier on Monday to exclude Russian and Belarusian athletes, officials and teams from international competitions wherever possible. That IOC executive board decision effectively gave a green light to FIFA to go further than it previously had, and to exclude Russia from the World Cup.\n\nThe IOC said the exclusion recommendation had been made \u201cin order to protect the integrity of global sports competitions and for the safety of all the participants\u201d.\n\nIt is the strongest move taken yet by the international sports community to isolate Russia from global competition.\n\nFifa had faced criticism over its initial decision on Sunday night to allow Russia to continue to compete in the men\u2019s World Cup play-offs, but on neutral territory and under the Football Union of Russia banner.\n\nOliver Mintzlaff, the chief executive of Spartak Moscow\u2019s Europa League last-16 opponents RB Leipzig, said in a tweet on the club\u2019s official channel: \u201cWe continue to be in close contact with the associations and have complete confidence in Uefa and their decision. We assume that the games will be cancelled.\u201d\n\nManchester City\u2019s Ukraine defender Oleksandr Zinchenko posted on Instagram on Monday calling for the exclusion of Russia from all international sports governing bodies and the country\u2019s athletes from participating in international competitions.",
