          "title": "Ex-President, Sultan, others ask FG to convene peace summit",
          "text": "Former President Olusegun Obasanjo; Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Muhammad Abubakar; President, Christian Association of Nigeria, Olasupo Ayokunle; Aare Ona Kakanfo of Yorubaland, Gani Adams; a founding member of the Arewa Consultative Forum, Alhaji Tanko Yakassai; and an Islamic cleric, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi, called on the Federal Government to immediately convene a national reconciliation conference to douse tension in the country.\n\nThe leaders were joined by regional groups such as the Northern Elders Forum, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, the Middle Belt Forum, Afenifere, the Arewa Consultative Forum and others.\n\nThe stakeholders also called on the government to act sincerely as an unbiased arbiter to address insecurity in the country headlong.\n\nThe stakeholders made their position known in a joint communiqu\u00e9 titled, \u2018Inclusive security dialogue, a meeting of select stakeholders to unbundle barriers\u2019, which was made available to journalists in Abuja on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to the communiqu\u00e9, the dialogue was convened as a strategy to understand conflict dynamics in Nigeria.\n\nIt was stated that expectations from the meeting were to have an increased understanding of the root causes of conflict and violence, and increased positive relationship between the government and various agitating groups.\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 stated in part, \u201cAs a result of this dialogue meeting, the individual discussants have contributed to this communiqu\u00e9 highlighting the following thematic focal points: High prevalence of insecurity in Nigeria is driven largely by social injustice and a failed economy, hence fuelling continued agitation by the country\u2019s young alienated generation.\n\n\u201cHunger and starvation in the land will get worse as continued violence and insecurity makes our farms unsafe for families, whose basic sustenance is dependent on their yields from the farms.\n\n\u201cNeglect of oil exploration communities and minorities will only deepen the threat to our security and unity. Underdevelopment and isolation cannot remain the strategy else they will be uncomfortable to remain with the concept of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cA national reconciliation conference that allows the principles of fairness, equity and justice, with an immediate consideration of legitimate agitations, and a collective effort to de-escalate the conflict and violence across the nation can no longer be ignored.\n\n\u201cThe 1999 Constitution is oligo-military in nature and does not represent our collective interests; it needs to be re-negotiated. A constitutional review process enabling peace and social cohesion is necessary. Government shall, therefore, provide an environment where a new constitution from the representatives of the people by the people and for the people will emerge.\u201d\n\nThe stakeholders also called on the government to \u201cact sincerely as an unbiased arbiter to address insecurity headlong as the high prevalence of violent crises, kidnapping and fatal attacks in Nigeria are driven largely by social injustice and a failed economy.\u201d\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 added, \u201cThe church, the mosque and traditional worshippers must as a matter of morality step up to the responsibility of contributing to the collective reengineering and moral rearmament urgently needed to salvage our nation, in fulfilling their roles as religious leaders and pulpit managers.\n\n\u201cGovernment, as a matter of urgency, must convene a national reconciliatory conference, where we can all address the underlying issues of our challenges and hateful statements/agenda that successive governments have ignored to address; this conference should be organised in order to quell the mistrust-fuelled agitations and crises before the entity called Nigeria collapses.\n\n\u201cThe 1999 Constitution does not embody the principles of justice, fairness and equality on which every democracy is founded. Thus, it does not fully protect the rights and interests of Nigeria\u2019s diverse constituencies. We call on the government to begin a process of constitutional review, amend and rework the Constitution by drawing on our previous constitutions, among other things, to synchronise/harmonise the laudable principles they embody. This will ensure, not one-off solutions, but lasting change.\u201d\n\n\u201cGovernments at all levels must revisit and show sincere effort at understanding the core issues of dissidence and self-determination in Nigeria rather than incarceration, bullets and counter-attacks as government response to agitations and unrest.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike; and the new national chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, Dr Iyorchia Ayu, on Wednesday boasted of the party\u2019s capacity to win 2023 presidency.\n\nWike said concerned stakeholders fought for the change of the immediate past national chairman of the party, Uche Secondus, because they wanted to reposition the party to win the presidency in 2023.\n\nHe maintained that such change of leadership at the national level was also to avert a situation of doom for the party.\n\nSpeaking at the flag-off of Oyigbo-Okoloma Road in Oyigbo Local Government Area on Wednesday, Wike said the party now has good leadership in place to rescue Nigeria from the All Progressives Congress.\n\nA statement signed by his media aide, Kelvin Ebiri, quoted the governor as saying, \u201cSome of us rose and said we will not wait. It doesn\u2019t matter if the person is anybody from Rivers State or not, what\u2019s important for us is for the PDP to have a good leadership to fight for the change of leadership in this country come 2023.\u201d\n\nHe therefore urged the party\u2019s new chairman, who inaugurated the road, to effect positive change in the party and return it to power.\n\nThe governor declared that the people of the state have no other party than the PDP, which is why they will not allow it to die.\n\nHe said his state was among few states in the country that denied the APC vote spread during the 2015 and 2019 general elections.\n\nOn the issue of his successor, the governor told party faithful currently consulting not to extend the consultation to the PDP national chairman or the National Working Committee of the party.\n\nAyu commended Wike and PDP governors for spreading development to all parts of their states.\n\nHe said while the APC-controlled government was busy borrowing money from foreign creditors and increasing the debt burden on Nigeria, PDP governors were delivering dividends of democracy.\n\nAyu berated APC governors, particularly, one of them who he said has abandoned his governorship responsibilities in his state to reside in Abuja.\n\nHe alleged that another one hid N19bn in the bank instead of providing development to his people.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not only proud of the governor of Rivers, I\u2019m proud of PDP governors. Every PDP governor, with the resources base of the state, have been trying very hard to make sure that the people get the dividends of democracy.\n\n\u201cThe other party, the governors take power as a joke. How on earth can a governor leave his state and become a party chairman and live in Abuja without making any effort to develop his state? I believe such action does not take into recognition the people who laboured to elect such a governor.\n\n\u201cHow can a governor of a state take N19bn and go and hide in a bank account, in a state where he has not paid salaries?\u201d\n\nAyu also said his leadership would ensure that it increases the number of states controlled by the PDP, produce majority membership of the National Assembly and clinch the presidency in 2023.\n\n\u201cThe Peoples Democratic Party is prepared to expand its base, not only in control of states, but in control of the National Assembly and ultimately also the return to the Villa in Abuja where we shall put a President of PDP extraction,\u201d he said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "By Elizabeth Adegbesan\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer, Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise (CPPE), Muda Yussuf, has said the Federal Government (FG) won\u2019t be able to fund the 2022 budget of N17.1 trillion due to its unending problem with revenue generation.\n\nThe National Assembly has just passed the 2022 Appropriation Act, raising the budget size to N17.126 trillion from the N16.391 trillion presented by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nREAD ALSO:APC scuttled electoral act amendment for fear of 2023 \u2014 PDP\n\nSpeaking at a CPPE press conference on business environment in Lagos, Yusuf, the immediate past Director General of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, LCCI, said: \u201cEven with the original budget we are talking about a deficit of over N6 trillion and many people expect that the deficit will even go higher than that. Because every now and then we are being told that the government has a revenue problem.\n\n\u201cLook at the rate at which we are borrowing. And the borrowing is going to increase because we are going to the last lap of the administration.

Secondly, there is no political will to deal with the issue of expenditure because we are just throwing everything into it as if we have to make it so that everybody is happy and yet we don\u2019t have the capacity to fund it. That is why at the end of each budget year, when you relate the actual to what was budgeted, it is always a huge gap. When you relate the appropriation to the releases sometimes some agencies will tell you they got about 20 per cent of releases. There is always a wide gap.\n\n\u201cThen there is also the risk of increasing the deficit and then borrowing which will further compound the fiscal situation that we have and the debt sustainability problem that we have.\u201d",

          "text": "NATIONAL Union of Electricity Employees, NUEE, has decried the worsening electricity supply across the country eight years after the privatisation of the assets of the defunct Power Holding Company of Nigeria, PHCN.\n\nPresident of NUEE, Engr. Martin Uzoegwu, in Lagos, contended that the only workable and practicable option for resolving the challenges facing the power sector was \u201ca total reversal of the whole privatisation exercise because it is not working and cannot work.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO:Lagos requires N99bn to kit 33,000 policemen, says LSSTF boss\n\nAccording to him: \u201cWe reiterate like we have done in the last 13 years that the solution to the power challenge in the Electric Power Reform process is total commercialisation of the sector. This option will give the companies the opportunity to charge economic tariffs with human face considering the purchasing power of the citizens and the regulatory directives.\n\nIt will help to solve the twin problems of funding and investments in the whole value chain of the power sector. Power is not only a business but also a social service and one of the commanding heights of the economy.\n\n\u201cIf we resolve the power debacle, Nigeria will solve a lot of socio-economic problems with one stone. These may include but not limited to reduction in unemployment, reduction in the rate of organised crimes and other social vices, creation of small and medium enterprises in the rural and semi-urban areas, reduction in the cost of energy for manufacturing firms thus reducing the cost of goods and services and increase in turnover which could lead to more direct and indirect employment, reduction in rural-urban migration, rapid development of our industrial capacity and increased life expectancy as a result of less stress, better health management etc.\n\nIt will also lead to more revenue for government as access to electricity will increase income from tariffs, rapid development of the country in the area of industrialisation, foreign direct investment, FDI, more worker-friendly environment with good pay and welfare packages and reduction or elimination of power poverty.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cin Nigeria the power sector, long neglected by successive governments was primed for privatisation. This feat was achieved in 2013 when the PHCN was unbundled to 11 Distribution and six Generation companies, and sold to different private companies while one Transmission Company is still owned by the FG.\n\nThe government mantra was that the private sector would provide infrastructure and utilities more effectively and attract investment.\n\n\u201cA long list of reasons was given why the privatization of the sector must happen.\n\nThey include Grid energy insufficiency and instability, network infrastructure challenges (overloaded transformers and feeders, obsolete equipment, limited network, lack of automation, etc), Gas limitation to the generation companies, annual water shortages at the hydro-generation station, metering challenges (huge metering gap of over 6,000,000, estimated billing, poor meter maintenance, etc), operational challenges (long feeders, quality of workforce, large operational areas, etc), funding challenges (absence of long term \u201cpatient\u201d capital (equity/debt) to fund capex investment, high cost of borrowing, poor history of DisCos, etc), lack of investment/upgrade of equipments and facilities, lack of diversification to other forms of energy, health, safety, and environmental issues.\n\nHe said since the privatization, \u201ctariffs have been increased three times and the fourth increase is imminent.\n\nThis continues to put additional burdens on Nigerians who do not actually enjoy adequate power supply. The only beneficiaries of this regime are generator importers who continue to have a field day.\n\nUzoegwu, \u201cThis year marks the eighth anniversary of the privatisatiion exercise, and the same issues have remained unsolved. Citizens and industries still do not have reliable power supply. Even with installed capacity at 12,522 MW, the nation has not been able to generate beyond 4,000 MW, which is insufficient for the population of 200 million. Added to these are the periodic price hikes, a variety of tariffs and estimated billing.\n\nRecall that electricity on the grid on November 1, 2013, when the sector was privatised was around 3,400MW. Since then, the highest peak power ever generated and transmitted in Nigeria was 5,802MW on March 1, 2021, which was evacuated at a frequency of 50.09 hertz.Nigeria is supposed be generating over 20,000MW by now. While the transmitting capacity has improved to wheel well over 8,000 MW through the GRID, we still have less power to pass through the system for the Country.\n\nAnd we continue to pay them for doing nothing to upgrade the capacity in the Country.As we speak , power generation has again dropped to below 4,000 MW.\n\nDisturbingly, the GenCos have jettisoned the primary objectives of generating power as contained in their MOU to sundry businesses around the power stations.We can authoritatively say without fear of contradiction that some prefer these other businesses to revamping the generating machines.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari says Nigeria needs an investment size of N348.1 trillion to achieve the targets set out in the National Development Plan (NDP) 2021-2025.\n\nMr Femi Adesina, the President\u2019s spokesman, said the president stated this at the formal launch and public presentation, on Wednesday in Abuja, of the National Development Plan (NDP) 2021-2025, the successor to the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP), 2017- 2020, which lapsed in Dec. 2020.\n\nREAD ALSO:Police confirm death of female traffic officer crushed by truck in Calabar\n\nAccording to President Buhari, the overall target of the Plan is to achieve a broad-based real GDP growth rate of 5 per cent on average during the Plan period; generate 21 million full-time jobs; and through an inclusive growth, lift 35 million people out of poverty.\n\nHe added that this would set the stage for achieving the government\u2019s target of lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years, under the National Poverty Reduction with Growth Strategy (NPRGS).\n\nTo achieve these, the president noted that out of the investment size of N348.1 trillion, the government is expected to provide N49.7 trillion or 14.3 per cent, while the private sector would provide the balance of N298.3 trillion or 85.7 per cent.\n\n\u2018\u2018This implies that successful implementation of the Plan will require a strong partnership between the public and private sectors.\n\n\u2018\u2018In this regard, a Development Plan Implementation Unit, headed by the Vice President, with the Minister of State, Budget and National Planning as the Vice-Chair, will be established in the Budget and National Planning arm of the Ministry,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, this is to ensure overall coordination with the Ministries, Departments and Agencies; sub-national governments; Private sector operators and Civil Society Organizations.\n\nThe president recounted that the Federal Executive Council (FEC) had on Nov. 10, 2021, approved the Draft National Development Plan, 2021-2025, which was the first of the envisaged Medium Term development Plans to implement the Nigeria Agenda 2050.\n\n\u2018\u2018The Plan, as a matter of deliberate efforts, is comprehensive and has the capacity not only to accelerate and sustain national development but also to attain various Regional and Global Agendas, including the AU Agenda 2063, ECOWAS Agenda 2050 and the UN Sustainable Development Goals, 2030.\n\n\u2018\u2018I have no doubt in my mind that with effective and sustained implementation, Nigeria will achieve quantum leap in unlocking its potentials in all sectors of the economy for a sustainable and inclusive national development,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nHe commended the Ministers of Finance, Budget and National Planning, the Leaderships of the National Steering Committee, the Central Working Group and the Technical Working Groups for the sacrifice and efforts in achieving this milestone.\n\nThe president noted that the implementation of the ERGP not only helped the country to exit the 2016 economic recession but sustained a modest growth until the advent of the recent global economic challenges occasioned by the outbreak of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\n\n\u2018\u2018The sustained implementation of the ERGP ensured execution of our social investment programmes and improvement in infrastructure across the country.\n\n\u2018\u2018In order to ensure a seamless transition and continue the implementation of the policies, programmes and projects of government, it became necessary to prepare a successor Plan to the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan.\n\n\u2018\u2018I on September 9, 2020, therefore, inaugurated the National Steering Committee (NSC), co-chaired by the respected Mr. Atedo Peterside and the Honourable Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Dr. (Mrs) Zainab Ahmed.\n\n\u2018\u2018Apart from the NSC, the institutional arrangement for the preparation of the Plan also included; the Central Working Group (CWG), the Technical Working Groups (TWGs) and a strong Secretariat that supported the process.\n\n\u2018\u2018The process adopted for the preparation of the Plan was not only participatory and consultative but also inclusive.\n\n\u201dIt involved all segments of the society such as; Key Political Parties; Government Agencies; Labour Unions; Youth Organizations; Civil Society Organizations; Women Society; Farmers\u2019 Association; ALGON; Traditional and Religious Leaders and Representatives of People with Special Needs; and Development Partners,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nAccording to the president, the broad objectives of the Plan include the establishing of a strong foundation for a concentric diversified economy with robust MSME growth and a more resilient business environment as well as investing in critical, physical, financial digital and innovation infrastructure.\n\nHe added that the Plan is also expected to build a solid framework to strengthen security and ensure good governance while also enabling a vibrant, educated and healthy population.\n\n\u2018\u2018The macroeconomic framework recognizes that sectors have differing potentials for growth and identified and leveraged on those sectors with the highest potentials for stimulating growth,\u2019\u2019 he further explained",

          "text": "Leader of Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF), and Chairman, Board of Trustees, Ijaw National Congress, Chief Edwin Kiagbodo Clark, has written a protest letter, a copy of which was made available to DAILY POST in Abuja on Wednesday, alleging former President Olusegun Obasanjo\u2019s hatred for Niger Delta region.\n\nHe blasted Obasanjo for betraying the interest of Niger Delta region for the past forty-five years, when he was the military Head of State.\n\nClark\u2019s grouse was that, the former President did visit him in his residence last week, and showed no discontent about the Niger Delta and its people with regards to the struggle for resource control, only for him to lampooned and embarked on verbal outbursts, at a summit organised by the Global Peace Foundation in Abuja.\n\nClark, who took out time to thank Chief Olusegun Obasanjo for stopping over at his Asokoro residence on Monday, 13th December, 2021, to check on his wellbeing, added that they both engaged in discussion that bothers on national issues and those issues that were very disturbing, but wondered what went wrong within few days that made Obasanjo to descend heavily on the Niger Delta people.\n\nHe said, the discussion, though, personal to two of them, was never about Niger Delta, and neither did Obasanjo expressed any ill-feelings about Niger Delta people, before going to a summit to lash out at Niger.Delta people.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency will recall that a summit was organised by a group, Global Peace Foundation, on Monday, 13th December, 2021, the same day you came to visit me, to which various groups and individuals were invited, and Your Excellency happened to be one of the invitees.\n\n\u201cI was equally invited. But because as Your Excellency knows, I am recuperating from an ailment, and since I have been told by my doctors to take things easy, I asked His Excellency, Ambassador Godknows Igali, a retired Permanent Secretary with the Federal Civil Service, and a former Ambassador, to kindly represent me at the Summit together with Mr. O\u2019Mac Emakpore, a retired Director with the Nigeria Television Authority (NTA) and Engr. Ebipamowei Wodu, the Secretary-General, Ijaw National Congress (INC).\u201d\n\nThe leader expressed shock having watched Chief Obasanjo\u2019s outburst in a video which he described as unbecoming of his standing in the society.\n\nHe said, Obasanjo\u2019s outburst was a huge disappointment to those present at the meeting as his hate for the people of Niger Delta who dared to agitate for resource control was obvious, specifically, when he interjected Engr. Wodu and Mr. O\u2019Mac Emakpore, each time they tried to put the interest of the Niger Delta in proper perspective.\n\nAccording to him, he has known Chief for the past forty-six years before he became the Military Head State, who was also conversant with the perils of the region, wondering why he continued to push for maeginalisation of the region.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency, we have known ourselves for several decades, since 1975, when we served as Federal Commissioners (Ministers) in the cabinet of General Yakubu Gowon\u2019s government, together with His Excellency, late Alhaji Shehu Shagari, late General Murtala Mohammed, amongst others.\u201d\n\nClark recalled that the agitation for resource control has been there even when it was earlier captured in the 1960 Constitution, wondering why Obasanjo has been consistently working against the region that produces the nation\u2019s economic mainstay.\n\nPointing out at section 140 of the 1960 Constitution, Chief Clerk insisted that natural resources found in regions, were controlled by the people of the regions in the country.\n\n\u201cAs a former Military Head of State of Nigeria, 1976-1979, and later a democratically elected President of the country, 1999-2007, I am certain Your Excellency knows that the principle of derivation, has always been top on the agenda of our national discourse, before and after the country\u2019s Independence.\u201d\n\nClark said, Chief Obafemi Awolowo of the the Western region and Sir Ahmadu Bello of the Northern region were able to develop their regions above the Eastern region\n\nas a result of the practice of the principle of derivation.\n\n\u201cThe Eastern Region did not progress like the other two regions. From the benefits of the practice of derivation principle, the Western Region introduced free education, built universities, the first Television in Africa, among other economic and social infrastructure, including hiring at the time, an Israeli Company, Soleh Bole, to develop roads and other infrastructure.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that the derivative principle continued till the discovery of oil in commercial quantity at Oloibiri in 1956 which the then Prime Minister, Alhaji Tafawa Balewa, sent congratulatory message to the then Premier of the Eastern Region, Dr. Michael Okpara.\n\nThe sharing formula at the time was 50% of the revenue for the owning State, while 20% and 30% goes to the Federal government and distributable pool, for sharing among the regions, including the contributing region.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency, as you are very much aware, this was the situation for sharing the fiscal assets of the federation among the regions of the country until the 1966 coup that suspended the Constitution.\n\n\u201cThe Cocoa House and the Liberty Stadium all in Ibadan, the Western House in Lagos and the Oodua group of companies, one of the biggest companies in Nigeria, are solely owned by the Western Region. One very disappointing thing that happened in the whole of this, was when the Midwest Region, to which I belonged, was created out of the Western Region, the Western Region, bluntly refused to share assets with the Midwest Region on the reason that the Midwest Region did not contribute anything to the Western Region and to its economy.\u201d\n\nHe explained the the northern region was well coordinated in the joint ownership of assets compared to South East region, a situation that badly affected them at the time.\n\nChief Clark lamented that the 36 States of the Federation comes to Abuja on monthly basis to shares oil revenues to the ruins of Niger Delta region.",

As soon as he got home, his security details and personal staff, learning that they would not be travelling to Esa-Oke again, went out to look for dinner at a nearby restaurant as soon as they dropped their boss.\n\n\u201cShortly after they left, some gunmen invaded the Ige residence.\n\n\u201cThe house was at the end of the street. Behind it was a swamp of an undeveloped bush that terminated in a dead-end.\n\n\u201cThey overpowered the only gateman who had been working with Uncle Bola before he took up the ministerial appointment with Obasanjo and marched him upstairs.\n\n\u201cAll the doors were opened and they soon accosted their quarry in his bedroom.\n\n\u201cThere, they shot him and fled.

Let us be unstinting in our sustaining reminiscences.\n\n\u201cI particularly regret my absence, as it provides a mandatory, inescapable occasion for directing a question at the nation\u2019s current leader, President Buhari, a DEMAND that the entire nation, no matter the political inclination of her citizens, is morally obliged to make.\n\n\u201cMY message proceeds: President Muhammadu Buhari, what has become of your robust pledge to open an enquiry into the spate of political murders that the nation has undergone in recent years?\n\n\u201cDoes it all amount to yet another instance of political bravado?\n\n\u201cWhile we all accept that all lives should be valued equally, some impose a special responsibility on those in governance.\n\n\u201cBola Ige, as the nation\u2019s minister of justice, and United Nations\u2019 civil servant designate, was unarguably one such.\n\n\u201cA nation\u2019s honour is in question and remains so until the hour of closure.\n\n\u201cThus, she must never relent in demanding an explanation for his brutal murder, expose the perpetrators, identify the conspirators and reinstate the broken lines of justice.\n\n\u201cAt the very least, we need a formal declaration regarding those who displayed an abnormal interest in the fates of those accused, to a level of proven, documented interference both in the investigative process and within the judiciary.\n\n\u201cI am not alone in having written and lectured on these sordid aspects that fuelled the subversion of justice. There are surviving witnesses.\n\n\u201cUnsolved crimes only lead to a culture of impunity. This puts the entire nation at risk, no matter the privilege of high-level protection.\n\n\u201cThis is a lesson that Nigerian leadership has yet to learn.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari, share the rewards of your investigations \u2013 if any!!!\u201d",

          "text": "From Fred Itua, Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja and Henry Uche\n\nSenators may today draw battlelines with President Muhammadu Buhari over the veto of the Electoral Amendment Bill 2021.\n\nMajority of them want to press for the overriding of the president\u2019s veto, in exercise of the National Assembly\u2019s power to overrule the president on passed bills.\n\nPresident Buhari had withheld assent to the Electoral Amendment Bill, which the National Assembly sent to him on November 19, 2021.\n\nAs exclusively reported by The Sun on December 9, the president, in a letter to the National Assembly leadership, said he was withholding assent over the provision on direct primaries by political parties as the only means of selecting candidates for election.He said its adoption would increase the cost of elections as well as infringe on the rights of citizens.\n\nHe also cited insecurity as another reason for withholding assent to the bill, which has as its major highlight the electronic transmission of election results.\n\nCompetent sources at the Senate told Daily Sun that senators were not happy that President Buhari vetoed the Electoral Bill and want the upper legislative chamber to override his veto and pass the bill into law with two-thirds majority as required by the constitution. The Senate needs the \u201cYes\u201d votes of 73 lawmakers to override the veto and pass the Electoral Bill into law.\n\nIt was gathered that the aggrieved senators said they would not discuss the 2022 budget, which was to be passed yesterday, except the senate took a final decision on the Electoral Bill by allowing them to vote for the overriding of the president\u2019s veto.\n\nDaily Sun gathered that between yesterday\u2019s morning and evening, 81 senators had signed for the overriding of the president veto. These included senators who attended plenary and those absent but who sent in their positions via phone messages.\n\nSeventy-one senators signed the document, while 10 sent phone messages to support the plan to override the President\u2019s veto, it was gathered.\n\nIt was learnt that Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, was not comfortable with the move to override President Buhari\u2019s veto and is believed to be devising strategy to frustrate the plot.\n\nOne of the strategies he may adopt, it was learnt, is open voting on the floor today, believing that such process may make senators to chicken out of the plan.\n\nThe senators, however, are insisting that there would be no need to vote on the floor since they had already signed a document on their position to override the president\u2019s veto.\n\nIt was,however, learnt that the Senate president has rejected the \u201cvote\u201d via phone messages by senators who were absent in yesterday\u2019s plenary, insisting that only the position of those present would be considered.\n\nSources told Daily Sun that the Senate could not close plenary for the year yesterday as earlier scheduled because of senators\u2019 insistence that President Buhari\u2019s veto of the Electoral Bill must be discussed before they go on recess. They senators also refused to discuss and pass the 2022 budget as earlier scheduled.\n\nIt is believed that the Senate would go on recess today after discussing and perhaps taking a vote on President Buhari\u2019s veto of the Electoral Bill. The House of Representatives has already gone on recess till January next year.\n\n\u2022Reps\u2019ll revisit electoral bill next year \u2013 Gbajabiamila\n\nHowever, Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila, has said the House of Representatives would revisit the Electoral Act Amendment when it resumes from Christmas vacation on January 2022.\n\nHe stated this while addressing members at the last plenary for this year.\n\nGbajabiamila said the House when it resumes would continue efforts to reform the electoral process, saying that is what Nigerians expect from the parliament.\n\n\u201cThis year, despite the differences of opinions, all of us in the House of Representatives and indeed the entire National Assembly, worked to pass the Electoral Act Amendment Bill. We included in that bill, provisions we hope will significantly enhance the conduct of our national elections and improve public confidence in our electoral outcomes. As it is now, that bill has not received presidential assent, and it falls on parliament to decide the best way forward.\n\n\u201cWhen we return in the New Year, we will resume our efforts to reform the electoral system in our country. And we will do it together. That is what the Nigerian people expect of us, and we will do our duty for God and country. Whichever way it pans out, we must not throw out the baby with the bath water and must deliver a credible and enduring electoral system to Nigerians. Every law is a living document and as long as it has breath, it must survive,\u201d he said.\n\nMinority Leader, Ndudi Elumelu, speaking under matters of privilege, had implored the House to immediately remove the contentious clause and resend it the president for assent.\n\nElumelu had argued that time was of essence in the quest by the National Assembly to give the country a new electoral law ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nGbajabiamila, in his response, said since the country operates a bicameral legislature, whatever the House intends to do must be in sync with Senate for it to be effective.\n\n\u2022 We\u2019re not scared of direct primaries \u2013 NGF\n\nMeanwhile, Chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF) and Governor of Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, has said contrary to perceptions, neither President Buhari nor governors were scared of direct primaries.\n\nFayemi, who was responding to questions from State House Correspondents after a meeting with the president, dismissed suggestions that the president had succumbed to their pressure by declining assent to the bill, noting that governors do not care whether the mode of primaries is direct or indirect.\n\nWhen told that governors were happy because President Buhari did not sign the bill over the mandatory direct primaries, Fayemi argued: \u201cOkay, well, I don\u2019t know what you mean by governor\u2019s being happy. At least as the governor who has gone through a series of elections, my election to office during my first term was via a direct primary that took place in all the 177 wards in my state. And my election to my second term in office was via an indirect primary.\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019ve tasted both and I can tell you that it really doesn\u2019t matter to any governor whether you have primaries via direct mode or an indirect mode. What is governors\u2019 interest and concern is that opportunities are given for an inclusive process. And I think that is what Mr. President\u2019s letter has brought out.\n\n\u201cMr. President has not objected to direct primaries, neither has he endorsed indirect primaries. He has only said, be fair to all, let all options apply and what you decide should be determined by your own local and peculiar circumstances. Being mindful of questions of security, finances, and internal democracy.\n\n\u201cSo, I think we all should commend the courage of Mr. President to stand with the people. And the President, you know, just like me, is not afraid of whatever mode you you decide to use.\n\n\u201cWhen I chaired the primaries, the historic primaries that brought him in as a presidential candidate, I was the chair of that primaries in 2014, it was an indirect primaries.\n\n\u201cBut in 2019, when he was coming back, he came back via a direct primary. So, Mr. President has also tasted both. And I don\u2019t think he\u2019s somebody to be lectured about the pros and cons of either processes.\n\n\u201cWhat is important is to ensure that whatever process you choose in your particular circumstance still provides a process that is as free a manner as possible.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not completely free process, but at least there is something that is called substantial compliance in electoral law. And if it meets substantial compliance, I think all of us should be happy with that. We shouldn\u2019t really dwell too much on\u2026there\u2019s been this exaggerated expectation that direct primaries is going to provide all answers to whatever electoral challenges that we have faced.\n\n\u201cAnd we all know that that is false. Direct primaries has its own challenges, indirect primaries has its own challenges, a consensus approach is also not without challenges but options should be provided.\n\n\u2022CUPP tasks NASS\n\nThe Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP) has charged the National Assembly to expunge direct primaries from the Bill and return same to President Buhari for his assent.\n\nIts spokesman, Ikenga Ugochinyere, appealed to members of the National Assembly to cancel their Christmas break so as to enable them rework the Bill, immediately, in the interest of the country.\n\n\u201cIf the issue of direct and indirect primary is why the president failed to sign the electoral law, let parliament expunge that area and retransmit the remaining one to him. Let us see the reason he would use in not signing it again.\n\n\u201cIf the parliament was responsive, there is no need of going on recess at a time like this. All that is required to do is just one or two sittings and the amendment would be made and transmitted back to the president for assent. I can tell you that what the president is running away from is not the argument of direct or indirect primary but the president is scared that if he conduct an election with electronic voting system, his party would lose election.\u201d\n\n\u2022Override veto or leave in perpetual shame, Ozekhome to NASS\n\nSenior lawyer, Mike Ozekhome, also threw a challenge to the National Assembly to override the president\u2019s veto and pass the bill into law, using section 58 (5) of the 1999 constitution.\n\nIn a monitored interview, Ozekhome said he was not surprised that the president declined his assent to the bill. He said he had earlier challenged the president in a public forum to surprise him and many other Nigerians who knew ab initio that he would not sign the bill, saying his expectation in this regard was not dashed.\n\nOzekhome said history beckons on the lawmakers in both the Senate and House of Representatives to give Nigerians a Christmas present by getting two-third majority in a joint session to pass the bill into law in the interest of Nigerians. He warned that Nigerians would hold the lawmakers responsible if things deteriorate politically, economically and otherwise in the years ahead as a result of the non-passage of the electoral amendment bill.",

          "text": "*Stresses need for Senate to stabilise polity ahead of 2023 poll\n\n*Says report of 1999 constitution review committee for consideration January\n\nDeji Elumoye and Juliet Akoje in Abuja\n\nPresident of the Senate, Dr Ahmad Lawan, has disclosed that the National Assembly will on Thursday transmit the 2022 budget passed by both chambers to President Muhammadu Buhari for assent.\n\nHe also canvassed for the Senate to stabilise the nation\u2019s polity ahead of the 2023 general elections as the Red Chamber prepares to consider the report of the committee on the review of the 1999 constitution upon resumption of plenary in January, 2022.\n\nLawan, who dropped the hint on Wednesday in his remarks shortly before the chamber proceeded on recess emphasised that the timely signing of the 2022 Appropriation bill into law would ensure the commencement of its implementation by January next year.\n\nAccording to him, businesses operating in the country as well as the economy stand to be impacted positively by the timely passage of the nation\u2019s budget by the National Assembly.\n\nHe said, \u201cFor the 2022 Appropriation bill, we are expecting that the bill will be cleaned up between today and tomorrow, and we hope that by tomorrow (Thursday), the bill will be sent to Mr. President for his assent.\n\n\u201c[And] we are very optimistic that Mr. President will assent to the bill, like he did for 2020 and 2021, so that by January 2022, the implementation of the budget 2022 will commence by the grace of God.\n\n\u201cWe have seen the benefits of passing and assenting to the budget in good time, especially when we had to fight COVID-19.\n\n\u201cThe consequence of the implementation of the budget in 2021 and 2020 was very clear. For us to come out of the recession that we found ourselves in the previous period, we must have had the fortune of passing the budget and getting Mr. President to sign in time.\n\n\u201cSo, we believe that the economy of Nigeria, and Nigerian businesses especially, will continue to benefit from the passage of the appropriation bills in time and the assent by Mr. President, accordingly.\n\n\u201cWe wish to make it clear that our desire is to provide legislations for the peace, order and good government of our country.\u201d\n\nLawan further stated that the Red Chamber would consider the report of the Committee on the Review of the 1999 Constitution as soon as it is presented early next year.\n\nHis words: \u201cWhen we return, we have one major that has not been attended to at all as a chamber, and that is the constitutional amendments.\n\n\u201cOur Committee on the Review of the 1999 Constitution has been doing its work. But as a chamber, we haven\u2019t finished working on it.\n\n\u201cWe are expectant that our Committee on the review of the constitution will be presenting the report to this chamber as soon as we resume. The committee has done so much, and the report is almost ready.\n\n\u201cWhen we harmonize with our colleagues in the House, we should be able to vote on the issues that will particularly bring about peace, unity and good government in our country, before such bill will be sent to the State Houses of Assembly for concurrence.\n\n\u201cOn the whole, we must thank Almighty God that almost all those major items we reflected in our legislative agenda as a chamber has been attended to.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing that has been left out, including the review or amendment to our standing orders on how our committees have better and more clearly defined jurisdictions and, of course, how we conduct ourselves here as a chamber.\n\n\u201cAnd this is because we\u2019ve remained united even in the face of sometimes very difficult issues. We have gone through such difficult moments with dignity and respect for each other, and we have come out even stronger.\u201d\n\nHe reminded his colleagues of the role of the Senate as an institution to stabilize the polity, particularly against the backdrop of issues likely to surface ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cNext year, by the grace of God, will be the last lap of our tenure. So, we have a lot to ensure that we finish all the things that we have penciled down for ourselves and, of course, there are many other issues that from time to time will be coming up in our polity.\n\n\u201cThis Senate is supposed to play that role of stabilizing the polity in Nigeria.\n\n\u201c[And] I daresay, that the members of the National Assembly, particularly the Senate, is a stabilizing institution in the polity of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nLawan underscored the need for the National Assembly to work with the executive arm of government to provide the needed resources, as well as oversight the use of such funds in the fight against insecurity.\n\n\u201cThe killings across the country are so bad, and it is not acceptable to us, but we have to work hard because we are part of government and we are also accountable to the people, for not only protecting their lives and property, but to ensure that they have a life that is worth living\u201d.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "More victims of the rogue police team at Force Criminal Investigation Department Annex, Alagbon Close, Lagos State, that forcefully extorted N22 million worth of bitcoin from two young real estate developers in July 2021, Morakinyo Tobiloba Peter and Yusuf Samson Dayo, have emerged.\n\nLed by Cordelia Nwawe, a Deputy Superintendent of Police with Force number 14534, the criminal team has been \u2018running riot\u2019 all across Lagos, seizing, framing and extorting innocent citizens they sense have access to good money.\n\nIn the latest episode of their criminal enterprise, the police team led by Nwawe forced a United Kingdom returnee, Kanmi Adedire, to pay $30,000 at gunpoint on August 23, 2021 to be free from their grip after falsely accusing him of illegal financial activities.\n\nAdedire, who lives in the UK with his two children and is a graduate of the Obafemi Awolowo University, was on a visit with them to Nigeria in August and was going about his activities when he ran into the criminal police team that fateful day.\n\nHe was accosted at about 2:10 pm by five policemen in a Toyota Camry car as he drove out of Banana Island and headed towards Turnbul Road in Ikoyi enroute to Magodo on Lagos Mainland.\n\nAfter identifying themselves and saying that there was a petition against the owner of the Mercedes Benz GLE Adedire was driving, the policemen ordered him to move to their office at the FCID Alagbon. See Also Police REAVEALED: Identities Of Rogue Police Officers Who Extorted N22million Worth Of Bitcoin From Young Men At Gunpoint In Lagos\n\nDespite requesting to make a few phone calls to let his lawyer and other family members know the situation he was in, the policemen declined and instead seized his two mobile phones and laptop, which was at the back seat of the car.\n\nUpon getting to their office, they forced the young man to provide passwords to his two phones and laptops which they went on to search for several hours in a bid to find any incriminating item on them.\n\nWhen that did not work, they further breached Adedire\u2019s privacy by logging into his private and business email accounts to print out documents of his correspondence with clients in the UK before forcing him to thumbprint and hold them in front of a camera.\n\nDemanding to find out what his crime was and asking the police officers to show him a copy of the petition they claimed to have against him, Adedire was threatened with death and told that he was going to be paraded as a money launderer if he didn\u2019t cooperate with them and \u2018buy\u2019 his freedom.\n\nDSP Nwawe, who told her men to deal with the young man if he failed to cooperate, threatened to jail him and even get a promotion for doing so.\n\nThe police team went ahead to demand N100 million before letting him go but eventually reduced it to $30,000 after the victim, out of fear for his life, pleaded with them to bring the amount down.\n\nIt was only then that Adedire was allowed access to one of his mobile phones so that he could contact family members and friends to raise the \u2018ransom\u2019 money the policemen had put on his head.\n\nAfter making several frantic calls to his contacts at gunpoint, the victim managed to raise the complete amount, which was brought to the FCID office at Alagbon by one of his friend\u2019s driver around 8:00 pm that day.\n\nImmediately DSP Nwawe and her rogue team received the $30,000, they did some paperwork and released Adedire to go.\n\nWhile making his way out of the place, one of the policemen, who gave his name as Aigbe, told him that he could have been killed that night had he not been able to provide the money they demanded.\n\nSpeaking with SaharaReporters from his base in the UK on Wednesday, the victim said, \u201cAs I was leaving, one of the policemen told me that I must be a good man for being able to raise the money they demanded that day. He said that I could have been killed if I hadn\u2019t paid the money.\n\n\u201cHe told me to be positive about the whole thing as I could have fallen into the hands of kidnappers and the situation could have been worse.\n\n\u201cI am still traumatised from that whole experience. The people I thought I could find protection from are the ones who have made my life a nightmare for no reason.\n\n\u201cI was harassed and threatened with death for about six hours for committing no offence. They could not provide the said petition against me even after I demanded to see it.\u201d\n\nLawyer of the victim, Dr Tunji Abayomi, told SaharaReporters that despite several petitions written to the police authorities over the issue, Nwawe and her team had not been punished for grossly violating the right of Adedire and taking $30,000 from him illegally.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have written to the Assistant Inspector-General of Police in charge of Alagbon and even to the IGP himself, nothing has been done on the matter till this moment.\n\n\u201cIt is sad that things like this can still happen in our country. It is really sad.\u201d\n\nApart from extorting $30,000 from Adedire for committing no offence, the police team led by DSP Nwawe, according to latest findings by SaharaReporters, also forcefully collected N7 million worth of Bitcoin from one Samson Ogunyemi on November 29, 2021 in Lagos after falsely labelling him an Internet fraudster.\n\nThe young man, who trades in cryptocurrency, was stopped at a traffic intersection around Lagos Island by the same team from Alagbon and moved to their office for no concrete reason.\n\nLike they do to all their victims, the policemen seized Ogunyemi\u2019s mobile phone before harassing and threatening him with imprisonment and death for reasons he was never told.\n\n\u201cThey stopped me at a traffic light and forced me to their station. Immediately we got there, they started taking my photos and did not allow me to say anything or call anyone on the phone.\n\n\u201cThey held me at gunpoint and forced me to sign a statement they had written that I was an Internet fraudster.\n\n\u201cThey later logged into my Bitcoin account and transferred the entire money inside it which I was using to trade to a wallet belonging to one of the policemen named Frank.\n\n\u201cThey moved the entire $12,000 from my Bitcoin wallet for committing no offence. They have crippled me financially. I committed no offence to deserve this type of wickedness from them,\u201d he said while speaking with our correspondent.\n\nFollowing SaharaReporters story on how DSP Nwawe and her team forcefully extorted N22 million worth of bitcoin from Peter and Dayo in July this year and the uproar that greeted that revelation, the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, on Monday ordered an immediate investigation into the professional misconduct and abuse of office of the police team at Alagbon led by DSP Nwawe.\n\nForce spokesperson, Frank Mba, in a statement said that a Special Investigation Panel led by DCP Olaolu Adegbite would carry out a discreet and transparent investigation into the allegation against the officers mentioned in the story by SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cDSP Cordelia and the other police personnel allegedly indicted in the report have been ordered to report to the Special Investigation Panel, Force Headquarters, Abuja, on Tuesday, 21st December, 2021 to answer to the allegations against them.\n\n\u201cThe Special Investigation Panel is headed by DCP Olaolu Adegbite of the Force Intelligence Bureau.

They have crippled me financially. I committed no offence to deserve this type of wickedness from them,\u201d he said while speaking with our correspondent.\n\nFollowing SaharaReporters story on how DSP Nwawe and her team forcefully extorted N22 million worth of bitcoin from Peter and Dayo in July this year and the uproar that greeted that revelation, the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, on Monday ordered an immediate investigation into the professional misconduct and abuse of office of the police team at Alagbon led by DSP Nwawe.\n\nForce spokesperson, Frank Mba, in a statement said that a Special Investigation Panel led by DCP Olaolu Adegbite would carry out a discreet and transparent investigation into the allegation against the officers mentioned in the story by SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cDSP Cordelia and the other police personnel allegedly indicted in the report have been ordered to report to the Special Investigation Panel, Force Headquarters, Abuja, on Tuesday, 21st December, 2021 to answer to the allegations against them.\n\n\u201cThe Special Investigation Panel is headed by DCP Olaolu Adegbite of the Force Intelligence Bureau. See Also Breaking News BREAKING: Inspector-General Orders Probe Into Police Extortion Of N22million Worth Of Bitcoin From Real Estate Agents After SaharaReporters\u2019 Story\n\n\u201cThe Force advices any member of the public who has had similar experiences of high-handedness or extortion by the officers in question, her team or any other officer at the FCID Alagbon to come forward with detailed information to enable the panel achieve a holistic investigation,\u201d Mba said in the statement.\n\nEarning a notorious reputation for corruption, highhandedness and extrajudicial killings, the police in Nigeria have committed more crimes in the society than they have solved over the years.\n\nConstantly harassing and extorting young citizens riding in sleek cars and dressing in fine clothes, policemen across the country have continued to violate rights with impunity despite public outcry over their nefarious activities.\n\nIn October 2020, the situation hit a climax when young Nigerians took to the streets to protest police harassment, extortion and brutality.\n\nThe demonstrations quickly gathered momentum, grabbing headlines across the globe in the weeks that followed.\n\nIn response, the police authorities scrapped the Special Anti-Robbery Squad and promised reforms in several areas.\n\nBut more than one year since that historic event, nothing has changed as rogue policemen continue to violate the rights of Nigerians \u2013 young and old.",
          "summary": "DSP Nwawe, who told her men to deal with the young man if he failed to cooperate, threatened to jail him and even get a promotion for doing so.\nImmediately DSP Nwawe and her rogue team received the $30,000, they did some paperwork and released Adedire to go.\n\u201cThey held me at gunpoint and forced me to sign a statement they had written that I was an Internet fraudster.\nIn October 2020, the situation hit a climax when young Nigerians took to the streets to protest police harassment, extortion and brutality.\nBut more than one year since that historic event, nothing has changed as rogue policemen continue to violate the rights of Nigerians \u2013 young and old.",

          "text": "Elon Musk once said, \"Some people don't like change but you need to embrace change if the alternative is disaster,\" and that is a path that the Nigerian has to commit himself to if we are going to see any success in the fight against terrorism. The Nigerian Military's tactics against the terrorist groups have been rigid while the opponents have embraced adaptability. One accepts that guerrilla warfare tactics are aided by the lack of a need to secure and control territory which is a constraint sometimes for conventional national armies but more needs to be done.\n\nNot only is Nigeria reeling from these attacks, but we're also losing our soldiers on the battlefield and to a style that has become a depressing pattern where locations get attacked and ambushes are set up to hit the reinforcements that get called in in response. This was how we lost Brigadier-General Dzarma Kennedy Zirkusu in Askira Uba, Borno, and others like Colonel Dahiru Bako and Lt-Col MZ Manu.\n\nThe acquisition and use of mine-resistant armoured protected vehicles (MRAPs) have helped protect Nigerian soldiers from roadside bombings and mine explosions but now the terrorists have resorted to attacking military bases to steal these vehicles. I expect that the Nigerian Army would have the equipment and aptitude required to foresee these attacks and work at nullifying them with intelligence obtained from aerial surveillance equipment that provides early warnings on enemy movements.\n\nThe death of Brigadier-General Zirkusu hurt and angered the military establishment and we can only hope that the 50 ISWAP fighters that were reported killed days later in the area were not random revenge killings as that would poison the hearts of the locals and make it harder to win this war.\n\nWith that being said, we return to the issue of adaptability and how important it is for Nigeria's military high command to reevaluate its basic battle playbook after over a decade of limited success in fighting this insurgency. One worries about the soldiers getting weary and while the news that the army had killed the new ISWAP leader, Mallam Banu, ISWAP's capacity to carry out operations seemed unharmed as they still launched attacks without missing a beat is still able to carry out attacks after the loss of two leaders in quick succession.\n\nTelecom services were shut down in some states in the hope that the communication difficulties would make it harder for the terrorists but they have resorted to the use of walkie-talkies and the attacks on some local government areas in Sokoto State have shown that these measures have failed to hinder the terrorists but have stopped the innocent members of the general public from being able to call for help from the authorities. It felt even worse when word got out that the attacks were a joint operation by erstwhile rival groups headed by kingpins, Halilu Sububu and Kachalla Turji, who seem to have chosen to unite their forces in a manner that has been felt in the deadly Goronyo market attack that had 60 casualties a month ago.\n\nIn early October, these terrorists moved to Sokoto state after suffering attacks from the Nigerian Army at their traditional hideouts in Zamfara. Their choice of location is said to be partly inspired by the need to be placed in the space between the Niger Republic and Zamfara to move for cover when attacks come from the Army of the Republic of Niger.\n\nThis is frustrating to see. A stubborn commitment to a conventional military approach to solving an asymmetric security challenge is unwise especially with an Army that is already stretched thin by involvement in roughly 30 Nigerian states. Abuja must restrategise. Localised policing and well-thought-out community engagement must be a key factor in the choices made for the future and the 900-km boundary that the Nigerian North West shares with the Niger Republic must be properly secured.\n\nNwanze is a partner at SBM Intelligence",

We asked them to show us papers, they refused to show us the paper,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that they obtained an order against the Lagos state government, the judgement which people believe is fake as no specific definition and no properties were mentioned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat the judgement said is that the Lagos state government should allocate 549 plots to them. As at today, no plot has been allocated. Until the plots are allocated to them, that is when they become property owners.\n\n\u201cAll the properties you see here, those who own the properties obtained allocations from the Lagos state government and they obtained certificates of occupancy to that effect. And those certificates are still valid; they have not been revoked.\n\n\u201cThat is what we are trying to put across. We want the world to see what we are facing because the government has not come to protect us.\n\n\u201cThankfully, they later came today \u2014 people from the governor. I think they are still around to ensure that the police that came from FCT through the IGP are out of the state. That is why the gates are open.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, Bajo Osinubi, chairman of MRA, said they decided to open the estate\u2019s gates owing to the promise made by Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of Lagos, that the state is \u201con top of the case\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe opened the gate about an hour ago because we had a promise from the governor of Lagos state, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, that he is on top of the case,\u201d Osinubi said.\n\n\u201cActually, he (referring to the governor) sent in the mayoress of Ikosi, Mrs Bada, to come and tell us that the policemen will be withdrawn and this siege that has become perennial will never happen again.\n\n\u201cSo, with that promise, we decided to open up the gates so that our people can move.\u201d",

          "title": "Inside TeamApt: How an upstart overturned competition to dominate agency banking",
          "text": "Six years after TeamApt, a little-known banking software development company, had launched, it stirred excitement after Bloomberg reported the startup\u2019s move to raise $150 million at a billion-dollar valuation\u2014which would elevate it to the coveted unicorn status. TeamApt\u2019s co-founders had bootstrapped the company from a four-man team in their flat in 1004 Estate to building products, MoneyTor and AptPay, which serviced virtually all the commercial banks in Nigeria. TeamApt followed the growth with a $5.5 million Series A round by 2019.\n\nHowever, it was Moniepoint, the product it launched next, that skyrocketed the company to near-unicorn status.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, Nigeria had 4.3 bank branches per 100,000 people in 2018, thereby leaving many of its 200 million population either unserved or underserved. Moniepoint provides payment, withdrawal, and deposit services to these underbanked users through an army of agents mostly in mom-and-pop stores across the country. In 2019, when OPay announced a total of $170 million in fundraising from two rounds and marched thousands of point-of-sale (POS) terminal-wielding footmen across the country to convert agents and successfully grow agency banking in the country, Moniepoint launched that September after a beta-testing phase, with about 1,000 agents.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have money then, so we were taking terminals from banks and manually sending them to agents, individually, in other parts of the country. That was so base and hectic,\u201d says Tolu Adetuyi, Moniepoint Head of Growth.\n\nAfter the $5.5 million raise, TeamApt had cash in the bank to place orders for terminals in China and invaded the Nigerian market. Now it processes over $4 billion monthly, servicing 18 million unique customers, and has over 120,000 active merchants in almost all of Nigeria\u2019s 774 local government areas (LGAs)\u2014only the terror-prone LGAs in the country\u2019s northern regions are left out. A regulator report seen by TechCabal back in June capturing transaction volumes by super agents showed TeamApt recorded an agent transaction volume of roughly 50 million, which accounted for 75% of total agent volumes collated for the month reported. Although, an industry analyst under anonymity told TechCabal that he doubts OPay\u2019s numbers were captured in the report.\n\nSo how did TeamApt become this super agent?\n\n\u201cBack then, our fee was only 1% of each transaction, which was high, but that was what we could afford, but we obsessed about our agents and offered them unmatched user experience,\u201d Adetuyi explained.\n\nTolu Adetuyi, as growth lead, along with 40 other support staff, oversee a massive network of agents engaged through Whatsapp groups dedicated to each LGA in Nigeria and a few other separate high-level Whatsapp groups of LGA agent leaders also called cluster managers, state managers, and regional managers. These performing agents-turned-managers are responsible for increasing and engaging the agents in their communities in order to increase their commission.\n\n\u201cMy phone is always buzzing, and I\u2019m attending town hall meetings. That\u2019s like, the whole of my work. I know what\u2019s happening on the streets right from my room,\u201d Adetuyi tells me excitedly via a Google Meet call.\n\nTeamApt\u2019s strong feedback loop facilitates rich market intelligence which enabled the company successively introduce groundbreaking features to the market which some competitors adopted and eventually became industry standards.\n\nMrs Ogunleye, an agent in the Alimosho local government area of Lagos, runs a grocery store and owns three POS terminals. \u201cI started using Moniepoint because of their daily commission settlement while others were paying monthly,\u201d she tells TechCabal.\n\nSources at TeamApt credit Moniepoint\u2019s early success and breakthrough growth to this payment feature. \u201cMany of these agents are like petty traders who need their daily earnings for restocking and running their households. I study my agents. I literally have documents on agent motivation,\u201d Adetuyi shares.\n\nMoniePoint also provides agents with live analytics dashboards to see a detailed breakdown of their performance and earnings. This transparency enables agent trust in the commission given and drives them to improve their performance as opposed to opaque estimated monthly earnings.\n\nTeamApt deploys an interesting active POS terminal performance management system for its merchants. For example, for every 10 terminals given, a certain number must be doing transaction values exceeding a fixed amount. The figure is determined by the area and market trend. This drives cluster managers to identify and recruit the best agents and engage them daily to improve their performance.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really want merchants who use our terminals only when they need to make quick money. We want active agents who use them daily. We try to prevent what they call bozo explosion, where we bring in lots of agents but are not able to service the 20% that\u2019s going to give you most of your revenue, then you end up losing them,\u201d Solomon Amadi, Vice President at TeamApt, tells TechCabal.\n\nTeamApt\u2019s agent network is a vibrant talent ecosystem that allows enterprising agents to grow through the rank. Merchant agents can become cluster managers at LG level, grow into state managers, and finally regional heads, while increasing their earnings along the way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a talent war. Competitors are calling and trying to poach our cluster managers, so much so that we know the name of some of the employees calling them because our cluster managers tell us. That\u2019s why we sign exclusive contracts with some of these managers,\u201d Amadi disclosed.\n\nThe talent grab, though, goes both ways. TeamApt also tries to convert performing agents on other platforms.\n\nTo improve the reliability of its product, TeamApt introduced to the market a 24-hour resolution service for false debit card withdrawals. Usually, it takes 8 days after physically visiting a bank branch to resolve an unsuccessful card withdrawal where the customer\u2019s account got debited. But TeamApt funds customers from its account once it can verify the transaction and later sorts out the reconciliation at the back end with the bank.\n\n\u201cThe solutions we introduced to the market seem commonplace but many of them weren\u2019t being done till we did. In Nigeria, we just like to copy and paste models without thinking to adapt them to our peculiarities. But, first principles thinking has really helped us in how we approach problems and come up with the solutions we have introduced,\u201d Adetuyi concludes.\n\n\u201cFirst principles thinking\u201d is a phrase I heard often while interviewing management executives at TeamApt. It\u2019s a problem-solving thought process of attacking problems by first identifying the fundamental issues. It was first taught by Aristotle and currently made popular by South African-born physics engineering genius, Elon Musk. Tosin Eniolorunda, founder and CEO of TeamApt, champions the thought process and is instilling it into the company culture.\n\n\u201cWhen we hit a roadblock while thinking up a solution, Felix (TeamApt CTO) would often say, okay, let\u2019s go back, let\u2019s go back,\u201d Eniolorunda tells me as he rolls his wrist backwards. He shares that his exposure to first principles philosophy came in stages. The first time was in his 100 level at Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) as a mechanical engineering student.\n\n\u201cI got into OAU on merit, first try. So, I was feeling fly with myself. But I now failed in my first year. My CGPA was 3.3,\u201d he shares in-between laughs. \u201cThat was a major learning experience for me. I learnt the power of focus. Secondly, it sparked a new way of thinking because adversity changes us. I questioned myself on why I want excellence and I began to think of how to get there.\u201d\n\nTosin, the first born of a building contractor father and primary teacher mother, worked and paid his way through tertiary school and graduated with a second class upper in mechanical engineering. He had always wanted to be an entrepreneur and build \u201csomething massive\u201d. With TeamApt seemingly to be crowned with unicorn status, the company now has its eyes on digital banking but with a slant. \u201cThere\u2019s a me too movement in tech. Everyone is launching digital banking with different offerings. But the fundamental question is, what do customers really need? Zero cost transaction accounts? That\u2019s good, but I think credit is one of the key needs. So, we will be launching a hybrid credit-led banking solution that also caters to the offline market,\u201d Eniolorunda concludes.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Want luxury fashion? Play Africa\u2019s first metaverse crypto game",
          "text": "The digital age has seen people try to imitate reality online. A result of this trend is that people are buying the online versions of what they would normally buy in real life: luxury houses, dresses, and even land. For example, this year saw the purchase of the world\u2019s first digital home, sold for over $500,000 on the NFT market. Instead of physical artworks, people now buy Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), digital assets whose ownerships are recorded on the blockchain.\n\nDigital fashion allows designers to model their designs in pixels instead of silk, cotton, lace, or polyester. Digital fashion can be in the form of digital fashion conceived to produce physical garments or fashion that a person can wear only with augmented or virtual reality. Or it can be fashion that is sold directly to an avatar.\n\nPowered by blockchain and NFTs, the digital fashion world is steadily growing. This growth is marked by the emergence of fashion houses like The Fabricant, which creates digital-only fashion; and RTFKT, a company that specialises in making digital sneakers that can be used and traded in virtual spaces as NFTs. In what represents a landmark moment in digital fashion, The Fabricant sold the world\u2019s first digital-only dress, \u201dIridescence\u201d, for $9,500 to a Canadian, Rachel Ma.\n\nThe Fabricant\u2019s \u2018Iridescence\u2019 | @the_fab_ric_ant\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic forced designers to rethink and seek a digital option to showcase their collections, leading to the creation of hyper-real digital showrooms around the world.\n\nA product of digital fashion, hyper-real fashion, is used to explain the use of tech to virtually showcase fashion products. By removing the need for humans to physically examine fashion products, hyper-real fashion tech continues to blur the lines of a prominent human physical experience: shopping.\n\nThis has also led to the development of Obsess, an experiential e-commerce platform, that uses 3D to create 360-degree virtual stores. Their portfolio includes brands such as Tommy Hilfiger, Dior, and Charlotte Tilbury. \u201cVirtual stores can be created completely digitally and don\u2019t have to exist in real life. Brands use this option to create super engaging experiences for their customers,\u201d says Neha Singh, Obsess\u2019s founder and CEO, in an interview with Vogue India earlier this year.\n\nPositioning for \u201cmeta fashion\u201d\n\nThe metaverse is the use of the combination of technology like virtual reality, augmented reality, and video to create a digital world. The metaverse, unlike the way we currently access the internet, is immersive.\n\nSome of the earliest collaborations between the metaverse and fashion industry can be seen in games. There is Burberry\u2019s first-of-its-kind NFT collection with Mythical Games\u2019 Blankos Block Party, Gucci\u2019s Garden Metaverse with Roblox and their Aria Collection Film at Christie\u2019s, and Louis Vuitton\u2019s \u201cLouis The Game\u201d NFT in celebration of the 200th anniversary of the French house\u2019s founding.\n\nWhile it is evident that the metaverse will enjoy massive investments from the fashion industry, the gaming industry is not left behind. Collaboration between the fashion and gaming industry in the metaverse presents a huge economic opportunity. Some notable collaborations in recent times include Balenciaga and Fortnite working together to design accessories and skins, Burberry partnering with Tencent to create exclusively designed skins for Honor of Kings characters.\n\nThe fashion industry is investing in the metaverse to create the branding of the future. While the metaverse is still new and building around it is still ongoing, its building blocks\u2014fashion avatars, digitally designed spaces, exotic pets in games\u2014are not entirely foreign.\n\nIn an attempt to tap into the trend of combining fashion and the digital world, Delz Erinle, a product and UX designer and Niyi Okeowo, an art director, started Thrill Digital, a company that started as a virtual fashion showcase and now pioneers a fashion metaverse. Thrill Digital uses a combination of Web3 technologies like XR (AR/VR), video, audio, crypto, and gaming to create its own fashion metaverse and other unreleased digital products.\n\nDuring the pandemic last year, Erinle saw how difficult it was to shop. So, he decided to bring in Lead Developer and Chief Technical Officer (CTO), Luke Jeffers, to use 3D to create a VR shopping product, to make shopping more accessible and effortless for an audience that was stuck at home.\n\nPivoting from creating the initial idea of a fashion show, Thrill started working on a VR shopping product. Thrill Digital pitched a lot of investors and won Epic Game\u2019s MegaGrant worth $40,000 in January this year to create the VR shopping product. They eventually delivered the product during Lone Design Club fashion week in February.\n\nAfter that, Erinle carried out research in a mall in London where he asked people if they would play a game to win luxury prizes. The feedback they got from people was affirmative. \u201cWe didn\u2019t set out to create a metaverse project initially. It was like a virtual shopping experience, first, \u201d Erinle said.\n\nThis was how Thrill Digital started Astra, a fashion crypto game where players can win real-life fashion luxury items. The game would have its own crypto token, which must be connected to a crypto wallet like the popular crypto game, Axie Infinity. The game will be open on December 20 and users can play to win a Balenciaga Small Hourglass Tote Bag. When players win a luxury item on Astra, it would be delivered to them wherever they are in the world.\n\nErinle, who doesn\u2019t believe a fully fleshed metaverse has been created yet, explained the metaverse as \u201ca collection of interoperable virtual worlds which people can experience using an avatar. The metaverse is a virtual 3D environment where people can interact but this time with phones; it is an immersive experience.\u201d\n\nLead 3D designer, Charles Egbejule, believes daring to dream they can build a mini metaverse out of Africa was one of the biggest challenges they had to face. While lead VR architect, Adekunbi Ajai, believes building remotely from different parts of the world also poses a challenge for the team. But they were able to adapt and can now easily communicate, she added.\n\nFor the team\u2019s brand designer and co-founder, Niyi Okeowo, one difficulty they faced was raising awareness on a new concept like digital fashion. \u201cWe were trying to sell the product while teaching people about it.\u201d\n\nThe audience that Astra is targeting is people who love fashion, people who use crypto, and people who love games\u2014or people who love all three.\n\nSo here is how the game works: players amass as many crypto tokens as they can within an allotted time, after which a leaderboard is created where winners will be declared and win luxury fashion.\n\nJeffers explained that NFTs would play a huge role in claiming ownership of clothing accessories and land in Astra.\n\nErinle explained that it chose to build its metaverse on the Solana blockchain because of its low gas fees and low energy consumption. Citing a report that says transactions on the Solana blockchain consume less energy than two Google searches, Astra believes it is contributing to the reduction of environmental sustainability issues.\n\nThe game will be available first on PC before VR headsets and, hopefully, mobile devices.\n\nTapping into the play-to-earn trend\n\nLike the play-to-earn crypto game, Axie Infinity, Astra will make money through protocol profits too. Revenue is generated via fees for interacting with a protocol\u2014a game\u2019s unique crypto token.\n\nAxie Infinity made huge profits using a similar approach this year. The leading crypto game has raked in $84.9 million in funds, making its protocol profit one of the biggest in the market. In the case of Axie Infinity, whenever a player sells one of the Axie creatures, he pays a 4.25% marketplace fee. He does this when he sells land or special items. Another way Axie makes money is through the fee of 4 AXS, the game\u2019s native token for \u201cbreeding\u201d more digital creatures called Axies.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Ventures Platform launches a $40m fund, invites Seni Sulyman as venture partner",
          "text": "As far back as 2005, Kola Aina knew he wanted to invest in companies. He even registered a company name after his MBA program\u2014one which he\u2019s too embarrassed to share and ended up not using. After a number of rejections, unreplied messages, and bootstrapping his first business, Kola Aina launched Ventures Platform, an early-stage pan-African VC firm, in 2016.\n\nToday, Ventures Platform, announced a $40m fund for African tech startups. The new fund which has reached the first close is being led by the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA).\n\nThe fund features participation from experienced investors and some new leading names in Africa\u2019s technology and corporate ecosystem,, including UAC Nigeria, VFD Group, Gbenga Oyebode, Paystack CEO Shola Akinlade, as well as global investors like Y Combinator CEO Michael Seibel, and Adam Draper. A sizable portion of the fund comes from local partners, Ventures Platform told TechCabal.\n\nSince its launch in 2016, Ventures Platform has backed almost 70 startups including Seamless HR, PiggyVest, Mono, and Paystack\u2014which Stripe acquired in October 2020 for over $200m.\n\nThis new fund will allow Ventures Platform to significantly deepen its long-standing presence in Nigeria and West Africa while also investing in select companies in East, North and Francophone Africa that are able to expand across the continent.\n\n\u201cPrior to this fund, we could only write one cheque, then introduce the entrepreneur to our network of investors for a follow-on round. Now we\u2019re not only able to write their first cheque but also write follow-on rounds for our companies,\u201d Kola Aina, founder and General Partner at Ventures Platform, told TechCabal.\n\nThis new capital injection will enable Ventures Platform to double down on existing investments in its category-leading portfolio via subsequent rounds. Aina believes that being able to double down on existing investments means they can assure startups that they have a long-term capital partner. It also helps Ventures Platform defend their ownership stake in the companies, as they can participate in the upside they helped build, which is important from a returns perspective.\n\nAs part of a move to further deepen its expertise, Ventures Platform has also onboarded leading figures across African tech as Venture Partners, including Seni Sulyman (ex-VP at Andela, founder at Black Ops.)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very bullish about the market; it\u2019s about the entrepreneur first. Across our portfolio, we now have two companies whose entrepreneurs we\u2019ve funded twice. We funded their first project, it didn\u2019t work; we\u2019ve funded them again,\u201d Aina said.\n\nAina has a heart for entrepreneurs as he\u2019d been one before becoming an investor.\n\nFascinated by the power of capital\n\n\u201cI was just always fascinated by the power of capital. I always wanted to end up being an investor, even when it wasn\u2019t popular.\u201d\n\nWhat attracted Aina to investing? It was the notion of giving people money and seeing them build something meaningful with it.\n\nIn 2009, Aina moved back from the US to Nigeria and co-founded Emerging Platforms, a software company. Initially, they had some customers willing to pay, but the business needed funding. They tried to raise funds but faced rejection at every corner.\n\n\u201cWe wrote a letter to every bank in Nigeria, got introductions but everyone said no. So, we went back to the drawing board and bootstrapped the business.\u201d\n\nThe harrowing experience of fundraising stayed with Aina and ignited the desire to change how people got access to capital in Africa.\n\nMaking new mistakes\n\nFortunately, the bootstrapped business thrived and Aina started angel investing in 2014. Two years later, he had an epiphany that waiting for the government and donors to solve society\u2019s problems was pointless. A better alternative was to find and fund young people using technology to solve these problems.\n\nInspired by Silicon Valley-esque accelerators, Ventures Platform was born in 2016. The initial approach was to get the best entrepreneurs from across Africa to fly into a campus in Abuja for a 16-week acceleration program. They were paired with investors, team members, capital, and mentors.\n\n\u201cObviously everyone told us acceleration is too difficult to do in Africa, but we told them we\u2019ll make new mistakes.\u201d\n\nWhile making new mistakes, they also got a few things right. One of the things Ventures Platform did then that was pioneering and different was that it was fully transparent with its terms of investing in startups. It offered $20,000 for 10% equity.\n\n\u201cAt that time it was one of the fairer deals out there,\u201d Aina said.\n\nThis transparency helped ventures attract talents like Kayode Oyewole, partner at Ventures Platform and Fola Olatunji-David, who later left the firm to become Head of Startup Success and Service at Google. Aina also believes that sharing the firm\u2019s manifesto helped move the market forward in setting the terms of evaluation for pre-seed companies in Africa.\n\nAlongside the accelerator, Aina continued investing and got to invest in startups like Paystack, Kudi, Kangbe (now Reliance HMO), Printivo and Tizeti.\n\nAfter the first year, Aina and his team saw that the accelerator wasn\u2019t ideal for the continent, so they pivoted to an early-stage fund model.\n\n\u201cWith people living together on campus, you\u2019re not just investing and helping people scale their businesses, you\u2019re also dealing with personalities. It was almost like the Big Brother House but for investing.\u201d\n\nNotably, the initial capital used to run the accelerator and invest in startups was Aina\u2019s personal funds. He had to have a conversation with his wife telling her that he needed to raid their savings to support startups.\n\n\u201cWe did over a million dollars in investments in the early days. But, in retrospect, that was a smart decision because it helped us show a track record.\u201c\n\nBy late 2017, Ventures Platform started raising external capital: syndicate funds. This happened because people who were impressed with the performance of the firm\u2019s portfolio companies wanted to invest in Ventures Platform.\n\nThe syndicate style investments continued until mid last year when Aina felt it was time for Ventures Platform to start working on raising its first institutional fund.\n\nWhy did he wait this long to raise an institutional fund?\n\n\u201cI wanted to see evidence that there\u2019s liquidity in this market before I raised an institutional fund. Startups are not just about inspiration or motivational talk. It\u2019s real business. Startup founders sometimes forget that I have to return money to my investors.\u201d\n\nWhy $40m matters\n\n2021 has been a record year for African startups as they\u2019ve raised over $4 billion so far. It\u2019s easy to see $40m, in an era where $100m raises are the new normal and wonder \u201cWhat difference does $40m make?\u201d\n\nAina believes that while the increase in capital inflow is important, the venture capital space needs to be seen as a continuum. For him, Venture Platforms\u2019 role is to find companies early and support them along the way as they gain product-market fit and look to scale.\n\n\u201cThere was a period when a company raising $500,000 was huge. Five years ago, you could count the number of local funds in the market. I think it\u2019s day one for this fund. We must not get ahead of ourselves. We want to stay disciplined. We\u2019re very clear about our thesis and are staying grounded to it.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe year is 2016. Idris Marcial Monthe has just graduated from the Abidjan Founders Institute. An amazing three months of learning from the best and Monthe was feeling quite confident.\n\nHe and Daniel Dindji had just launched their payment gateway, CinetPay in the same year with little to no experience in the financial sector. The duo had met each other while studying Computer Science at the New Superior School of Engineering and Technology (ENSIT), Abidjan, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\n\nThis is not their first rodeo, though. In 2009, Monthe and Dindji created CinetCore, a platform specialising in the sale of domain names. But they soon encountered a problem \u2014 payments.\n\n\u201cIn our region, you have 80% of people with a mobile money account, while the remaining 10 to 20% have a bank account and a card to pay online,\u201d Monthe tells Techpoint Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey tried to open several PayPal accounts to get their payments but they were blocked because Cote d\u2019Ivoire \u2014 like many African countries \u2014 has limited usability on PayPal and is unofficially said to be on a blacklist.\n\n\u201cWe saw that we have a good opportunity with mobile money because many people have mobile money accounts. But, the problem with mobile money is that, all the 80% are spread between three or five operators and it\u2019s not easy for a merchant to open four accounts, integrate four APIs, manage four reconciliation, and deal with four partners, just for collection of payments.\u201d\n\nSo, they decided to build a gateway for their website, connecting all of these mobile money operators in one place. But soon, clients were asking, \u201cHow can we recreate this for ourselves?\u201d And CinetPay was born.\n\nThe journey to getting funded\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCinetPay Founders. Source: Supplied\n\nIn December 2021, CinetPay announced a $2.4 million seed round led by 4DX Ventures and African payment gateway unicorn, Flutterwave.\n\nCinetPay has been Flutterwave\u2019s Francophone Africa partner since 2019.\n\n\u201cI think Flutterwave was looking for a strong partner in Francophone Africa to explore the market, check if we have the capacity to help them in our region and that is how the partnership started. Flutterwave had a customer in Cameroon and wanted to serve this customer with a mobile money solution and when they looked in Cameroon, they saw that their best partner would be CinetPay.\u201d\n\nFor Monthe, it has been a very good partnership, helping both companies share information and experience.\n\nWhen Techpoint Africa asks Monthe if bootstrapping was a deliberate choice, he says, \u201cIt is not our choice. We are in a region where fundraising is very low, and many investors don\u2019t have information about our region, our market, our environment. If we had a choice, we would have raised money since 2017.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCompared to Africa\u2019s big four \u2014 South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria, and Egypt \u2014 funding in Francophone Africa is quite low. However, this year has been a good year for the region, with several startups raising some impressive rounds and a unicorn emerging.\n\nMonthe believes that this is good news for them as more investors get interested in Francophone Africa.\n\nA little bit more detail about CinetPay\n\nCinetPay helps merchants in the Francophone Africa region accept and collect online payments from mobile money wallets in nine countries.\n\n\u201cJust to give you an example, if you are an eCommerce website and you want to launch your website in nine countries in Francophone Africa, you need to create 9 companies, you need to sign 36 contracts with each operator present in our region, you need to integrate 36 APIs, and you need to deal with 36 services for reconciliation, which is not very easy.\u201d\n\nWhat CinetPay does is aggregate all these means of payments in one gateway \u2014 a Flutterwave or Paystack, but for mobile money wallets.\n\nThe company is present in Cameroon, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, Togo, Guinea, and Benin.\n\nMonthe believes CinetPay\u2019s geographical presence among other things has helped the company stand out.\n\n\u201cWe are present in more countries than our competitors in Francophone Africa. We also have a large number of methods of payment \u2014130 \u2014 on our website. Our payment page is very simple and seamless; you have just one or two steps to processing payments.\n\n\u201cAnother thing is that we have the capacity to help big companies or institutions and public services. And we help these services to build a great solution. We don\u2019t just provide payment services, but we help our partners to digitise their services.\u201d\n\nWith over 350 merchants on the platform, CinetPay serves public services, schools, banks, financial institutions, eCommerce websites among others.\n\nThe company charges a commission on each transaction, with all merchants paying a $20 subscription fee annually.\n\nChallenges, conquests, and plans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdris Marcial Monthe, CEO CinetPay. Source: Supplied\n\nWhen Dindji and Monthe first started, with no idea of how a payment infrastructure works, they began to attend a lot of incubators and accelerators, searching for helpful knowledge.\n\nAfter getting into the Abidjan Founder Institute, they also got into Seedstars. They\u2019ve also made it into several government and private incubators. A chance he believes has helped them grow CinetPay.\n\nInterestingly, Monthe didn\u2019t see their lack of experience as a challenge. It became a passion for him.\n\n\u201cI am very passionate about innovation, So I don\u2019t care about learning anything innovation, I like it. I don\u2019t see it as a challenge, but a passion. My goal is to impact the lives of many people in Francophone Africa.\u201d\n\nThe trick was practicing everyday what he had learnt at all the incubators and accelerators.\n\nIntriguingly, Monthe wants to create a non-profit organisation to help females gain access to education.\n\nAccording to the Francophone Africa and the Equality Challenge 2019 Report by the University of Chester Area Studies Research Group, female literacy rates in Francophone Africa have not been growing consistently, with outdated datasets being used for policy making and decision making.\n\n\u201cI think that the world will be better if many women are educated. The capacity of women to do many things like earn profit, to work hard is very high compared totge capacity of the men. This is my passion and my challenge and in the next five, ten years, this is something that I will launch.\u201d\n\nHe also jokes about being a farmer if he hadn\u2019t started CinetPay.\n\nThere\u2019s also the problem of trust. To solve this, Monthe says the team has had to adopt a transparency in communication and collaboration. Of course, when dealing with people\u2019s money, this is important.\n\n\u201cWe give the best product because if you cause losses, you lose trust. We work hard to give the merchants the best experience of payment in West Africa. 99% of transactions are in cash; you need to build trust to combat cash.\u201d\n\nWith the challenge of building and retaining talent, Monthe reveals an interesting strategy.\n\n\u201cWe signed a partnership with a high school to help us to recruit the best people, one year before the end of their degree.\u201d\n\nEssentially, building a pipeline of talent at an early stage.\n\nThe plan for now, though, is to focus on consolidating their hold in Francophone Africa. CinetPay is working on a regulatory sandbox with the Ministry of Finance. Building bridges and important connections as they grow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

Today, we\u2019ll take a trip down memory lane through some of the news trends we observed on Techpoint Digest in 2021.\n\nBut first, let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s happening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusic\u2019s next frontier\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowing up, music came in cassettes or rolling discs, and I, sometimes, marvel at how much has changed since then. I mean, you either buy Daddy Showkey\u2019s I in a store, or you wait for NTA to play. I\u2019m probably not old enough to think of anything else, but you get my drift.\n\nToday all you need, if you want to be legitimate, that is, is a decent Internet connection and either Deezer, Spotify, Audiomack, or YouTube music, and you can get your favourite songs at the click of a button or two.\n\nTechnology has changed the game in every industry, and entertainment has been a huge recipient. But what does the future hold? Our reporter, Bolu, had a chat with executives from Spotify and Audiomack to paint a pretty picture.\n\nHave fun: Blockchain-powered music and bigger investments: The next frontier for music tech.\n\nMAX raises $31 million for its electric vehicle subscription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: MAX.ng Twitter\n\nNigerian mobility startup, Metro Africa Xpress (MAX) has closed a $31 million Series B funding round. Interestingly, this is the first of other closes in this round that should be expected in the coming weeks.\n\nThis round was led by global private equity platform, Lightrock and UAE-based VC firm, Global Ventures. Other backers include Kenyan VC, Novastar Ventures, Japanese multinational, Yamaha \u2014 these two participated in a $7million round MAX closed in June 2019 \u2014 TMT Investments, and Proparco.\n\nThe fund would be deployed towards expansion into Egypt and Ghana in Q1 2022 and later into Francophone, Eastern, and Southern Africa to compete with the likes of Gozem. It will also go into the deployment of electric vehicles (EVs) and charging infrastructure, and the provision of credit and financial products to drivers, specifically those that utilise their vehicles for commercial purposes.\n\nApparently, MAX\u2019s business model has evolved since it launched in 2015. From logistics to bike-hailing and now to offering vehicle subscriptions and other packages that help drivers to maximise revenue and minimise costs.\n\nThis is MAX\u2019s largest VC-funded round to date. $8.2 million raised in four major funding rounds \u2014 through venture funding, angel investments, bank loans, and debt financing \u2014 and a previous raise of over $40 million of institutional debt for driver financing. The startup also moved into Nigeria\u2019s capital market after completing the issuance of a \u20a6400 million ($1 million) bond in September 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore context: Nigerian mobility-tech startup MAX bags $31 million in Series B round, set to expand across Africa, build EV infrastructure\n\nInternational calls get a new look\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you live outside Nigeria, it\u2019s important to note that the country\u2019s telecom regulator is finally regulating the cost of making a call to a loved one back home.\n\nAccording to the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), from January 2022, the standard international termination rate (ITR) for calls will be pegged at a minimum rate of $0.045.\n\nWhat am I talking about? Whenever you make a call from outside the country, your telecom operators pay Nigerian telecom operators a certain amount to complete the call successfully. Before now, the NCC fixed the amount at \u20a624.\n\nSo what happened? Since the fee was in naira, the NCC is saying that the telcos have been losing money due to the devaluation of the naira. Consequently, it believes getting the fees in dollars will help the telcos make more revenue, even if the naira falls again.\n\nThe big picture: Even the NCC is betting that the naira would keep falling, but what can we do? When you convert the new fee, it\u2019s just \u20a618.4 now, but who knows what it would grow to tomorrow?\n\nTrends we observed\n\nEgyptian startup funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI can guess that at some point this year, people in the African startup scene had exclaimed, \u201cthese Egyptian startups are on fire!\u201d It felt like it was time to take lessons from them. The largest raise from an Egyptian company was $120m, and over $400m was raised this year, more than half of what the country had seen since 2015.\n\nTrue, Egypt is part of Africa\u2019s big four in terms of startup market size and funding, but the gap is quickly closing between Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa. MaxAB\u2019s $55m Series A, MNT-Halan\u2019s $120m, Paymob\u2019s $18m Series A, and Trella\u2019s $42 million Series A made the highlights.\n\nGenerally, it\u2019s a good year for Africa\u2019s startup funding scene. Several Nigerian startups hit unicorn status, and Francophone Africa got its first unicorn. 2022 seems like the year to expect more exciting rounds\n\nRegulatory somersaults\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Ewan Kennedy on Unsplash\n\nOf course, you should have guessed we wouldn\u2019t miss this. Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem was fraught with regulatory somersaults, which we have gotten used to for quite a while.\n\nThe crypto ban\n\nFirst, we were hit with the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s ban on cryptocurrency transactions. Though crypto is not illegal in the country and the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was planning progressive regulations for the space, that didn\u2019t matter at all.\n\nThe CBN\u2019s circular basically sent crypto users underground \u2014 peer to peer (P2P). The opportunity to regulate a decentralised space got swept away, creating difficulties for well-meaning users and breathing room for bad eggs. But nothing is scarier than \u201cmoney made out of thin air\u201d, right?\n\neNaira launch: CBN highlights relief funds, cross-border payments, and unknown risks.\n\nTwitter ban\n\nIf the ban on crypto platforms had no constitutional grounds, then the Nigerian government\u2019s ban on Twitter was a clear violation. But we had to roll with it because Twitter was apparently a \u201cthreat to national security\u201d. The perfect excuse for African governments looking to censor free speech.\n\nIt\u2019s been four months since Nigeria\u2019s information minister said the ban would be lifted in a matter of days. I guess he wouldn\u2019t be lying if it takes six months.\n\nStartups want to digitise SME operations\n\nQuite a handful of African startups came up with decent plans to digitise Africa\u2019s informal sector. TradeDepot, Marketforce, Doroki, Capiter, Sabi, Alerzo, OmniBiz, Sokowatch, BIZ301, and several others are working on digitising different segments of SME activities that have been largely offline.\n\nThis would definitely be a space to watch in 2022,\n\nFintech unicorns\n\nThan previous years, Africa recorded more unicorns in 2021. For context, these are tech companies valued above $1 billion. The continent now has six unicorns, and more than half of them are Nigerian and fintech startups.\n\nInterswitch is older in the record. Meanwhile, this year, Flutterwave, OPay, Wave, Chipper Cash, and Andela joined the list.\n\nThe bigger picture: We\u2019ll leave this open-ended. Why not bare your thoughts in the comment section? The most interesting responses might just make it to Techpoint Digest on January 3rd.\n\nWhat we are reading\n\nChristmas is in four days. Not to be a Grinch, but it doesn\u2019t feel like it this year.\n\nMeet the 15 semi-finalists for Pitchstorm 3.0.

Music, for example, has gone from stringed cassette tapes that\u2019ll go on to become a child\u2019s plaything (if you\u2019re me) to being globally available with a simple tap.\n\nOne of the most profound effects technology has had on music is blurring the geographical boundaries that set sounds from different cultures apart, making music truly universal.\n\nIt\u2019s no doubt technology has aided major paradigm shifts in every industry, rendering applauded methods of doing things obsolete and establishing another method as the status quo. But at the point where music is now, it\u2019s hard to think of innovations that will disrupt the current model of music creation, distribution, and consumption.\n\nBut after a closer look and talking to some of the industry\u2019s brightest, the signs are there \u2014 the next frontier for music tech may be closer than we imagine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDisclaimer: We can\u2019t predict the future. All opinions in this article are educated guesses and might not happen.\n\nMusic is in a very exciting place right now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Marcela Laskoski on Unsplash\n\nWhile Victor Okpala, who recently became Spotify\u2019s Artist & Label Partnerships Manager, West Africa, sees amazing things coming to African music tech, he\u2019s still pretty excited about where things are right now. Okpala is also the Founder of Nabsolute Media, a communication and marketing agency.\n\nIn a chat with Techpoint Africa, he started with the subject of monetisation and said artistes can now truly live off their music.\n\n\u201cFor example, we know how bootlegging used to work. A huge percentage of the people that consume music in Nigeria downloaded them from free websites. It was something illegal that somehow got normalised. But we are moving to a place where people see the value in music enough to pay for it.\n\n\u201cApart from the traditional streams of income which were live shows and endorsements, the music itself is able to bring in revenue as a product.\u201d\n\nBootlegging or piracy is the illegal manufacture, distribution or sale of goods. It has been a thorn in the flesh of Nigerian artistes for years. The amount lost to piracy runs into millions of dollars every year.\n\nAdeyemi Adetunji, a lawyer who is also Audiomack\u2019s Manager of Operations and Commercial Partnerships, is just as excited about African music.\n\nAccording to him, he knew afrobeats would become a thing when he was a DJ, playing the songs to an international audience back in the day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI would play them Wande Coal, P-Square, and D\u2019banj songs all the way back in 2011, and I just felt like the music was resonating with people, so I knew there was something there.\u201d\n\nAdetunji is particularly pleased that Nigerian musicians were maximising the opportunities technology presented. From building a strong following to connecting with fans on a deeper level.\n\nInternational collaborations and more international award nominations are also exciting phenomena in music right now. Adetunji beams with excitement as he recounts how the international collaborations that only started trickling in in 2010, are becoming the norm today.\n\n\u201cAll the new school kids are doing that a lot now, the Fireboys, the Remas and Omahlays. They\u2019re really big on that.\u201d\n\nLooking to the future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Okpala, the next frontier for music is that it will be viewed more as a product. He said it\u2019s currently seen solely as a form of art that doesn\u2019t drive enough investment in the industry. Ultimately, he believes the music industry is worthy of the same attention investors pay to fintech or healthtech, for example.\n\nA study by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) published on November 17, 2020, revealed that music supports two million jobs and contributes \u20ac81.9 billion ($91.69 billion) to the European economy annually.\n\nIn the US, music contributes even more to the economy. According to a 2021 study by the Recording Industry Association of America, music contributes $170 billion to the US GDP annually and supports 2.5 million jobs.\n\nThis is possible due to robust investments in the industry. In the US, record companies invested more than $4.5 billion in the industry in 2015.\n\nWhile Nigeria cannot boast such levels of investment, the state of the music industry signals that more investments could have a positive impact on the economy. Per Statista, motion picture and music recording made up $1.8 billion out of Nigeria\u2019s GDP.\n\nIn terms of revenue, the music industry raked in $40 million in 2021. This number is projected to reach $44 million in 2022. Interestingly, there are now data points that can be used to predict investment in music. As Okpala points out, this will aid more investments as there is enough data for investors to bet on.\n\n\u201cAs an investor, if you\u2019re about to invest in an artiste that has, say, 10,000 monthly listeners and 1 million monthly streams on Spotify, you can calculate his monthly revenue to be $5,000. So, if you decide to invest $5,000 towards branding, marketing, and extending reach with the goal of multiplying your audience, you can predict what the revenue could look like.\u201d\n\nHe adds that gone are the days when investors had to bet on just talent as it is never enough.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of things that come into play when it comes to the success of an artiste, which could be the name, the branding, the story, and the content, of course.\u201d\n\nMusic, blockchain, and the metaverse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<span>Photo by <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/@zarakvg?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Zarak Khan</a> on <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/s/photos/music-streaming?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Unsplash</a></span>\n\nWhile Adetunji believes no one knows tomorrow and doesn\u2019t like to make bold statements about the future, he indicates that the advent of Web3 and blockchain might have a strong role to play in the future of music.\n\nWe\u2019re already seeing blockchain innovations like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) disrupting the music space.\n\nWhile Okpala agrees that these technologies will play a big part in music, he believes that the future is still very far away. Streaming, on the other hand, isn\u2019t going anywhere soon but will only get better.\n\nNot only is it the current frontier, it\u2019ll most likely still be the next frontier. The convenience streaming brings to music is probably why it\u2019s playing a big role in music growth now.\n\nGlobal streaming revenues have grown by 42% since 2015, surpassing the entire recording industry, which has only grown by 9% in the same amount of time.\n\nAdetunji and Okpala are optimistic about the future of African and Nigerian music, one where tech will definitely determine what the next frontier will be.\n\nWith such interesting predictions, I can\u2019t wait to see more experts from the music scene share their thoughts at Techpoint Build 2021.\n\nYou can also be a part of Techpoint Build 2021, the biggest tech event in West Africa, by registering here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "text": "The expected combination of Flour Mills Nigeria (FMN) and the flour mills unit of Honeywell Flour Mills plc (HFMP) will form a formidable entity and an unassailable market leader in the agro-allied sector in Nigeria, according to industry players and market analysts.\n\nLast month, Flour Mills announced it had reached a deal to acquire the flour mills business of Honeywell in an N80 billion deal that will significantly enhance its market leadership.\n\nFMN is believed to hold about 40 percent of the flour business in Nigeria and its leadership in the sector will become even more secure following the combination with Honeywell Flour, which has a production capacity of 835,000 metric tons of food per annum.\n\nBusinessDay learns that the deal has been helped by several factors including the fact that the combination is seen as a \u201cstrategic fit\u201d and also the leaders of the two businesses including their chairmen have known themselves for a very long time. They have mutual respect for each other.\n\nIn full year ended March 2021, the turnover for the two was N771.6 billion for Flour Mills and N109.59 billion for Honeywell Flour, and the combination will see FMN emerge as a true continental giant, amassing substantial value for shareholders and huge economic benefit for Nigeria.\n\nRead Also: Honeywell, Flour Mills N80bn merger to boost Nigeria\u2019s food production\n\nFMN, established in 1960, prides itself of being in the vanguard of feeding the nation for the past 60 years.

          "title": "The many legal battles of Ecobank and Honeywell",
          "text": "The lawyers for both Ecobank and Honeywell Group are pushing several cases against each other in connection with the dispute over the settlement of claims of N5 billion by the bank against Honeywell as well as an unrelated matter of the sale of shares held originally in what is today\u2019s Airtel Nigeria plc.\n\nOn July 23, 2013, Honeywell wrote to Ecobank accepting the terms for the resolution of the claim by the bank agreed at the meeting held the day earlier and saying, \u201cwe confirm our agreement to pay the sum of N3.5billion as full and final settlement of our indebtedness to your bank. As part of the verbal agreement reached at the meeting, we shall immediately pay the sum of N500million towards the facilities. We propose that the balance of N3 billion be paid in three equal half yearly payments.\u201d\n\nThat same day, Ecobank sent back a response in which the bank said, \u201cplease note that the agreement was for a full and final payment of N3.5 billion to be part paid immediately by \u2013 N500 million on Monday, July 22, 2013, and the balance to be paid immediately thereafter before the CBN examiners leave the bank.\u201d\n\nThe timing of the payment became a big issue and this saw both parties moving their wranglings to the court on October 16, 2015, via a suit by Ecobank before Justice Tsoho seeking to wind up Honeywell.\n\nRead Also: Ecobank warns FMN against Honeywell acquisition deal\n\nHowever, both parties began to get public attention for their dispute after Ecobank secured an ex-parte motion to restrain Honeywell and Oba Otudeko from operating their accounts in all banks and financial institutions and an order directing their respective banks to furnish Ecobank with details of their accounts in the banks.\n\nThis same bank-customer dispute was submitted to the subcommittee of ethics and professionalism of the Bankers\u2019 Committee for adjudication and ruling was issued in favour of Honeywell, but Ecobank in a letter dated November 14, 2014, maintained that \u201cduring a recent CBN/NDIC review of the bank, the accounts were flagged and that the CBN had insisted that the amount outstanding be paid without further delay.\u201d\n\nOn August 6, 2015, Honeywell filed a suit before Justice M. B. Idris in which it sought an interim injunction to restrain Ecobank from making any representation suggesting that it owed the bank and on August 10, 2015, the interim injunction was granted and both parties ordered by the court to maintain status quo.\n\nFollowing this, Ecobank filed a preliminary objection on the basis that the Federal High court lacked jurisdiction to hear the dispute and on December 11, 2015, the court presided by Justice Idris held that the Federal High court had jurisdiction to hear the matter. Ecobank immediately appealed this decision.\n\nOn October 16, 2015, Ecobank filed two separate suits before Justice Abang. On this same day, Ecobank filed another two petitions before Justice Yunusa who on December 4, 2015, varied the ex-parte orders by granting Honeywell Flour Mills restricted access to its banks accounts allowing the company to take no more than N15 million weekly.\n\nWorried by the orders of Justice Yunusa, Honeywell petitioned the National Judicial Council alleging judicial misconduct arising from what the company called, \u201cthe unfair and unlawful exercise of his discretion.\u201d\n\nAfter this petition to the NJC, Ecobank\u2019s lawyer wrote to Honeywell demanding a copy of the petition. This got Honeywell thinking that something was amiss.\n\nSensing that Ecobank\u2019s lawyers might be attempting to use the administration of justice to blackmail Honeywell into submission, on April 7, 2016, Honeywell petitioned the Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Committee also known as the Body of Benchers.\n\nIn the petition, the company said, \u201cin view of the critical role of the judiciary in preserving the sanctity of the law and in light of the facts set out above, we respectfully urge you to conduct an investigation into Mr Kunle Ogunba\u2019s conduct with respect to this dispute and to take such disciplinary actions as are necessary in line with Section 11 of the Legal Practitioners Act CCAP L11. LFN 2004) to ensure that the integrity of the legal profession is preserved.\u201d\n\nAt an emergency meeting held on September 15, 2017, the Legal Practitioners Privileges Committee adjudicated on the matter and in a statement dated 11/1/2018 and signed by Hadizatu Mustapha, Chief Registrar of the Supreme Court, the committee said as follows, \u201cHoneywell Group petitioned Kunle Ogunba SAN alleging professional misconduct against him. The misconduct alleged consists of the institution of multiplicity of proceedings before different judges of the Federal High Court on the same subject with the deliberate aim of abusing the process of court and derailing the course of justice. This is to further notify the general public that after a thorough investigation of the petition by the sub-committee set up by the Legal Practitioners\u2019 Privileges Committee (at which the respondent was given a fair hearing) it was decided that the petition is meritorious.\u201d\n\nConsequently, the Legal Practitioners\u2019 Privileges Committee at its 129th plenary meeting sanctioned the senior lawyer, withdrawing a set of privileges from him forthwith.\n\nHoneywell is also in court pressing damages claim against Ecobank for harm to its interests arising from the ex-parte order granted against it and which has now been made voided by courts including the Supreme Court.\n\nOn July 13, 2018, justices of the Supreme Court made two rulings, both in favour of Honeywell.\n\nIn one, suit number SC.401/2016, which was an appeal by Honeywell against the ruling of a lower court in favour of Ecobank, the justices in the ruling read by Amiru Sanusi upheld the appeal.\n\nIn another ruling delivered by John Inyang Okoro, the Supreme Court justices reviewed an appeal brought before them by Ecobank in relation to the judgment of the Court of Appeal delivered on March 30, 2016, said inter alia, \u201chaving resolved all five issues against the appellant (Ecobank) , I hold that this appeal lacks merit and is hereby dismissed. I affirm the decision of the court of appeal delivered on 30th March, 2016.\u201d\n\nIn doing so, the Supreme Court justice said, \u201cHonestly, I have tried to understand the complaint of the appellant in this issue but it appears to be the more you look, the less you see.\u201d\n\nIn an unrelated matter, Honeywell and Ecobank are also in court over the sale of Airtel shares by Ecobank to Bharti Airtel for $28 million. Honeywell claims that as at the time the shares were sold to Delta State government, which then sold to Oceanic Bank (acquired by Ecobank), there was a subsisting shareholder agreement that stipulated that existing shareholders were to be given rights of first refusal.\n\nHoneywell is now asking that the court compel Ecobank to deposit the $28 million proceeds from the share sale into the accounts of the court until the determination of the substantive suit brought by Honeywell.",

Today is an opportunity for Nigerians to have further faith in our vaccination programme.\n\n\u201cWe worked with our sister agency, the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), who took that decision to destroy these vaccines at the point that they got expired.\n\n\u201cThe work that we do is the work that requires trust. It is a sacred trust that has been bestowed on us by the generalizing generality of Nigerians and hold that trust to be true,\u201d he added.\n\nHe noted that the heroes of today\u2019s activity were actually the frontline health workers.\n\n\u201cA few months ago, when these vaccines were offered to us, we knew that they had a short shelf life. But we were living in an environment where the supply of COVID-19 vaccines were very scarce.\n\n\u201cThey were not available due to vaccine nationalism. Some developed countries that procured these vaccines, hoarded them in their stores,\u201d he said.\n\nHe commended members of staff of the NPHCDA who worked Saturdays or Sundays on very extreme situations to make sure that Nigerians have access to vaccines.\n\n\u201cWe were able to vaccinate over 10 million Nigerians.\n\n\u201cSo my heart and my pride goes out to those frontline health workers that continue to work around the clock.\n\n\u201cWe still have short shelf life vaccines in the country. They are still potent.\n\n\u201cThey have not reached the end of use dates and the health workers are still going around every communities and settlement to ensure Nigerians are vaccinated.\n\n\u201cThis decision has saved Nigeria over 40 million dollars,\u201d he added.\n\nAlso speaking, the Director-General of NAFDAC, Dr. Mojisola Adeyeye, noted that Nigeria was the only country with a unique immunization programme.\n\n\u201cNigeria has one of the best vaccination immunization program in the world. UNICEF mentioned this last year. But we started this journey months before the vaccines came.\n\n\u201cIn terms of what we are witnessing today. It is a continuous unfolding of the fact that the best is for all Nigerians, because Nigerians deserve the best in terms of quality of medicines, vaccines,\u201d she said.\n\nAdeyeye added that this was the basis of the endless meetings between NPHCDA and NAFDAC. Noting that when NAFDAC approved a vaccine it means that what the agency had seen on paper was the package of the history of the vaccine development.\n\n\u201cWe have been working night and day together. And what he said about the vaccines coming with short expiration dates pose a challenge to us as a country.\n\n\u201cBut because of the love of the country we decided to walk with that tight timespan or challenge,\u201d she added.\n\nShe noted that NAFDAC was the only regulatory agency in Africa that tests the subjects the vaccines test.\n\nNAN reports that Malawi was the first country to publicly destroy vaccine doses in May.\n\nThe African Union\u2019s African Vaccine Acquisition Task Team shipped over 900,000 doses AstraZeneca vaccine to 13 African nations through donations.\n\nBut, the Serum institute of India, which manufactured these doses, extended the shelf-life to July 13, there was confusion in the expiration dates.\n\nThis Countries have also faced challenges planning and funding for in-country rollouts, as well as vaccine hesitancy, which has made it difficult for countries to quickly administer the jabs into the arms of citizens.\n\n...",

When this failed we instituted a civil action against the State Government and the officials involved in 1988.\n\n\u201cThe matter went through the High Court, the appeal court and the Supreme court that dropped its hammers in 2012 with an order that members of the association should as a matter of first priority be given 549plots of land in the area.\n\n\u201cSince 2012, the process of harvesting the fruit of our Supreme Court Judgement has been a Herculean task because the Lagos State Government felt it is greater than the law. Even the than Attorney General of Lagos State Mr Ade Ipaye boosted to our Lawyers, that despite the judgement of the Apex Court, no inch of the land in Magodo will be yielded to any member of the Landlord Association.\u201d\n\nFurther detailing what he described as the facts, the association chairman noted that, \u201cBetween 1984 and 1986, the government of Lagos State of Nigeria fraudulently took the parcel of land belonging to us, members of the landlord Association of Shangisha /Magodo the area occupied by us, under the pretence that the acquired land will be used for the construction of an international standard hospital. We the landlords were forcefully evicted from the land in dispute.\n\n\u201cThe government went ahead to pull down all our houses, taking the entire area which was not what they had asked for in the 1st place. After the pulling down of our houses, we were embarrassed to find out that the Lagos state government officials involved had converted the land for their selfish interest, allotting the said land in plots to their friends and cronies, and some of high and mighty people in the society.\n\n\u201cThe Association (Judgement Creditors) unanimously elected Chief Adebayo Adeyiga as their chairman and six other members to represent the Association in recovery of their land from the Lagos State government. We approach the Lagos State government, armed with facts of the fraudulent allotment, and it was resolved between us that members of the Association would be given plots of land from the then new scheme known as Magodo scheme 2.\n\n\u201cIt was when they failed to do so, that we were forced to sue the Lagos State government sometimes in June 1988 in suits ID/795/88 Chief Adebayo Adeyiga and six (6) others versus military governor of Lagos State and four(4) others in Lagos State high court, Ikeja.\n\n\u201cThe Association applied to the court for an order to sue and prosecute the case in a representative capacity and was brought before Honorable Justice W. A. Oshodi it was granted on 21st of November 1988.\n\n\u201cWhile the case was going on, the Lagos State government refused or neglected to obey the court order to maintain status quo, rather they and their cronies intensified construction activities. This forced us to apply for interlocutory injunction which was granted by the late Honorable Justice A. L. Balogun on 19th October 1992.\n\n\u201cBy this ruling/order of the courts, it was expected that the Lagos State government and the Association would respect the court of the land and refrain from allotting or further development on the land, pending the determination of the substantive suit, but they refused.\n\n\u201cOn the 17th of May 1993, while the case was still pending in court, the then civilian governor of Lagos State, Sir Michael Otedola gave the executive order for the release of our land to us, which was not also compiled with by the state of Lagos state government officials.\n\n\u201cOn the 31st of December 1993, the trial court gave judgment in favor of Shangisha Landlord Association as represented by the Chief Adebayo Adeyiga and six)6) others with a mandatory injunction order on the judgment debtor (Lagos State government) to allocate 549 plots on the land in dispute as first choice preference to the association.\n\n\u201cOn the 16th of March 1994, while the appeal against the said judgement was pending, the judgement debtor applied for a stay of execution which was granted by Honorable Justice Rosaline Omotosho, and she ordered both parties to maintain status quo. She lamented the contemptuous act and lawlessness of the Lagos state government and their agents in refusing to comply with the earlier order.\n\n\u201cOn May 4th, 1994, the same judgement debtors wanted to eliminate members of the Association judgment creditors. They sent members of the government task force with thugs after the chairman of the Association Chief Adeyiga who was beaten with his wife, wounded and thrown down from his one-story building. This act cost him permanent disability on his body and complete damage of his eyes, this same act of lawlessness was also carried out on other members of the Association using the same task force, thugs and security personnel.\n\n\u201cIn 1999, the late Honorable Justice Akinola Aguda tribunal on the allocation of land and Lagos state also gave an order against developers of all the lands in dispute and Shangisha/Magodo and Ikosi GRA to suspend work pending the determination of the suit ID 795/88 in the courts of appeal but they did not obey the order.\n\n\u201cDespite the caveat put on the land by late Honorable Akinola Aguda, the Lagos state government and illegal allottees refused to obey the order of the late jurist. The Lagos state government and its land officials and Justice department, because of the reprimand given by the late jurist to some Judges. Ministries of Justice officials and Land officials colluded and refused to release the recommendation and the report of Late Justice Akinola Aguda panel until today.\n\n\u201cOn the 25th of September 2001, the courts of appeal gave judgment against Lagos state and reaffirmed the judgment of the lower courts.\n\n\u201cIn order to preserve the rest of the land our counsel, the Late MR. Kehinde Sofola SAN wrote a letter dated 29th of July 2002 to the then attorney general of Lagos state Prof. Yemi Osinbajo to preserve the 549 plots with him pending the determination of the case and send a copy to Supreme court. The Lagos state government dissatisfied with the same appealed to the Supreme Court of Nigeria, which finally affirmed the judgement of the lower courts on the 10th February 2012.\n\n\u201cAfter the Supreme Court had dropped it hammer by confirming the judgment of the lower courts, we exhausted all options known in law to have our land even by auditing all the remaining vacant land in Magodo Ikosi GRA but all to no avail to Lagos state government. We therefore applied as of right for writ of possession to harvest the fruit of our judgment.\n\n\u201cOur lead counsel Mr. Kayode Sofola wrote the former Chief Justice of Lagos state, the Honorable Justice Ayotunde Phillips on the need to sign the writ of possession to enable us to execute the judgment. Amazingly and enviously, the Chief Justice of Lagos state, the honorable Ayotunde Phillips colluded with the Lagos state government by refusing to sign the writ and even hide our files with one Honorable Justice Kayode Ogunmekan. The file was only released after we wrote a letter to the Honorable Justice Ayotunde Phillips through our counsel.\n\n\u201cWe had no choice but to petition the former Chief Justice of Nigeria and chairman of national judiciary council, Chief Justice Honorable Mariam Aloma Mukhta who narratively issued a query to Honorable Justice Ayotunde Phillips concerning the matter. Surprisingly, Honorable Justice Ayotunde Phillips refused to answer the query until she retired in 2014. The NJC allowed her to collect her retirement entitlement despite our petition to the NJC not to allow her to do so.\n\n\u201cA reminder of our petition is again forwarded to the then Chief Justice of Nigeria, The Honorable Justice Mohammed Mahmoud and the NJC culminating in the issuing of another letter of request to Chief Justice of Lagos state, the Honorable justice Olufunmilayo Atilade to know what step she had taken on the matter.\n\n\u201cOn November 11th, 2016, we wrote a petition against Honorable Olufunmilayo Atilade on her failure to discharge her responsibility in the enforcement of the judgment of the Supreme Court for refusing to sign our writ of possession file before her in November 2015.\n\n\u201cBased on all the above facts, we humbly stated that we have by all means done and exhausted what is expected of law abiding citizens of the nation by following due process in this matter but the government of Lagos state has not deemed it necessary to obey court orders,\u201d he concluded.\n\nMeanwhile, the Legal Adviser, Magodo Residents Association, Tunji Abdulhameed, said the landowners were about invading the estate with a bulldozer when the estate management closed estate gates to prevent the action.\n\n\u201cThey came around 1pm yesterday; The land grabbers invaded the estate and the police gave them backing. I asked what they were doing here and the police said they are trying to enforce judgment,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI asked for a copy of the judgment but no document was shown to me. What they showed was a newspaper publication which they did themselves to inform the world that they are the owner of the property.\n\n\u201cThey had a judgment in 1993 and as far as I am concerned the judgment was not properly captured. The judgment said the government should allocate 549 plots to them with no specification to the area, property, location of the plots of land; in fact, there was nothing to ascertain the property they were talking about.\n\n\u201cThe resident associations had a meeting in the evening and thereafter, we just saw a bulldozer at the front of our gate. The police didn\u2019t go and were with them, the bulldozer is still at the other gate. That was why we closed the gate.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know whether we are going to open the gate because we don\u2019t know their plan as the land grabbers and policemen are still around. They have a motive they want to achieve; I think the purpose is to use the bulldozer to destroy property.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking on the development, Chairman, Board of Trustee, Magodo Residents Association, Professor Ayodele Ogunye, said residents in the estate had constantly been subjected to different forms of land grabber attacks, adding that the state government should intervene to restore normalcy in the estate.\n\n\u201cI have been living here since 1992 but we have been having problems with land grabbers until this case became enlarged. It is true that the supreme court had given judgment in the favor of the Adeyiga Family; they are to be giving 549 plots but that judgment did not say 549 plots in Magodo,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHence, the Lagos State Government allocated plots of land to them along Badagry and Ibeju Lekki. So far, about 300 of them have agreed to take those plots and these people continue to harass us. I have been to Alagbon three times this year on this issue.\n\n\u201cYesterday, in the morning, these people besieged us; they said they were bailiffs trying to enforce the supreme court judgment. They are not Lagos State Government bailiff, if they were, they will wear their jackets. They went to hire some area boys to come in as bailiff.\n\n\u201cI spoke with the senior officer that led them and he said he got instruction from the top to follow them. We told them to show us the judgment they are enforcing, and they showed our lawyer a press release. Press release is not a court judgment or court instruction that they should bombard us.\n\n\u201cThey were marking houses including houses we have been living together since 1992. We gathered that the government was not informed yesterday, how could they come into a government estate without clearance from the governor, the governor said he is not aware about this siege.\u201d",

          "text": "As part of efforts to encourage farmers and boost local production of rice in Osun Stats, the administration of Governor Adegboyega Oyetola, on Wednesday, commenced distribution of local rice popularly known as \u201cOfada\u201d to the beneficiaries of its monthly Food Support Scheme.\n\nThis initiative will not only boost local production of rice but will also encourage the farmers and create ready-made market for their farm produce which will contribute to making Osun hub of the nation\u2019s agricultural produce.\n\nSpeaking at the symbolic flag-off of the 9th edition of the Food Support Scheme, held at the Local Government Service Commission, Government Secretariat, Abere, Osogbo, Governor Oyetola noted that the initiative was to further actualise his plans to genuinely diversify the economy by unraveling the potential embedded in the critical sectors such as agriculture, mining and tourism.\n\nRepresented by the Secretary to the State Government, Prince Wole Oyebamiji, the governor reiterated his commitment towards sustaining the programme, noting that no amount of economic downturn would prevent the programme from happening on monthly basis as designed.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe disclosed that another empowerment plan had reached the final stage to ensure that widows, aged and other vulnerable citizens who were not captured in the food support scheme are properly taken care of.\n\nGovernor Oyetola, who noted that over 270,000 households had benefited from the scheme since its commencement nine months ago, said no effort would be spared to add value to the initiative which has been widely accepted by the people.\n\n\u201cYou will recall that nine months ago, our government did promise that on a monthly basis, 30,000 households will be fed and this is the ninth edition making 270,000 households that had benefited from the Scheme. And when we talk of household, it is not an individual that makes up an household, essentially, the husband, wife, children and dependants.\n\n\u201cSo, when we look at the numbers of the beneficiaries, one would not but agree that thousand of residents of the state had benefitted so far.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThis is an achievement of the wishes and aspirations of Mr Governor to ensure that the common man also benefit from his lofty people-centred programmes designed to cater for their welfare and well-being.\n\n\u201cThere is strategy already put in place to ensure that all the food items get to the beneficiaries across the 30 Local Government Areas of the State and this will be done before the end of this week,\u201d he added.\n\nEarlier, the Commissioner for Regional Integration and Special Duties, Engr.

Badmus who was accompanied by the Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on Regional Integration and Special Duties, Hon. Samson Owoyokun, said it gladdened his heart that this month\u2019s edition was dedicated to pure local food.\n\nAccording to him, the initiative will enhance the production capacity and encourage the young ones to go into farming as government was resolute to create enabling environment for citizens particularly farmers to thrive.\n\n\u201cWe are doing the 9th edition of the Ilerioluwa Food Support Scheme and this one is spectacular because we have gone out of our way to meet our local rice farmers to ensure that we are getting enough rice for distribution.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThis initiative is to ensure that we source the food contents directly from the farmers for distribution as part of efforts to boost the local productions and strengthen the production capacity in our State.\n\n\u201cYes, we couldn\u2019t get all in the State because of the present rice production capacity but this is Nigerian-made rice popularly known as \u201cOfada rice\u201d that we sourced locally from the farmers.\n\n\u201cAs it is, our farmers will be enjoy direct purchase from the government as this will also go a long way to encourage our farmers to grow rice and other staple foods.\n\n\u201cI can assure you all that as far as Mr Governor remains in government, he will continue to support our farmers to revamp the agricultural sector,\u201d he stated.",

          "text": "As part of efforts to encourage farmers and boost local production of rice in Osun Stats, the administration of Governor Adegboyega Oyetola, on Wednesday, commenced distribution of local rice popularly known as \u201cOfada\u201d to the beneficiaries of its monthly Food Support Scheme.\n\nThis initiative will not only boost local production of rice but will also encourage the farmers and create ready-made market for their farm produce which will contribute to making Osun hub of the nation\u2019s agricultural produce.\n\nSpeaking at the symbolic flag-off of the 9th edition of the Food Support Scheme, held at the Local Government Service Commission, Government Secretariat, Abere, Osogbo, Governor Oyetola noted that the initiative was to further actualise his plans to genuinely diversify the economy by unraveling the potential embedded in the critical sectors such as agriculture, mining and tourism.\n\nRepresented by the Secretary to the State Government, Prince Wole Oyebamiji, the governor reiterated his commitment towards sustaining the programme, noting that no amount of economic downturn would prevent the programme from happening on monthly basis as designed.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe disclosed that another empowerment plan had reached the final stage to ensure that widows, aged and other vulnerable citizens who were not captured in the food support scheme are properly taken care of.\n\nGovernor Oyetola, who noted that over 270,000 households had benefited from the scheme since its commencement nine months ago, said no effort would be spared to add value to the initiative which has been widely accepted by the people.\n\n\u201cYou will recall that nine months ago, our government did promise that on a monthly basis, 30,000 households will be fed and this is the ninth edition making 270,000 households that had benefited from the Scheme. And when we talk of household, it is not an individual that makes up an household, essentially, the husband, wife, children and dependants.\n\n\u201cSo, when we look at the numbers of the beneficiaries, one would not but agree that thousand of residents of the state had benefitted so far.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThis is an achievement of the wishes and aspirations of Mr Governor to ensure that the common man also benefit from his lofty people-centred programmes designed to cater for their welfare and well-being.\n\n\u201cThere is strategy already put in place to ensure that all the food items get to the beneficiaries across the 30 Local Government Areas of the State and this will be done before the end of this week,\u201d he added.\n\nEarlier, the Commissioner for Regional Integration and Special Duties, Engr. Olalekan Badmus, said the government\u2019s resolve to promote local content had begun to yield positive results as evidenced in the successful move to source Ofada rice locally.\n\nEngr. Badmus who was accompanied by the Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on Regional Integration and Special Duties, Hon. Samson Owoyokun, said it gladdened his heart that this month\u2019s edition was dedicated to pure local food.\n\nAccording to him, the initiative will enhance the production capacity and encourage the young ones to go into farming as government was resolute to create enabling environment for citizens particularly farmers to thrive.\n\n\u201cWe are doing the 9th edition of the Ilerioluwa Food Support Scheme and this one is spectacular because we have gone out of our way to meet our local rice farmers to ensure that we are getting enough rice for distribution.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThis initiative is to ensure that we source the food contents directly from the farmers for distribution as part of efforts to boost the local productions and strengthen the production capacity in our State.\n\n\u201cYes, we couldn\u2019t get all in the State because of the present rice production capacity but this is Nigerian-made rice popularly known as \u201cOfada rice\u201d that we sourced locally from the farmers.\n\n\u201cAs it is, our farmers will be enjoy direct purchase from the government as this will also go a long way to encourage our farmers to grow rice and other staple foods.\n\n\u201cI can assure you all that as far as Mr Governor remains in government, he will continue to support our farmers to revamp the agricultural sector,\u201d he stated.",

For us to come out of the recession that we found ourselves in the previous period, we must have had the fortune of passing the budget and getting Mr. President to sign in time.\n\n\u201cSo, we believe that the economy of Nigeria, and Nigerian businesses especially, will continue to benefit from the passage of the appropriation bills in time and the assent by Mr. President, accordingly.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe wish to make it clear that our desire is to provide legislations for the peace, order and good government of our country.\u201d\n\nThe Senate President further hinted that the chamber would consider the report of the Committee on the Review of the 1999 Constitution as soon as it is presented early next year.\n\n\u201cWhen we return, we have one major legislation that has not been attended to at all as a chamber, and that is the constitutional amendments.\n\n\u201cOur Committee on the Review of the 1999 Constitution has been doing its work.

We have gone through such difficult moments with dignity and respect for each other, and we have come out even stronger.\u201d\n\nThe Senate President reminded his colleagues of the role of the Senate as an institution to stabilize the polity, particularly against the backdrop of issues likely to surface ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cNext year, by the grace of God, will be the last lap of our tenure.

          "title": "Internal wrangling won\u2019t affect APC\u2019s chances in 2023 \u2013 Bagudu",
          "text": "Kebbi state Governor Atiku Abubakar Bagudu has assured that the internal wrangling within the All Progressives Congress (APC) would not make the party sink ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\nThe governor, who said this Wednesday while fielding questions from State House correspondents at the Presidential Villa in Abuja, noted that difference in opinion was part of party politics.\n\nBagudu said instead of disintegrating, the current disagreements in the party would eventually bring out the best in the ruling party and lead it to progress.\n\nThe governor said despite the wrangling, the APC, under the present national caretaker committee, has attracted more people, including serving governors and federal legislators.\n\n\u201cFirst, let us know that the distinction between democracy and possibly other forms of government is that there will be differences of opinion and the hope that such differences of opinion will from time to time bring out the best or move society forward.\n\n\u201cWe have been a party that recognises that there will never be one voice and we don\u2019t pray that there will be one voice. We pray that people should be able to express themselves, bring different ideas, even when they conflict those ideas within the systems created by the democracy sit and iron them out.\n\n\u201cTo suggest that because there is dissent or differences in opinion, that it will affect the fortune of our party, I think that is quite far-fetched. We are a party that recognises that for us to continue to deliver, we must debate, we must compete, and we must bring ideas to the government.\n\n\u201cMind you, remember that particularly in the last two years, under the current caretaker committee chairman, Mai-Mala Buni, three serving governors, one serving deputy governor, a number of serving senators, members of the National Assembly, former this, former that have joined the party.\n\n\u201cThat is the best evidence that this party is continuing to deliver on the promises that Nigerians have trusted us with, under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari,\u201d he said.\n\nOn insecurity in Kebbi state, the governor urged Nigerians to be cautious about security issues.\n\n\u201cI think Nigerians; we have to be contextual about security issues. We are part of the human race and as long as the problem is not solved, anywhere, you cannot escape it sometimes.\n\n\u201cMany gains have been made, that is the thing, but there will always be that isolated or sporadic issue somewhere. What is important is for us to strengthen each other, strengthen our communities, support our communities, support our security agencies, support measures that will ensure that we will dominate rather than those who do not wish us well,\u201d he said.\n\nPGF on convention date\n\nIn a related development, Director General Progressive Governors Forum (PGF) Salihu Lukman has called on Governor Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker Extraordinary/Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) to urgently release the specific date for the party\u2019s national convention.\n\nLukman, while denying media reports that he was opposed to direct primaries, urged the National Assembly\u2019s leadership to rework contentious clauses in the rejected bill and forward same to the president for his assent.\n\nSpeaking during the unveiling of his new book, \u201cAPC and Campaign for New Nigeria\u201d, Wednesday in Abuja, the PDG boss further tasked party leaders on the question of internet provision within the party to ensure that every member of the party is aware of the records of members without any dispute.\u201d\n\nOn direct primary or otherwise, Lukman said: \u201cI am not opposed to direct primary, but there are some conditions which must be met for direct primary to be able to provide the democratic platform that will confirm the voice of individual members of the party.\u201d\n\nWhile commending Buni-led national caretaker committee, Lukman said: \u201cI\u2019m happy from the information we got from the media, the caretaker committee has confirmed that the convention is going to take place in February.\n\n\u201cMy appeal is for the caretaker committee to remain proactive; certain issues should not be allowed to go into speculation. Information about the date of the convention, I think should be made public so that every party member knows when the convention is going to hold in February.\n\n\u201cWe must commend the leadership of H.E Mai Mala Buni, for rising to that occasion and affirming that the February date is sacrosanct. So, party members should look forward for a specific date that will be announced by the caretaker committee.\n\n\u201cSome of those conditions include the fact that the membership of the political party must be very clear; it should not be in dispute. In APC, we are very clear in terms of ensuring that we prioritise the question of developing the membership database of our party. That was why we went through the process of membership registration and revalidation.\u201d\n\nDirect/indirect primary\n\nOn the controversy over direct and indirect primaries, he said \u201cthe whole debate about direct or indirect primary is basically an APC issue. To that extent, my position is to appeal to the leadership of the National Assembly to provide the necessary leadership so that we don\u2019t muddle up issues.\n\n\u201cMy argument is that the original bill which went for public hearing did not include all those provisions. It was out of the momentary anger I think, against governors following the management of the Congresses that led to the situation whereby National Assembly (NASS) members felt compelled to amend the law and include direct primaries.\n\n\u201cThe issues that are necessary in the Electoral Act which are not contentious are issues of electronic transmission of results and all the other issues.\n\n\u201cI think they should rework it and submit it to Mr. President for assent. The other issues of direct primaries should go through the normal legislative process and if it is passed, so be it, so that we don\u2019t throw the baby away with the bath water.\u201d\n\nOn the message of his latest book, Lukman said it is basically an appeal to APC leaders to prioritise internal negotiations.\n\n\u201cDemocracy is about negotiations. Our leaders have demonstrated very good capacity to make sacrifices and that is how the party even came about.\n\n\u201cI think at this point, it is important that our leaders embrace negotiations. It is just about ensuring that meetings take place and decisions taken are respected. It is the capacity of organs of the party to meet that provides a platform for negotiations.\n\n\u201cAnother point which is there in the book is an appeal to party leaders again to prioritise the issue of relationship because the major challenge of politics in this country today is poor management of relationship among party leaders.\n\n\u201cThis is creating a lot of internal crisis and I believe that as we move towards the convention, we should resume meetings of statutory organs of the party because that will help a number of issues whether it is that of congresses or any other disagreement. One meeting can settle everything.\n\n\u201cOur leaders should be able to convene a meeting, possibly, a meeting of National Caucus or National Executive Committee (NEC) before the convention, on the basis of which we can begin to resume the process of reorganizing ourselves and facing the challenge of providing leadership to this country as we move to 2023,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "The Senate Wednesday announced plans to consult with the House of Representatives on the way out of the logjam over President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s veto on the 2010 Electoral Act (Amendment Bill) Bill 2021.\n\nThe position came as a sharp contrast to the earlier threat by Senators George Sekibo, Mathew Urhoghide and some others who pleaded anonymity, to override Buhari\u2019s veto.\n\nThe aggrieved lawmakers had Tuesday said the Senate would move against the president\u2019s decision by gathering signatures to override the president.\n\nIn fact, reports said over 70 signatures had already been gathered as at Tuesday.\n\nBuhari\u2019s action\n\nPresident Buhari had in a letter dated December 13, 2021, explained that his decision to withhold assent to the electoral bill was informed by advice from relevant Ministries, Departments and Agencies of Government after a thorough review.\n\nAccording to the president, signing the bill into law would have serious adverse legal, financial, economic and security consequences on the country, particularly in view of Nigeria\u2019s peculiarities.\n\nHe added that it would also impact negatively on the rights of citizens to participate in the government as constitutionally ensured.\n\nThe resolutions\n\nHowever, after about 40 minutes of closed-door session, the Senate made a face- saving move by resolving to consult with the Green Chamber and their constituents before taking any action on issues raised by President Buhari in the rejected bill.\n\nAnnouncing the resolutions taken at the meeting, President of the Senate Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan said: \u201cThe Senate in the closed session discussed how to respond to the letter from Mr. President on the electoral bill amendment.\n\n\u201cBut provisions of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) does not permit the upper chamber to exclusively take any action on such matters in the absence of the House of Representatives, since the latter has embarked on recess.\n\n\u201cThe Senate consequently resolved to consult with the House of Representatives in January when both the Senate and House will be in session.\n\n\u201cPresently, the House of Reps has gone on recess and like we all know, the constitutional provision is for the Senate and House of Representatives to jointly take the appropriate action.\n\n\u201cThe Senate also resolved to consult with our constituents during our recess in January. The Senate believes that our constituents have a role to play as the major stakeholders in the laws that we make in the National Assembly.\u201d\n\nBudget\n\nMeanwhile,Senate President Lawan has said the National Assembly would today (Thursday) transmit the 2022 budget passed by both chambers to President Buhari for assent into law.\n\nLawan gave the hint Wednesday in his remarks moments before the chamber proceeded on recess.\n\nHe said the timely assent of the 2022 Appropriations Bill into law would ensure the commencement of its implementation by January next year.\n\nThe lawmaker added that businesses operating in the country as well as the economy stand to be impacted positively by the timely passage of the nation\u2019s budget.\n\nAhmad said:\u201cFor the 2022 Appropriation Bill, we are expecting that the bill will be cleaned up between today and tomorrow, and we hope that by tomorrow, the bill will be sent to Mr. President for his assent.\n\n\u201c(And) we are very optimistic that Mr. President will assent to the bill, like he did for 2020 and 2021, so that by January 2022, the implementation of the budget 2022 will commence by the grace of God.\n\n\u201cWe have seen the benefits of passing and assenting to the budget in good time, especially when we had to fight COVID-19.\n\n\u201cThe consequence of the implementation of the budget in 2021 and 2020 was very clear. For us to come out of the recession that we found ourselves in the previous period, we must have had the fortune of passing the budget and getting Mr. President to sign in time.\n\n\u201cSo, we believe that the economy of Nigeria and Nigerian businesses especially, will continue to benefit from the passage of the appropriation bills in time and the assent by Mr. President, accordingly.\n\n\u201cWe wish to make it clear that our desire is to provide legislations for the peace, order and good government of our country.\u201d\n\nOn 1999 Constitution\n\nSenate President Ahmad further hinted that the chamber would consider the report of the Committee on the Review of the 1999 Constitution as soon as it is presented early next year.\n\n\u201cWhen we return, we have one major legislation that has not been attended to at all as a chamber, and that is the constitutional amendments.\n\n\u201cOur Committee on the Review of the 1999 Constitution has been doing its work. But as a chamber, we haven\u2019t finished working on it.\n\n\u201cWe are expectant that our Committee on the review of the constitution will be presenting the report to this chamber as soon as we resume. The committee has done so much, and the report is almost ready.\n\n\u201cWhen we harmonise with our colleagues in the House, we should be able to vote on the issues that will particularly bring about peace, unity and good government in our country, before such bill will be sent to the State Houses of Assembly for concurrence.\n\n\u201cOn the whole, we must thank Almighty God that almost all those major items we reflected in our legislative agenda as a chamber has been attended to\u201d, he added.\n\nHe reminded his colleagues of the role of the Senate as an institution to stabilise the polity, particularly against the backdrop of issues likely to surface ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cNext year, by the grace of God, will be the last lap of our tenure. So, we have a lot to ensure that we finish all the things that we have pencilled down for ourselves and, of course, there are many other issues that from time to time will be coming up in our polity.\n\n\u201cThis Senate is supposed to play that role of stabilizing the polity in Nigeria.\n\n\u201c(And) I daresay, that the members of the National Assembly, particularly the Senate, is a stabilising institution in the polity of Nigeria.\u201d, he stressed.\n\nBudge passed\n\nEarlier, the Senate had passed an aggregate expenditure of N17, 126,873,917,692 trillion naira as budget for the 2022 fiscal year.\n\nThe passage followed the consideration of a report by the Appropriations Committee on the 2022 Appropriations Bill.\n\nChairman of the Committee, Senator Barau Jibrin, said the revenue projection for the 2022 budget was predicated on the Medium Term Expenditure Framework/Fiscal Strategy Paper approved by the National Assembly.\n\nBarau recalled that the National Assembly had approved 1.88mbpd daily oil production and US$62 as against $US57 proposed by the executive arm of government.\n\nHe explained that the increase in oil price Benchmark from US$57 to US$62 was done to reflect the current market value in the international market.\n\nJibrin added that the exchange rate was pegged at N410.15/US$1, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Rate at 4.2 and Inflation Rate at 13 percent.\n\nThe lawmaker explained that out of the N17,126,873,917,692 passed, N869,667,187,542 is for Statutory Transfer; N6,909,849,788,737 is for Recurrent Expenditure; N5,467,403,959,863 is for Capital Expenditure; and N3,879,952,981,550 is for Debt Service.\n\nThe committee in its recommendations stated that additional revenues discovered should be provided to the Works and Housing Ministry for funding of critical projects, Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), for the 2023 General Elections, Defence and the National Population Commission for the 2022 Population Census.\n\nIt added also that N98 billion increase in deficit should be approved to take care of some of the additional requests from the executive arm of government.\n\nA breakdown of recurrent expenditure shows that N61,079,757,342 was budgeted for the Presidency in 2022, N996,09 1,292,618 for Defence, N79,243,483,198 for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, N55,796,274,038 for Federal Ministry of Information and Culture, N257,626,461,524 for Ministry of Interior, N7,919,353,247 for Office of the Head of Civil Service of the Federation, and N4,476,854,068 for the Auditor General for the Federation.\n\nWhile the Federal Ministry of Police Affairs received N518,532,292,470, the Ministry of a communications and Digital Economy got N23,387,996,618, National Security Adviser \u2013 N155,820,2 14,009, Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission \u2013 N1,344,674,257, Secretary to the Government of the Federation \u2013 N62,575,420,244, Federal Ministry of Special Duties and Inter-Governmental Affairs \u2013 N4,439,614,685, Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development \u2013 N75,544,228,649, and Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning \u2013 N28,604, 104,969.\n\nIn addition, the Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment received N17,966,745,438, Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment \u2013 N14,453,726,978, Federal Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation \u2013 N49,683,523,165, Federal Ministry of Transport \u2013 N15,892,132,819, Federal Ministry of Aviation \u2013 N7,692,548,460, Federal Ministry of Power \u2013 N6,262,156,943, and Ministry of Petroleum Resources \u2013 N30,502,257, 191.\n\nAlso, N12,038,392,758 was budgeted for the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development, N31,935,604,197 for Federal Ministry of Works and Housing, N870,534,226 for National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission, N456,245,928 for Fiscal Responsibility Commission, N10,669,058,320 for Federal Ministry of Water Resources, N26,761,780,448 for Federal Ministry of Justice, and N11,655,253,717 for the Independent Corrupt Practices and Related Offences Commission.\n\nOthers are Federal Capital Territory Administration \u2013 Nil, Federal Ministry of Niger Delta \u2013 N2,569,680,304, Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development \u2013 N185,489,102,966, Federal Ministry of Women Affairs \u2013 N2,103,758,084, Federal Ministry of Education \u2013 N593,473,925,256, Federal Ministry of Health \u2013 N462,858,698,619, Federal Ministry of Environment \u2013 N22,796,647,842, National Population Commission \u2013 N8,880,618,082, and Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development \u2013 N7,669,972,542.\n\nOther Executive bodies such as the Federal Code of Conduct Bureau received N2,343,845,401, Code of Conduct Tribunal \u2013 N830,910,644, Federal Character Commission \u2013 N3,272,871,999, Federal Civil Service Commission \u2013 N1,217,473,478, Police Service Commission \u2013 N926,505,919, and Revenue Mobilisation, Allocation, and Fiscal Commission \u2013 N2,337,230,632.\n\nThe Senate, after passing the 2022 budget, adjourned plenary till January 18, 2022 for the Christmas break.",

There is power in music. When I almost committed suicide in my younger age as a real estate business man, it was music that saved my life. Music is a perfect communication with God.\n\n\u201cI had become very successful in the real estate sector at a very young age. I took a loan of N8 billion about 12 years ago to build high rise building which I had to pull down by myself when we were already on the 10th floor, and the money went down the drain.\n\n\u201cLife turned upside down thereafter and the only option was for me to commit suicide, but listening to series of inspirational music reset my thinking faculty to remember the common saying \u2018There is Hope When There is Life\u2019.\n\n\u201cI have since then adopted music as a very powerful solution tool when faced with challenges, and I made up mind to invest in music and art for the economic empowerment and mental liberation of our youths and the less privileged people in our society. Ladies and gentlemen, whatever you are going through, please don\u2019t give up. Use inspirational music to elevate your spirit\n\n\u201cThis is indeed a calling for me and I feel so happily fulfilled tonight with this 1st day of this musical project, a three-day musical show which I tagged \u2018Memorable Moments With Music\u2019.\u201d\n\nRelated\n\nNo tags for this post.",

They either veto the president\u2019s decline of assent or remove the contentious provision on direct primaries and send it back to the President for his assent.\n\nWhichever option, our legislators choose, can be accomplished in the shortest possible time. We could have a new electoral law in January 2022.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Buhari\u2019s Letter Declining Assent To Electoral Act Amendment Bill Read At NASS\n\nIt was either commendation or criticism for various political players on Tuesday after it was revealed that the President had opted to withhold his assent to the bill.\n\nIn the letters read to lawmakers in the Senate and House of Representatives chambers, President Buhari raised concern over the mandatory direct mode of primaries for political parties.\n\nWhile some governors and groups gave contrary reactions to the President\u2019s decision, the lawmakers in both chambers said they would take definite action after their recess.\n\n\u2018Not An Option\u2019\n\nSaraki, in his reaction, believes the present mood in the country is the desire to have a new electoral law that will lead to a credible, free, fair, and peaceful process of electing leaders at various levels.\n\nHe stressed that Nigerians needed a system that would ensure their votes truly count in the election of those who govern them.\n\n\u201cThis proposed electoral law is expected to reassure the youths, many of whom steer clear of the political process because they have no confidence in the system. They believe the system is usually rigged and compromised,\u201d the former Senate President said.\n\n\u201cOne way to bring this active demography into the political system is to enact a new law that will give them hope in our nation. This Electoral Act [Amendment] Bill serves that purpose.\n\n\u201cThis is why, as the representatives of the Nigerian people, the National Assembly must take a decision in the interest of our nation and its long-term democracy. The option of not doing anything after the refusal of the assent by the President is not an option.\u201d",

          "title": "FULL TEXT: President Buhari\u2019s letter on withholding assent to electoral bill -",
          "text": "The President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan; and Speaker of House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, on Tuesday, at the opening of plenary read the communication from President Muhammadu Buhari on his rejection of the Electoral Act 2010 (Amendment) Bill.\n\nWhile making his remark on the letter, Speaker Gbajabiamila said the House would act on Buhari\u2019s communication when the National Assembly resumes in January.\n\nThe letter, which was dated December 13, 2021, was received by the House on December 21, 2021 and it is titled, \u2018Withholding of Assent to Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2021.\u2019\n\nRead the full text of the letter below\n\n\u201cFurther to the fetter dated 18th November, 2021, forwarded for presidential assent, the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021, as passed by the National Assembly, I have received informed advice from relevant ministries, departments and agencies of the government, and have also carefully reviewed the bill in light of the current realities prevalent in the Federal Republic of Nigeria in the circumstances.\n\n\u201cArising from the review, Rt. Honourable Speaker may wish to note that the conduct of elections for the nomination of party candidates solely via direct primaries as envisaged by the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021 has serious adverse legal, financial, economic and security consequences which cannot be accommodated at the moment considering our nation\u2019s peculiarities. It also has implications on the rights of citizens to participate in the government as constitutionally ensured.\n\n\u201cThe Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021 seeks to amend certain provisions of the extant Electoral Act 2010. Part of the objective of the bill is the amendment of the present Section 87 of the Electoral Act, 2010, to delete the provision for the conduct of indirect primaries in the nomination of party candidates such that party candidates can henceforth only emerge through direct primaries.\n\n\u201cArising from the review, Mr. Speaker may wish to particularly note the pertinent issues implicated as follows to wit:\n\n\u201cThe conduct of direct primaries across the 8,809 wards across the length and breadth of the country will lead to a significant spike in the cost of conducting primary elections by parties as well as increase in the cost of monitoring such elections by INEC who has to deploy monitors across these wards each time a party is to conduct direct primaries for the presidential, gubernatorial and legislative posts. The addition of these costs with the already huge cost of conducting general elections will inevitable lead to huge financial burden on both the political parties, INEC and the economy in general at a time of dwindling revenues.\n\n\u201cThe indirect consequences of the issues of high cost and monetisation are that it will raise financial crimes and constitute further strain on the economy. It will also stifle smaller parties without the enormous resources required to mobilise all party members for the primaries. This is not healthy for the sustenance of multi-party democracy in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn addition to increased costs identified above, conducting and monitoring primary elections across 8,809 wards will pose huge security challenges as the security agencies will also be overstretched, direct primaries will be open to participation from all and sundry and such large turn-out without effective security coordination will also engender intimidation and disruptions, thereby raising credibility issues for the outcomes of such elections.\n\n\u201cThe amendment as proposed is a violation of the underlying spirit of democracy which is characterised by freedom of choices. Political party membership is a voluntary exercise of the constitutional right to freedom of association. Several millions of Nigerians are not card carrying members of any political party. Thus, the emphasis should be on enabling qualified Nigerians to vote for the candidate of their choice during general elections as a means of participation in governance and furtherance of the concept of universal adult suffrage or universal franchise.\n\nThe proposed amendment may also give rise to plethora of Litigations based on diverse grounds and issues of Law, including but not limited to the fact that the proposed amendment cannot work in retrospect given that the existing Constitution of the parties already registered with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) permits direct, indirect and consensus primaries. This real possibility, will, without doubt, truncate the electoral program of the nation as another electoral exercise is imminent towards a change of government in 2023.\n\n\u201cNigeria is at the moment still grappling with the issues of monetisation of the political process and vote buying at both party and general elections. The direct implication of institutionalising only direct primaries is the aggravation of over-monetisation of the process as there will be much more people a contestant needs to reach out to thereby further fuelling corruption and abuse of office by incumbent contestants who may resort to public resources to satisfy the increased demands and logistics of winning party primaries.\n\n\u201cDirect primaries are also subject or susceptible to manipulation or malpractices as most parties cannot boast of reliable and verified membership Register or valid means of identification which therefore means non-members can be recruited to vote by wealthy contestants to influence the outcome. Rival parties can also conspire and mobilise people to vote against a good or popular candidate in a party during its primaries just to pave way for their own candidates. Whereas where voting is done by accredited delegates during indirect primaries, the above irregularities are not possible.\n\nIt further read, \u201cThe major conclusions arrived at upon the review are highlighted hereunder, to wit:\n\n\u201cAsides its serious adverse legal, financial, economic and security consequences, the limitation or restriction of the nomination procedures available to political parties and their members constitutes an affront to the right to freedom of association. It is thus undemocratic to restrict the procedure or means of nomination of candidates by political parties, as it also amounts to undue interference in the affairs of political parties.\n\n\u201cIndirect primaries or collegiate elections are part of internationally accepted electoral practices. More so, direct primaries are not free from manipulations and do not particularly guarantee the emergence of the will of the people especially in circumstances like ours where it is near impossible to sustain a workable implementation framework or structure thereof.\n\n\u201cIn the premise of the above, I hereby signify to the National Assembly that I am constrained to withhold assent to the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021 in line with the provisions of Section 58(1) & (4) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended). It is my considered position that the political parties should be allowed to freely exercise right of choice in deciding which of direct or indirect primary to adopt in the conduct of their primary elections as their respective realities may permit.\n\n\u201cPlease accept, Rt. Honourable Speaker, the assurance of my highest deration and esteem.\u201d",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s presidency says dozens of people have been killed in violence between farmers and herders in the country\u2019s central Nasarawa state.\n\nIn a statement late on Tuesday, the office of President Muhammadu Buhari said at least 45 farmers were killed in the violence that erupted on Friday. Dozens more were wounded, it said.\n\nBuhari \u201cexpressed grief over the heart-wrenching\u201d killings and said his government would \u201cleave no stone unturned in fishing out the perpetrators of this senseless and barbaric incident, and bring them to justice\u201d.\n\nLocal police said the violence broke out when armed Fulani herders attacked villagers from the Tiv ethnic group over the killing of a kinsman that they blamed on Tiv farmers. The unrest continued until Sunday.\n\nThe police initially gave a death toll of eight.\n\nNasarawa state police spokesman Ramhan Nansel earlier said military and police teams had deployed in the area to restore calm and arrest the perpetrators.\n\n\u201cWe received a complaint on the killing of a Fulani herdsman but while the investigation was ongoing, a reprisal attack was carried out in Hangara village and neighbouring Kwayero village,\u201d Ramhan Nansel,\n\n\u201cEight people were killed in the attacks and their bodies were recovered by the police and taken to hospital.\u201d\n\nBut Peter Ahemba of the Tiv Development Association said the death toll was higher.\n\n\u201cWe recovered more than 20 corpses of our people killed in the attacks in 12 villages across Lafia, Obi and Awe districts where around 5,000 were displaced,\u201d he said, adding that many people were still missing.\n\nDeadly clashes between nomadic cattle herders and local farmers over grazing and water rights are common in central Nigeria.\n\nThe internecine conflict has taken on an ethnic and religious dimension in recent years. The Fulani herders are Muslim, and the farmers are primarily Christian.\n\nThe friction, which has roots dating back more than a century, was caused by droughts, population growth, the expansion of sedentary farming into communal areas as well as poor governance.\n\nViolence by criminal gangs of cattle thieves among the herders, who raid villages, killing and burning homes after looting them, has compounded the situation.\n\nThe Governor of Nasarawa State, Abdullahi Sule, has promised to go after killers of Fulani herders and Tiv farmers.\n\n\u201cThere was needless loss of lives of our citizens. Such act of violence is most unfortunate, condemnable, and unacceptable and will not be condoned by this administration,\u201d he was quoted as saying by the Sahara Reporters news site.\n\nAl Jazeera",
