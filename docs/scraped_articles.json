Iniobong Ekpenyong has given his testimony in the ongoing trial of Uduak-Abasi Akpan over the murder of 26-year-old Iniubong Umoren.\n\nEkpenyong testified as the first Prosecution Witness (PW1) on Thursday before the trial Judge, Justice Bassey Nkanang at Akwa Ibom State High Court 9 sitting in Uyo.\n\nHe told the Court how he acilitated the arrest of his cousin, Uduak-Abasi Akpan, whom is standing trial for the murder of Miss Iniubong Umoren, graduate of the University of Uyo, (UNIUYO).\n\nHe said he learnt about the murder of late Umoren when his attention was drawn to Social media post that the second accused person, Mr. Frank Akpan had been arrested.\n\nHe told the Court that he received calls from various quarters asking him to intervene because the second accused person has an ailment which needed attention.\n\nHe said: \u201cI\u2019m Surveyor Iniobong Ekpenyong,\n\nChairman Uruan Local Government. I live at F173 Ewet Housing Estate, Uyo. My Lord on April 30, 2021 on the social media, it was trending that one Uduak Frank Akpan was involved in a murder of Miss Iniubong Umoren.\n\n\u201cI got calls from various quarters that the Father of Uduak-Abasi Frank Akpan (first accused person) has been arrested. In view of the fact that he is from my LG, Uruan, people asked that I should intervene, that the second accused person has an ailment that needed attention.\n\n\u201cThen I now called the Divisional Police Officer , Uruan, Kufre Effiong and one DSP Akwa. All converged in my residence at Ewet Housing Estate, Uyo, where we discussed issues, where the first accused person called Kufre Effiong. Kufre Effiong brought his phone to the DPO Uruan division.\n\n\u201d At that time we were happy that the first accused person called. So Effiong asked him to come down and clear his name that he is trending on social media, and so that his father can be released from Police custody\u201d\n\nHe noted that when Uduak-Abasi arrived his residence he confessed that he actually murdered late Iniubong Umoren by hitting her with an object.\n\nAlso in his brief testimony, the second Prosecution witness, Kufre Effiong who told the Court that he lives at No. 16 Esuene Street Uyo, corroborated what the LG Council Chairman Ekpenyong said earlier.\n\nHe said: \u201cOn April 30, 2021 about 2pm I was called by my father who lives in Lagos. He told me that there was a trending post on Facebook concerning Uduak-Abasi Akpan on kidnapping. Not too long the Uruan LG Chairman also called me and intimated me of the same issue\u201d\n\nEarlier, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd defendants\n\n, namely (Uduak-Abasi Akpan, Frank Akpan, and Miss Anwan Bassey Akpan respectively, earlier during the proceedings, pleaded not guilty to the charges brought against them.\n\nJustice Nkanang in his remarks after listening to the testimony of the duo, assured to give the matter accelerated hearing in order to ensure judgement was delivered before Easter 2022.\n\nHe adjourned the case till Monday 15, November 2021.",

Prof. Osinbajo considers this painful loss of lives a horrible tragedy.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cThe attention of the Vice President has been drawn to an obviously sponsored falsehood regarding the recently collapsed building published by Sahara Reporters on November 4th, 2021, to the effect that:\n\n1. The VP owns the land upon which the collapsed building in Ikoyi stood.\n\n2. That the said land was sold to him by Chief Michael Ade. Ojo, Chairman of Elizade Motors; and\n\n3. That the Vice President, at some point, intervened with the regulatory authorities in Lagos State to unseal the said property.\n\nLet it be made absolutely clear that Prof. Yemi Osinbajo does not own and has never owned the said land.\n\nHe has also never been involved, in any shape or form, in the development of this or any other land since he became Vice President.\n\nAt no time whatsoever did the VP buy this or any other piece of land from Chief Michael Ade. Ojo, or entered into any transaction for the sale of that land or any other piece of land from Chief Ade. Ojo or anyone for that matter.\n\nAll property and assets owned by the Vice President have been publicly declared.\n\nAlso, the Vice President has never spoken to the Governor of Lagos State or any other official of the State Government regarding the unsealing of the said building on Gerrard Road, Ikoyi, which subsequently collapsed. He has, indeed, never acted to influence any other regulatory action on the collapsed building, or any other building for that matter, in Lagos State.\n\nThe Vice President restates categorically that he has no interest whatsoever, and has never had any interest, either legally or beneficially, in the land, the building or development.\n\nThe wickedness and viciousness of a lie that seeks to utilise a tragedy where so many people have lost their lives, even as rescue efforts are ongoing, and in wanton disregard to the feelings and untold grief of their loved ones for political gain, reveals a dangerous desperation, as well as the heartlessness of the perpetrators of such despicable lies.\n\nSahara Reporters were undoubtedly well rewarded for their criminal and inhumane conduct. Typical of a hatchet job and deliberately irresponsible journalism, the publication was not signed by anyone.\n\nThe Vice President has referred this disgraceful publication to his lawyers for prompt legal action.\u201d",

          "title": "Debt cancellation: Nigeria yet to appreciate Tukur",
          "text": "By Dirisu Yakubu\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, Thursday, eulogized elder statesmen and former Managing Director of the Nigerian Ports Authority, Alhaji Bamanga Tukur, saying not much credit has been given him particularly against the backdrop of the role he playing in securing debt relief for Nigeria a few years ago.\n\nPresident Buhari stated this at the public presentation of book titled, \u201cLegacies of a Legend,\u201d in honour of Tukur as part of events marking his 86th birthday.\n\nRepresented by his Chief of Staff, Professor Ibrahim Gambari, President Buhari described the celebrant as a man who dedicated his whole life in shaping public policies and championing public/private partnerships on the platform of the African Business Roundtable.\n\nHe said: \u201cI recalled Bamanga Tukur\u2019s activities with Tony Blair led Commission for Africa in 2004/2005 and how that led to the 2005 G8 Summit landmark decision on debt cancellation for 32 African countries. Prior to that, many poor African countries were using large portion of their little resources to service debt obligations.\n\n\u201cThe benefits of debt cancellation were that many African countries were then able to free up resources which they previously channeled into debt servicing and deployed them into socio-economic and infrastructural projects. That explained the fact that shortly after, the fastest growing economy was from Africa which perfectly fuelled Africa\u2019s rising narrative. To my mind, much credit has not yet been given to the role played by Alhaji Bamanga Tukur in the process. We must recognize that now.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, these debts that were incurred in the past, cancellation advocacy were not channeled into appropriate economic goods and services that directly lay the foundation upon which the economic growth will be experienced.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha described Alhaji Tukur as \u201can epitome of what Nigeria ought to be.\u201d Recalling how the former NPA boss redefined the idea of the Nigerianess in him, Mustapha said the celebrant shocked the then Gongola state when he brought a Southerner, Chief Raymond Dokpesi to head his governorship campaign organization, adding that the development revealed the broad-mindedness that has stuck with the elder statesman ever since.\n\n\u201cHe made Dokpesi his campaign director and later as Chief of Staff in Gongola state. That demonstrated that whatever part of the country you come from is not important. What matters is that once you have the capacity to deliver, you can find accommodation anywhere in Nigeria,\u201d Mustapha said.\n\nFederal Capital Territory, FCT Minister, Mohammed Bello left the capacity-filled Congress Hall of Transcorp Hilton in ecstasy when he went memory lane to recall the closeness he shared with Tukur in 1981/1982 in the course of his National Youth Service Corps, NYSC scheme.\n\n\u201cIn 1981, I was doing my NYSC in Lagos and I had no car. My father met with Alhaji Bamanga Tukur and they discussed how to get me a car to aid my movement. The brand Honda Accord car (1982 model) was going for N9,000. They agreed that the cost of the car would be shared among us. My father brought N4,000, Alhaji Bamanga brought N4,000 while I was asked to bring N1,000 for registration and insurance. That was what happened but Alhaji Bamanga even paid for the insurance for me,\u201d he recalled.\n\nMeanwhile, Director General of the Nigerian Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA, Brig.Gen. Buba Marwa (retd) has advocated drug test for all intending couples as a means of checkmating the prevalence of drug abuse across the country.\n\nIn his goodwill message at the event, Marwa said: \u201cHow many of you will like your daughters to marry drug addicts?

All flags are to be flown at half-mast in public and private buildings and official engagements cancelled during the period.\n\nThis came as Governor Sanwo-Olu signed the executive order giving legal backing to the panel of inquiry set up to probe the collapsed building.\n\nHe inaugurated the panel at the Five Cowries Boat Terminal of the Lagos State Water Authority (LASWA) on Falomo Road, Ikoyi, yesterday, with a charge to get to the root of the building collapse.\n\nThe governor charged the panel chaired by Mr. Toyin Ayinde to do its job without fear or favour, adding that Lagosians and the country as a whole deserve to know what led to the incident to forestall future occurrences.\n\nSetup your own platform that allows you to earn a minimum of \u20a6100,000 daily, payments are in US dollars, 100% legitimate .Click here to start now .\n\nOther members of the panel are Akintilo Adeleke, Yinka Ogundairo, Godfrey C.

It is a solemn moment for me personally, but this is an important assignment. Indeed, the generation coming after will not forgive us if we don\u2019t do the right thing on this incident.\n\n\u201cThe inauguration of this panel shows sincerely that the state government is interested in unravelling and get to the root cause of what happened to the building, so that everyone concerned, including the government, will learn from the very unfortunate incident. Lagosians and the world will be watching and waiting keenly, with the full expectation that the immediate and remote causes of this tragedy will be uncovered.\u201d\n\nHe said the public deserved to know what went wrong and stressed that the work of the panel would not bring back the lives lost but would help to prevent future reoccurrence of such tragic events.\n\nHe said the oath taken by the tribunal members empowered them with adequate privileges of government powers to conduct independent investigation without fear, favour, interference and restrictions.\n\n\u201cWhat this tribunal will be doing over the course of the next few weeks will have important implications for building safety and for emergency response, not just in Lagos, but in the entire country. It will also go a long way towards ensuring that the families of the innocent victims of this avoidable tragedy experience some sort of closure and get justice,\u201d Sanwo-Olu said.\n\nAyinde said Lagos was in its \u201cdark period\u201d given the record of fatalities from the site of the building collapse and pledged on behalf of members to discharge the duty with all sense of responsibility and in line with ethics.\n\nThe governor, who left the venue for the collapsed building site on Gerrard Road, met and interacted with all the first responders to enable him assess the extent of the rescue operation ongoing. He said the bodies would as from today be ready for release to their families for burial, as autopsy was being rounded off on them.\n\nThe governor said the process was taking long because corona inquisition, among others was being conducted, saying such could also reveal more information about few of the affected.\n\nMeanwhile, the body of the Managing Director, Fourscore Homes, Femis Osibona, has been recovered in the rubble of the collapsed Ikoyi building.\n\nFourscore Homes is the firm constructing the 21-storey building under construction which collapsed on Monday, on Gerrard Road in Ikoyi, Lagos.\n\nThe National Emergency Management Agency confirmed this last night.

For those who have followed the build up to the poll on Saturday, it would expectedly be the mother of all governorship elections not just in Anambra but Nigeria at large.\n\nIt would be an understatement to say that the tension in the South Eastern state is high.\n\nBut many agree that despite all manner of conspiracy theories around the election, it would come and go. For obvious reasons, the consensus among various commentators is that it is in the best interest of Anambra people that the election holds in the state tomorrow. There is anxiety for it to hold in spite of the serious security threat to the entire process.\n\nThe most scary threat came from the Separatist campaigners, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), who earlier said there would be total lockdown of the South East region from November 5 (today), if its leader, Nnamdi Kanu was not released unconditionally from the custody of the Department of State Services (DSS), where he has been held for more than three months. He is facing charges of treason.\n\nSetup your own platform that allows you to earn a minimum of \u20a6100,000 daily, payments are in US dollars, 100% legitimate .Click here to start now .\n\nTo make matters worse, some faceless groups have continued to perpetuate killings in the state just as another rag-tag group, led by one Innocent Orji, had through some viral videos vowed that the election would not hold.\n\nAs a consequence, a coalition of civil society organisations in the state had called for a shift in the election date but the security agencies and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) have repeatedly reassured that there was no going back on the November 6 date.\n\nAlso, the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, had on October 30, carried out what he described as \u201ca major overhauling of the security landscape in Anambra\u201d ahead of the election by deploying two deputy inspectors-general of police (DIG) and five assistant inspectors-general of police (AIG) there, to help ensure adequate security for the poll.\n\nSpokesperson of the force headquarters, Frank Mba, who announced the deployment in a statement in Abuja, said 14 commissioners of police, 31 deputy commissioners of police, and 48 assistant commissioners of police have also been deployed to the state.\n\nIGP Baba had earlier disclosed that at least 34, 587 operatives were to be deployed following the outcome of election security threat analysis conducted by the Force Intelligence Bureau.\n\nMba said Joseph Egbunike, a deputy inspector-general of police, is to coordinate the security component for the election. He would be assisted by the acting deputy inspector-general of police in-charge of operations, Zaki Ahmed.\n\nAccording to IGP Baba, the police are \u201cadequately prepared\u201d for the election, and would do everything within their powers to ensure a free and fair election in the state.\n\nHe, then, called on citizens in Anambra State to \u201ccome out en masse and exercise their franchise as adequate security has been emplaced to protect them before, during and after the elections.\u201d\n\nHow the parties stand\n\nFor the bookmakers, there are just three major political parties in tomorrow\u2019s election, namely: All Progressives Congress (APC), All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). However, some political dynamics within the PDP had thrown up the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) and located it as a major force in the Anambra governorship contest.\n\nThen, there are the Young Progressives Party (YPP) which controls a senatorial seat in the state and also the African Action Congress (AAC) which is also garnering support across the state. There are also other seemingly light weights such as Accord Party, African Democratic Congress (ADC), Social Democratic Party (SDP) and Labour Party (LP).\n\nOn paper, the election should ordinarily be a straight fight between the incumbent APGA and the APC because of the preponderance of supposedly big names in Anambra politics that recently flooded the ruling party(APC).\n\nBut the three major parties in Anambra: APC, APGA and PDP, have big challenges staring them in the face as they go into the election.\n\nFor the APC represented by Senator Andy Uba, it has been creating awareness, but the party lacks total grassroots support in Anambra. The tale of sorrow and blood from marauding herdsmen is an albatross to the APC because voters believe that victory for the party would further embolden their tormentors. What this means is that the APC has remained a hard sell; their message has not been received and might remain so. However, critical observers argue that it would be preposterous to underrate the overwhelming influence the ruling party has a potent tool for tomorrow\u2019s election.\n\nSome pessimists also think that APGA has in the last 16 failed to meet the expectation of Anambra people. The poor economic condition of the masses is the biggest demon confronting the party. There is also a negative perception surrounding its candidate, Prof Charles Soludo as an arrogant person who claims to be all-knowing. His opponents insist that APGA\u2019s grassroots model would not save him.\n\nHowever, like Soludo or hate him, many see him as the candidate to beat in the election because of his outstanding credentials especially during his tenure as the governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria(CBN). Some believe that among the candidate, he appears to be the most prepared.\n\nFor the PDP, the thinking out there is that it lost a golden opportunity to reclaim the Agu Awka Government House because of the factor of god-fatherism that has bedeviled the party. The perception in many quarters is that godfathers have been at the roots of the challenges facing Anambra today.\n\nThe dismal outing of former Governor Chinwoke Mbadinuju, many believe, was caused by a godfather who did not allow him to lead the state.\n\nAs a result, Mbadinuju did not return for a second term, and Chris Ngige was imposed on the state. Ngige however got into office, dishonored the agreement and started working but his godfathers who allegedly wanted him to sign off Anambra\u2019s allocation to them followed him up and abducted him from office. Even though Ngige like a cat with nine lives, wriggled out, he could not do his work again as the state was made ungovernable for him.\n\nAt that point, the godfathers linked up with Peter Obi in APGA and through their contacts, networks and connections, took the power away from Ngige through the court judgment. Then Obi became the governor and served for eight years.\n\nIt is a known fact that after Obi\u2019s eight-year tenure, he also wanted to be a godfather and actually was one for Governor Willie Obiano. It did not take long before the godfather and his godson\u2019s relationship soured and got to an irretrievable point. Today, they are two of the best enemies of Anambra that even the Bishops could not reconcile them.\n\nHowever, despite the odds against the PDP, it remains a force to record with because of the quality of its candidate. Many see him as a man with a rich track record and experience which he would bring to bear on governance.\n\nUbah, Okonkwo, Nwankwo, Maduka, Nwankpo\n\nApart from the big three parties, there are also candidates of the YPP, Senator Ifeanyi Ubah, ZLP, Dr. Obiora Okonkwo, African Action Congress (AAC), Dr Chidozie Nwankwo, ACCORD party, Dr. Godwin Maduka, ADC, Akachukwu Nwankpo, Labour Party, Obiora Agbasimelo and Social Democratic Party (SDP), Dr. Obinna Uzor who have individually garnered visibility and have done a lot of campaign.\n\nUbah as current senator of Anambra South Senatorial District is expected to make appreciable impact in the election with his grassroots appeal especially amongst the Keke (tricycle) operators, barrow pushers of Onitsha and their likes, but it is not known how far such street popularity will push him and his party.\n\nAlso, the AAC candidate, Dr Nwankwo is a well-known figure not only in Anambra but Nigeria and has made a name for himself in the sectors of business and humanitarian work, both in the Eastern region and across the country.\n\nThere is also Maduka of the Accord Party whose aspiration initially looked bright particularly in the PDP, but dimmed after the party\u2019s primary election of June 26, 2021. Not many are confident that his party would have a good showing on Saturday.\n\nHowever, one man that has continued to show strength is Dr. Obiora Okonkwo of the ZLP. His leaving the PDP after the party\u2019s controversial governorship primary election remains a big blow to the party. It is believed that majority of PDP faithful across the state are still with the man whose candidacy promises some surprise in the election. He is also at home with various Christian denominations in the state.\n\nThe mathematics\n\nOut of the three Senatorial Districts: Anambra North, Anambra Central and Anambra South; the Central has the highest number of registered voters, dominantly in Idemili North and South LGAs.\n\nAnambra North has the second highest registered voters, majority of the votes in Ogbaru LGA.\n\nAnambra South is the least in terms of registered voters but Aguata LGA has the highest registered voters in South.\n\nThe ZLP\u2019s Dr Obiora Okonkwo (Dikeora) is from Anambra Central, and the only candidate from the entire zone. Okonkwo hails from Idemili North that commands over 30 per cent of the overall votes cast every election year. The possible scenario tomorrow is that Central will vote Central, Dikeora will win opponents with significant margin there.\n\nAnambra North has the second highest registered voters; the ZLP is also expected to harvest in Anambra North because the party sowed there too. The ZLP deputy governorship candidate, Jessie Balonwu, is also the only running mate from Anambra North. For the Anambra North that has been often undermined as not being financially endowed, the zone is at peace that one of their own is the deputy.\n\nThere is no doubt that other three parties, APC APGA and PDP have very significant battle ahead of them. Andy Uba, Charles Soludo and Valentine Ozigbo will have to determine who is who in the old Aguata ground.\n\nIn addition, the whole of Anambra South is in pieces as Accord Party may show some flashes in Orumba North and South. YPP could possibly win Nnewi North and probably South, just as ADC\u2019s Nwankpo and SDP\u2019s Uzor will slug it out in Ihiala.\n\nThe emerging scenario might be that of everyman to his strong hold but the candidates will all show up in Anambra North to wrestle for votes as none is from Anambra South. Obiora Okonkwo\u2019s victory in Idemili will be a very big advantage. The running mate of the APC candidate, Emeka Okafor also hails from Idemili, Nnobi precisely.\n\nThe race would also be tough when the APC, APGA, PDP and ZLP shift the battle to Anambra North.\n\nThis is without prejudice to the influence of several other big politicians from the North including Senators Stella Oduah and Joy Emordi; House of Representatives member Lynda Ikpeazu and the rest that recently defected to the APC.\n\nOutgoing Governor Obiano who hails from Anambra North is also expecting to deliver the zone to his party, APGA. For him, tomorrow\u2019s election is like his last political battle, so, it would be titanic at least in his Senatorial zone.\n\nRegardless of all the variables, as Anambra votes for a new governor, a potpourri of factors would come to play including the issues of god-fatherism, incumbency, role of federal might, voting strength of candidates\u2019 catchment areas, final decisions of the two major churches, and last minute horse trading.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Enugu\n\nBarely 24 hours to Anambra governorship election, Amb. Bianca Ojukwu, wife of the late Igbo leader and national leader of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), on the occasion of his posthumous birthday, November 4, speaks on the chances of the party.\n\nThe former Nigerian Ambassador to Spain said that Governor Willie Obiano should be held responsible should APGA lose the election.\n\nToday is Dim Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu\u2019s birthday. In this election year, are there any programmes or events that have been put in place by APGA, his political party to mark the event?\n\nThis birthday anniversary of Dim Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu is symbolic because it is taking place barely 48 hours to the gubernatorial elections in Anambra State, the political stronghold of APGA, of which he is widely referred to as its eternal leader. However, with the current situation in the party and the calculated attempts by the present party leadership to expunge his image from the party; it is given that they will not host any remembrance events, even on this birthday anniversary. In any case, is it not a united and harmonious party that can come together to host such an event? There is far too much turmoil and infighting going on within the party at present. However, our family is hosting a dedicated Mass celebration in his honour today.\n\nSetup your own platform that allows you to earn a minimum of \u20a6100,000 daily, payments are in US dollars, 100% legitimate .Click here to start now .\n\nWhat is your take concerning the crisis within the party and the spate of defections taking place within its fold almost on a daily basis?\n\nThe bitter truth, if it is to be told, is that the situation that exists in APGA today is a direct result of leadership failure of the party leader, Governor Willie Obiano, coupled with the abdication of his responsibilities both to the party and to the state. This has left a deeply wounded and visibly divided party, with APGA party members decamping from the party almost on a daily basis with the alacrity of rats deserting a sinking ship. Curiously, they are almost all defecting to APC. Our party has lost almost half of our state and national legislators, several principal members of our Board of Trustees including the Secretary of the Board, party local government leaders, countless party executive members including Governor Obiano\u2019s own ward chairman and to cap it all, the serving deputy governor of the state, Dr Nkem Okeke who joined the APC recently. What cannot be denied is that Obiano and his henchmen have run APGA like a secret cult and reduced our once vibrant party to a shadow of its former self. In the process, they have squandered the massive goodwill our party once enjoyed among our people.\n\nIn what ways is he responsible for the dwindling fortunes of APGA and this collateral loss of goodwill in the state?\n\nThis is visible for all to see. I have persistently raised the alarm signals that the events of 2018, when party officials executed the biggest heist in the party\u2019s political history and party aspirants were subjected to untold extortion and impunity would surely come back to haunt the party during these elections. This event has left the party deeply divided, as has the party\u2019s orchestrated and high handed disqualification of gubernatorial aspirants during this year\u2019s primaries, after collecting millions of money from them. This has also caused factions within APGA. Moreover, the Governor has not only instigated a religious denominational crisis within the state but also friction between the state and traditional institutions by his highhanded approach and arbitrary dethronement of traditional rulers who go against his views. The state is suffering the most extreme state of insecurity under his watch which has seen several citizens, including a traditional ruler in his community gunned down in broad daylight recently. There is palpable fear and anxiety among citizens within the state.\n\nTo the governor\u2019s credit, Anambra airport is nearing completion but then, the intercity roads and roads leading to the communities are in a terrible state, and this has created a persistent logjam and traffic gridlock within the state, making motorists to spend hours in transit.\n\nAnother critical factor is that traders and artisans who used to be APGA\u2019s most ardent supporters have, over the years, been subjected to crippling levies and multiple levels of taxation by state agents, thereby breeding deep resentment against the Obiano Administration, and by extension, the party. Added to this is the governor\u2019s refusal to conduct local government elections throughout his years in office so as to facilitate better development of communities.\n\nIn fact, there are so many other factors which have pitched citizens of the state against this administration, which has not been made any better by the nonchalant attitude of our governor who surrounds himself with sycophants who convince him that all is well.\n\nWhat is then your assessment of the party\u2019s chances in these elections?\n\nI am confident that despite all these shortcomings, we will do well. APGA is not just a political party, but a state of mind. The party has been in control of the state for almost sixteen years. This was due to the Ojukwu factor. The people transferred the love they had for him to the political platform identified with him. While it remains true that those comforting combinations of stability, fraternity and decency which have always rallied our people behind APGA as \u2018Nke Anyi\u2019 have been somewhat eroded, the fact remains that our party has a good candidate in this guber election in the person of Prof Charles Soludo and he has all it takes to chart a new course both in the trajectory of the party and of the state.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "title": "Abdulsalami: Parties, Candidates Must Accept Outcome of Anambra Poll Once Credible, Free",
          "text": "Says INEC has guaranteed transparent election\n\n18 governorship hopefuls sign peace accord\n\nAll is set for tomorrow, declares electoral body\n\nIPOB suspends stay-at-home order\n\nPDP reiterates call for Kanu\u2019s release\n\nChidoka, Abaribe, Amadi, others call for peaceful exercise\n\nNBC warns against inciting broadcast\n\nNseobong Okon-Ekong, Nume Ekeghe in Lagos, Chuks Okocha, Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja and David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka\n\nChairman of the National Peace Committee (NPC) and former Head of State, General Abdulsalamii Abubakar, has appealed to political parties and their candidates in Anambra State to accept the outcome of tomorrow\u2019s governorship election once pronounced credible. Abdulsalamii made the call in Awka at a Peace Accord signing ceremony preparatory to the poll, which was attended by candidates of the 18 contesting political parties.\n\nAbdulsalamii, who coordinated the signing of the peace understanding, assured that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had promised a credible election in the state.\n\nChairman of INEC, Professor Mahmood Yakubu, said the commission had, against incredible odds, done all it should to make the electoral process smooth. Yakubu called for a violence-free poll.\n\nRemarkably, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) had a change of heart and suspended its stay-at-home order, billed to commence today.\n\nBut the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) called for the release of the detained IPOB leader, Nnamdi Kanu. PDP said releasing Kanu and engaging the group in a dialogue would help to stem the tide of insecurity in Anambra State and the entire South-east.\n\nIn a similar vein, some key voices in the South-east called for a halt to violence and hostility in Anambra State. Former Minister of Aviation, Chief Osita Chidoka; Senate Minority Leader, Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe; and a law lecturer and activist, Dr. Sam Amadi, pleaded for peaceful conduct of the governorship election.\n\nBut the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) warned all broadcast stations covering the Anambra State governorship election to avoid languages and scenes likely to encourage, incite or compromise the unity or corporate existence of Nigeria.\n\nSpeaking at the Peace Accord signing ceremony held at the Professor Dora Akunyili Women Development Centre, Abdulsalamii urged the governorship hopefuls to abide by the letter and spirit of the peace pact, which they had agreed to. He told the candidates that the peace accord was a clarion call to them to commit to a peaceful election, adding that the pact became necessary following the history of electoral violence in the country.\n\nAbdulsalamii stated, \u201cIn Nigeria, almost every election was accompanied by violence, ballot box snatching, vote buying, outright disruption of the process, and in some cases, the intimidation of ordinary citizens, who simply want to select a leader, who will govern them.\n\n\u201cWe, the members of the National Peace Committee, have come to Anambra to support a peaceful electoral process. We cherish Anambra and we cherish the peace and unity of Nigeria. Most importantly, we want to contribute our own quota to see that the governorship election in Anambra is devoid of violence.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the signing of the peace accord today is not a mere exercise, it is, indeed, a clarion call for all the candidates and the political parties and all people of Anambra people to commit themselves to have peaceful process.\n\n\u201cWe call on all the candidates, political parties and their supporters to accept the outcome of the poll as long as it is adjudged to be free, fair and credible. I have been assured by the chairman of INEC that all efforts are in place to ensure a free and fair election.\n\n\u201cAll of us have the responsibility to deepen the cause of democracy in every part of Nigeria. We want every Nigerian to begin to enjoy the fruits of democracy. This can only happen, when there is peace and stability.\u201d\n\nThe peace deal signing ceremony saw the candidates of all the political parties participating in tomorrow\u2019s election, the INEC chairman, and NPC chairman, putting pen to paper and signing up to an agreement to ensure peace before, during, and after the November 6 governorship election.\n\nThe event, organised by Abdulsalamii and Bishop Mathew Hassan Kukah to foster peace among politicians and their supporters, was attended by the Inspector General of Police (IGP) Usman Baba, represented by Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Police Joseph Egbunike, who hails from Anambra State.\n\nOthers at the ceremony were Chairman, Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Anambra State; the leadership of all the political parties; and Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC) Chairmen.\n\nThose who signed the agreement included former Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and candidate of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Professor Charles Soludo; Mr. Valentine Ozigbo of PDP; Senator Ifeanyi Ubah of Young Progressives Party (YPP); and Andy Uba of All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nAll Set for Tomorrow, Says INEC\n\nThe INEC chairman said the commission had done all it should to make the electoral process smooth. Yakubu appealed for a violence-free poll.\n\nHe commended the National Peace Committee for always lending INEC a helping hand whenever it was faced with the challenge of insecurity.\n\nYakubu said, \u201cFaced with the current situation in Anambra State, the commission once again appealed to the NPC to bring parties and candidates to commit to peace before, during and after the election. We believe that Anambra cannot be different from Edo and Ondo. For this reason, we are also confident that, just like Edo and Ondo, the election on Saturday will be peaceful and the outcome will reflect the will of the Anambra voters.\n\n\u201cINEC has done everything possible to ensure credible elections in Anambra State under very difficult circumstances. I would like to appeal to all parties, candidates and other actors to play their roles in support of the Peace Accord.\n\n\u201cWithout peace, our deployment plans, innovations in voter accreditation and result management, safety of election duty personnel and accredited observers, security of election materials and, ultimately, the credibility of the polls will be undermined. That is why we must all support today\u2019s Peace Accord and the work of the NPC, in general.\n\n\u201cBefore I conclude, let me re-echo what the chairman of the NPC has just said. Those who signed the Peace Accord must abide by its letter and spirit in words and deeds.\u201d\n\nIPOB Suspends Stay-at-home Order\n\nA statement yesterday, signed by IPOB\u2019s Director of Publicity, Emma Powerful, said the group decided to call off its stay-at-home order following appeals by elders in the South-east, coupled with the grave economic implications of the movement restriction for the people.\n\nThe body urged the people of Anambra State to come out and vote in the governorship poll without intimidation or fear.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cFollowing the genuine intervention of our elders, esteemed traditional institutions/rulers and religious leaders, and after due consideration of the positive impacts of their engagement, and sequel to the fact that our elders have spoken in our terms, the leadership of IPOB, ably led by Nnamdi Kanu, hereby and immediately calls off the one-week sit-at-home earlier declared to commence tomorrow, November 5, to November 10, 2021.\n\n\u201cWe have equally considered several appeals by our mothers, who earn their living based on their daily economic activities, which will obviously be affected if the region is locked down for one whole week. It\u2019s never our intention to add to the pains of our people, hence, our decision to suspend the sit-at-home.\n\n\u201cThe people of Anambra State should go out en masse and peacefully exercise their franchise come 6th November 2021, and accordingly, choose a leader of their choice and should not be intimidated by anybody, group of persons or security agents.\n\n\u201cAnambrarians should vote and standby to protect their votes. No rigging of any kind will be tolerated on the Anambra State governorship election. It must be transparent, free and fair to all.\n\n\u201cWe wish to thank IPOB members worldwide, friends of Biafra and lovers of freedom for their continued support for our dogged struggle for independence.\n\n\u201cMay we, therefore, warn detractors, traitors and our enemies not to cause confusion by imputing motives to our decision. IPOB doesn\u2019t expect anybody to observe, monitor or enforce the suspended order, otherwise, such action will be considered a rebellion to the highest leadership of our global movement.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, our oppressors should not take our decision as an act of cowardice. IPOB still believes that our elders, religious leaders, political leaders and various stakeholders will live up to their promises in their engagements and efforts towards securing the unconditional release of our leader.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, urge everyone to go about their lawful businesses without fear of any molestations. All agents of darkness recruited by our enemies to inflict pain on our people under the guise of enforcing the sit-at-home are hereby warned to steer clear or brace up for the consequences of their evil action.\u201d\n\nState PDP Chapter Reiterates Call for Kanu\u2019s Release\n\nPDP, in a statement by the publicity secretary of the party\u2019s Publicity Committee for the Anambra election, Ken Okologbo, said, \u201cPresident Yar\u2019Adua used the stick and carrot approach to stem the issue of militancy in the South-south. This brought the present peace experienced in that region and greatly increased our revenue as a country.\n\n\u201cThe APC government will rather continue to leave us in this terrible state of insecurity all over the country. We are fast turning into Afghanistan, as rightly described by Governors Okowa and Ortom.\u201d\n\nThe statement said PDP ended its campaign at Uga, in Auguata Local Government Area of Anambra State. It alleged that the party was \u201cmindful of the propaganda going on that money was used in mobilising the huge crowd that thronged Alex Ekwueme Square on Tuesday 2nd November 2021, where we had our official flag-off.\n\n\u201cOur opponents are intimidated by the overwhelming welcome Ndi Anambra have shown for our candidate Valentine Ozigbo and our party.\u201d\n\nThe party called on INEC to go beyond the peace accord and ensure that incident forms were not used during the election.\n\nPDP stated, \u201cWe have all been assured that the Bimodal system of accreditation will be applied. If the card reader fails to recognise your thumbprint then the facial features will also come into play. This was used in Isoko South by-election to the Delta State House of Assembly and we saw how successful it turned out to be.\n\n\u201cWe are set to win this election and we urge Ndi Anambra to come out to vote for PDP. A vote for our party is a signal to what will be happening in Ekiti, Osun and eventually in 2023 to free us of the rudderless government of APC that has left us in this complete state of insecurity presently threatening the elections in the South-east.\u201d\n\nChidoka, Abaribe, Amadi, Others Call for Peaceful Exercise\n\nThe plea for peace was the central point of a conversation initiated and anchored by Chidoka on practical ways to push through the agitation of the South-east people, particularly, within the context of the Anambra election.\n\nThe discussants, including Abaribe and Amadi, said call became imperative to prevent external forces, criminal elements and desperate politicians from hijacking the genuine agitation of the people and cashing in on the situation in the state to unleash violence and frame up innocent persons to justify state-backed brutality.\n\nThe trio urged the various groups agitating in the region to shame and disarm their traducers by asking Anambra people to come out and choose the leader that approximates the type of personality they would represent Ndi Igbo in their yearnings as a people.\n\nThe discussants believed, \u201cThe act of Ndi Anambra voting on Saturday is a major part of the affirmation of our self-determination as a people. If the people cannot decide who will govern them through an election, they are not close to determining their future through a democratic process. Denying the people the right to vote is a major denial of their rights to self-determination.\n\n\u201cWhen the people elect a leadership that represents their hopes and aspirations, they are in a position to pursue the people\u2019s agenda more effectively. Whatever is the plan, it has to go through a political process. If you have governors and legislators, who share in the vision, it would be easier to realise such vision.\u201d\n\nAbaribe pointed out he would have languished in prison if he was not a senator and ready to meet the bail condition that required a senator to stand surety.\n\n\u201cYou have to be in the game to score a goal,\u201d Abaribe explained.\n\nAmadi called for a more pragmatic strategy in the South-east, like the Catalonia approach of self-development and using the movement as a platform to achieve political control.\n\nIn his summary of the discussion, Chidoka restated the call for a peaceful election on Saturday and noted that the election was a significant part of the self-determination process of the people. He said the poll was an opportunity for the people to elect the leader that would best advance their agitation instead of allowing situations that give their traducers an upper hand to perpetrate violence and foist undesirable leadership on them.\n\nMeanwhile, the Commissioner for Information and Public Enlightenment in Anambra State, Don Adinuba, raised the alarm over an alleged plot by some members of an unnamed political party to use the federal might to arrest key officials of Governor Willie Obiano\u2019s administration.\n\nIn a statement, Adinuba said the desperate politicians wanted to use certain compromised security operatives to orchestrate the sinister plan. He added that the statement was designed to bring the evil plan of the people to the knowledge of Anambra people and also for the attention of all relevant authorities for prompt action.\n\nIGP Restricts Movement\n\nMeanwhile, the Inspector General of Police (IGP) announced a 24-hour restriction of movement in Anambra, beginning from today, Friday, at 11:59pm. Deputy Inspector General in charge of operations, Mr Zaki Ahmed, who is the leader of the operations, announced this to journalists while unveiling the activities of police operatives posted for the Anambra governorship election.\n\nAhmed said, \u201cI assure you that the police will be professional in carrying out its duty throughout the election, and will maintain neutrality and a level playing ground for all the political parties.\n\n\u201cAdequate security is provided and you have seen the level of manpower in the state, and we are working in collaboration with other security agencies to ensure peace in the state. We are protecting everyone and ensuring that all parties will be protected equally.\n\n\u201cWe have created intervention spots and they will respond to any distress call. This is a national assignment and we should work hand-in-hand to ensure peaceful election.\n\n\u201cThe restriction of movement is for 24 hours and begins on Friday 11:59. All the hotels in Awka are very well covered and fully armed men are there. We have men on all the streets of Awka and we are well protected. We have cautioned our men over human rights abuses, and they are sure to behave themselves.\u201d\n\nSouth-east Marginalisation Responsible for Agitation\n\nIn a related development, the governorship candidates of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Mr Obinna Uzor, and Africa Democratic Congress (ADC), Mr Akachukwu Nwankwo, insisted that the marginalisation of the South-east in the distribution of national resources was the trigger for the agitation championed by IPOB.\n\nSpeaking on Arise News Channel, Nwankwo said the federal government should engage IPOB in order to resolve the insecurity in the region.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere should be a tactical, rational approach that enables us to have this conversation going. What IPOB is saying is that they want good governance. IPOB wants a relationship between the Igbo people and the federal government that makes every Igbo child feel that he is part of Nigeria. In the absence of that, they want to leave Nigeria. Theoretically, that\u2019s what they are doing.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Uzor said the situation required a political solution. He said, \u201cWhat they are saying is, recognise us, let us be part of Nigeria. The Igbo are the most patriotic tribe in Nigeria. What we are saying is, let us have a dialogue, let\u2019s have a political solution.\u201d\n\nAA Candidate Optimistic of Free, Fair Poll Dutch\n\nThe governorship candidate of Action Alliance (AA), Mr. Ben Etiaba, said yesterday that he was confident that INEC would conduct a free and fair election tomorrow. Etiaba said he expected that the turnout might be low but expressed the readiness of his party\u2019s followers to turn out en masse to cast their ballot.\n\nHe spoke on Arise News Channel, saying, \u201cI have more faith in this election than I have ever had. INEC went out of their way as a body to educate the political parties, the masses, and the candidates on what to expect.\n\n\u201cThey have come up with a system that if adopted and if implemented properly would give us a credible result. I have no reason to believe that the election wouldn\u2019t be credible. I am not one of those, who believe the results have been written. I don\u2019t believe that. I believe this election would be credible.\u201d\n\nOn voter turnout and the fear of voter suppression, Etiaba noted that there was a valid concern of voters about their safety. But he remained optimistic of an average turnout.\n\nHe said, \u201cIn every election, voter turnout has been suppressed, but I would be lying if I didn\u2019t acknowledge the fact that there would be more voter apathy this time than we have always had. The number of people voting would be suppressed than before, because people are scared.\n\n\u201cBut it is my belief that enough people would turn out to make the exercise very credible and whatever happens, there would be a result and I am looking forward to mobilising people to make sure people come out to vote for us and create an upset if we win.\u201d\n\nNBC Warns against Inciting Broadcast\n\nThe National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) urged all broadcast stations covering tomorrow\u2019s election in Anambra State to eschew broadcast language and scenes capable of stoking emotions and violence.\n\nDirector General of NBC, Balarabe Shehu Ilelah, issued the warning yesterday in a press statement.\n\nIlelah implored all broadcasters to desist from using or allowing their platforms and facilities to be used for the broadcast of contents that might lead to the breakdown of law and order. He asked all broadcasting stations to take note of the provisions of the Nigeria Broadcast Code and other relevant regulations guiding the broadcast of elections in the country.\n\nIlelah cited some of the provisions, including sections 3.11.1 (a), 3.11.1 (b), 5.41 (f), 5.3.3(j), 5.3.3 (i), 5.3.3 (k) and 5.3.4 that required broadcast stations to ensure that no programme contained anything tantamount to subversion of constituted authority.\n\nSpecifically, section 5.41 (f) provides, \u201cBroadcast shall not transmit divisive materials that may threaten or compromise the indivisibility and indissolubility of Nigeria as a sovereign state,\u201d he said.\n\nNBC also warned broadcasters to end the broadcast of partisan political campaign, jingle and any form of partisan political party identification 24 hours before the election. It said broadcast stations should use any vote obtained at the polling station or from an exit poll to project or speculate on the chances of a candidate.\n\nIlelah said the relay of election results or declaration of a winner could only be done by the authorised electoral officer for the election. He warned that any broadcaster that breached any of the listed provisions of the code shall be severely sanctioned.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "NCC, Telcos Differ on N75bn Reserve Price for 3.5GHz Spectrum",
          "text": "*Fixes December 13 for auction\n\nEmma Okonji\n\nAhead of preparations for 5G rollout in Nigeria in 2022, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has released draft Information Memorandum (IM) for 3.5GHz spectrum auction that would facilitate 5G rollout across the country.\n\nThe NCC had fixed December 13, 2021, for the 3.5GHz spectrum auction and had pegged the reserve price at $197.4 million (N75 billion).\n\nBut telecoms operators, including GSM Association (GSMA), have disagreed with the reserve price, and have called for a downward review to enable more operators participate in the 3.5GHz auction process.\n\nThe NCC at a stakeholders\u2019 consultative forum, held in Lagos yesterday, presented the dissenting positions of the operators and the GSMA, which they had earlier submitted to the commission.\n\nThe stakeholders\u2019 consultative forum, which was organised by the NCC further discussed the reserve price, among other issues such as longevity of the spectrum licence, the auction process, the requirements and rollout obligations.\n\nWhile the NCC was considering 10 years period for the duration of the spectrum, the operators want the NCC to extend it to 20 years, to enable winners of the spectrum to have enough rollout time to utilise the spectrum in offering telecoms services to subscribers.\n\nReacting to the N75 billion reserve price, telecoms operators, which included MTN, Airtel, Huawei, Intelsat, including the GSMA, called on NCC, to consider the current exchange rate in pegging the reserve price.\n\nThey argued that if the reserve price remained high, it would discourage operators from participating in the auction process.\n\nThe Director, Spectrum Administration at NCC, Oluwatoyin Asaju, who presented the draft IM for the 3.5GHz spectrum auction at the stakeholders\u2019 consultative forum said: \u201cThe IM provides guidance and process that the commission has decided to adopt for the licensing of the 3.5 GHz band, including details of the spectrum to be made available, the pre-qualification process and the auction process.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the 3.5GHz spectrum would come in five lots of 100 MHz each, to be cleared at different periods depending on the level of encumbrances on the slots.\n\nHe, however, said for the purpose of the auction, only two lots of 100 MHz each would be offered in the first phase of the auction, while the remaining three lots would be auctioned some other time.\n\nFor the auction process, Asaju explained that it would be Ascending Clock Auction (ACA), while the auction would be software based.\n\nHe said provisions had been made for manual auction should the auction software fail during the auction process, adding that there would be a mock auction that would precede the main auction on December 13.\n\n\u201cA reserve price of approximately N75 billion, equivalent to $197,400,000.00, will to be used. An Initial Bid Deposit (IBD) equal to 10 per cent of the reserve price is adopted in line with the previous auction.\n\n\u201cNew entrants are allowed to participate in the auction in addition to existing licensees and only licensees with 100 per cent regulatory compliance will be allowed to participate in the auction.\n\n\u201cThe auction comes with a 10-year spectrum licence and a minimum requirement of a UASL Operational Licence. New entrants or licensees without a UASL will be required to additionally obtain a UASL Operational Licence,\u201d Asaju said.\n\nFor the rollout obligations, he said operators would in the first two years, starting from the effective date of the licence, roll out service in at least one state in each geo-political zone, including federal capital territory, and in additional six states after the five years.\n\nThe Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ibrahim Pantami, in his keynote address, said the planned 3.5GHz spectrum auction was another milestone in the desire of the federal government to roll out 5G network in the country as quickly as possible.\n\nPantami who was represented by a director in the ministry, Mr. Abubakar Abdullahi Ladan, said: \u201cThe 3.5GHz spectrum band (the lower C-band), which is not effective in satellite operations, has been recovered from NIGCOMSAT and reallocated to the NCC in the first instance, for deployment of 5G technology based on terms and conditions agreed by both parties.\n\n\u201cThe next step is auctioning of the spectrum which is under the purview of the regulator of the industry. However, for transparency and accountability in the sale of this common national heritage, the federal government thought it wise to involve relevant stakeholders in the process so that the general public is carried along.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of this gathering therefore, is to discuss the Information Memorandum on the Auction of this 3.5GHz Spectrum Band allocated for deployment of 5G network in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe Executive Vice Chairman of NCC, Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta, in his speech, said: \u201c5G technology does not only offer enhanced broadband and ultra-reliable low/latency communications, it also provides massive machine type communications, where lots of devices will seamlessly connect and interact independently with the Internet without human intervention.\n\n\u201cGiven the importance of 5G technology and the critical role of spectrum, the International Telecommunications Union Radio Communication Sector (ITU-R) conducted studies in its last two study cycles during the World Radio Communication Conferences of 2015 and 2019 (WRC-15 & WRC-19) and identified spectrum for 5G technology including the 3.5GHz band, which stands out due to its excellent propagation characteristics which offer both capacity and coverage.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Flags to fly at half mast\n\n*Inaugurates tribunal\n\n*Death toll rises to 38, developer\u2019s body found\n\n*Emergency teams ramp up recovery operation\n\nSegun James\n\nGovernor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has declared three days of mourning in Lagos State over the Ikoyi building collapse tragedy which occurred on Monday.\n\nThis is just as he has inaugurated the investigation tribunal that would conduct an inquiry into what was responsible for the collapse of the 21-storey structure that was still under construction on Gerrard Road, Ikoyi. Reports late yesterday indicated that the body of the property developer, Femi Osibona had been pulled from the rubble while that of his friend, Wale Bob-Oseni, is yet to be recovered.\n\nBob-Oseni, who was to catch a flight to the US, briefly made a detour to see the project on the invitation of the developer but did not walk out alive.\n\nAs at the time of going to press, nine people were rescued, 38 have been confirmed dead\n\nThe Governor said all flags are to be flown at half-mast in public and private buildings and official engagements cancelled during the mourning period.\n\nThe Lagos State Government in a statement signed by Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr. Gbenga Omotoso commiserated with all those who lost their loved ones in the unfortunate incident.\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cGovernor Sanwo-Olu has visited the site thrice to encourage the rescuers and console relations of those who are believed to have been trapped in the 21-storey building. \u201cHe was today at the hospital to cheer up those injured before swearing in a six-man panel of Inquiry to find out why the building went down and recommend measures to prevent such incidents.\u201d\n\nThe governor who inaugurated the six-man panel of enquiry also signed the instrument legitimising the composition of the panel empowering the tribunal to invite or summon anyone and organisation useful to the investigation.\n\nMembers of the tribunal, who were totally drawn from the private sector, took the oath at the event held in the LASWA Building at Falomo, Ikoyi.\n\n\u201cTheir duty begins immediately and they are expected to report back within four weeks,\u201d the statement added.\n\nPresident of Nigeria Institute of Town Planners (NITP), Mr. Toyin Ayinde, is the chairman of the panel, while Ekundayo Onajobi, a lawyer in a private law firm, is the Secretary.\n\nOther panel members are a structural engineer, Dr. Akintilo Idris Adeleke; an architect, Yinka Ogundairo; representative of Institute of Builders, Mr. Godfrey O. Godfrey, and Mrs. Bunmi Ibrahim, a real estate lawyer.\n\nSanwo-Olu, who described the event as a \u201csad one\u201d for Lagos was visibly in a sombre mood during the inauguration.\n\nThe governor said members of the public deserved to know what went wrong.\n\nHe stressed that the work of the panel would not bring back the lives lost, but added that it would help to prevent reoccurrence of such tragic events.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are gathered here to perform a sad but necessary duty, which is the inauguration of a 6-member Panel of Inquiry into the collapse of the 21-storey building at Gerrard Road, Ikoyi, on Monday. It is a solemn moment for me personally, but this is an important assignment. Indeed, the generation coming after will not forgive us if we don\u2019t do the right thing on this incident.\n\n\u201cThe inauguration of this panel shows sincerely that the state government is interested in unravelling and get to the root cause of what happened to the building, so that everyone concerned, including the government, will learn from the very unfortunate incident.\n\n\u201cLagosians and the world will be watching and waiting keenly, with the full expectation that the immediate and remote causes of this tragedy will be uncovered,\u201d he added.\n\nSanwo-Olu identified with distraught families of victims trapped under the collapsed structure, expressing the belief that the outcome of the investigation would assuage their pains and worries.\n\nThe oath taken by the tribunal members, the governor said, empowers them with adequate privileges of government powers to conduct independent investigation without fear, favour, interference and restrictions.\n\nThe governor believed the tribunal members would bring their expertise and professionalism to bear in unravelling the infractions that brought down the building.\n\n\u201cWhat this tribunal will be doing over the course of the next few weeks will have important implications for building safety and for emergency response, not just in Lagos, but in the entire country.\n\n\u201cIt will also go a long way towards ensuring that the families of the innocent victims of this avoidable tragedy experience some sort of closure and get justice,\u201d Sanwo-Olu said.\n\nAyinde said Lagos was in its \u201cdark period\u201d, given the record of fatalities from the site of the building collapse.\n\nHe pledged on behalf of members to discharge the duty with all sense of responsibility and in line with ethics.\n\n\u201cWe accept at our own liberty and with humility the important assignment the State has placed before us. We will go ahead with a sense of dedicated responsibility. This exercise can only make the expected difference if we all agree to place value on Nigerian life.\n\n\u201cAs members, we promise to be guided by professional standards and hope that we will chart a new course that will guarantee the safety of lives of Nigeria citizens,\u201d Ayinde said.\n\nFor the third time within 72 hours, Babajide Sanwo-Olu was at the site of the Ikoyi building collapse to see how the search and recovery operation was being conducted, and also to boost the morale of the emergency responders on site.\n\nThe governor expressed satisfaction with the rescue operation, commending the first responders for their efforts. He also met with some of the distressed family members at the site, cheering them and raising their hopes, while the rescue efforts progressed.\n\nSanwo-Olu was in company of his deputy, Dr. Obafemi Hamzat, at the site for over three hours.\n\nThe actual number of persons still trapped in the collapsed building remained unclear as at Thursday afternoon.\n\nSanwo-Olu, while giving an update to the press, disclosed that family members had submitted 19 names of those still missing, saying the ongoing corona inquest on the bodies evacuated from the site was expected to be concluded today (Friday), after which families would be invited to identify them.\n\nHe said: \u201cYesterday (Wednesday), we opened a register for people that have missing persons or loved ones whom they believed must have been at the site before the collapse.\n\n\u201cAs I speak here, it is only 19 names of missing persons that have been registered. Some of them have pictures, others do not. This list would help us to get information on manifest of those at the site.\n\n\u201cAs at this afternoon, we have recovered a total of 32 bodies. We are conducting a corona inquest on the bodies and by tomorrow (Friday), we hope the exercise would have been concluded. That is the deadline we gave to the corona, so that the families can come and identify the bodies recovered so far.\u201d\n\nEarlier on Thursday, the Governor visited Lagos Island General Hospital where survivors of the building collapse are being given medical attention.\n\nOne of the nine people rescued alive, Sanwo-Olu said, has been moved to the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH) in Ikeja for advanced medical examination, \u201cbut he is not in a life-threatening situation.\u201d\n\nThree survivors were discharged two days ago, he disclosed.\n\nThe governor said he had ordered structural integrity test on two high-rise structures in the premises where the 21-storey collapsed. The action, he said, was necessary to safeguard the lives of emergency workers on the rescue operation.\n\nSanwo-Olu appealed to journalists covering the incident on speculative reporting and sensationalism, asking them to confirm any unclear details about the search and rescue operation from the official channel of communication. The governor was reacting to inconsistent figures of fatality being spread by the media.\n\nHe said: \u201cMinistries of Information, Special Duties and Health are fully on ground at the scene. Among these key ministries, members of the public can get answers to any information not clear to them.\u201d\n\nThe multi-sectoral search and rescue operation was ongoing as at press time. The effort was being led by teams of Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA) and National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), with the support of construction giants, Julius Berger, Craneburg, HiTech and China Civil Engineering Construction Company (CCECC).\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "President Donald J. Trump\u2019s Concession Speech, By Rudolf Okonkwo",
          "text": "Fellow Americans,\n\nNobody knows the joy of winning better than I do, believe me. I have always been a winner for as long as I can remember. Okay? Nobody knows the beauty of fighting to win better than I do. I am always a fighter and when I fight, I win. Everybody knows that.\n\nI have reached the very top. Absolutely. And I reached the top at a very tremendous speed. You all know it. The first time I ran for office, I ran for president. It was beautiful. Right? What usually takes great men three attempts before they get a win, I won in a landslide the very first time I ran. I heard that it has never been done anywhere else in the world.\n\nIn the last four years, I have accomplished for America things that presidents that were in office for twelve years did not accomplish. It is not even close. I made America a big-league winner again. I put billions and billions of dollars into your pockets through my amazing tax cuts. I have shown you that everything is possible if you have the right man to do the right job. Everybody is saying so.\n\nAll over the world, there is huge respect for America again, in some cases, even massive fear. Bigly! Which is good. I made it happen. Nobody messes with America because I highly insisted on it. I placed America first, which is fair. I stopped those out of control dope and overrated countries that get away with murder at the expense of America. It didn\u2019t happen again. Not on my watch! I was tough so that America would be triumphant.\n\nThe world had never seen anything like that before.\n\nBecause of me, the next generation of Americans will grow up knowing that America is the greatest nation on earth, full of courageous men like me. Thanks to me, they will grow up knowing that ours is a Christian nation where it is allowed to say Merry Christmas. Our children and grandchildren will grow up knowing that the whole world is out there for them to dominate and not bow to the sissies who think that we must worship the environment at the expense of the staggering economy that I built.\n\nFrankly, I have done everything that I set out to do \u2013 most of which were things that have never been done before. I have in place the greatest military that humans ever assembled for our incredible men and women in uniform. I assembled it in just four years by rebuilding our powerful military that they destroyed due to neglect and incompetence. I secured America from coast to coast with walls and wires, cages and visa bans. I took care of it, just as I promised I would do. I returned America under God. Before I came, they had taken America to the shrines of the devil.\n\nAmericans love me because of these outstanding accomplishments. I have seen it on the faces of fabulous Americans while I travelled around the country in the last few weeks.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, I could stay around and fight. And it is a fight that I know that I will win. But I have decided not to. There is no point.\n\nI believe that I have nothing else left to prove. My achievements will be around till the end of time. I won\u2019t be surprised if, by January 20, 2021, my face would go up on Mount Rushmore to join other presidents of my calibre. It won\u2019t surprise me one bit. People think it is going to happen.\n\nTo all my special supporters, I say thank you for the unbelievable fantastic ride. Don\u2019t despair, for I will send you a brilliant comforter. Those stupid little lightweights on the other side who have no clue may taunt you. When those clowns do, remind the goofy and crooked losers that I made America great again. Tell those terrible lowlifes that they have proved themselves unworthy of Donald Trump\u2019s genius and have opted to reduce America to a Second Class nation in the world. Total Disaster!\n\nSo, my fellow American, I bide you all farewell. May God bless you, and my God bless the United States of America.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump\n\nThe 45th President of the United States.",

          "title": "The Teflon President With Nine Lives Is On His Way Out By Dr. Wumi Akintide",
          "text": "You probably know who I am talking about. The Teflon President with nine lives I have in mind is nobody else but Donald J. Trump. Can any of you reading this write-up imagine Barack Obama, who twice won the popular vote and the Electoral College tallies and who spent 8 good years in the White House without a single scandal, being described as a cat with 9 lives?\n\nNot by a long shot. The answer to the rhetorical question has to be a resounding no. Poor Obama as President of the United States would long have been skinned alive and sacrificed to the gods by the Republicans who obstructed him every step of the way during all of his 8 years in the White House all in the name of partisan politics.\n\nYou would have thought they would have left him off the hook the moment he left office, but Republicans and their Narcissist-in-Chief in the White House have not left Obama alone for one brief moment. In fact, the grossly ignorant and incompetent lunatic in the White House still finds some ways to blame Obama or Hillary even for some of his own insanity or foolishness while fraudulently claiming to be the smartest President America has ever put in office.\n\nWhat is so offensive is that the hypocrites in his Republican base are buying the garbage and defending the impossible because all they care about is supporting the man who is going to put money in their pockets because his greatest motivation for seeking the Presidency is to make money and to make his family and few friends so rich that they would kill to have him removed from office, should it come to that. America under Trump is no longer the America we used to know and the Republican Party has become a den of thieves and sexual predators that have lost their moral compass as a major political party in God\u2019s own country.\n\nIn cahoots with Trump, Republicans have not ended their campaign of calumny to humiliate, blackmail and delegitimize Barack Obama, the first black President.\n\nEven though the White House was built with slave labor, as widely documented by historians, no black man was ever expected to live in that majestic building that the arrogant Donald Trump, in one of his craziest moments, has described as a \u201cdump.\u201d\n\nThe guy is just too arrogant to admit that the Obama couple was far superior to him and his Melania in intellect and education. Barack earned his education from Columbia and Harvard while Michelle earned her own from Princeton and Harvard.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t get any better than that for any American President dead or alive but the \u201cC\u201d average student from an undergraduate business program would tell you he is the smartest dude in the universe who never makes a mistake or regrets anything. He sounds to me like a reincarnated Adolf Hitler who told the Anglo-Saxons they were the most superior white race in the world who must dominate the world. Donald Trump is pretty much preaching the same doctrine today. His latest unilateral announcement to make Jerusalem the undivided capital of the Zionist Regime without consultation with any of America\u2019s traditional allies is tantamount to suicide and a move that will go down in infamy, to quote the immortal words of Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\nDonald Trump once boasted that he was far more experienced than all of the American generals combined. He is therefore seeking to invalidate or demolish anything the first black President had ever done during his 8 glorious years in the White House.\n\nThe one-term young Senator from Illinois was elected President in 2008 and re-elected again in 2012 with a wider margin. He turned around the American economy while reducing unemployment in America to the lowest it had ever been in 20 years. He killed Osama Bin Laden and he passed into law the Affordable Health Care Reform Law that offered medical insurance coverage to 46 million Americans with the stroke of his pen.\n\nThe Teflon outlaw with 9 lives came to town promising to undo everything Obama has done while promising to \u201cmake America great again,\u201d as if America has ever at any time lost her greatness following the end of the Second World War. Nothing could be farther from the truth, but his Republican base and some charlatans in the party are buying the cheap blackmail from a delusional outlaw in the White House.\n\nEven though Trump had lost the popular vote by 3 million votes to Hillary Clinton, he still managed to ride on the coattails of Vladimir Putin and the KGB to put himself in the White House against the better judgment of the 65 million Americans who voted for his opponent.\n\nMy point is that if Barack Obama had committed just a fraction of the crimes and violations of the norms of decency that Donald Trump has committed less than one year into his Presidency, Obama would long have been thrown out of office and sent to jail and Republicans in their hypocrisy and racism would have made that a justification to bar any colored person from ever aspiring to be President again.\n\nIi is Donald Trump that I call the Houdini of American Politics for how and why he has survived up to this moment despite all of the atrocities he has committed as a candidate and now as President for close to one year.\n\nIf Barack Obama had uttered half the statements credited to Donald Trump, he would never have secured the nomination of the Democratic Party in 2008 and would have been ostracized for life.\n\nI seek your indulgence to go back to memory lane to remind some of the fans of this column about the America we used to know before crazy Donald Trump showed up. Eagleton was dropped from nomination as running mate due to a history of mental health illness. Spiro Agnew, Vice President to Richard Nixon, was defrocked for tax evasion and fraud. Joseph Biden was forced to drop out of his Presidential bid at a point in his career because he was found guilty of plagiarism in one of his stump speeches - he lifted a quotation from Neil Kinnock, a Labour Party leader in Britain without acknowledging his source.\n\nGerald Ford lost to Jimmy Carter in 1976 in large part because he pardoned Richard Nixon, an unconvicted felon, for obstruction of justice and for displaying ignorance when he stated in one of his debates with Jimmy Carter that the now-defunct Soviet Union did not dominate Eastern Europe.\n\nGeorge Bush lost to Bill Clinton for going back on his \u201cread my lips\u201d pledge not to increase taxes. The voters concluded he had told a lie even though he was one of the most honorable and dependable men of honor ever to serve as American President.\n\nI gave all of these examples to show how Donald Trump would appear to have completely changed all the rules of the game for anyone who will be President in America. Republicans nominated a man who has had more than 4000 litigations against him in the Court of Law, most of those litigations he had to settle out of Court because he was too embarrassed to let them go forward.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man who falsely tried to delegitimize the man he was going to replace by claiming Obama was not born in America. Republicans nominated a man whose Trump Plaza Building in New York was already known to be the money laundering capital of the world.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man who claimed he loved to sexually assault women by \u201cgrabbing their pussies\u201d because they allowed him to commit the crime because he was a star who could get away with murder. He actually gloated that his supporters would still vote for him even if he had shot and killed a man on 5th Avenue in broad daylight in Manhattan. Republicans nominated and elected a pathological liar who is never ashamed to blackmail his opponents by calling them names and insulting them and getting away with everything.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man whose financial and business record with American banks and financial houses across the board were so bad that no American Bank was willing to do business with him because he had swindled them time and again. Republicans nominated and elected a man who had been divorced three times and who has filed for Bankruptcy more than five times and a man who has bluntly refused to submit his tax returns for public scrutiny because he has managed to avoid paying taxes for more than 20 years.\n\nRepublicans nominated and elected a con artist who is not afraid to lie his way out of every problem and a man who has openly tried to undermine NATO and many of the time-honored agreements all of his predecessors in the White House had committed to for more than 70 years.\n\nThey elected a hoodlum who openly colluded or conspired with the KGB while openly casting aspersion on the credibility of the American CIA and FBI. Republicans elected a man who wants to repeat Harry Truman\u2019s mistake by becoming the second American President to deploy or detonate the nuclear bomb, this time on North Korea.\n\nRepublicans have elected a man who openly emulates and praises dictators like Vladimir Putin. He made it clear he would want to be like them if he had his way. Republicans elected a man who tweets in the early hours of the morning and who has used tweeting as an instrument of policies and presidential orders. They elected a man who on Wednesday made good on his promise destroy the last vestiges of the Camp David Accord by unilaterally moving the capital of Israel to divide Jerusalem, thereby stroking the embers of fire and fury in the Middle East. Republicans have elected a man who has made his inexperienced son-in-law, Jared Kushner, the de facto Secretary of State to the United States through the backdoor.\n\nThe list goes on and on without end but Donald Trump is still there despite an abysmal approval opinion of only 33 percent or less. Republicans elected a man who has claimed that his own opinion or decision is all that counts and who has proclaimed most institutions of the fourth estate of the realm as \u201cfake news\u201d disseminators.\n\nHe has pointed accusing fingers at networks like CNN and print media like the highly respected New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, to mention a few.\n\nWhat atrocity, in less than one year in office, has this President not already committed? The list is inexhaustible. The greatest loser in this entire saga has to be the Republican Party and the clear winner has to be Vladimir Putin who now has the American President in his pocket and dictating to him what he must do or not do. Whoever thought that the whole world is going to turn 180 degrees for America and that Donald Trump is on his way to becoming the Mikhail Gorbachev of American Politics right under our eyes, and Americans appear totally helpless and clueless to do something about it.\n\nIt is a complete outrage and totally incredible!\n\nI rest my case.\n\nDr. Wumi Akintide",

          "text": "This article was contributed to TechCabal by Conrad Onyango/bird\n\nSupport for small businesses keen to trade across the continent\u2019s single market is being eyed as a potentially lucrative market by more and more African fintech startups.\n\nAfrica\u2019s fintech startups are rapidly expanding beyond their host countries\u2019 borders to tap into the anticipated surge in trade and investments with the opening up of the world\u2019s largest single market, the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).\n\nSurge in intra-continental expansion\n\nIn the last month alone, a number of startups have either raised growth funds, acquired another player present in regional markets within the same vertical, or tapped top talent in the telecoms industry. Their intention appears to be the targeting of small industries and traders seeking cross-border opportunities in new African markets.\n\nKenyan based Asante Financial Services Group, focused on supporting the growth of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME\u2019s), has raised 7.5 million US dollars in series A funding to scale business credit offering to small businesses in Kenya and Uganda access to new markets across Africa.\n\n\u201cThe investment enables Asante to scale its credit offerings to the underserved segment of MSMEs in Kenya and Uganda, and expand to Nigeria and Rwanda,\u201d the start-up said in a statement.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nTala, with African Operations in Kenya, Nigeria and Tanzania has begun a \u2018Rebuild Fund Business Program\u2019 targeting Kenya\u2019s hard-hit micro, small and medium-sized enterprises it say will help them build back better post-COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe program comes barely a month after Tala raised 145 million dollars in equity, hinting that part of the growth funds would go toward supporting its geographical expansion.\n\nThe World Bank puts the annual SME credit gap in Sub Saharan Africa at about 330 million US dollars, with traditional \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d lenders turning a blind eye to small traders on account of lack of \u2013 among others \u2013 collateral, high costs of due diligence, customer acquisition, distribution and servicing.\n\n\u201cMSMEs\u2014particularly those in the informal sector\u2014are being held back by a lack of responsible lending from traditional financial services providers who are unable to run accurate credit checks and offer profitable loans to this segment of the market,\u201d said Bitta Wycliffe, Senior Investment Associate at Goodwell Investments.\n\nPan-Africa fintech firm, MFS Africa is also making inroads in Nigeria through the acquisition of Baxi, a Nigerian start-up with a 90,000-agent network. The October move gives Nigerian SME\u2019s listed on Baxi access to MFS Africa\u2019s multiple mobile money payment wallets, currently serving up to 320 million customers in more than 35 African countries.\n\nAnother Pan-African fintech venture, Yabx, with a presence in 12 African countries recently tapped a telecoms industry expert with over 15 years in experience as a new director for its business.\n\nEunice R.

          "text": "There\u2019s a new exciting trend in the African tech ecosystem: African founders backing fellow founders especially in pre-seed and seed funding, which is an indication that the African tech ecosystem is maturing.\n\nOn Wednesday, Payhippo, a fintech startup providing capital for small businesses in Nigeria, was another example of the existence of this trend when it announced that it has closed $3 million in seed funding led by a number of African tech founders.\n\nThe round was led by Ham Serunjogi and Maijid Moujaled, co-founders Chipper Cash; Olugbenga \u201cGB\u201d Agboola, founder Flutterwave; Bolaji Balogun, CEO Chapel Hill Denham; and Hakeem Belo-Osagie, founder Metis Capital Partners.\n\nAngel investors from Paystack, Brex and Tala also participated in the round. TEN13, VentureSouq, and Prodigio Capital were the only institutional ventures that wrote a check for this round.\n\nThis investment comes barely 5 months after the startup raised a $1 million institutional pre-seed. Besides the earlier undisclosed capital raised from friends and family, the company\u2019s total fundraised is now at $4 million.\n\nCapital is a lifeline of business\n\nThere are over 40 million small and medium businesses (SMEs) in Nigeria. These businesses account for 96% of its total companies, 84% of employment, and 48% of the national GDP. But only a few of these businesses have access to capital, mostly due to heavy collateral requirements and long time of loan processing.\n\nPayhippo is at the forefront of solving this problem. Founded by Zach Bijesse, CEO, Chioma Okotcha, COO, and Uche Nnadi, CTO, Payhippo provides small businesses with short-term working capital with average loan amounts of $1300. The company also allows SMEs to build their credit score based on their track record of repaying their loans on time. SMEs even become eligible for higher amounts of capital as their credit score goes up.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIf capital is a lifeline of a business, then it\u2019s safe to say Payhippo is guarding the lifeline of Nigerian SMEs.\n\n\u201cThis funding will allow us to invest in hiring more engineers and data scientists. We aim to improve our technology and enhance our lending offerings as we continue to address the persistent financing gap for small businesses in Nigeria,\u201d Okotcha, COO at Payhippo, said. \u201cAt Payhippo, our vision is to provide millions of small businesses with sufficient and available capital to run and grow their businesses.\u201d\n\nThe company said it has disbursed 5000 loans to SMEs since it launched in January 2020. In September 2021, the Payhippo reportedly earned $64,000 in revenue from $900,000 disbursed, experiencing 25% monthly growth with a 97% repayment rate on loans.\n\nCommenting on his investment in Payhippo, Bolaji Balogun, founder/CEO at Chapel Hill Denham said: \u201cWe\u2019re excited at how Payhippo is using technology to provide SMEs in Africa with access to finance required to run their business needs. By lending to small businesses, Payhippo is allowing business owners access to much-needed working capital to grow their businesses and create jobs in the economy.\u201d\n\nFor Serunjogi and Moujaled, the two co-founders of Chipper Cash, the African fintech which attained a unicorn status on Tuesday, they are bullish on supporting new financial technologies being developed and implemented to change the competitive landscape in the financial sector in Africa.\n\n\u201cAccess to credit is a critical necessity for small businesses to manage their daily challenges. Payhippo helps address this need through its innovative approach that provides loans to small businesses in less than three hours, enabling them to access sufficient working capital to grow.\u201d Serunjogi said.\n\nPayhippo plans to use the new funding to improve its technology capabilities and expand its talent pool.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "When Chipper Cash, an African cross-border payment company, raised $100 million Series C funding in May this year, the CEO, Ham Serunjogi, without declaring the startup\u2019s current valuation said the company is the most valuable startup in Africa. That sparked a lot of mixed reactions in the ecosystem.\n\nFive months later, it looks like Serunjogi\u2019s claim might not have been far from the truth as today, Chipper Cash announced the extension of its series C and raised $150 million at a valuation little over $2 billion. The investment was led by FTX, the most valuable crypto derivatives exchange company owned by the youngest billionaire in the world, Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nWith a valuation of over $2 billion, Chipper Cash has now attained a unicorn status. It joins the ranks of Nigeria\u2019s Interswitch, Flutterwave and Opay, Egypt\u2019s Fawry, Pan-African Andela, and Senegal\u2019s Wave, as the seventh African unicorn.\n\nFounded by Serunjogi and Maijid Moujaled in 2018 to offer free cross-border payment service in Africa via a mobile app, Chipper Cash operates in seven African countries \u2014 Ghana, Uganda, Nigeria, Tanzania, Rwanda, South Africa and Kenya. In May, after the initial $100 million series C round, the company expanded into the UK to power UK to Africa peer-to-peer remittance.\n\nLast month, the startup also entered the competitive U.S market and it\u2019s reported to have started the U.S to Africa remittance in Nigeria and Uganda, with more countries to be added soon. The company also plans to start Africa to U.S remittance in South Africa, Uganda and Ghana next year.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nEarlier this year, Chipper Cash forayed into social payments by partnering with Twitter to offer payment for the social media platform\u2019s Tip Jar feature for African users. The Tip Jar feature was launched early this year to allow Twitter users receive money \u201ctip\u201d directly on the platform.\n\nChipper Cash is FTX\u2019s first investment in Africa. A move that hints that FTX is impressed by how Chipper Cash has been able to scale in the space of three years and its interest in the crypto space. Chipper Cash boasts of having over 4 million users across the world.\n\nThe investment will see FTX partner with Chipper Cash to make money transfer as simple as a text message and accelerate the adoption of crypto within Africa and beyond.\n\n\u201cDespite the recent growth in Africa, moving money across the continent is still slow and expensive. Unsurprisingly it is the fastest growing market with grassroots crypto adoption,\u201d Bankman-Fried, FTX CEO, told TechCrunch.\n\nAs a result of this partnership, FTX will increase its footprint in Africa and Chipper Cash will be integrated into the FTX product so that African users can fund their crypto wallet through Chipper Cash.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to be a compelling use case for both of our companies as we keep scaling and as FTX keeps scaling their geographical coverage. They do some of the most innovative work in the crypto space, so working with them is going to be quite exciting,\u201d Serunjogi said.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu Author @tarykuh",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi there,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nMusic and blockchain\n\nFunding rounds in Egypt\n\nPayhippo\u2019s $3m seed\n\nOpibus\u2019s $7.5m funding\n\nNFTs and music\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NFT market keeps growing. According to DappRader, $10.7 billion had traded hands by the end of Q3 2021.\n\nArts and collectibles continue to be a big deal in the market, allowing artistes to monetise their craft.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, NFTs come in other forms besides art, and one of them is music.\n\nAccording to Statista, NFT music sales in March 2021 reached $26.7 million, a small number, given that a single art NFT sold for $69 million.\n\nHowever, rapper turned music label owner, Henry Coco-Bassey sees the potential in musical NFT and tells the story that led to the sale of Africa\u2019s first music NFT.\n\nYou can read it here: Blockchain meets music: How music label owner promotes artistes and sells their music as NFTs\n\nCloudy with a chance of funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s raining funds in Egypt; three Egyptian startups \u2014 Breadfast, Bypa-ss, and Appetito \u2014 have announced some big cheques. Let\u2019s meet them.\n\nBreadfast: I know someone that\u2019ll get a craving for bread, hearing the name of this startup. However, this is not a bread-tech startup; it is an Egyptian grocery delivery company that has just raised $26 million in a Series A round.\n\nThe round was co-led by Vostok New Ventures and Endure Capital. Other participants include JAM Fund and Abudawood Group.\n\nWhile it might not be a bread-tech startup, it started as a bakery back in 2017. According to Mostafa Amin, Co-founder and CEO, \u201cWe started out baking and delivering fresh bread, and today we are able to give Egyptians access to thousands of items of their basic supermarket supplies at the click of a button.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe startup now offers scheduled and on-demand delivery of over 2,500 supermarket items via its app.\n\nBypa-ss: Away from bread and groceries, Egyptian healthtech startup, Bypa-ss has raised $1 million in a pre-seed round.\n\nPer TechCrunch, investors include MAGIC Fund and Launch Africa. Founded in 2019 by Andrew Saad, the startup provides easy and rapid access to a patient\u2019s medical history via its flagship product, HealthTag.\n\nSaad got the idea for the company back in medical school. A patient needed medication, but doctors were hesitant to administer any medicine because medical records for the patient weren\u2019t available.\n\nThe funding will help Bypa-ss expand its customer base and increase its network of over 3000 healthcare providers.\n\nAppetito: Now, let\u2019s go back to groceries and eCommerce, a sector that\u2019s been getting some attention in Egypt lately.\n\nBreadfast isn\u2019t the only grocery delivery startup getting an avalanche of cash in this funding storm. Appetito also joined the party, bagging $2 million in a pre-Series A funding round.\n\nAppetito, which launched in 2017, delivers fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) directly to customers. While its model might seem similar to Breadfast, Appetito is more concerned with offering affordable services.\n\nThe startup\u2019s CEO, Shehab Mokhtar, told TechCrunch that the company is \u201ctrying to provide customers not only with a convenient experience but also an affordable one by sourcing the products directly from the manufacturers and selling them directly to them.\u201d\n\nHe says the company is trying to mix convenience and affordability, saying that while 10 to 15-minute delivery sounds good, it comes at a high price. Appetito, on the other hand, completes deliveries within an hour or the next day at an affordable price.\n\nPayhippo raises $3m seed funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPayhippo co-founders: L-R: Zach Bijesse (CEO), Chioma Okotcha (COO), and Uche Nnadi (CTO). Source: Supplied\n\nNigerian fintech startup, Payhippo, has closed a $3 million seed funding round.\n\nPer TechCrunch, the round saw funding from angel investors, including Gbenga \u2018GB\u2019 Agboola, Flutterwave CEO, and Ham Serunjogi and Maijid Moujaled, Chipper Cash Co-founders.\n\nFounded in 2020, the startup\u2019s goal is to provide African small businesses access to finance while helping them to build their credit history.\n\nThe lending and business financing platform also got accepted into Y Combinator\u2019s Summer 2021 cohort in August and closed a $1 million pre-seed round back in July 2021.\n\nAccording to PwC, the financing gap for Nigerian MSMEs is \u20a6617.3 billion ($1.59 billion) annually, and less than 5% of them have access to adequate credit facilities.\n\nConsidering small businesses contribute 48% of Nigeria\u2019s GDP, their importance cannot be overestimated, hence the need for adequate financing.\n\nSpeaking to TechCrunch, Chioma Okotcha, Payhippo Co-founder and COO, says the startup wants to disburse at least 40,000 loans a day, 1% of Nigeria\u2019s 40 million SMEs.\n\nThe fund will go into hiring more talents so that it can provide credit to more SMEs rapidly.\n\nOpibus, electric mobility company, gets $7.5m funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn November 2, 2021, Swedish-Kenyan technology company, Opibus received $7.5 million in funding from investors, including At One Ventures and Ambo Ventures. $5 million in equity and $2.5 million in grants make up this financing.\n\nThe company produces heavy-duty electric vehicles (EVs) such as buses and trucks by converting petrol and diesel-based vehicles into electric, reducing cost and, in a way recycling older vehicles.\n\nOpibus has been manufacturing EVs since 2017, intending to make electric vehicles affordable in Africa.\n\nAccording to Filip Gardler, Opibus CEO, \u201cWe have together reached a clear strategic and visionary alignment \u2013 with the conviction that mass manufacturing of electric mobility solutions in Africa will not only make the products more accessible and affordable but also lead to one of the largest industrialisation and welfare transitions of the region in modern time.\u201d\n\nManufacturing electric vehicles or hardware production isn\u2019t a space filled with many African startups.\n\nHowever, we still have the likes of Jet Motor Company that announced a $9 million funding in 2020, Siltech, and Ampersand playing in the space.\n\nWith the road being the most dominant means of transportation in Africa, accounting for 90% of passenger traffic, EVs have a huge addressable market. However, the high cost of production is still a significant entry barrier.\n\nWhat I\u2019m watching\n\nNigeria to the world: Why it took Affiong Williams 9 years to raise $3m for ReelFruit.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s okay to think non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are overhyped. It seems almost everyone on Twitter has added the suffix \u201c.eth\u201d to their username.\n\nBut when you observe the amount of money exchanging hands in the NFT market, you might understand why everyone wants to get in on the action.\n\nData from NonFungible shows that in Q1 2021, more than $2 billion was traded in NFTs. Recent data by DappRader reveals that number surged to $10.7 billion in Q3, representing a 38,060% increase year-over-year.\n\nIt\u2019s fascinating; billions have traded hands in exchange for virtual kittens and images of anthropomorphised apes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile art is popular with NFTs, it can take several other forms, one of which is music.\n\nNFT untapped\n\nThe rarity of musical NFTs in Africa is one of the reasons that led Henry Coco-Bassey \u2014 popularly known as Hector \u2014 musician turned label owner, to enter the NFT space, where he\u2019s making not only money but some pretty exciting discoveries.\n\nRecounting when he discovered NFTs, he said, \u201cI started seeing NFTs in the news, a way you could take your creativity and turn it into a digital asset and earn in crypto. It was interesting, and I was like, \u2018I need to know more about this.'\u201d\n\nHector the rapper\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHenry Coco-Bassey aka Hector\n\nHector\u2019s love for music is huge, and while this might come off as an NFT story, it is more of a music story.\n\nAs a child, he sang everywhere \u2014 school, church, and especially in the shower.\n\nWhile he loved music generally, he was captivated by rap.\n\n\u201cI started falling in love with rap music when I was young because my dad used to play Tupac all the time.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Tupac Shakur\u2019s politically charged music, his love for rap was also deepened by the satiric and controversial American animated series, The Boondocks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt made sense for Hector to join the church choir \u2014 a place to create or at least participate in creating what he loved. He tried to infuse rap into church music, but that didn\u2019t fly with the church folk. From what he told me, the idea of rapping in the church was equivalent to or worse than lighting a cigarette at the altar.\n\nBut, he didn\u2019t give up on rap. He released his first song before getting into the university and kept making music till he graduated, but he wasn\u2019t satisfied with the earnings he made from music.\n\n\u201cWhen I finished school, I was like, \u2018I can\u2019t be doing music anymore.\u2019 I didn\u2019t like the fact that I put out music and I didn\u2019t earn. I recorded my last song with another rapper from Colorado, US. It was the first song I had on TuneCore and other platforms, so I made some money from it after a couple of months.\u201d\n\nHector\u2019s decision to stop making music didn\u2019t mean he was done with it; as I said, he loved it. So, the proceeds from his final record went into learning about the music business.\n\nAfter much thought, he told himself, \u201cI could be a music agent, helping other artistes that don\u2019t really know how to put out their music. So I started learning and exploring.\u201d\n\nHector spent a long time on the Internet trying to figure out the music business. \u201cI was on YouTube every night,\u201d he laughingly told me.\n\nThe YouTube vigils paid off; he took on his first client, and it was a success.\n\n\u201cI worked with artistes from the US and UK to help them put out their music.\u201d\n\nHaving gained some experience, Hector decided to launch his record label, Unique Sirius. But it was unlike any label on the continent; it connected artistes and fans in the NFT metaverse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHector and some artistes\n\nCall to NFT\n\nWhile running his label, Hector still sought ways to get additional income. He met a friend who was into forex and crypto trading. He found it interesting and started following crypto news and trends, and he caught wind of the NFT craze circling among crypto enthusiasts.\n\nNFT is incredible, and he has seen an avenue where his artistes could earn more for their music. But tokenised music has not caught on in Africa.\n\nPer NonFungible, artworks and collectibles are still the most popular in the NFT market. But music NFTs are gaining some wind too.\n\nIn August 2021, Tory Lanez, an American singer, sold a million copies of his NFT album in 57 seconds.\n\nHector saw the potential in NFTs. An opportunity for artistes to connect with fans better and make lots of money in a very short time\n\nHe reached out to influential artistes in the Nigerian music industry because he knew a big artiste could get the NFT ball rolling in Africa. But no one took him up on his offer.\n\nLuckily, he met Challex D Boss, a Nigerian artiste with a strong following in Cross River, Akwa Ibom, and Ebonyi States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallex D Boss performing on stage\n\nAlthough Challex didn\u2019t have the kind of global influence Hector wanted, he was still an excellent pick for launching what he calls \u201cthe first NFT music in Africa.\u201d\n\nThe first song to be minted as an NFT in Africa was My Fans. It was perfect, not only because Hector loved the sound, but it also preached the NFT message \u2014 a way to connect with fans while they also got rewarded. It was a win-win situation.\n\nThe song was minted on Rocki, an NFT music platform on Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Bjorn Niclas, Rocki CEO, was also thrilled at the idea of launching Africa\u2019s first musical NFT on the platform and paid the gas fees.\n\nWithin two weeks, almost 10,000 units of the 100,000 units of My Fans had been sold. Hector was excited. The numbers were good, but more importantly, history had just been made \u2014 the first tokenised afrobeat music.\n\nHector said, \u201cNothing felt like it. I\u2019d just done what I needed to do. I want artistes to eat off their music too. I\u2019ve tested the market, and it\u2019s great.\u201d\n\nThe artistes weren\u2019t the only ones eating from the market. Fans who bought the NFT gained their share, receiving 20% of the royalties from every secondary sale.\n\nNFTs are transforming the music business\n\nHector believes NFTs are going to be a big part of the music business in a few years. It will take power from big corporations and give it to artistes and listeners.\n\n\u201cIt will be great for independent artistes,\u201d he says, explaining how hard it is for them to make money with their creativity. When they finally do, a large percentage goes to the platforms that list the music.\n\nFor context, an artiste makes $0.0084 per stream on Spotify, a music streaming platform. If the song gets streamed one million times, the artiste makes $8,400. This means if Tory Lanez were to put his song on Spotify rather than minting them as NFT, he\u2019d make $8,400 after a million streams instead of $1 million after a million purchases.\n\nBut, what\u2019s in it for the fans? Why buy music NFTs? The fans can easily resell for a higher price. For example, Tory Lanez minted a million copies of his song for a dollar each. This means a fan can sell for $5, making $4 in profit.\n\nThe only drawback is, Tory Lanez was able to pull that off because he was already famous, a feat impossible for an upcoming artiste.\n\nHector believes it\u2019s possible due to the win-win nature of the transaction. He believes if an upcoming artiste makes good music and can gather a small number of followers, his fans will buy his NFT and promote him so they can increase the value of what they\u2019ve bought.\n\nIt seems like a lot to take in, but Hector believes strongly in the future of NFTs as the disruptor of the music business as we know it. He\u2019s currently creating a crypto token and, at the same time, building a blockchain metaverse where crypto and NFTs reign supreme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun Website He's a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

And no, lack of money was not the reason. Seeing this, Chris Folayan, MallforAfrica\u2019s CEO and Founder started the company to bridge the gap between African shoppers and these eCommerce platforms.\n\nAided by an influx of Africans to the Internet, the startup grew steadily, gaining attention and support from investors and media houses like CNN.\n\nHere are some things to know before you read the article. First, the company has shut down its operations with plans for a rebranding in place. According to Folayan, this is due to the devaluation of the naira and some CBN policies.\n\nAlso, while orders are no longer being accepted on the platform, those placed before the shutdown would still be delivered. However, Folayan reveals that owing to a reduction in the number of staff, this could take longer than usual.\n\nRevved up yet? You might want to get a cup of tea as you read this: Nigerian eCommerce platform, MallforAfrica, has shut down operations, possible rebranding could be imminent\n\nAffiong Williams and the ReelFruit story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAffiong Williams\n\nIn this age of eight-figure pre-seed rounds by African startups, stories of entrepreneurs who have slowly but steadily built their businesses are rare.\n\nFor Affiong Williams, Founder and CEO of agritech startup, ReelFruit, starting a fruit processing business in Nigeria with no template to draw from was a bold move.\n\nFor her first degree, Williams studied Physiology and Psychology. Like a lot of Nigerians, the goal was to become a medical doctor. However, those plans flew out the window while in school so to increase her options, she did a post-graduate diploma in Business Administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing this, she started at Endeavour South Africa, where she worked closely with entrepreneurs, supporting them in running their businesses. This was where her interest in entrepreneurship was born. Contrary to the expectations of her immediate family, she left her job and, with her savings, returned to Nigeria to set up ReelFruit.\n\nWhat you may not know is that she hoped to win a UN grant for her business, but just three days after she returned, she got the rejection letter.\n\nIn this episode of Founder\u2019s Table, Williams shares from her over eight years of experience running ReelFruit, while revealing the company\u2019s plans for global expansion. There are also some fundraising tips for those struggling to get buy-in from investors.\n\nRead more: Nigeria to the world: Why it took Affiong Williams 9 years to raise $3m for ReelFruit\n\nChipper Cash raises $150 million\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFive months after raising a $100 million Series C round, African fintech startup, Chipper Cash has raised $150 million in a Series C extension round at a valuation of over $2 billion.\n\nThe extension round was led by crypto exchange platform, FTX with SVB Capital, Deciens Capital, Ribbit Capital, Bezos Expeditions, One Way Ventures, and Tribe Capital participating.\n\nCurrently serving seven African countries, Chipper Cash was founded in 2018 by Sam Serunjogi and Maijid Moujaled to facilitate cross border payment in Africa. This year, it initiated international expansion plans, starting with the UK and the US.\n\nThe cost of sending money to and within sub-Saharan Africa is the highest in the world. This is where Chipper Cash has found a sweet spot. Serunjogi reveals that Chipper Cash offers remittances at \u201cconsiderably cheaper\u201d prices than other competitors. These competitors include long time players like Western Union and World Remit.\n\nViolence against journalists\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was the Austrian-American journalist, Henry Grunwald, who said, \u201cJournalism can never be silent: that is its greatest virtue and its greatest fault. It must speak, and speak immediately, while the echoes of wonder, the claims of triumph and the signs of horror are still in the air.\u201d Yet, for so many African journalists, speaking could result in their death.\n\nSince 1992, 265 journalists have reportedly been killed in 51 African countries. Somalia and Algeria account for the majority of these murders with 70 and 60 respectively. On this year\u2019s International Day to End Impunity for Crimes Against Journalists, here are the top 20 African countries with the most deaths of journalists.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nHow to Find The Secret to Meaningful Work.

This mirrors the potential of Nigeria\u2019s payment service bank (PSB), but for licensing challenges, the most populous nation in Africa has continued to lag African peers.\n\nNigeria failed to meet its National Financial Inclusion Strategy target for 2020 to include 80 percent of its adult population into the financial system. EFInA data showed that only 64.1 percent was financially included by the end of last year.\n\nThis means that 36 percent of Nigerian adults, or 38.1 million of the country\u2019s 106 million (18 years and above) adults, remain completely financially excluded. This is a shortfall by 16 percent points from the desired target of a 20 percent exclusion rate.\n\nBefore now, only banks and licensed financial institutions were allowed to provide financial services (bank-led financial inclusion model). Although telecom operators and other Fintech companies indicated interest to operate in the market, the CBN policy would not allow them.\n\nThe regulator eventually shifted because of the increasing rate of financially excluded people in Nigeria and the lack of progress in getting banks to provide financial services to people living in areas that lack access.",

          "title": "A tale of two biggest collapsed buildings in Lagos",
          "text": "In 2008, a 22-storey building came down in rubbles in Lagos State, but no life was lost, no injury or damage to surrounding buildings was recorded. That was the Bank of Industry (BoI) building constructed in 1972 and brought down through controlled demolition.\n\nThirteen years later, November 2021, a 21-storey building under construction collapsed in the Ikoyi area of Lagos, killing more than 36 people (so far) with dozens injured and many others missing.\n\nThe two buildings are, so far, the largest structures to have crumbled in Lagos, but also two distinctly contrasting stories behind them. One was safely brought down when authorities thought it had become a risk while the other represented a failure of authorities to ensure the developer kept to standards and approvals.\n\nEvidence from the Lagos State government shows that the developer of the building located at 20 Gerard Road, Ikoyi, flouted building permits. In a letter issued to Fourscore Height Limited on April 5, 2019, with registration number IV/2019/DO/033/67 and permit number DCB/DO/2442IV on April 9, 2019, the structure was originally approved for 15 floors, not 21.\n\nA year before this, Prowess Engineering Limited, the original contractor for the building, in a letter dated February 20, 2020, notified Fourscore Homes Limited that it was withdrawing its services on the now collapsed building.\n\nRead Also: Collapsed building: Experts\u2019 views\n\nProwess stated in the letter, \u201cWe arrived at this decision due to the fact that we no longer share the same vision with you as our client in terms of how the project is being executed.\u201d\n\nIn contrast to the Fourscore Homes building, on September 21, 2008, the administration of Babatunde Fashola, the then governor of Lagos State, supervised the demolition of the 22-storey BoI building.\n\nCollapsed buildings in Lagos\n\nThe skyscraper located on 67/71 Broad Street in Ikoyi before being brought to its feet had endured five fire incidents that eroded its quality and contributed to a partial collapse reported on March 22, 2006.\n\nThe controlled demolition project that gulped N1.5 billion from the state coffers would be remembered for two feats \u2013 the first of its kind in West Africa and the only building that collapsed without any casualty, not even the least damage to surrounding structures.\n\nBroad Street\u2019s tallest building crumbled within 10 seconds without bulldozers or cranes but with around 5,900 explosives planted strategically around the beams of the structure and then detonated through remote devices.\n\nConsequently, the building collapsed on its weight with rumbles and very thick dust that, for more than 10 minutes, covered the surrounding.\n\nBabatunde Fashola, immediately after the exercise, affirmed his government implemented guided demolition as the path of least risk to the residents in the area. He added that though the building had partially collapsed on March 22, 2006, the state government patiently persuaded both the Federal Government and the BoI management to proffer any solution but this proved abortive.\n\nRead also: Body of Osibona, owner of collapsed high-rise building recovered\n\nAs a result, the state had no other option than to resolve to exercise the constitutional powers of the governor under Section 28 of the Land Use Act by acquiring the property along Broad Street, within which the BoI building was located.\n\nHowever, unlike the BoI building demolished with no casualties, the Fourscore Homes 21-storey building that collapsed on November 1, around 3pm has more than 36 persons so far confirmed dead, even as the cause of the collapse is yet to be ascertained.\n\nApproved initially for a 15-storey building, the Fourscore Homes structure was designed as a luxury apartment to be known as 360 Degrees Towers. The collapsed building promised residents the scenic views of the Lagos lagoon, the Atlantic Ocean, neighbouring estates such as Banana Island, Osborne Road, and the Third Mainland Bridge, as well as the Lekki-Ikoyi Link Bridge.\n\nFor the Nigerian Building and Road Research Institute (NBRRI), the high incidence of building collapse in the country could be attributed to poor supervision and the use of inferior materials in the construction of buildings.\n\nIt buttresses the position of David Majekodunmi, the state chairman of the Nigerian Institute of Architects, who earlier decried lack of strict building regulations by the government and regulatory bodies, as reasons for the collapse of the Ikoyi building.\n\nMajekodunmi, speaking with the media recently, faulted the Project Board at the construction site of the building, noting that the numbers on the board showed that the same person was the consultant and the architect.\n\n\u201cIf the regulatory bodies had seen this board and done the needful, maybe we would be able to know who we are accusing or who to hold responsible for this mayhem,\u201d Majekodunni said.\n\nOkunola Olasunkanmi, a building plan research expert, stated that Nigeria\u2019s commercial hub had witnessed about 155 buildings collapse in a space of 16 years.",

          "text": "With less than 24 hours to the gubernatorial election in Anambra State, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the Nigerian security agencies have been urged to ensure a free, fair and credible election.\n\nAmid the precarious security situation in the state, observers say INEC and security agencies perhaps, face a tough task of ensuring the exercise is held as scheduled without ugly incidents.\n\nIn their meeting with stakeholders in the last few days, INEC and the police had expressed their readiness for the gubernatorial election, assuring voters of their safety, and urging them to come out and cast their votes without fear.\n\nThere are concerns that the spate of insecurity in the state, which has led to a series of violent attacks in the last few months and the sit-at-home order by the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), could affect the conduct of the election, particularly as it could engender voter apathy.\n\nRead Also: Why we\u2019re confident Anambra election will hold \u2013 INEC chairman\n\nINEC Anambra election\n\nTo ensure peace before, during and after the election, thousands of security officers and personnel of other sister agencies have been deployed to the state.\n\nOn October 14, about 34,587 officers were deployed, while additional 98 senior officers were also deployed on October 26.\n\nSpeaking at the stakeholders\u2019 forum on the preparation for the election in Akwa, the state capital, on Wednesday, November 3, Usman Baba, the Inspector-General of Police (IGP), said the deployment was to reassure residents of the Federal Government\u2019s protection.\n\n\u201cThis massive deployment is not designed to intimidate the law-abiding as being insinuated in some quarters. On the contrary, it is to reassure them of adequate protection by deterring misguided political elements as well as non-state actors that might be bent on threatening the election through acts of armed violence or other conducts that violate the provisions of the Electoral Act,\u201d Baba said.\n\nBaba further said it was to also serve as a strong warning that government was determined to bring subversive characters to justice should they attempt to cause trouble.\n\nSpeaking on the conduct of the election during the week, Mahmood Yakubu, national chairman, INEC, said the commission was prepared to deliver a free, fair and credible election, pointing out however that the only challenge before the commission was how to ensure the newly registered voters took part in the election.\n\nHe urged all voters to come out and participate as every arrangement had been made to ensure a peaceful election.\n\n\u201cWhen the commission released the timetable for the conduct of the election 11 months ago, the feeling was that the time would not come. The time is already here, we only have days left and we are going to go as a commission.\n\n\u201cTo ensure that the newly registered voters take part, we decided to contact them through their email and GSM numbers to inform them of the locations to get their cards,\u201d Yakubu said.\n\nAlthough there have been divergent views on the benefits of the massive deployment of security personnel for the election, some members of the public have called for caution, saying it was capable of scaring away eligible voters.\n\nObservers also advise the security operatives deployed to the state to be professional and not partisan in the discharge of their duties on Election Day.\n\n\u201cIt is very simple! The two of them must follow the global standard required by them in an electoral process. That is, the INEC must not only be perceived as transparent and unbiased but also its officials at all levels of the election process must carry out their responsibilities with utmost good faith in tandem with the provisions of the Electoral Acts,\u201d Kunle Okunade, a political analyst, says.\n\nOkunade notes that recent events have shown that security agents had been used to compromise elections in Nigeria, which must change.\n\n\u201cIn the last few years, security agencies have often been alleged of playing a role in electoral malpractices; so, it will be appropriate for the sake of the credibility of the election, that security agents should strictly act based on its responsibilities stated in the Electoral Act,\u201d he states.\n\nChekwas Okorie, a founding member of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), however, expresses concern on the readiness of the security agencies to be professional in the discharge of their duties, predicting that the election would be marred by low turnout.\n\n\u201cSo far, INEC has done what is expected of them; Anambra, may be, because of the peculiar situation in the state, the situation now is overwhelming to the point of fear. Our security personnel have not been known to discharge their duties professionally; that is the fear in town. Would they change now? There would be an election but there would be massive poor turnout,\u201d he says.\n\nA coalition of the 18 registered political parties in Nigeria under the aegis of Inter Party Advisory Council (IPAC) on Wednesday also called on the INEC and security agencies to ensure that the Anambra poll is credible, fair and transparent.\n\nLeonard Nzenwa, chairman of IPAC and national chairman, African Action Congress (AAC), at press conference in Abuja, said it was important that INEC and security agencies commit to ensuring fairness and transparency during the election.\n\n\u201cINEC should provide a level playing field to all political parties and their candidates participating in the election and ensure electoral materials are provided, and that voting starts as scheduled in all polling units in the state.\n\n\u201cThe neutrality of INEC in this election will determine the survival of democracy in Nigeria. All eyes are on the commission and its officials as they discharge this onerous civic responsibility,\u201d Nzenwa said.\n\nAbout 18 candidates from 18 political parties are taking part in the off-season gubernatorial election.",

Seriake Dickson.\n\nAt the resumed trial, the prosecution witness, Mr Timothy Owoeye, an official of the EFCC, in his evidence, said that the Commission collaborated with several banks and regulatory agencies during its investigation.\n\nOwoeye was led in evidence by the prosecution counsel Mustapha Iko.\n\nHe told the court that the Commission acted on a Suspicious Transactions Report (STR) from the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) to investigate the defendant.\n\nHe noted that the STR from the NFIU indicated that between April and Oct 2015, N73 million, $51,900 and \u00a33,800 in cash were reportedly lodged in the defendant\u2019s bank account at Guarantee Trust Bank, Yenagoa.\n\nOwoeye also said that efforts to trace the source of the funds made the EFCC to query the registration status of Kare-X Fashions and Designs Nigeria Ltd, with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC).\n\nHe said that the company, which the defendant claimed to be her source for the funds, was not found in the database of the CAC.\n\nThe witness further said that the defendant later claimed that she had other sources of business supplying of granite and timber for construction which were also scrutinised.\n\nThe EFCC, however, said that the income from the defendant\u2019s timber business could not be ascertained as most of the buildings where the timber was purportedly used had been roofed and occupied.\n\nHe tendered letters from several organisations in response to EFCC\u2019s inquiry, documents from six commercial banks as evidence, but the court noted that the documents were not itemised for ease of reference.\n\nThe trial judge, Justice Isa Ndahen, adjourned the case until Nov. 4 for ruling on the admissibility of the documents tendered in evidence by the EFCC.\n\nThe EFCC had arraigned Apere and Beauty at the court on Oct. 8, for money laundering allegedly carried out in 2015 but defence counsel Andrew Arthur raised a motion of preliminary objection to Apere\u2019s arraignment.\n\nThe defence argued that Apere had earlier been tried and discharged and the discharge amounted to an acquittal, but the prosecution countered that the discharge was based on technicalities and not on merit.\n\nThe judge adjourned until Dec 15 for ruling on the motion opposing the arraignment of Apere.\n\n...",

The panel cannot wind up without confirming the whereabouts of victims in police custody, whether they are alive or dead,\u201d he said.\n\nPolice lawyer speaks\n\nThe leader of the defence team, Mr Idachaba, assured the panel that he would get involved personally to find out the whereabouts of the victim.\n\nHe said from a preliminary investigation carried out personally, Mr Ezela was arrested by the Inspector General of Police, Intelligence Response Team (IGP-IRT) and not SARS, as alleged by his family.\n\nThe case was adjourned till November 23, for the defence\u2019s report on the victim\u2019s whereabouts.\n\nHilda Ezeala, the mother of the victim and petitioner who lodged the complaint, had said her son was arrested in July 2017 by some policemen.\n\nShe said she was informed to come with her lawyer to the SARS office in Owerri, Imo State, where she was later told that he had been transferred to Abuja.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has declared that the undisguised love a former deputy governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Dr Obadiah Mailafia, had for the country was never in doubt even as he recalled sterling footprints left behind by the late 2019 presidential candidate.\n\nLEADERSHIP reports that Mailafia died on Sunday, September 19, 2021 at the Gwagwalada Specialist Hospital after a brief illness.\n\nSpeaking during a service of songs and tributes for the late technocrat and scholar, which held at the National Christian Centre, Abuja on Thursday, the president commended the late central banker for his intelligence he brought to bear in both public and private life.\n\nMailafia would be buried this Friday but Buhari, who was represented at the occasion by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr Boss Mustapha, said, \u201cLate Dr was a devoted Christian, well known Development Economist, International Polymath, Central Banker, academician per-excellence, astute administrator and strategist whose enormous contributions to the growth and development of our nation\u2019s economy are unquantifiable.\n\n\u201cI fondly remember and appreciate his indelible contributions to the transformation of our nation\u2019s banking sector through the Banking Consolidation Exercise during his eventful stint as the then Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria between 2005 and 2006. This must have birthed most of the technologically advanced banking services we enjoy today. All thanks to late Dr Mailafia and his team.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, Dr Mailafia was a complete family man and humanitarian whose selfless service to his family and contributions to humanity are enumerable. He had made his marks as an outstanding individual whose personality transcended local and international borders.\n\n\u201cWe have lost a rare gem and we will all miss him for his unimpeachable contributions to nation building. His undisguised love for Nigeria was not in doubt.\u201d\n\nFor his part, the governor of Benue State, Dr Samuel Ortom, commended the late Mailafia for his courage and love for Nigeria, stressing that his death was painful at a time the nation needed him the most.\n\nRepresented by Dr Ishima Ayati, the governor commiserated with members of his immediate family and prayed to God to grant eternal repose to the soul of the Mailafia.\n\nAlso, president of the Middle Belt Forum (MBF), Dr Pogu Bitrus, described the former CBN deputy governor as a distinguished son of the Middle Belt and national patriot who was committed to ensuring that Nigeria works for all.\n\n\u201cAt a time like this, it is painful to mourn the passage of a younger one. Dr Mailafia was courageous, honest and fearless on issues that matter the most. His death has left a huge vacuum and we pray that the Almighty God raise up other Mailafias to continue where he stopped,\u201d Dr Pogu prayed.\n\nFoe their part, the Southern Kaduna Peoples Union (SOKAPU), described the late consummate writer and polymath as a symbol of the struggle to enthrone justice and equity for the diverse people of Nigeria.\n\nChairman of the Board of Trustees of SOKAPU, who spoke for the Union, Elder Steven Bangoji, said, \u201cDr Mailafia died for the oppressed and stood for those suffering from an unjust system. As long as Nigeria continue to exist as a single political entity, his footprints will always be remembered.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe governor of the CBN, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, sympathised with the family of Dr Mailafia, and described the late central banker as an intelligent personality whose contributions to the growth of the nation will remain indelible.\n\nProfessor Yusuf Turaki, who delivered the sermon at the service of songs, recalled the life and times of Mailafia and his courage to stand by his principles at all times. He described the Sanga-born technocrat as a lover of humanity and someone who stood for truth.\n\nChairman of the Steering Committee for the burial and former Minister of Information, Prof. Jerry Gana, commended Nigerians for attending the service of songs, stressing that Mailafia was a true son of Nigeria who loved his nation.\n\nThousands of Nigerians from all walks of life trooped to the National Christian Centre Abuja to pay their last respects to the man many described as a voice for the voiceless while alive.\n\nThe funeral service is billed to take place on this Friday, November 5, 2021 at the same venue at 11am, while interment will follow at the Gudu cemetery, Abuja.",

          "title": "Ikoyi building: Developer, friend\u2019s corpses recovered, death toll reaches 40",
          "text": "The corpses of the Managing Director, Fourscore Heights Limited, Mr Femi Osibona, and his friend, a United States of America-based Nigerian businessman, Wale Bob-Oseni, have been recovered from the 21-storey building that collapsed on Gerrard Road in the Ikoyi area of Lagos State.\n\nPUNCH Metro learnt that their bodies were found on Thursday by responders during the recovery operation at the scene of the incident.\n\nBob-Oseni, a real-estate dealer, was on his way back to the US on Monday when he got a call from Osibona to check out the project.\n\nBoth friends were subsequently trapped when the building collapsed.\n\nOur correspondents had reported that the 21-storey building crumbled on Monday around 2pm when Osibona, who owned the project, his clients and workers were on the site.\n\nOne of our reporters, who was at the scene on Thursday, reported that no fewer than 40 corpses had so far been recovered from the site.\n\nHowever, the Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, around 1pm said 32 bodies were recovered.\n\nFamilies lament delay in identifying corpses\n\nSome relatives of the victims lamented the postponement of the identification of corpses recovered by emergency workers.\n\nThey recalled that Sanwo-Olu said autopsies were being conducted on the corpses but families would be able to identify their loved ones from Thursday.\n\nThe bereaved families said when they visited the Mainland Hospital mortuary, Yaba, on Thursday, they were denied access to the bodies.\n\nThe father of an 18-year-old boy, Edward Godwin, while in tears, said he was not allowed to identify his son\u2019s body despite the governor\u2019s assurance.\n\nHe said, \u201cI honestly needed to see my son yesterday (Wednesday). I\u2019ve been to the general hospital to check those injured, but my son was not there. I thought I would be able to see him today, but I\u2019ve not been able to see my son.\u201d\n\nA woman, who did not identify herself, said she had been to the state morgue as well but was not allowed to identify her sister\u2019s son.\n\nShe said, \u201cThe governor said yesterday (Wednesday) that we would be able to see the corpses recovered today (Thursday) and check if our loved ones were there. But when I went there today, I was not allowed to see anything despite telling them that the governor said we would be able to check today.\n\n\u201cI want to know if the boy is still alive or dead. I have not told my sister about what happened because she\u2019s not staying in Lagos and I want to know if he\u2019s dead or not before telling her. The government should just allow us to see if our people are there or not.\u201d\n\nAnother woman, who identified herself as Florence, said she spoke with her brother on Sunday before she got a call that he was among those trapped.\n\nShe said, \u201cMy younger brother is here; I spoke with him last on Sunday but someone called me that something happened and I came here yesterday.\n\n\u201cSomeone told me he was among those rushed to the hospital and I went to the general hospital and showed someone his picture and he confirmed that he was brought in unconscious. But since yesterday, I\u2019ve not seen him or sure of the hospital he was taken to.\u201d\n\nPUNCH Metro observed as a black Toyota Highlander reportedly owned by an aluminium fabricator trapped in the rubble was driven away from the site on Thursday.\n\nThe wife of the victim, who sat under a tree, looked vague and declined comment when one of our correspondents approached her.\n\nConflicting casualty figures\n\nA senior government officer, who did not want to be identified, told PUNCH Metro that 35 males and three females were brought out dead from the rubble as of 11.50am on Thursday.\n\nOne of our correspondents, who was at the scene, noted that more bodies were brought out after that time.\n\nHowever, the state governor, Sanwo-Olu, while addressing journalists on Thursday around 1pm, said the state Ministry of Health was in charge of taking corpses to the morgue.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs we stand here and we speak, we have recovered a total of 32 dead bodies and they have been transported to the morgue and the reason why the corpses were moved to the IDH is because it\u2019s one of the foremost preserved morgues we have in Lagos.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s understand what the chain of command is. This is a Lagos State site and so the Lagos State\u2019s chain of command and control is from the state Ministry of Health; they are the ones that have taken corpses to the morgue so they are accountable and the people that are moving corpses here are staff of the Lagos State Ministry of Health; the staff that are leading rescue here are staff of LASEMA.\n\n\u201cA dead body is not what you hide; it\u2019s what you take to the morgue and it\u2019s only when it\u2019s accountable from here to the morgue that we have a proper register of it.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on why families were not able to identify their corpses, Sanwo-Olu said autopsies had not been concluded.\n\n\u201cThe coroner inquest takes their turn and the certification by the pathologists are currently going on. We\u2019re pushing them to ensure they can work very quickly to make if not all the bodies but some of the bodies ready by tomorrow (Friday).

This is a Lagos State site and so the Lagos State\u2019s chain of command and control is from the state Ministry of Health; they are the ones that have taken corpses to the morgue so they are accountable and the people that are moving corpses here are staff of the Lagos State Ministry of Health; the staff that are leading rescue here are staff of LASEMA.\n\n\u201cA dead body is not what you hide; it\u2019s what you take to the morgue and it\u2019s only when it\u2019s accountable from here to the morgue that we have a proper register of it.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on why families were not able to identify their corpses, Sanwo-Olu said autopsies had not been concluded.\n\n\u201cThe coroner inquest takes their turn and the certification by the pathologists are currently going on.

This is a Lagos State site and so the Lagos State\u2019s chain of command and control is from the state Ministry of Health; they are the ones that have taken corpses to the morgue so they are accountable and the people that are moving corpses here are staff of the Lagos State Ministry of Health; the staff that are leading rescue here are staff of LASEMA.\n\n\u201cA dead body is not what you hide; it\u2019s what you take to the morgue and it\u2019s only when it\u2019s accountable from here to the morgue that we have a proper register of it.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on why families were not able to identify their corpses, Sanwo-Olu said autopsies had not been concluded.\n\n\u201cThe coroner inquest takes their turn and the certification by the pathologists are currently going on. We\u2019re pushing them to ensure they can work very quickly to make if not all the bodies but some of the bodies ready by tomorrow (Friday).\n\n\u201cThat is the deadline we have pushed them to so families can come and look and identify the bodies and at the appropriate time take their body away,\u201d he added.\n\nThe governor, however, said he would give an exception to the man who came from Abuja to check the photographs of the bodies recovered and see if his son was there.\n\nSanwo-Olu noted that the independent panel that would investigate the collapse had been officially inaugurated and given a seal of office.\n\nHe said, \u201cThey have all the powers in case they want to summon, ask and engage anybody whatsoever in the course of their investigation to be able to give a thorough objective and transparent advice and recommendations coming out from the investigation panel and they have 30 days turnaround to do their work because of the importance and urgency.\u201d\n\nSource: PUNCH",

          "text": "Worried by the security challenges afflicting the region, the South-East Governors\u2019 Forum (SEGF) Thursday said they would soon meet with the federal government on the issue around leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Mazi Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nThe forum said the meeting would ensure that political solutions were deployed in the case of the IPOB leader currently in the custody of the Department of State Services and facing treason-related charges.\n\nThey said the meeting would also address the pockets of violence in the region and the sit-at-home orders issued by different groups of agitators.\n\nEbonyi state Governor and SEGF Chairman David Umahi announced this at Abakalilki during a media parley.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of the various illegal orders of sit-at-home by different groups of state agitators for our people of South East to sit at home every Monday and from 5th to 10th November 2021.\n\n\u201cWhereas we have identified some of the spokespersons of some of these groups and we have been engaging them to stop all forms of violence and illegalities in South East and allow South East leaders to address all issues raised by them, we are however working with security agencies, our local security and our leaders to protect the lives of our people and to address all issues raised.\n\n\u201cWe thank Ohanaeze Ndigbo for a good job they did through their various committees in raising various solutions towards addressing all issues raised by our young children. South East Governors are studying their reports with the elders and leaders of the various South East States and very soon, we will be meeting with Federal Government of Nigeria on these issues including deploying political solutions in the case of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu which we have already initiated.\n\n\u201cWe thank our religious leaders, Conference of Bishops and Archbishops of South East, the traditional institutions of South East and Christian Association of Nigeria of South East for their interventions and mediations on this matter. We will work with them to achieve the desired result for our people and Nigeria,\u201d Umahi said.\n\nOhanaeze kicks\n\nIn a related development, Chairman Ohanaeze Ndigbo Council of Elders Engineer Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu has described as provocative and insulting the action instituted by a group described as northern elders requesting the court to order the National Assembly to make a law expelling Igbo from Nigeria.\n\nIwuanyanwu, who said this in a statement issued Thursday in Abuja, recalled that a few years ago, some northern leaders rose from a meeting in Kaduna state and issued a communiqu\u00e9 calling for the expulsion of Igbo from Nigeria.\n\nHe also observed that some months ago, many news media carried the demonstration of some northern youths and women insisting that Igbo should leave Nigeria.\n\nThe elder statesman said since these attacks on Igbo nation in Nigeria, he has received lots of curious enquiries from many Igbos within and in Diaspora as regards their safety.\n\nHe described the situation as very embarrassing to not only Ndigbo but also to all patriotic citizens of Nigeria, maintaining that in a larger sense, the action of these northerners was treason against Nigeria.\n\nIwuanyanwu insisted that the action is very hostile against the unity, peace and stability of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and urged all patriotic Nigerians to view this action with great concern.\n\nHe said: \u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s meeting with South East leaders during his visit in Owerri was highly commended and indeed a good and strategic step towards reconciliation and reassuring to Igbo.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari made it clear that Igbos were domiciled in virtually all communities in Nigeria and in those communities, they are pursuing their businesses with peace and love. And that Igbos wherever they go obey the laws of the land and respect the customs and traditions of the indigenes.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is clear that no group in Nigeria can claim greater ownership of Nigeria today than the Igbos. And at every stage of the nation\u2019s history since 1914, Igbo have played major roles in all activities that shape the destiny of Nigeria everywhere.\n\n\u201cIn the struggle for independence, Igbo championed the crusade. In other areas, economy, education, industry, sports, etc, Igbo have continued to play their roles and make tremendous contributions.\n\n\u201cIgbo will therefore want to make it abundantly clear to all and sundry that if anybody plans to expel Igbo from Nigeria and dispossess them of their hard earned assets they have all over the country, Igbo will never accept that.\n\n\u201cFor avoidance of doubt, the name Nigeria is derived from one of the biggest rivers in Africa- River Nigeria. In Nigeria, this river traverses through substantial part of Igbo land. It is important to note that most of the people who want to expel Igbo and seize their assets do not have their states anywhere near the River Nigeria. We now want to tell Nigerians that Igbos are substantial owners of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn some geopolitical zones, militants, Boko Haram and Herdsmen are operating dangerously, killing many innocent people. These people are secessionists. They have even mounted their flags in some Local Governments and collecting taxes. I want to point out the fact that Nigeria flag is flying everywhere in Igbo land,\u201d the statement said.\u201d",

          "text": "Barely six months after Niger state Governor Abubakar Sani Bello warned terrorists and related criminals were just \u201ctwo hours from Abuja\u201d, the Federal Capital Territory has come under attack by the criminal elements.\n\nFollowing series of attacks on people of the state, Governor Abubakar Sani Bello raised the alarm that the Boko Haram terrorists were trying to make Kaure their home and headquarters like they did in Sambisa forest.\n\n\u201cI have been engaging the federal government, and unfortunately, it has gotten to this stage, and if care is not taken even Abuja is not safe. We have been saying this for long and all efforts have been in vain,\u201d Bello had said.\n\n\u201cWhile Sambisa forest is several kilometers away from Abuja, Kaure is only two hours drive to Abuja,\u201d the governor further added.\n\nThe attacks\n\nIn May this year, some students and staff members of the University of Abuja were reportedly held hostage by unknown gunmen for over six hours until the military formation located adjacent the school came to their rescue.\n\nAlthough no report of casualties in all the attacks so far recorded, Blueprint gathered that in just five days of their incursion into the nation\u2019s seat of power and its environs, the criminal elements have abducted not less than 11 people at different times from different locations.\n\nWhile there had been pockets of abduction around Abuja and its environs, the intensity in the last five days is causing tension and has become a source of worry and concern to residents who \u201cdo not have the feeling of being safe again.\u201d\n\nIt was gathered that the security breach started Saturday when gunmen hit the staff quarters of Junior Secondary School Yebu in Kwali Area Council of Abuja and abducted the Vice Principal, Mohammed Nuhu.\n\nNuhu\u2019s abduction was not in the public domain until after a similar one at the University of Abuja where a lecturer and some five others were kidnapped in the early hours of Tuesday.\n\nAccording to reports, the gunmen came in numbers and began to shoot fiercely into the air to wade off possible opposition from other residents who might attempt coming to the VP\u2019s rescue.\n\nAnd to further ease their operations, sources told Blueprint the security personnel manning the gate was tied by the hoodlums.\n\nChairman of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) wing of the Nigeria Union of Teachers (NUT), Comrade Stephen Knabayi, confirmed the abduction and said the captors were yet to reach out to relations of the victim as at the time of this report.\n\nThe UNIABUAJA attack\n\nAnd following closely Tuesday was another abduction of a University of Abuja teacher and Professor of Economics, his two children and some three others.\n\nReports said they were all abducted within the university quarters.\n\nThe abductors, we reliably gathered, had since reached out to the families of their victims.\n\nTo let them off the hook, the criminals are placing a N300 million ransom on the six persons at N50 million per head.\n\nYet another attack on UniAbuja\n\nAnd just 24 hours after, the university came under yet another attack Wednesday.\n\nA student who craved anonymity for fear of possible target by the hoodlums or their informants told Blueprint some unknown persons with suspected stolen vehicle stuffed with weapons gained entry into the school, harnessed some students at the entrance and collected their belongings.\n\n\u201cThey still went into an office, and attacked a lecturer with Economics Department Professor David Okoroafor. The lecturer teaches Mathematics in the department.\n\n\u201cThey made attempts to collect the lecturer\u2019s phone and other belongings before students who saw them earlier raised the alarm, then security men within the school went after them.\n\n\u201cDue to fear and anxiety, a scheduled lecture in our class was hastily put off because the lecturer in charge called to tell us he won\u2019t be in class again. By the time we came out, others were already leaving the school premises,\u201d said the source.\n\nAlso, another anonymous student said students living within and outside the school premises now lived in fear, as cultists now attack students and others around.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe cultists harass people mostly at night around Bob H area, behind the boys\u2019 hostel in Gwagwalada.\n\n\u201cIn the past three weeks, the unknown persons with weapons have been terrorising female hostel close to school. They collect their phones and other belongings unchallenged.\u201d\n\nThese ugly developments had put a number schools in Kuje Area Council of the FCT on red alert.\n\nBlueprint had reported that schools within these places had taken extra security measures to safeguard the students, while the police were said to have agreed to establish their presence at strategic locations around the schools in these places.\n\nSuleja attack\n\nAnd from Suleja, a suburb of Abuja in Niger state, the Police Thursday confirmed the abduction of four women by gunmen at Haske Dabara community, Angwan Gwari Kwamba of Suleja local government area of the state.\n\nNiger state Commissioner of Police Monday Kuryas confirmed the incident in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Minna.\n\n\u201cYes it has happened at about 1 a.m. last night and already anti-kidnapping team, the army and vigilante had been deployed to rescue the victims.\n\n\u201cWe will do everything humanly possible to apprehend all those miscreants undermining the peaceful coexistence among residents.\n\n\u201cI am appealing to residents, especially rural dwellers, to come forward with credible information on movement of strange faces among them to the nearest security personnel for necessary security action\u201d, he said.\n\nThe commissioner solicited more working support by coming forward with intelligence information that could aid the security personnel deployed across the state in the ongoing fight against kidnapping, banditry and other criminal elements in the state.\n\nAn eyewitness said the gunmen entered the community at about 12.46 a.m. with gunshots that scared the residents.\n\nResidents fear\n\nThe spate of attacks has become a major source of worry to residents of the FCT.\n\nIn a chat with our reporters, Asake Muftau who resides in Jikowyi, an Abuja suburb, said: \u201cWe woke up to gridlock on Wednesday and we were told that some people are plotting to attack Abuja. So, the soldiers stationed at Karu Bridge are searching vehicles. But is that the best way to prevent an attack? Certainly No.\n\n\u201cBecause of this threat, we now live in fear and the soldiers make it worse by mounting roadblocks on the road. Now, I am extremely careful where I go and who comes around me and my family.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, our security personnel need to change their tactics. This habitual roadblock or stop and search has never prevented an attack. When Shi\u2019ites wanted to protest they blocked the road, yet they protested inside the city centre. Despite the roadblock, attacks still occur. Would it not be more dangerous and deadly when motorists who are held up by their roadblock are attacked? So we now live in fear, even in traffic and the roadblock has created more hardship for many of us.\u201d\n\nAnother resident of Nyanya, Aminu Abdullahi said the tension over possible attacks on and in Abuja should be of concern to everyone, urging the security personnel to do more than \u201d stop and search.\n\n\u201cThe security situation in Nigeria and Abuja too is very worrisome. And this is affecting everything that we do. It is affecting our business, movement and our family. For how long are we going to continue?\n\n\u201cSecurity agencies must do more than stop and search, they should be very proactive in their operation. When you block roads, do you think criminals will not find alternative route? Our security personnel need to do more intelligence gathering and be very proactive in defending citizens.\u201d\n\nExpressing similar worry, a businessman and resident of the FCT, Alhaji Adamu Abdullahi, who resides at Nyanya area described the situation as a surprising development.\n\nAbdullahi said: \u201cIt\u2019s a reflection of the appalling security situation in the country. For me, it\u2019s a wakeup call on the authorities to think out of the box to nip the menace of banditry and kidnapping in the bud. The eye service approach of roadblock is simply scraping the problem on the surface.\n\n\u201cWe need intelligence gathering to fish out the bad eggs in our society. Those who steal our security votes should be reminded that they have no hiding place any longer as these bandits are beginning to zero in on the elites.\u201d\n\nAlso, Malam Sabi Baruten, an Abuja-based politician, said any attack in the FCT is an attack to the entire nation.\n\n\u201cLook, the situation in the FCT and even Nigeria as a whole concerning insecurity and the purported planned invasion of the nation\u2019s capital by bandits or whatever you call them, is something that should worry everyone.\n\n\u201cToday, FCT is home to Nigerians, there\u2019s no tribe no matter how micro it is, that is not represented here. So any attack in the FCT is an attack on the entire nation.\n\n\u201cWhat should concern us as residents here is the porosity of all the entry routes to the FCT. My humble appeal to the relevant authorities, especially those in charge of gathering intelligent reports is to collaborate and increase synergy to beef up security.\n\n\u201cI know they can do it the same way the current Buhari led administration has succeeded in stopping bombings within and around the FCT common during the last administration of PDP.\u201d\n\nAlso, Hajia Khadija Abdul, a respondent who lives in Kubwa, a satellite town in the FCT said, \u201cIt\u2019s high time the security agencies did more to stop this. Attack on Abuja has the tendency to spark off ethno-religious war. Truth be told, we just do not have the feeling of being safe again in Abuja.\n\n\u201cHere in Kubwa, we once experienced kidnap of people. The right attention was not given to the incident. Let us not pretend that all is well. Irrespective of whatever the government says, honestly Abuja is not safe.

Hon. Ayuba Abok.\n\nThe coalition which is an umbrella body of about 74 civil society organisations, expressed concern at the turn of events in the aftermath of impeachment of the former Speaker, which it said was unhealthy for the much-needed peaceful atmosphere in the state.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in Abuja yesterday, the Convener of the coalition, Comrade James Dauda who was flanked by other members maintained that attempt to whip up sentiment through spurious allegation that Governor Lalong was behind the impeachment of the former Speaker was not only condemnable but unacceptable in a democratic setting.\n\nThe group noted that the governor, who is the chairman of the Northern Governors Forum, NGF , was the first to grant judicial and legislative autonomy in Nigeria which the former Speaker enjoyed the privilege.\n\nIt wondered how members of the State House of Assembly, which is independent of the executive arm of government in the state, turned out to impeach its Speaker for reasons best known to them, yet the governor is being accused of \u2018behind the scene\u2019 role.\n\n\u201cGentlemen of the press, we are aware that Plateau State House of Assembly was the first out of 36 States of the Federation to enjoy legislative and judicial autonomy, even when Hon. Ayuba Abok held sway as Speaker.\n\n\u201cThe lawmakers decided to impeach their leader based on reasons best known to them and elected Hon. Yakubu Sanda as new Speaker, which we consider as democracy in action, hence, peace should be allowed to reign at all cost,\u201d the convener stressed.\n\nA\u00e7cording to him, \u201cthe embattled Speaker had once refused confirmation of nominees as commissioners when he has opportunity to do so for the state to move forward, yet the governor who was an ex-lawmaker played along given that in democracy, each arms were at liberty to take decision on their own.\u201d\n\nThe group further bemoaned the ex-Speaker\u2019s recalcitrance in cooperating with the All Progressives Congress, APC structure in Plateau which has degenerated to factionalization during the recent state congress.\n\nIt, however, commended Governor Lalong for his maturity and leadership that has ensured peace and tranquility as well as socio-economic and infrastructural development of the state, while calling on the citizens, particularly the youths not to allow themselves to be used.",

The volume of the outstanding liabilities with underfunding has affected ongoing projects/programmes of the Ministry across the region and this is gradually contributing to the resurgence of problems in some areas of the region,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking earlier, during the budget presentation the Chairman House of Representative Committee on Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs Hon. Essien Ekpeyong, assured that the Legislature is committed to the security of lives and investment in the Niger Delta region and for economic and social activities to strive. Therefore, he said, the budget proposal of N25.56 billion would be given due attention in line with the 2021 budgetary review.\n\nHe explained that there was need for the Executive and Legislature to work together to ensure that thousands of uncompleted projects scattered across the region are completed for the betterment of the life of the people.\n\nHe also noted that the House would also consider if there were challenges that would require legislative intervention, particularly in the area of funding in respect of the East-West Road by setting up committee to work with the ministry in this regard.",

We are bringing you all the latest from the Anambra governorship election and the National Assembly\u2019s grilling of Rotimi Amaechi over the Federal Government\u2019s plan to extend the national rail network to Maradi in Niger Republic.\n\nSubscribe here to receive this news briefing in your inbox before 6:45am (WAT) every weekday.\n\nAnambra governorship candidates sign peace pact\n\nCandidates in the imminent Anambra governorship election signed a peace accord in Awka, the state captial, on Thursday.\n\nThe election is slated for Saturday.\n\nThe peace accord ceremony was organised by the National Peace Committee, which is chaired by former military Head of State, General Abdulsalami Abubakar.\n\nThe accord is equally binding on the candidate\u2019s political parties and is expected to encourage signees to take proactive steps \u201ctowards ensuring a conducive environment for the conduct of a credible electoral process.\u201d\n\nSecurity measures: The Inspector General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, has ordered the restriction of vehicular movementin the state. This means there would be no movement of vehicles in and out of Anambra State from 11:59 pm on Friday, November 5 to 11:59 pm on Saturday, November 6.\n\nPush forward: A coalition of Governors from the five South-East states have urged residents to ignore threats of insecurity, confidently go out on Saturday and vote for any candidate of their choice.\n\nFinal words: The candidates have made their last pitchto voters ahead of the election this weekend.\n\nLagos Govt, NEMA differ on high-rise casualty figure\n\nThe Lagos State Government and the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) have differed on the number of casualties recorded from the 21-story Ikoyi building collapse as rescue efforts continue.\n\nGovernor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who visited the scene on Thursday, noted that 32 bodies have been recovered from the building collapse.\n\nBut earlier in the day, NEMA\u2019s Acting Coordinator of the Lagos Territorial Office, Mr Ibrahim Farinloye said 38 people had been confirmed dead.\n\nMeanwhile, the body of Mr Femi Osibona, the CEO Of Fourscore Homes, the real estate company responsible for the collapsed building, was said to be among those recovered on Thursday.\n\nForward steps: The Governor visited survivors of the building collapse at the hospital on Thursday before inaugurating a tribunal of inquiry into the incident.\n\nQuotable: \u201cAs much as we sympathise with all concerned, we will also ensure that we are open and thorough in investigating the cause of the collapse,\u201d the Governor said.\n\nBabatunde Fashola: The Federal Minister of Works and Housing has described the building collapse as a \u201chorrific tragedy\u201c.\n\nLawmakers quiz Amaechi Over Niger Republic railway\n\nMembers of the National Assembly joint committees on land and marine transport have questioned the construction of a standard gauge Kano-Maradi rail line, while plans are being made to build what they describe as archaic rail lines for the South-East and North-Central.\n\nCommittee members made their feelings known to the Minister of Transport, Mr Rotimi Amaechi when he appeared before them to defend his ministry\u2019s 2022 budget proposal.\n\n\u201cWhy is the ministry doing a 287-kilometer of railway track from Kano to Maradi that you will fund with Nigerian money borrowed for Nigerians to be paid by our children to do a world-class railway to Maradi,\u201d Hon. Pat Asadu said.\n\n\u201cI also know the economy of Niger Republic and I believe the economy of the South-East is bigger than that of Maradi. I am not even talking of South-South.\u201d\n\nAmaechi insisted that the Niger Republic rail-line was driven by economic considerations.\n\nThe construction of the Kano-Maradi railway has generated controversy ever since the Federal Government announced the project.\n\nWhat else is happening?\n\nAdamawa State: Seven persons have been killed with several others injured during an attack by gunmen on the Negga community in the Numan Local Government Area.\n\nASUU: The academic union has given the Federal Government a 48-hour ultimatum to rescue the victims who were kidnapped from the University of Abuja (UNIABUJA) on Tuesday. The kidnappers are demanding a N50m ransom.\n\nUnrest: Some commercial tricycle operators, popularly known as Keke Napep, clashed with police officers in the Meiran area of Lagos State after an officer reportedly stabbed a driver over a bribe.\n\nCrime and punishment: A civil servant has been sentenced to 28-years imprisonment in Maiduguri for engaging in an N86.1 million contract fraud.\n\nKwara State: Two minors were raped after suspected Fulani herdsmen attacked Nuku village in Kaiama Local Government.\n\nTigray crisis: Ethiopian lawmakers on Thursday endorsed a state of emergencyafter rebels advanced on the capital, sparking a US warning that an aid crisis that has already plunged hundreds of thousands into hunger could worsen further.\n\nVatican matters: Pope Francis has appointed a woman to head up the governorate of the Vatican, as he forges ahead with a mission to achieve greater gender equality in the Church.\n\nWhat to watch on YouTube\n\nCOP26: The biggest climate change event this year is all about encouraging countries to cut greenhouse gas emissions quickly enough to save the planet. Our correspondent, Ayoola Kassim, is in Glasgow.\n\nCrimebeat: A man in Benin-city allegedly killed his wife over a domestic dispute and tried to hide it.\n\nPat Utomi: The former presidential candidate believes some powerful Nigerians are hoarding dollars for election campaigns.\n\nAnd that\u2019s it for this morning. Join me again tomorrow.\n\nFor more updates, visit www.channelstv.com\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget to subscribe to our YouTube channel: http://bit.ly/2Hb8hjx\n\nWatch us on DSTV:420 | Sky UK: 518 | Live Stream: www.channelstv.com/live",

Irish startup Provizio is developing technology that uses machine learning to analyse data from sensors attached to a car.\n\nIn time, its founder Barry Lunn hopes that will allow emergency braking systems to kick into gear 10 times faster than previously.\n\nCode writing\n\nThe age of AI shunning all need for human help, and writing its own computer code, is closer than you may think.\n\nOne initiative generating a buzz in Lisbon this week was Copilot, a joint project by software development platform GitHub and research lab OpenAI.\n\nThe tool can auto-complete chunks of code, understanding the intentions of the human software engineer.\n\nBut New York University researchers suggest the computers still need us: around 40 percent of the time, the code still has bugs in it.\n\nDeepfakes\n\nRecent years have seen growing alarm over deepfake technology, in which stunningly realistic likenesses of living people can be made to act as the creator pleases.\n\nDeepfakes appearing to show actor Tom Cruise went viral this year, prompting fresh questions over whether the technology could be used for fraud or even political manipulation.\n\nReface, a US startup founded by Ukrainians, wants to use deepfake AI for more playful purposes, allowing the user to swap Justin Bieber\u2019s head, or the Mona Lisa\u2019s, for their own.\n\nBut co-founder Ivan Altsybieiev imagines a future where people could mock up entire remakes of their favourite TV shows, starring themselves.\n\nA \u201cfuture where all content could be personalised\u201d, he told AFP.",

It\u2019s never our intention to add to the pains of our people, hence our decision to suspend the sit-at-home,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe IPOB spokesman stated further that the gorup\u2019s leadership is only interested in its referendum and peaceful agitation for self determination, and can not by under any guise be seen to be interfering with any electoral process.\n\nMr Powerful urged the people of Anambra State should go out enmasse and peacefully exercise their franchise come 6th November 20121 and accordingly, chose a leader of their Choice and should not be intimidated by anybody, group of persons or security agents.\n\n\u201cCredible intelligence available to us confirmed that the Nigeria DSS has concluded arrangement to deploy a branch of their trained terrorist group to Anambra state come 6th Day 2021, to unleash mayhem on our people and attribute the killing to peaceful IPOB members.\n\n\u201cAnambrarians should vote and standby to protect their votes. No rigging of any kind will be tolerated on the Anambra State governorship election. It must be transparent, free and fair to all.\n\n\u201cWe wish to thank Biafrans, IPOB members worldwide, friends of Biafra and lovers of freedom for their continued support for our dogged struggle for independence, the statement added.\n\nIPOB however, warned those it described as \u201cdetractors, traitors and enemies of Biafra not to cause confusion by imputing motives to our decision.\n\nThe group added that it doesn\u2019t expect anybody to observe, monitor or enforce the suspended order otherwise such action will be considered a rebellion to the highest leadership of our global movement.\n\nMeanwhile, the group declared that it oppressors should not take its decision as an act of cowardice. \u201cIPOB still believes that our elders, religious leaders, political leaders and various stakeholders will live up to their promises in their engagements and efforts towards securing the unconditional release of our leader.\n\n\u201cWe therefore urge all Biafrans and residents of Biafra to go about their lawful businesses without fear of any molestations. All agents of darkness recruited by our enemies to inflict pains on our people under the guise of enforcing the sit-at-home are hereby warned to steer clear or brace up for the consequences of their evil action.\n\n\u201cIPOB will not relent in our pursuit for Biafra freedom.

Nigeria is championing the crucial role of biotech cowpeas.\n\n\u201cThousands of farmers across Nigeria who planted the biotech cowpea this planting season attest to the multiple benefits they derived compared to prior seasons. The commercialization of the transgenic bean underscores that extensive safety studies were conducted to demonstrate that it is safe for both human and livestock consumption,\u201d Smith stated.\n\nSmith added that the new paradigm of scientific collaboration was due to unprecedented joint efforts and called on biotech and agricultural experts including multilateral entities, governments, the private sector, NGOs and academia to strategically collaborate to increase the adoption of transgenic crops across Africa with the aim of strengthening food security.\n\n\u201cThe workshop was a prime occasion for stakeholders in the biotech space to strengthen innovative partnerships, especially public, private partnerships that will drive the future of biotechnology in Nigeria. The commercialization of biotech cowpea has become the latest milestone in Nigeria\u2019s robust biosafety regulatory process,\u201d Smith noted.\n\nThe workshop was organised by the Foreign Agricultural Service of the U.S. Mission in Nigeria in partnership with National Biotechnology Development Agency (NABDA), African Agricultural Technology Foundation, (AATF), National Biosafety Management Agency (NBMA) and Open Forum on Agricultural Biotechnology in Africa.\n\nThe Foreign Agricultural Service is the overseas arm of the United States Department of Agriculture that offers a variety of services to American and Nigerian agribusiness companies, government and non-government entities involved in agricultural trade and development.\n\nThe service helps developing countries strengthen sustainable agricultural practices by providing capacity building opportunities.",

          "text": "Ethiopia\u2019s Tigray forces are joining with other armed and opposition groups in an alliance against Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed to seek a political transition after a year of devastating war, organizers say.\n\nThe signing in Washington on Friday includes the Tigray forces that have been fighting Ethiopian and allied forces, as well as the Oromo Liberation Army now fighting alongside the Tigray forces and seven other groups from around the country.\n\nThe alliance is forming as U.S. special envoy Jeffrey Feltman is in Ethiopia\u2019s capital meeting with senior government officials amid calls for an immediate cease-fire and talks to end the war that has killed thousands of people since November 2020. The U.S. said he met with the deputy prime minister and defense and finance ministers on Thursday.\n\nThe new United Front of Ethiopian Federalist Forces seeks to \u201cestablish a transitional arrangement in Ethiopia\u201d so the prime minister can go as soon as possible, organizer Yohanees Abraha, who is with the Tigray group, told The Associated Press late Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe next step will be, of course, to start meeting and communicating with countries, diplomats and international actors in Ethiopia and abroad.\u201d\n\nHe said the new alliance is both political and military. It has had no communication with Ethiopia\u2019s government, he added.\n\nA spokesman for the Oromo Liberation Army, Odaa Tarbii, confirmed the new alliance. When asked whether it meant to force Abiy out, he replied that it depended on Ethiopia\u2019s government and events over the coming weeks. \u201cOf course we prefer if there\u2019s a peaceful and orderly transition with Abiy being removed,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe goal is to be as inclusive as possible. We know this transition requires all stakeholders,\u201d he added. But as for members of the prime minister\u2019s Prosperity Party, \u201cthere would have to be a process. Many members would have to go through investigation, possibly be prosecuted\u201d for crimes related to the war.\n\nThe spokeswoman for the prime minister, Billene Seyoum, addressed the new alliance Thursday evening when she tweeted that \u201cany outliers that rejected the democratic processes Ethiopia embarked upon cannot be for democratization,\u201d pointing out Abiy\u2019s opening-up of political space after taking office in 2018. His reforms included welcoming some opposition groups home from exile.\n\nThe spokeswoman said she had no further comment Friday, and had no information on whether the prime minister would be meeting with the U.S. special envoy.\n\nThe OLA spokesman in reply to her tweet noted that some of the people who returned to Ethiopia were later put in prison or under house arrest. \u201cA lot of goodwill was lost over the last three years,\u201d he said.\n\nOther groups signing on Friday include the Afar Revolutionary Democratic Unity Front, Agaw Democratic Movement, Benishangul People\u2019s Liberation Movement, Gambella Peoples Liberation Army, Global Kimant People Right and Justice Movement/ Kimant Democratic Party, Sidama National Liberation Front and Somali State Resistance, according to organizers.",

          "title": "US Special Envoy Arrives Ethiopia as America Scrambles to Avert Bloodshed in Addis Ababa",
          "text": "The United States Special Envoy for the Horn of Africa, Jeffrey Feltman, arrived Ethiopia on Thursday for a two-day visit to secure a ceasefire as the American government scrambles to avert bloody war after Tigray rebel attack forces announced they had inched closer to taking over Addis Ababa.\n\nThe US is an ally of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed\u2019s government but insisted it would not tolerate unjustified violence on the part of the Ethiopian government.\n\nThe special envoy is in Addis Ababa to stop military operations and had a ceasefire roundtable between the warring parties.\n\nReuters reported that the African Union Commission Chair, Moussa Faki Mahamat met Feltman to discuss efforts towards dialogue and political solutions to the conflict, which pits the central government against the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF) and its allies.\n\nThe European Union and the East African bloc, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), joined the chorus of bodies calling for a ceasefire.\n\nUgandan President Yoweri Museveni announced an IGAD meeting on November 16, to discuss the war.\n\nThe Intergovernmental Authority on Development, according to NBC News, also appealed for an immediate ceasefire, imploring the parties to engage in peace talks.\n\nOn his part, Kenyan President, Uhuru Kenyatta said \u201cthe fighting must stop\u201d on Wednesday, urging the government and rebels to, \u201cput down their arms and to cease the fighting, to talk, and to find a path to sustainable peace.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he had spoken to Ahmed on Wednesday \u201cto offer my good offices to create the conditions for a dialogue, so the fighting stops.\u201d\n\nBefore his trip to Ethiopia, at Washington-based think-tank US Institute for Peace, Feltman said as many as 900,000 people in Tigray faced famine-like conditions, while 90 per cent of the population needs aid.\n\nHe added that the most serious obstacle to getting food, medicine, and other critical assistance was the Ethiopian government, which imposed bureaucratic obstacles and expelled seven senior UN humanitarian and human rights officials in October.\n\n\u201cThis, unfortunately, suggests an intentional effort by the authorities to deprive Ethiopians who are suffering of receiving lifesaving assistance,\u201d said Feltman.\n\nMeanwhile, the special envoy said the government\u2019s airstrikes and TPLF\u2019s alliances with other disaffected armed groups were \u201calarming,\u201d and warned that the country risked sliding into a bigger conflagration.\n\n\u201cA multi-decade civil war in Ethiopia would be disastrous for its future and for its people,\u201d Feltman warned.\n\n\u201cWe urge the government of Ethiopia, the TPLF, and the other belligerents to give peace a chance, to choose a different path and engage in dialogue without preconditions.\u201d\n\nFeltman deflected accusations that the US was biased toward the TPLF.\n\n\u201cLet me be clear: We oppose any TPLF move to Addis or any attempt by the TPLF to besiege Addis. This is a message we have also underscored in our engagement with TPLF leaders,\u201d said the US envoy.\n\nHe also denied claims that President Joe Biden\u2019s administration planned to replace Ahmed with a TPLF-dominated regime.\n\nAccording to USIP, Feltman said the Biden administration was prepared to impose sanctions targeting all parties to the conflict and those obstructing humanitarian operations, leaving thousands killed, hundreds raped, and over 2.5 million people forced to flee their homes.\n\nIn September, the US president issued an executive order to impose sanctions on parties \u201ccomplicit in prolonging,\u201d the conflict in the Tigray region.\n\nOn November 2, citing \u201cgross violations of internationally recognised human rights,\u201d Biden informed Congress of his intent to end a preferential trade designation for Ethiopia as of January 1, 2022. The African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) provides market access to the US for some sub-Saharan African countries.\n\nMeanwhile, Ahmed declared a six-month state of emergency on Wednesday, calling on his compatriots to defend their neighbourhoods if rebels arrive in the capital.\n\nOn Sunday, he boasted on Facebook that: \u201cWe will bury the enemy with our blood and bones.\u201d His rhetorics have drawn the ire of Facebook, which removed a post by Abiy urging Ethiopians to rise up and \u201cbury\u201d the Tigray rebels.\n\nAccording to the social media\u2019s spokeswoman Emily Cain, Ahmed\u2019s post on Sunday violated Facebook\u2019s policies against inciting and supporting violence.\n\n\u201cThe obligation to die for Ethiopia belongs to all of us,\u201d said Ahmed, telling Ethiopians to fight the rebels by \u201cholding any weapon or capacity.\u201d\n\nThe US and other countries have warned Ethiopia about \u201cdehumanising rhetoric\u201d after the prime minister in comments in July described the Tigray forces as \u201ccancer\u201d and \u201cweeds.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Ethiopia\u2019s government yesterday said it was on the brink of victory in an \u201cexistential war\u201d against Tigrayan rebels and vowed to fight on, in an apparent rebuke of international ceasefire calls on the conflict\u2019s first anniversary.\n\n\u201cThis is not a country that crumbles under foreign propaganda! We are fighting an existential war!\u201d the government\u2019s communications office said on Facebook, following advances by rebel groups towards the capital.\n\nThe combative statement could dampen hopes for a negotiated settlement between the government of Prime Minister, winner of the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize, and the TPLF rebel group.\n\n\u201cThe obligation to die for Ethiopia belongs to all of us,\u201d said Ahmed, telling Ethiopians to fight the rebels by \u201cholding any weapon or capacity.\u201d\n\nThe US and other countries have warned Ethiopia about \u201cdehumanising rhetoric\u201d after the prime minister in comments in July described the Tigray forces as \u201ccancer\u201d and \u201cweeds.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Ethiopia\u2019s government thursday said it was on the brink of victory in an \u201cexistential war\u201d against Tigrayan rebels and vowed to fight on, in an apparent rebuke of international ceasefire calls on the conflict\u2019s first anniversary.\n\n\u201cThis is not a country that crumbles under foreign propaganda!

          "text": "Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has declared three days of mourning in Lagos State over the Ikoyi building collapse tragedy which occurred on Monday.\n\nThis is just as he has inaugurated the investigation tribunal that would conduct an inquiry into what was responsible for the collapse of the 21-storey structure that was still under construction on Gerrard Road, Ikoyi. Reports late Thursday indicated that the body of the property developer, Femi Osibona had been pulled from the rubble while that of his friend, Wale Bob-Oseni, is yet to be recovered.\n\nBob-Oseni, who was to catch a flight to the US, briefly made a detour to see the project on the invitation of the developer but did not walk out alive.\n\nAs at the time of going to press, nine people were rescued, and more than 30 have been confirmed dead.\n\nThe Governor said all flags are to be flown at half-mast in public and private buildings and official engagements cancelled during the mourning period.\n\nThe Lagos State Government in a statement signed by Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr. Gbenga Omotoso commiserated with all those who lost their loved ones in the unfortunate incident.\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cGovernor Sanwo-Olu has visited the site thrice to encourage the rescuers and console relations of those who are believed to have been trapped in the 21-storey building. \u201cHe was today at the hospital to cheer up those injured before swearing in a six-man panel of Inquiry to find out why the building went down and recommend measures to prevent such incidents.\u201d\n\nThe governor who inaugurated the six-man panel of enquiry also signed the instrument legitimising the composition of the panel empowering the tribunal to invite or summon anyone and organisation useful to the investigation.\n\nMembers of the tribunal, who were totally drawn from the private sector, took the oath at the event held in the LASWA Building at Falomo, Ikoyi.\n\n\u201cTheir duty begins immediately and they are expected to report back within four weeks,\u201d the statement added.\n\nPresident of Nigeria Institute of Town Planners (NITP), Mr. Toyin Ayinde, is the chairman of the panel, while Ekundayo Onajobi, a lawyer in a private law firm, is the Secretary.\n\nOther panel members are a structural engineer, Dr. Akintilo Idris Adeleke; an architect, Yinka Ogundairo; representative of Institute of Builders, Mr. Godfrey O. Godfrey, and Mrs. Bunmi Ibrahim, a real estate lawyer.\n\nSanwo-Olu, who described the event as a \u201csad one\u201d for Lagos was visibly in a sombre mood during the inauguration.\n\nThe governor said members of the public deserved to know what went wrong.\n\nHe stressed that the work of the panel would not bring back the lives lost, but added that it would help to prevent reoccurrence of such tragic events.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are gathered here to perform a sad but necessary duty, which is the inauguration of a 6-member Panel of Inquiry into the collapse of the 21-storey building at Gerrard Road, Ikoyi, on Monday. It is a solemn moment for me personally, but this is an important assignment. Indeed, the generation coming after will not forgive us if we don\u2019t do the right thing on this incident.\n\n\u201cThe inauguration of this panel shows sincerely that the state government is interested in unravelling and get to the root cause of what happened to the building, so that everyone concerned, including the government, will learn from the very unfortunate incident.\n\n\u201cLagosians and the world will be watching and waiting keenly, with the full expectation that the immediate and remote causes of this tragedy will be uncovered,\u201d he added.\n\nSanwo-Olu identified with distraught families of victims trapped under the collapsed structure, expressing the belief that the outcome of the investigation would assuage their pains and worries.\n\nThe oath taken by the tribunal members, the governor said, empowers them with adequate privileges of government powers to conduct independent investigation without fear, favour, interference and restrictions.\n\nThe governor believed the tribunal members would bring their expertise and professionalism to bear in unravelling the infractions that brought down the building.\n\n\u201cWhat this tribunal will be doing over the course of the next few weeks will have important implications for building safety and for emergency response, not just in Lagos, but in the entire country.\n\n\u201cIt will also go a long way towards ensuring that the families of the innocent victims of this avoidable tragedy experience some sort of closure and get justice,\u201d Sanwo-Olu said.\n\nAyinde said Lagos was in its \u201cdark period\u201d, given the record of fatalities from the site of the building collapse.\n\nHe pledged on behalf of members to discharge the duty with all sense of responsibility and in line with ethics.\n\n\u201cWe accept at our own liberty and with humility the important assignment the State has placed before us. We will go ahead with a sense of dedicated responsibility. This exercise can only make the expected difference if we all agree to place value on Nigerian life.\n\n\u201cAs members, we promise to be guided by professional standards and hope that we will chart a new course that will guarantee the safety of lives of Nigeria citizens,\u201d Ayinde said.\n\nFor the third time within 72 hours, Babajide Sanwo-Olu was at the site of the Ikoyi building collapse to see how the search and recovery operation was being conducted, and also to boost the morale of the emergency responders on site.\n\nThe governor expressed satisfaction with the rescue operation, commending the first responders for their efforts. He also met with some of the distressed family members at the site, cheering them and raising their hopes, while the rescue efforts progressed.\n\nSanwo-Olu was in company of his deputy, Dr. Obafemi Hamzat, at the site for over three hours.\n\nThe actual number of persons still trapped in the collapsed building remained unclear as at Thursday afternoon.\n\nSanwo-Olu, while giving an update to the press, disclosed that family members had submitted 19 names of those still missing, saying the ongoing corona inquest on the bodies evacuated from the site was expected to be concluded today (Friday), after which families would be invited to identify them.\n\nHe said: \u201cYesterday (Wednesday), we opened a register for people that have missing persons or loved ones whom they believed must have been at the site before the collapse.\n\n\u201cAs I speak here, it is only 19 names of missing persons that have been registered. Some of them have pictures, others do not. This list would help us to get information on manifest of those at the site.\n\n\u201cAs at this afternoon, we have recovered a total of 32 bodies. We are conducting a corona inquest on the bodies and by tomorrow (Friday), we hope the exercise would have been concluded. That is the deadline we gave to the corona, so that the families can come and identify the bodies recovered so far.\u201d\n\nEarlier on Thursday, the Governor visited Lagos Island General Hospital where survivors of the building collapse are being given medical attention.\n\nOne of the nine people rescued alive, Sanwo-Olu said, has been moved to the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH) in Ikeja for advanced medical examination, \u201cbut he is not in a life-threatening situation.\u201d\n\nThree survivors were discharged two days ago, he disclosed.\n\nThe governor said he had ordered structural integrity test on two high-rise structures in the premises where the 21-storey collapsed. The action, he said, was necessary to safeguard the lives of emergency workers on the rescue operation.\n\nSanwo-Olu appealed to journalists covering the incident on speculative reporting and sensationalism, asking them to confirm any unclear details about the search and rescue operation from the official channel of communication. The governor was reacting to inconsistent figures of fatality being spread by the media.\n\nHe said: \u201cMinistries of Information, Special Duties and Health are fully on ground at the scene. Among these key ministries, members of the public can get answers to any information not clear to them.\u201d\n\nThe multi-sectoral search and rescue operation was ongoing as at press time. The effort was being led by teams of Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA) and National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), with the support of construction giants, Julius Berger, Craneburg, HiTech and China Civil Engineering Construction Company (CCECC).\n\nSegun James",
