          "title": "How Nnamdi Kanu deceived us to train IPOB/ESN militias \u2014dismissed soldiers",
          "text": "\n\n\n\ndismissed soldier\n\nBy Ifeanyi Okolie\n\nThree dismissed soldiers who took part in training 4000 members of the Eastern Security Network, ESN, the armed wing of the Indigenous People of Biafra, POB, have revealed how they were lured with money and promises.\n\nVanguard gathered that the dismissed soldiers who were arrested by operatives of the Force Intelligence Response Team, IRT were identified as Linus Owalo, Godswill Steven and Chinasa Orji.\n\nREAD ALSOGunmen kill solider, 3 others in Plateau\n\nThey were arrested recently after operatives of the IRT acted on intelligence they generated from some members of IPOB when they raided the group\u2019s hideouts in Imo, Anambra, Delta and the Federal Capital Territory, FCT, Abuja.\n\nPolice sources disclosed that, Owalo, who was enlisted into the Nigeria Army in 2013 and was attached to 102 Guard Brigade Battalion, was dismissed from the army in 2019. His colleagues; Orji and Steven, who were enlisted into the Nigeria Army in 2015 and 2017 respectively were trained at the 133 Special Force Battalion and got dismissed in 2020.\n\nVanguard gathered that the ex-soldiers were promised a double of their salaries in the army before joining the IPOB military camp in Abia State where they trained over 4000 IPOB volunteered fighters and then moved to Asaba Delta State where they trained another 400 IPOB members.\n\nDuring their confessions, the suspects said they were promised to be sent abroad for further military training and that when State of Biafra was achieved, they would become military generals in the republic. They added that when they discovered that Kanu\u2019s promises were all lies, they decided to quit.\n\nTheir confessions\n\nIn his confession, 32-year-old Linus Owalo, a native of Layal Local Government Area of Cross Rivers State, who is married with two children, said; \u201cI was enlisted into the Nigeria Army in 2013 and posted to the Guards Brigade Headquarters, FCT Abuja. But in 2019, I was absent from duty and the army authorities arrested me.\n\nI was charged and subsequently dismissed from the service. Since then I have been seeking reinstatement and life has not been easy for me and my family. Then I approached one man for a job who however linked me to one Mr Williams who could help me get a job. Mr Williams told me about Biafra and their dream to achieve a sovereign state. He invited me to their meeting where they welcomed me warmly and I was given a half bag of garri, five tubers of yam and they also paid a visit to my wife and children.\n\nI then told them that I was making plans to get reinstated into the Nigeria Army but they told me that I should forget about it that their Supreme leader, Nnamdi Kanu, would make life better for me if I could train the IPOB militias known as ESN.\n\nThey also told me that I would be sent abroad for more military training after I must have trained the militias and that when Birafra was actualized I would become a general in the Biafra Army. I took an oath of allegiance to Nnamdi Kanu and also vowed that I would die if I betrayed the Biafra struggle. I was then given the sum of N100,000 before moving to a forest in Abia State, where I met over 4000 men who wanted to be trained.\n\nThis was in October 2020. I also met some other dismissed soldiers of the Nigeria Army who were there to train the men.\n\nWe commenced training the moment I arrived and we started with push-ups, moral training, then moved to fire movement known as field craft. The people managing the camp refused to trust us and they didn\u2019t involve us in their meetings.\n\nThree months into the training, they sent us to Delta State, where we met a man known as Be-in-Spirit who took us to the camp. They told us that when we got to Delta they would take care of us very well but when we got there we discovered that the camp had been shut down. I couldn\u2019t talk to Nnamdi Kanu, I was just talking to his boys. I discovered that I had been brainwashed and used by IPOB\u201d.\n\nThe other suspect, Godswill Steven, a 33-year-old native of Bende Local Government Area of Abia State, in his confession said; \u201cI joined the Nigeria Army in June 2017 and I was attached to the Special Force and I had my four months training in Kontagora. I also went to Kaba, Kogi State for another three months training, before I was sent to Takum in Taraba State for three more months training.\n\nAt the completion of my training I was sent to 133 Battalion, where I sustained an injury. I was posted to Maiduguri in 2018 and I fought at Garuda in Maiduguri, I survived the battle even with my injuries. I wanted to treat myself but the army authorities refused to allow me go for treatment.\n\nWhen the pain became too much, I left to treat myself and when I returned, I was arrested and locked up in a cell where I met Chinasa Orji. We became friends and while in the cell he told me that one of his friends called him from Senegal and informed him that Nnamdi Kanu was recruiting soldiers to train IPOB militias.\n\nHe said Nnamdi Kanu was ready to pay them twice the money they were earning as soldiers. He also told me that Nnamdi Kanu would take the soldiers abroad and when Biafra was achieved he would make them generals in the Biafra. I accepted the offer and they paid us N100,000 each which was twice the salary I was receiving from the Nigeria Army. We then traveled to Abia State where we took oaths to be loyal to Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nWe were also taken into the camp where we gave the militias trainings on combat and special forces maneuvering. After spending one month in the Abia State Camp, we were transferred to another camp, where I spent three weeks training the militias I met there. I left the camp, when it became clear that the promise they made to take us abroad for training wasn\u2019t realistic. I came down to Abuja where I got a security job before I was eventually arrested\u201d, he stated.\n\nThe third suspect, Chinasa Orji, a native of Isikuator Local Government Area, aged 23, said: \u201cI was enlisted into the Nigeria Army in 2015 but was dismissed in 2018 after I attended the burial of my elder brother, a soldier who was killed on 22 August 2018. My elder brother was a soldier who was killed when he went on escort duty in Bayelsa State. My bosses refused to give me a pass to attend the burial but I went on my own while my bank account was frozen.\n\nWhen I returned, I was arrested and detained. While in detention I had access to my phone and I started chatting with one of my friends known as Victor who told me that Mazi Nnamdi Kanu needed my service to train some IPOB militias. He told me that Kanu was ready to pay me twice the money I was earning in the army and I told my friend Steven, who was also in detention, about it and he accepted.\n\nThey sent us money which we used to travel from Yola, Adamawa State to Abia State and we were picked up by some IPOB members and taken into the forest where we took oaths and started training the militias.\n\nI was paid N100,000 but I got angry when they couldn\u2019t fulfill their promise of taking us abroad for training.",

          "text": "Demands sack of Akpabio\n\nBy Chioma Onuegbu \u2013 Uyo\n\nA coalition of ex-agitators in Akwa Ibom State under the auspices of the \u201cUnyekisong Akwa Ibom\u201d has threatened to embark on a mass protest across the country if a substantive board of Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC, is not constituted within 14 days.\n\nThis is contained n a statement signed by Dede Udofia and Ibanga Ekeng, on behalf of the group and made available to newsmen on Friday in Uyo.\n\nThey lamented that the non-constitution of a substantive board of the Commission has reduced the agency to a mere regional outfit without positive impact on the people of the region.\n\nThe statement reads in part \u201cWe view the appointment of an Interim Management Committee and now a Sole Administrator to run the affairs of the NDDC as well as oversee the so-called NDDC forensic audit as illegal, even when the nominees for the new NDDC Board had already been screened and confirmed by the Senate in 2019.\n\n\u201cWithout mincing words, this blatant disregard to the decision of the highest law-making organ in the land with regards to the properly-conducted screening exercise has succeeded in enhancing the perpetration of fraud, financial recklessness and mismanagement of the region\u2019s economic resources by a few power-seeking individuals.\n\n\u201cIt has also resulted in the non-representation of the nine niger delta states in the Commission for the past nineteen months thus robbing these member states of the benefits from the Commission\u2019s activities. Under the current dispensation, the NDDC has been reduced to a mere regional outfit without any significant mandate or positive impact.\n\n\u201cIt has also succeeded in shortchanging the people of the region as well as results in the gross abuse of procedures and laid-down processes. It would also be an understatement to say that projects undertaken during the period are done without due diligence.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in the history of the Commission, the Supervisory body (Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs) is now directing the day-to-day activities of the Commission which is supposed to be autonomous, and which was so during the time the Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation was supervising the Commission\u201d\n\nThe ex-agitators further demanded that the Amnesty Programme must abe urgently restructured with the appointment of a substantive Special Adviser to the President/Coordinator to make the agency functional.\n\nThey decried a situation where the NDDC is now operating as an appendage of the Ministry due to the alleged manipulation of the entire process by the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs and office of the National Security Adviser to the President, stressing that they would no longer keep mum while money-hungry politicians continue to vandalize the Commission\u2019s resources at the expense of the suffering masses.\n\n\u201cWe therefore demand for his immediate removal from the position of Minister of Niger Delta Affairs as he has proven to be the major problem to the Niger Delta region today. The Office of the National Security Adviser to the President should also be relieved of its role as the supervisor of the Programme, as the NSA has only succeeded in worsening the activities of the Amnesty Office.\n\n\u201cThe NSA\u2019s office cannot even effectively handle the current security challenges in the country, but is rather busy siphoning funds appropriated for the Amnesty Programme.\n\n\u201cLet it be stated for the avoidance of doubt that we have already started mobilizing and if the Federal Government fails to meet these demands on or before 14 days from the day of this press release, we shall be left with no other option than to embark on mass protests and shut-down of all major federal government projects and parastatals including Exxon Mobil and NDDC until this issue is urgently and properly addressed\u201d, they stated.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

We want that board to be constituted, the ultimatum stands. After the ultimatum and nothing is done, don\u2019t blame anybody.\u201d\n\nSpeaking earlier Akpabio made reference to how war would break out in the Niger Delta if tension continues to grow.\n\nHe said that it was necessary for the youths to give peace a chance going by the fragile nature of the Niger Delta region, saying that \u201cwe must not allow our region to boil. We must support the Federal Government, particularly this present government.\u201d\n\nHe said his visit was primarily to consult the people on the way forward and also to appeal for peace.\n\nIt was, however, learnt that the minister left the peace parley at Oporoza with the promise to commence the process of constituting the substantive NDDC board on returning to Abuja.",

          "title": "Invasion plot by foreign herders: Yoruba groups to comb South-West forests",
          "text": "From Lukman Olabiyi, Lagos, Bamigbola Gbolagunte, Akure, and Lawrence Enyoghasu, Lagos\n\nSeveral security and socio-political groups in the South-West have declared their readiness to repel any attacks launched on any part of the region by foreign herders.\n\nThere are also plans by the different groups to comb the vast forests of the region in a bid to flush out criminal elements posing as lawful herders.\n\nChairman of South West Security Network, Operation Amotekun in Oyo State, General Ajibola Togun, rtd had on Thursday alleged that an invasion of the six South-West states by foreign herdsmen from Mali, Niger Republic, Chad and Burkina Faso, was imminent.\n\nHe also disclosed that these non-Nigerians are already hiding in forest reserves in the zone, saying the invasion by the herders would soon happen and that it would definitely begin from Yorubaland.\n\nIn separate interviews yesterday, leaders of the South West Security Network, Operation Amotekun, Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, Iba Gani Adams, and Agbekoya, among others, warned the foreign bandits disguising as herders to steer clear of the six states of the South West, warning of dire consequences if such plots were actualized.\n\nThe groups threatened to deal decisively with Fulani herdsmen or any hoodlum that might want to perpetrate any form of trouble in the region.\n\nChairman, Forum of Amotekun Commanders in the South West, Mr Adeleye Adetunji said his men are battle ready to fight any form of crime in any of the six states of the region. He called for proactive efforts of all Yoruba people to fight the menace of insecurity to a standstill in the region.\n\nAdetunji who expressed the determination of the corps to bring an end to insecurity, especially killing, kidnapping and banditry in the region, maintained that efforts are on top gear to involve local vigilantes in the activities of Amotekun.\n\nHe added that the conventional security agencies were being carried along in the fight against insecurity in the region, stressing that the fight against crime is a collective one, which should not be left in the hands of only the security agents.\n\nAlso speaking, the Field Commander of Operation Amotekun in Osun State, Chief Amitolu Shittu warned herders from any part of the world against coming to the South West region, warning that such efforts would be foiled. He said the forests in the South West would be combed to identify illegal herders, especially those from neighbouring countries. Shittu also cautioned those working for the herders within the region to desist from such act before they are identified and made to face the music.\n\nHe said: \u201cVehicular movements from one place to another is guaranteed by the 1999 constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Nevertheless, that privilege should not be taken as a way to foment crimes in other regions.\n\n\u201cOur borders are too porous and that is responsible for easy movement of the herders from our neighbouring countries, especially Chad and Niger. The fact, however remains that the South West will not tolerate such illegal migration and anyone caught will be taught serious lessons.\u201d\n\nAare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, Otunba, Iba Gani Adams, said the Oodua People\u2019s Congress (OPC), which he heads, has been raising similar alarms has severally warned that the forests in the region had been infiltrated by criminal herders, regretting that such warnings fell on deaf ears.\n\nHe said Fulani headers were indeed plotting an invasion but warned that the perpetrators would meet their waterloo. He also asserted that certain Yoruba leaders were giving support to the activities of criminal herders \u201cby empowering them spiritually and traditionally.\u201d\n\nHe said the OPC members are always battle ready and willing to fight in the defence of Yoruba land.\n\n\u201cThey have indeed surrounded us. We are shocked that when the herdsmen want to establish themselves in any community and the community rejects them, you see Nigerian Army backing them up and forcing them on the community. Then the community can\u2019t access their lands. In a community like Owo, we have nothing less than 10,000 herdsmen in the forests. There are allegations of unknown helicopters coming to drop food for them.\n\n\u201cI said it about two years ago but people didn\u2019t believe me that there are many dangerous herdsmen in Igbo-Ora, Oke Ogun and other parts of Oyo State. They were there until they were chased out by OPC and others. They have almost overrun the Middle-Belt and now in the South-West. The South-East has taken its destiny into its own hands.\n\n\u201cWe have to put our house in order. When we are alerting our people they don\u2019t do anything. They don\u2019t call for advice. Even there are some grassroots people conniving with these criminals. We have some Yoruba people empowering the herders spiritually. They give them our spiritual powers. They also help them to gather information about rich Yoruba people. We also have some members of the political class that give them support. The Obas have a big role to play in this. Some of the Obas take it with levity and when the crisis come, they would call the police, an agent of the government. We are in trouble and we have to work.\u201d\n\n\u201cNeighbouring countries have always encouraged crisis and banditry in Nigeria but they will not find it easy if they come to the South West. We have had enough political crisis and no crisis should brew in the South West again,\u201d he added.\n\nFulani invasion : Traditionally, we\u2019re prepared for them\u2013Agbekoya\n\nThe foremost farmers and hunters union in South West, Agbekoya Farmers Society, accused the Federal Government of tacitly supporting criminal herders in the region. The group warned, however, that it would not allow the invasion of any part of Yoruba land by foreign herders.\n\nNational Secretary of the union, Adegbenro Ogunlana, said: \u201cIt is the Federal Government that is encouraging and pampering them. That is why it seems difficult to check their movement.\n\n\u201cAgbekoya has what it uses to fight, and we are already preparing. We are not relenting. It\u2019s not until we start carrying guns that we are fighting. We have what can tame them, but we cannot be revealing everything in the public.\n\nThe Agbekoya scribe disclosed that apart from preparing for the invaders, members of Agbekoya would stage a protest on June 12 to express their feelings.\n\n\u201cInsecurity in the land is seriously affecting us. People cannot go to the farm, and there is poverty.\n\n\u201cBut we are very much prepared for the Fulani invaders. Traditionally we are prepared for them. It is only Agbekoya that do fight wars without using guns or cutlasses. That is why it takes us time before we respond or declare war on our enemies. Already, our members are stationed across the forests in South West. We are getting reports on daily basis and there are some other steps already taken as well which I can not reveal. But we are battle ready,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "From Olanrewaju Lawal, Birnin Kebbi\n\nThe Leadership of the Senate has donated N10 million to the victims\u2019 families of Warrah boat mishap in Ngaski Local Government Area of Kebbi State. Senator Adamu Aliero who led the Senate delegation, announced the donation in Birnin Kebbi on Friday, during their condolence visit to the Kebbi State Governor, Senator Abubakar Atiku Bagudu over the boat mishap.\n\nHe noted that the donation would be given to Emir of Yauri Emirate, who will then give it out to the victims\u2019 families. According to him the Senate is deeply concerned by the unfortunate incident, and will ensure that measures are taken by the Nigerian Inland Water Ways to take away trunks and bursting rocks that could cause the perennial accidents.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have lost many lives from 2003 to date and anytime the water recedes from the River Niger, we will not have this kind of accident. If these measures are taken, in addition to the one to be taken by HYPPADEC, we will drastically reduce the accident and provide succour to the people living along riverine areas.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Chief Whip of the Senate, Senator Uzor Orji Kalu who delivered the resolution of the Senate on the incident, told Governor Abubakar Atiku Bagudu that the entire Senate members were shocked because of the incident. He explained that the Senate Leader, Dr. Abdullahi Yahyah moved a motion over the incident and was seconded by Senator Adamu Aliero.\n\nAccording to him, the Senate in its wisdom decided to ask the national Inland Water Way to make sure that in the next budget, should provide money to make sure it removes those tree trunks and rocky areas in the river. \u201cThe Senate also plans to make special provision of funds to look around that area in terms of what they will be working with the state government inline with the policy of National Inland Water Way and other relief agencies. Senate in its resolution also asked NEMA to go to the area quickly, to see how they can help the people that have survived and reposition them.\n\n\u201cAnd Senate LSO asked that we should be able to make new laws that will protect our waterways and make sure that such incident do not recur again. The Senate also asked in the resolution that very soon new areas that would improve the waterways should be put in place to take care of the riverine areas.\u201d\n\nWhile condoling the Governor and people of the state, Senator Orji said: \u201c we are really touched in what happened. This is one motion that brought a lot of sympathy, a lot of crying on the floor of the Senate and I can see many of Senators, not only from Kebbi state, but across the country.\n\n\u201cThe Senate President himself told us to come here immediately, first, to condole with the governor of the state, the people of the state, Emir of Yauri Emirate and the people of Warrah where this incident happened and the local government area.\n\n\u201cSo, on behalf of our Senate President, on whose endorsement we are here today and the three Senators from Kebbi State, we want to genuinely ask you to accept our condolences. May the soul of the deceased rest in perfect peace.",

          "title": "Alleged random arrest of youths in South-East: FG plotting war on Igboland",
          "text": "By Vincent Kalu, Sunday Ani and Jude Chinedu, Enugu\n\nAgainst the alleged arrest of several youths in states in the South-East, President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Prof George Obiozor; First Republic Aviation Minister, Chief Mbazulike Amaechi and former Anambra State governor, Dr. Chukwuemeka Ezeife and others, have raised the alarm that the Federal Government is plotting war on Igboland.\n\nProf. Obiozor, during a press conference in Enugu on Friday, urged President Muhammadu Buhari to halt the use of brute force on the South-East and advised him to rather employ dialogue by engaging all Nigerian groups through their various leaders, instead of his decision to quell rising tension and agitations in the South-East with force.\n\n\u201cOhanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide called for dialogue to resolve the present national crisis. The Federal Government should acknowledge that because of the reality of Nigeria\u2019s irresistible pluralism, it is always preferable to go for dialogue instead of force.\n\n\u201cMay I repeat that history shows that military and violent means to solve national problem leads to national fractionalization, anarchy and eventual or inevitable disintegration. The Federal Government should realise and be confident enough, that no secessionist forces can defeat Nigeria,\u201d Obiozor said.\n\nWhile urging Buhari to reconsider the use of force in resolving the present national crisis, the Ohanaeze leader asked the government to consider it imperative to conduct urgent in-depth investigations on the destruction of lives and property in the Southeast.\n\nWhile condemning the statement by Buhari threatening to shock some Nigerians, Obiozor urged youths in Igbo land to join Ohanaeze Ndigbo in seeking a peaceful solution to the security challenges.\n\n\u201cOhanaeze Ndigbo wants to make it categorically clear that Ndigbo will not support the break-up of Nigeria but Ndigbo will not be victims of Nigerian unity. In this context, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide considers as unfortunate the implications of the President\u2019s statement.\n\n\u201cThe last time I checked or heard a President speak of shock and awe, it was reserved for the enemy, not the citizens. I also want to appeal to all Igbo youths involved in the violence that we cannot change our lots and situations by steering and provoking hatred amongst ourselves, raining insults and abuses on ourselves and declaring war against those who disagree with your own ideas and approach to resolving our common problems,\u201d Obiozor said.\n\nIn the same vein, Chief Amaechi said the killing of Igbo youth was not by accident, noting that anybody who can count his teeth with his tongues knows that there has been a plan to undo the Igbo and if possible visit genocide on Igbo land.\n\nAccording to him, only a tree hears that it will be cut down and still stands on the same place. He therefore called on elders of Igbo land, traditional rulers of Igbo land, religious leaders of Igbo land to come together and examine the whole thing and find a way to stop the killing or \u201creduce the chances of our being killed or genocide being visited on us.\n\n\u201cIt could be tactical withdrawal of some statements and actions of youth that could give ammunition to enemies or apply diplomacy and politics. And also approach leaders from other parts of Nigeria and appeal to them to look and observe what is happening and for them to know that if they finish the Igbo, they will be emboldened to go after the non-Igbo in order to achieve the century old objective, which is very well known.\n\n\u201cThey said they were killing IPOB and MASSOB youth, but most of them are innocent. The elders should talk to the youth, both IPOB and MASSOB, not to give weapons to their enemies to kill them. The Igbo should come together and used their feet to search what has fallen into the water,\u201d Amechi said.\n\nAlso, former Governor Ezeife, has accused the Federal Government of sending soldiers and policemen to the South-East with the sole intention to terrorise and kill the people, particularly the young men.\n\nEzeife, who said the incident had been going on for almost two weeks now, corroborated it with the instruction by the Inspector General of Police (IGP) to officers recently deployed to the South-East for special assignment, to deal ruthlessly with the people without bothering about human rights violations.\n\nAccording to him, since then, there have been gory pictures and stories of what have been happening in the East.\n\n\u201cI have been saying that the Buhari-led Federal Government is pushing the Southeast out of Nigeria. How can you explain that in a country where you are a citizen, your children are being massacred like that?\u201d\n\nHe alleged that the soldiers are targeting young men so that when the full war is declared, there won\u2019t be any young men to fight back. This, he said is the preliminary aspect of the war, and it is intended to kill all the young men who can come out and fight and leave the old men who can\u2019t even hold a gun.\n\n\u201cThis is what I see with my eyes. I can\u2019t understand how a president of Nigeria can be showing such a level of hatred for a part of the country he is governing,\u201d he said.\n\nFormer National Vice President of the Nigeria Bar Association, Monday Ubani, said he has read about such reports but was yet to get an independent confirmation from the governments in the South-East.\n\nHe said if the development is true, then the quietness of the governors, the senators and House of Representatives members from the South-East was disappointing, as they were the right people expected to raise the alarm.\n\nPresident General of Igbo Speaking Community in Lagos, Chief Sunday Ude, said what is happening in the South-East is very bad and unfair.\n\nHe called on the Federal Government to stop the killing as a matter of urgency because it is getting out of hand.",

          "title": "In a Shocking Overreaction, FG Suspends Twitter\u2019s Operations",
          "text": "\u2022Experts doubt ability to enforce order\n\n\u2022Twitter says \u2018suspension deeply concerning\u2019\n\n\u2022NBC now to license social media\n\n\u2022Nigerian Tweeps prepare to use Virtual Private Networks\n\nOur Correspondents\n\nIn a shocking overreaction, the federal government yesterday announced the suspension of the operations of micro-blogging platform/social networking service provider, Twitter, in the country.\n\nThis was apparently in response to Twitter\u2019s deletion of a \u201ccivil war\u201d post by President Muhammadu Buhari, which the social media platform said violated its policies.\n\nThe suspension of Twitter, popularly among Nigerians, sent shock across the country, with many describing the action as illegal and an infringement on their freedom of expression.\n\nOwners of the micro-blogging platform also reacted, saying the suspension is \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d.\n\nBut experts punched holes in federal government\u2019s ability to enforce the suspension of Twitter and deny Nigerians access to the platform, given the availability of other options of accessing the micro-blog, like using Virtual Private Networks (VPN), geo-location changes and other technologies.\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, in a statement signed by his media aide, Segun Adeyemi, said the measure against Twitter \u201cis with immediate effect.\u201d\n\nThe announcement by the Information Minister cited the \u201cpersistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\u201d\n\nThe statement titled, \u2018FG Suspends Twitter\u2019s Operations in Nigeria\u2019, read: \u201cThe Federal Government has suspended indefinitely the operations of the microblogging and social networking service, Twitter, in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn the press statement, Lai Mohammed also announced that the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) would immediately commence the process of licensing all social media operations in Nigeria. The NBC is the regulator of all radio and television stations in Nigeria.\n\nHowever, as at press time, Twitter was still up in Nigeria, as users still had access to the platform.\n\nPresident Buhari had condemned the attacks on police stations, prisons and offices of the Independent National Electoral Commission, especially in the South-East, warning that those supporting insurrection and violence in the country would be shocked.\n\nBuhari had tweeted, \u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian Civil War. Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.\u201d\n\nThe President\u2019s tweet riled some persons who felt he was insensitive to have made an analogy of the civil war. His critics subsequently reported the tweet to Twitter and the microblogging site later deleted the post with a comment, \u201cThis Tweet violated the Twitter Rules\u201d.\n\nAnalysts said yesterday that Twitter was not unfair to Buhari as being claimed, \u201cbecause a second Tweet by the Nigerian President that said almost the same thing as the \u2018civil war\u2019 Tweet was not deleted.\u201d\n\nDisapprovals Trail Suspension\n\nThe former vice president and PDP\u2019s presidential candidate in the last general election, Atiku Abubakar said in his verified twitter handle that the Twitter ban would not affect him.\n\nAtiku said in a single tweet: \u201cHopefully, this isn\u2019t my last tweet. #smile\u201d\n\nFormer President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki remarked: \u201cNo sir, this should not be the response from the President of a nation with a vibrant youthful population for whom the #Twitter is part of their daily lives and a source of their income and livelihood. This must be reviewed.\u201d\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) vehemently rejected the Twitter suspension, describing it as a draconian action and a slide towards a fascist regime in our country.\n\nThe party asserted that the suspension \u201cis a vexatious, condemnable and barbaric move to muzzle Nigerians, particularly the youth, ostensibly to prevent them from holding the overtly corrupt, vindictive and divisive Buhari administration accountable for its atrocities, including human right violations, patronising of terrorists and outright suppressive acts against innocent Nigerians.\u201d\n\nIn a statement by their National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, PDP said, \u201cOur party is appalled that the Federal Government could exhibit such primitive intolerance and power intoxication because the social media giant demonstrated international best practices in not allowing the Buhari presidency to use Twitter as a platform to propagate and spread the Buhari administration\u2019s hatred towards Nigerians.\u201d\n\nCivil society organisation, the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) vowed to sue the federal government over its suspension of Twitter.\n\nIn a statement released yesterday, SERAP said, \u201cNigerians have a right to freedom of expression and access to information, including online, and we plan to fight to keep it that way. Nigeria, we\u2019ll see in court.\u201d\n\nThe British embassy in Nigeria also condemned the Twitter suspension.\n\nAccording to the British Deputy High Commissioner in Abuja, Gill Atkinson, the federal government must not suppress basic freedom as all Nigerians have the right to freedom of speech.\n\nTweeting from @GillAtkinson11, she said: \u201cAll Nigerians have the right to freedom of speech and the responsibility not to misuse that right. Any action taken by Government must be measured, proportionate and not suppress basic freedoms.\u201d\n\nHer tweet was liked by the Twitter handles of @UKinNigeria and Paul Arkwright, the former UK diplomat to Nigeria.\n\nThe Nigerian Bar Association threatened to challenge the twitter suspension in court.\n\nNBA President, Olumide Akpata, described the decision as illegal.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhether one likes it or not, we are operating a\n\nconstitutional democracy, the primary consequence of which is that everything must be done according to law; and government must be conducted within the framework of recognised rules and principles which restrict discretionary power.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Bar Association finds no constitutional or legal authority to support the peremptory action of the Federal Government to suspend the operations of Twitter in Nigeria and deprive Nigerians of their right to freely express their constitutionally guaranteed opinions. Beyond the dent on our constitutional democracy, at a time when the Nigerian economy is unarguably struggling, the impact of arbitrary decisions such as this on investor confidence is better imagined.\n\n\u201cConsequently, if this decision is not immediately reversed, the Nigerian Bar Association will have no choice but to challenge same in the interest of the public and our democracy.\u201d\n\nHuman rights lawyer, Mr. Femi Falana (SAN), said the decision to suspend Twitter shows that Buhari has suspended Chapter IV of the 1999 Constitution.\n\nThe human rights lawyer argued that the suspension is also at variance with the Freedom of Information Act which seeks to expand information and access to it.\n\nNobel Laureate, Prof Wole Soyinka described Twitter suspension as unbecoming of a democratically elected President.\n\nAccording to the Nobel Laureate, if Buhari has a problem with the micro-blogging platform, he should sort it out between them personally, the way ex-US president Donald Trump did and not rope in the right to free expression of the Nigerian citizen as collateral damage.\n\nHe adds: \u201cIn any case, this is a technical problem. Nigerians should be able to work their way around.

          "text": "\u2022NPC confirms Baba as police boss\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday directed the newly confirmed Inspector General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, to take immediate steps towards reducing the myriad of security problems facing the nation to the barest minimum.\n\nThis was shortly after the Nigeria Police Council made up of the President, Vice President, 36 state governors, Ministers of Police Affairs, Interior and the Federal Capital Territory, confirmed Baba as IGP.\n\nBriefing newsmen at the end of the one and half hour meeting, chaired by President Muhammadu Buhari at the Conference Hall of the First Lady at the StateHouse, Abuja, Minister of Police Affairs, Alhaji Maigari Dingyadi said Baba was unanimously confirmed by all Council members in attendance.\n\nPresident Buhari had on April 6, appointed Baba as acting Inspector General of Police.\n\nAccording to him, the main purpose of the meeting was to \u201cget the appointment of acting IG confirmed by the Council that is in keeping with section 205 of the 1999 constitution. It requires the confirmation by members of the Council before he is finally confirmed as the Inspector General of Police.\u201d\n\nHe said the meeting was also to x-tray the security situation in the country with a view to finding lasting solution to the challenges plaguing the country.\n\nDingyadi said: \u201cThe meeting started with the usual presentation of tactics by the inspector General which fortunately, because of his track record, was unanimously confirmed.\n\n\u201cMr. President used the opportunity to congratulate him on his appointment and called on him to ensure that this is worthy of the confidence reposed in him. He tasked him to rise to the challenge and ensure that the insecurity that the country is facing is brought to the barest minimum.\n\n\u201cThe IG assured Mr. President and Nigerians that he is going to work assiduously to ensure that the responsibilities assigned to him are brought to bear and executed to the best of his abilities and to the satisfaction of all Nigerians.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, Baba said he briefed the Council on the threat to national security across the six geo-political zones emphasising on zones\u2019 peculiarities.\n\nThe new police boss also talked tough on the activities of the proscribed Independent People of Biafra (IPOB) and herders, saying his administration would checkmate their activities and rid the country of every other criminal activity.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere are peculiarities, like I said before, in the South-east and South-south is the issue of secessionist agenda championed by IPOB. I also talked about terrorism and religious bigotry in the North-east. I also talked about the issue of kidnapping, armed robbery, banditry and cultism as it affects the North-central and North-west and South-west. I gave a synopsis in terms of what we are doing to address this situation. I also thanked Mr President for providing additional logistics in terms of carrying out our duties and responsibilities.\n\n\u201cIn collaboration with other security agencies, we try to checkmate other forms of lawlessness; criminality and unlawful agitation in order to ensure lives and property are safe and at the same time allow Nigerian citizens go about their lawful business.\n\n\u201cWhat is seriously worrisome in the South East, but it is gradually being checked and results are positive, are the attacks and killings of security agents and distruction of assets belonging to the federal government. Our ability to checkmate this lawlessness has improved and we are getting closer to something positive.\n\n\u201cWe also acknowledge the fact that there are some things that have been done by the federal government to improve police operations, ranging from the establishment of the Police Trust Fund, signing into law of the 2020 Police Act and several other intervention funds, necessary technology and intelligence-led policing will be a reality.\n\n\u201cI briefed Council on adding to our strengths in terms of recruitment for 2020 and 2021 as this will assist us. I also briefed the Council on community policing which has taken off in all the states and how the community police officers are assisting in providing security in their communities because, their operations are restricted to their immediate community.\n\n\u201cI briefed Council on the number of arrests we have made and recoveries in terms of firearms and weaponry that are being used lawlessly. I briefed Council on rescue of kidnapped victims and what we are doing to secure the school children that have been kidnapped and how we are going about securing those in schools.\u201d\n\nAsked if the police was ensuring that political thugs are not meted the same punishment as IPOB members in the South East, Baba said: \u201cHow do I differentiate between political thugs and IPOB? I don\u2019t even need to differentiate them. The issue is I\u2019m looking for anybody who has committed offence or anybody who belongs to a proscribed organisation. So, the issue is it all depends on the level of criminality or lawlessness that someone does to know what punishment will be meted on him. If a political thug commits crime, he is in for it as a principal offender. If someone is sponsoring him, either aiding or abetting him, conspiring with him, they will be taken together.\n\n\u201cThe issue is IPOB is a proscribed organisation and we expect nobody to belong to the IPOB. Thuggery is an offence and anyone will be dealt with according to the law. They are all offenders. It\u2019s just like me differentiating between an armed robber and a thug. It\u2019s the level of crime that matters. There is no way we can say this is IPOB or a thug. It all depends on the level of crime.\u201d\n\nOn the alarm raised by South-west leaders on invasion by foreign herdsmen, the Police boss said it was being taken seriously.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt\u2019s a statement that will not be taken lightly. We are looking into it based on intelligence available to us. We will deal with the situation and those who are making the statement are also at liberty by national calling to substantiate to the nearest police station.\n\n\u201cIt is not today we have been hearing of foreigners coming in to commit one crime or the other and, in some instances; there are real incidence that some people that were arrested are not really Nigerians. It is not a new thing and whatever level of security we need to provide, we are doing it. We have border patrol police, immigration are doing their jobs in terms of checking illegal aliens. It is possible, but it is not as light as invasion, that word is very strong, we will look into it to determine if actually it is true.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Tegina parents: Kidnappers serious about threat to kill our children; sympathisers raise N11m for ransom\n\nFestus Akanbi in Lagos and Laleye Dipo in Minna\n\nThe latest mass abduction victims, 136 pupils kidnapped last Sunday from Salihu Tanko Islamiyya School in Tegina, Rafi Local Government Area of Niger State, are all children from poor homes, paying paltry N200 monthly as school fees.\n\nThe pupils, according to investigations, were deliberately targeted by the bandits in line with their new push for the seizure of the poor and vulnerable, following recent difficulties in abducting from the middle class and wealthy people, who have found better ways of protection.\n\nIn a related development, parents of the abducted Tegina pupils yesterday raised the alarm saying the bandits, based on telephone conversation with them last Thursday, are serious about killing their children if they fail to meet N200 million ransom. By yesterday, sympathisers had contributed N11 million towards the payment.\n\nThis trend of kidnapping from among the poor and vulnerable is evident in the series of abductions that have taken place in the last few months in Kaduna, Niger, Zamfara, Katsina and Sokoto states.\n\nIn the case of Tegina School, these pupils from poor homes, study in ramshackle buildings (with help of a charitable indigene), with no iota of security in the premises. So, they were easy prey.\n\nThe middle class and the rich in the listed trouble-states have apparently found a functional way of protecting themselves against abduction, thus forcing the bandits to switch to soft targets.\n\nA lot of abductions of the poor and vulnerable in Niger State are taking place in Shiroro, Munya, Rafi and Mariga local government areas.\n\nTwelve of such poor people were abducted at Malam Bako village, Mariga LG on June 1 and five others at Batati town, Lavun LG on May 29, both in Niger State.\n\nIn Kaduna State, the poor and vulnerable are being abducted in communities in Chikum, Birnin Gwari, Igabi, Kajuru and Giwa local government areas.\n\nIn Katsina State, a lot of abduction of the poor and vulnerable are occurring in communities in Batsari, Safana, Dutsin-Ma, Kankara, Kurfi, Dan- Musa, Jibia, Faskari and Sabuwa local government areas.\n\n\u2018Bandits Serious About Killing Our Children\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, parents of the abducted Tegina pupils yesterday raised the alarm saying the bandits, based on telephone conversation with them last Thursday, are serious about the threat to kill their children\n\nThe bandits have also increased their ransom demand to N200 million. Initially the bandits demanded for N110 million for the release of the victims, mostly girls, with a threat that if by Thursday the money was not delivered they (children) would be killed.\n\nHowever, the bandits reportedly got across to the parents last Thursday evening that the ransom had been increased to N200 million with the same threat after the deadline was not met.\n\nFather of five of the victims and a tipper driver, Malam Ali Mohammed, confirmed the latest development to THISDAY last Thursday night.\n\nMohammed, who was sobbing in the telephone conversation with THISDAY said: \u201cThe bandits are serious about killing our children if we cannot pay. We are poor people, we don\u2019t have such money we plead with the government to come to our assistance.\u201d\n\nTHISDAY also learnt that public-spirited people in the community had been able to raise N11 million for the ransom demanded, a large chunk of which was by a top political office holder in the area.\n\nIt was also learnt that the mother of one of the victims whose name was not given died on Thursday as a result of trauma.\n\nThe remains of the deceased were interred in Tegina on Thursday evening according to Islamic injunction.\n\nThe state government insists it has set necessary machinery in motion to ensure the safe release of the school children but completely ruled out the payment of ransom to the kidnappers.\n\n\u2018\n\n\u2018Abducted Pupils are Toddlers Who Need Help\u2019\n\nParents and teachers of the abducted Tegina pupils yesterday painted a gory picture of the toddlers in the bush for the sixth day running.\n\nSome of the parents, who spoke on Arise TV, called for the immediate rescue of the kids \u201cbecause they are too tender for the harsh realities of kidnappers\u2019 den.\u201d\n\nThe parents lamented that some of the kidnapped pupils are between ages four, and 13, maintaining that the younger ones are vulnerable to sickness in the bush where they were kept for days without food and shelter.\n\nThe headmaster of the school, Alhaji Abubakar Alhassan, whose two children and a sister are among the abducted, said some of the victims were too young for the ordeals they are facing.\n\nHe also indicted both the federal and state governments for abandoning the school and the parents of the students in their moment of despair.\n\nAlhassan, popularly called Mallam by his community, in an emotion-laden interview, claimed there had been no sympathy from the government, and wondered why the federal government failed to provide the ransom demanded by the bandits.\n\nHe said it was a lie that the government had sent vehicles and motorcycles into the bush for the rescue operation.\n\n\u201cThere is no way people can be in the bush without the community getting wind of this. They can\u2019t be inside the office and begin to tell lies. It\u2019s only the local government official who has been with us,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also denied the report that he had prior information of the attack.\n\nThe head teacher disclosed that the abduction had already led to the death of two parents of the victims, warning that more casualties may happen unless the students regained their freedom quickly.\n\nFighting back tears, Alhassan said: \u201cI have witnessed the funeral prayer of one of the parents here very close to the school. She died because she had just one child who is our student. She was not around when the incident happened. When she came back they told her and within 30 minutes, she collapsed and died. That was the day before yesterday.\n\n\u201cA day after the incident happened, another parent died. She had two children. One was sent to the town while the one with her was kidnapped. She died of a heart attack.\n\n\u201cAs I\u2019m talking to you now, my wife is down. She was put on a drip, she didn\u2019t cook, she didn\u2019t eat. My little child at home, who slept with me on my bed, woke up only to begin to shout the name of his elder sister, asking me \u201cBaba, when is she coming back?\n\n\u201cOne painful thing was that my sister called me before the last discussion with the bandits, crying. She swore that the children are sick, they cannot work. She told me they have removed their hijabs. They have unveiled them. They removed their shirts and they are left with only trousers.\n\n\u201cThere is no food. They gave them kulikuli (groundnut cake). How do you expect them to survive? They took them to unknown environments. I heard people saying they kept them on the floor. When you are talking about floors you are talking about classrooms or a house. No, they are kept in the bush. They are sleeping on the ground, no leaves, not mat. How do you expect them to live like that?\u201d\n\nAnother parent, a mother, Mrs. Hashimu said five of her children were initially kidnapped, but that the two toddlers among them, ages two and four were sent back home while the rest were taken away.\n\nGiving her account, she said, \u201cThe whole incident was terrifying because everything happened in my presence. I was hearing everything. I saw when the bandits were going away with these children but there was nothing I could do. Government is not helping matters at all saying this, saying that, yet we cannot see anything on the ground.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Insecurity does not make Nigeria failed state, insists FG\n\n\u2022Presidency: Foreign magazine\u2019s opinion on Nigeria distorted, unfair\n\nBy Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja and Kayode Fasua in Abeokuta\n\nFormer President Olusegun Obasanjo yesterday expressed worry over the state of the nation and blamed bad leadership for the nation\u2019s woes.\n\nThe former president, while receiving a book titled, \u2018The Man, The General and The President,\u2019 written by Femmy Carrena, said in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, that even though the country is destined to be a land flowing with milk and honey, bad leadership has made it unachievable.\n\nAccording to him, the country is currently dripping with bitterness and sadness.\n\nBut despite the worsening insecurity, the federal government has said it is preposterous for anyone to declare Nigeria a failed state on the basis of the country\u2019s security challenges.\n\nThe All Progressives Congress (APC) also said alleged plots by some Nigerians to bring down the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari would fail.\n\nObasanjo stated that although Nigeria is destined to lead the black race, failure of leadership has prevented the country from taking its rightful place in the comity of developed nations.\n\nHe said: \u201cMy prayer is that all of us will have something to contribute to making this country what God has created it to be \u2013 a land flowing with milk and honey.\n\n\u201cRight now, it is a land flowing with bitterness and sadness; that is not what God wants this country to be.\n\n\u201cWe must change the narrative; we must talk to ourselves in the civilised language.\n\n\u201cThere is nowhere you go in this country that you will not see geniuses in any section of the country. So, why should we look down on ourselves?\u201d\n\nHe stated that over 14 million children were out of school, adding that if care is not taken, Nigeria would have more \u201cBoko Haram in future.\u201d\n\nObasanjo urged Nigerians to emulate some prominent citizens that are doing well at the international level.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have Akin Adesina running the African Development Bank (AfDB); we have Benedict Oramah running the Afrexim Bank; we have Mohammed Barkindo running the OPEC (Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries); we have my sister, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, running the WTO (World Trade Organisation), and we have Amina Mohammed who, I think celebrated her 60th birthday yesterday or the day before yesterday, who is number two in the United Nations (UN).\n\n\u201cThese are things that should give hope and encouragement for the future.\n\n\u201cAnd each of these people that I have mentioned, are doing fantastically well. We have even at the AU (African Union), Ambassador Bankole Adeoye, who had just taken over as the Commissioner for Political Affairs & Peace and Security (PAPS) of the AU.\n\n\u201cSo why are they doing well there and here we are not doing well? Something must be wrong! We should be interrogating this; we should ask then what should we do?\n\n\u201cWhat we should do is put our house in order, and we can put our house in order.\u201d\n\nThe book was reviewed by Professor Emeritus, Michael Abiola Omolewa, a former Chairperson of United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), and the review was read on his behalf by Ndidi Amaka-Okafor.\n\nInsecurity Does Not Make Nigeria Failed State, Insists FG\n\nMeanwhile, the federal government has said it is preposterous for anyone to declare Nigeria a failed state due to the country\u2019s security challenges.\n\nMinister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, stated this yesterday in response to a recent declaration by the Council on Foreign Affairs in the United States that \u201cNigeria is at a point of no return with all the signs of a failed nation.\u2019\u2019\n\nFormer US Ambassador to Nigeria and a Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, Mr. John Campbell, and the President Emeritus of World Peace Foundation, Mr. Robert Rotberg, had urged the United States to acknowledge that Nigeria is a failed state in the light of the many challenges plaguing the country.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s worldwide companions, particularly the USA, should acknowledge that Nigeria is now a failed state. In recognition of that truth, they need to deepen their engagement with the nation and search to carry the present administration accountable for its failures, while additionally working with it to supply safety and proper financial system,\u201d they had said in an article.\n\nBut Mohammed said in Abuja that \u201cNigeria is not and cannot be a failed state.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe stated that the declaration by the council did not represent an official US policy.\n\nMohammed said: \u201cThis declaration is merely the opinions of two persons, former US Ambassador to Nigeria and a Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, John Campbell, and the President Emeritus of World Peace Foundation, Robert Rotberg.\n\n\u201cDeclaring any nation a failed state is not done at the whims and caprices of one or two persons, no matter their status.\n\n\u201cJust because Nigeria is facing security challenges, which we have acknowledged and which we are tackling, does not automatically make the country a failed state.\n\n\u201cLike former US Senator Daniel Moynihan said, \u201cYou are entitled to your opinion but not your facts.\u201d\n\nMohammed said Nigeria did not meet the criteria for a nation to become a failed state.\n\nHe listed the criteria to include the inability to provide public service and inability to interact with other states as a full member of the international community.\n\n\u201cYes, the non-state actors may be rampaging in some parts of the country; they have not and cannot overwhelm this government,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe minister said it was not the first time it was predicted that Nigeria would fail or break up.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe were even once told that Nigeria would break up in 2015. But their doomsday predictions have all failed and will fail again.\u2019\u2019\n\nPresidency: Foreign Magazine\u2019s Opinion on Nigeria Distorted, Unfair\n\nMeanwhile, the Presidency yesterday described as unfair and distorted an opinion in the latest article on Nigeria entitled \u2018The Giant of Africa Is Failing\u2019 published by the Foreign Affairs (Magazine).\n\nThe Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, made the condemnation in a reaction to the article.\n\nIn a letter addressed to the publishers of the magazine, the presidential spokesman took exception to the way and manner facts were being misrepresented to support distorted opinions.\n\nThe letter read in part: \u201cThe latest article on Nigeria in Foreign Affairs titled \u2018The Giant of Africa is Failing\u2019 is unfair both to a magazine with such an esteemed pedigree and to its readers.\n\n\u201cFormer United States Ambassador to Nigeria, John Campbell, has been predicting the collapse of Nigeria for several years. He is of course entitled to his opinions, even where events consistently prove him wrong.\n\n\u201cBut facts should not be bent to support distorted opinions.\n\n\u201cLet me give you one example.\n\n\u201cThe authors write:\n\n\u2018At an April meeting with the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Buhari reportedly requested that the headquarters of the U.S. Africa Command be moved from Germany to Nigeria so that it would be closer to the fight against jihadi groups in the country\u2019s north.\u2019\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari did not request that AFRICOM move to Nigeria. The transcript of the call with Secretary Blinken is available on the State Department\u2019s own website.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a question of the invented addition of \u2018to Nigeria\u2019 with regard to AFRICOM. It sums up a piece that attempts \u2013 subtly but revealingly \u2013 to shift facts to suit an argument.\u2019\u2019\n\nAccording to Shehu, Nigeria faces multiple challenges, not least of which is the dissemination of fake news and prejudiced opinion.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis is something we have come to expect from partisan blogs and politically motivated lobbies.\n\n\u201cIt is still a surprise, and a disappointment, to see them joined by Foreign Affairs.\u2019\n\nPlots to Destroy Buhari\u2019s Govt will Fail, Says APC\n\nAlso yesterday, the ruling APC said plots by some Nigerians to bring down the administration of Buhari would fail.\n\nNational Secretary of the Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary National Convention Planning Committee of the APC, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, said at an event organised by the APC Professionals Forum, in Abuja, that despite the challenges the party met on the ground, the president had recorded successes in the areas of infrastructural development, the fight against corruption and the reduction of poverty.\n\nAkpanudoedehe spoke on behalf of the Governor of Yobe State and Chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the APC, Mr. Mai Mala Buni.\n\nHe said: \u201cPlans to bring down the government of President Muhammadu Buhari will fail; some disgruntled elements are trying to blackmail and discredit this government with the aim of bringing it down.\n\n\u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari will be judged by security and other achievements. We should not analyse the achievements of this government based on blackmail.\u201d\n\nHe added that despite misgivings in certain quarters, the benefit accruing to the nation through efforts being made by the Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy was visible.\n\nAccording to him, the SIM card registration, which has drastically reduced the number of pre-registered sims available for use for criminal purposes has helped in improving the nation\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cThose who are heating up the polity so that people will believe there is insecurity are organising to bring down the government of the APC. We will bring them to book Insha Allah,\u201d he said.\n\nAkpanudoedehe stated that the positive effects of the social intervention programmes among Nigeria\u2019s poor and the vulnerable were being underreported because most of the beneficiaries were neither party member nor did they share in the administration\u2019s vision.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The suspended Senior Special Assistant to the Ogun State Governor Dapo Abiodun, Mr Abidemi Rufai, caught in $350,000 wire fraud, may forfeit his bail as the United State authorities said he would escape to Nigeria if granted bail and his extradition would be difficult.\n\nThe Acting US Attorney, Tessa Gorma, stated this while asking a district judge to reverse a bail earlier granted to Rufai by a magistrate judge.\n\nThe authorities argued that Rufai presents an extreme risk of flight and \u201cif he does escape to Nigeria, extradition will be extraordinarily difficult or impossible because of his ties to the Nigerian government.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is well known that extradition from Nigeria to the United States is difficult under the best of circumstances. That will be exacerbated in this case because of the strong political connections that earned Rufai a governmental appointment,\u201d Gorma said.\n\nDespite his alleged involvement in $350,000 fraud, Rufai said through his lawyer that he was a man of integrity.\n\nResponding to the government\u2019s appeal on why he should be released on bail, his lawyer, Lance Hester, told the court in Tacoma that his client has a good character, which facilitated his appointment as governor\u2019s aide.\n\nThe reply was filed on June 1, 2021. See Also Politics Ogun Governor, Abiodun Suspends Aide Arrested In US Over N158million Fraud\n\n\u201c\u2026Mr Rufai\u2019s status as Nigerian National should not weigh heavily in favour of pretrial detention but rather, militate in favor of pretrial release. As the government concedes, Mr. Rufai holds a distinguished Governmental position in his home.\n\n\u201cIt goes without saying that only an individual of high moral character and integrity could achieve such a distinguished governmental appointment,\u201d Hester argued for his client in a court filing obtained by Premium Times on Thursday.\n\nSaharaReporters had on May 18 reported that Rufai faces up to 30 years in prison if he is convicted of wire fraud.\n\nAccording to the United States Department of Justice, wire fraud is punishable by up to 30 years in prison regarding benefits paid in connection with a presidentially declared disaster or emergency, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. See Also CRIME Suspended Governor Abiodun's Aide Faces 30 Years In United States Jail Over $350,000 Fraud\n\nRufai, who served as the Deputy Director-General of the Dapo Abiodun Campaign Organisation in the last governorship election in the state, was arrested on Friday at the JFK Airport in New York, the United States of America, on a criminal complaint of wire fraud for his scheme to steal over $350,000 in unemployment benefits from the Washington State Employment Security Department, the acting US Attorney, Tessa M. Gorman, announced.\n\nRufai, aka Sandy Tang, 42, of Lekki, Lagos, made his initial appearance in court on Saturday, May 15, 2021, in New York.\n\n\"Since the first fraud reports to our office in April 2020, we have worked diligently with a federal law enforcement team to track down the criminals who stole funds designated for pandemic relief. This is the first, but will not be the last, significant arrest in our ongoing investigation of the ESD fraud,\" Gorman had said.\n\nThe criminal complaint alleges that Rufai used the stolen identities of more than 100 Washington residents to file fraudulent claims with the ESD for pandemic-related unemployment benefits.\n\nHe was alleged to have also filed fraudulent unemployment claims with Hawaii, Wyoming, Massachusetts, Montana, New York and Pennsylvania. He used variations of a single email address in a manner intended to evade automatic detection by fraud systems.\n\nUsing this practice, Rufai allegedly made it appear that each claim was connected with a different email account.\n\nThe US Department of Justice stated on its website that Rufai caused the fraud proceeds to be paid out to online payment accounts such as 'Green Dot' accounts or wired to bank accounts controlled by 'money mules'. Some of the proceeds were then mailed to the Jamaica, New York address of Rufai's relative. See Also Corruption $350,000 Fraud: Suspended Governor Abiodun's Aide, Rufai To Remain In Detention Indefinitely, US Court Rules\n\nLaw enforcement determined that more than $288,000 was deposited into an American bank account controlled by Rufai between March and August 2020.\n\n\"Greed is a powerful motivator. Unfortunately, the greed alleged to this defendant affects all taxpayers,\" said Donald Voiret, Special Agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigations in Seattle.\n\n\"The FBI and our partners will not stand idly by while individuals attempt to defraud programmes meant to assist American workers and families suffering the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic,\" he added.\n\nOgun State governor, in his reaction, described the arrest as disturbing news and ordered the immediate suspension of Rufai.",

          "text": "The suspended Senior Special Assistant to the Ogun State Governor Dapo Abiodun, Mr Abidemi Rufai, caught in $350,000 wire fraud, may forfeit his bail as the United State authorities said he would escape to Nigeria if granted bail and his extradition would be difficult.\n\nThe Acting US Attorney, Tessa Gorma, stated this while asking a district judge to reverse a bail earlier granted to Rufai by a magistrate judge.\n\nThe authorities argued that Rufai presents an extreme risk of flight and \u201cif he does escape to Nigeria, extradition will be extraordinarily difficult or impossible because of his ties to the Nigerian government.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is well known that extradition from Nigeria to the United States is difficult under the best of circumstances. That will be exacerbated in this case because of the strong political connections that earned Rufai a governmental appointment,\u201d Gorma said.\n\nDespite his alleged involvement in $350,000 fraud, Rufai said through his lawyer that he was a man of integrity.\n\nResponding to the government\u2019s appeal on why he should be released on bail, his lawyer, Lance Hester, told the court in Tacoma that his client has a good character, which facilitated his appointment as governor\u2019s aide.\n\nThe reply was filed on June 1, 2021.

See Also CRIME Suspended Governor Abiodun's Aide Faces 30 Years In United States Jail Over $350,000 Fraud\n\nRufai, who served as the Deputy Director-General of the Dapo Abiodun Campaign Organisation in the last governorship election in the state, was arrested on Friday at the JFK Airport in New York, the United States of America, on a criminal complaint of wire fraud for his scheme to steal over $350,000 in unemployment benefits from the Washington State Employment Security Department, the acting US Attorney, Tessa M. Gorman, announced.\n\nRufai, aka Sandy Tang, 42, of Lekki, Lagos, made his initial appearance in court on Saturday, May 15, 2021, in New York.\n\n\"Since the first fraud reports to our office in April 2020, we have worked diligently with a federal law enforcement team to track down the criminals who stole funds designated for pandemic relief.

He used variations of a single email address in a manner intended to evade automatic detection by fraud systems.\n\nUsing this practice, Rufai allegedly made it appear that each claim was connected with a different email account.\n\nThe US Department of Justice stated on its website that Rufai caused the fraud proceeds to be paid out to online payment accounts such as 'Green Dot' accounts or wired to bank accounts controlled by 'money mules'.

This implies that with a new IP address \u2014 which can be that of any country of your choice \u2014 you can use Twitter as if you\u2019re in your selected country without restriction.\n\nTo do this, all that is needed is to change the location of the VPN to any country of your choice and connect to that country\u2019s VPN.\n\nAlso, with the government\u2019s suspension, you can still access Twitter from a Nigerian IP because VPN hides your address.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow can you get a VPN?\n\nGetting a VPN isn\u2019t a difficult thing. There are paid VPNs and there free ones that can guarantee you seamless usage of Twitter in Nigeria notwithstanding the government\u2019s suspension.\n\nSome of the best-paid VPNs for Twitter, according to Comparitech, are ExpressVPN, NordVPN and Surfshark, CyberGhost, IPVanish, VyprVPN, and ZenMate.\n\nThe free VPNs that can be used for Twitter include: ProtonVPN, Hotspot Shield Free VPN, Windscribe free, TunnelBear, Speedify and Hide.me.\n\nTo get a VPN \u2014 either paid or free \u2014 on your device, below are the simple steps you can follow:\n\nGo to Appstore/Playstore\n\nType VPN in the search box\n\nDownload any VPN of your choice\n\nOpen the app and install\n\nChange your location to any other country of your choice (for instance Germany, US, Russia\u2026)\n\nThen click connect on your VPN\n\nWith the above tips, you can use Twitter despite its suspension in Nigeria.\n\nCopyright 2021 TheCable.

We\u2019re investigating and will provide updates when we know more.\u201d\n\nWhile Twitter does not have physical offices in Nigeria, the platform is freely available in the country and has up to 2 million users, according to some estimates. The government\u2019s suspension as announced by Lai Mohammed, the Minister for Information and Culture, has been interpreted as a potential directive to Internet Service Providers to cut off users\u2019 access to the social media platform\n\nAs we have reported, the suspension is a culmination of a three-day drama. It started when Twitter deleted a tweet by President Muhammadu Buhari for violating its rules.\n\nA few hours after Twitter\u2019s action, Mohammed, the Information Minister, held a press conference in which he denounced the US social media company for having a suspicious agenda in Nigeria. He accused Twitter of enabling violence during #EndSARS protests in October 2020.\n\nIn the end, he justified his suspension of Twitter on the grounds of \u201cpersistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\u201d\n\nThe suspension brings Twitter squarely into the heat of the debate about the intersection of democracy and internet freedom in Africa.\n\nWhen they announced that Ghana will be the location of their first Africa office, Twitter said it was because Ghana is \u201ca champion for democracy, a supporter of free speech, online freedom, and the Open Internet, of which Twitter is also an advocate.\u201d\n\nTwitter remains available in Nigeria at the time of publishing this \u2013 two and half hours after the announcement was posted on the Information Ministry\u2019s verified Twitter account.

          "text": "\u201cWhat does it take to create Unicorns in Africa?\u201d\n\nIn 2017, the journey started with this question. Back then, eCommerce giant Jumia, South Africa\u2019s Promasidor Holdings and Cell C were the only Unicorns from Africa.\n\nToday, the story is different, there are five unicorns in Africa.\n\nCoined in 2013 by venture capitalist Aileen Lee, a unicorn is any private startup company started after 2003 that is valued at more than $1 billion. Lee chose the magic valuation number of $1 billion because it suggests that a company has either disrupted the market or created a new market.\n\nMeanwhile, the increase in the number of unicorns in Africa might seem like progress. It\u2019s only a small fraction of the number of unicorns in the world and in other countries.\n\nAccording to CBInsights, as of May 2021, there were more than 600 unicorns around the world. India has about 100 unicorns, China has 162 unicorns while the US has almost 300 unicorns.\n\nMost unicorns come from outside the African continent because the startup scene in Africa is still growing.\n\nTo accelerate this growth, in 2017, Unicorn Group, a pan-African investment company, set out to create a systematic approach to discover and produce unicorns on the continent. The unicorn team is led by Dr Akintoye Akindele with support from members like Dr Wura Abiola, Kola Abiola, Olatutu Sholeye, Yomi Akapo, Prof Cesar Baena, Mark White, Akudo Nweke, Kunle Soriyan and Dr Ponmile Osibo. The team travelled around the world studying different tech ecosystems to learn about what makes a unicorn and to create a playbook for the African tech ecosystem.\n\nThe wife of the Lagos state governor, Joke Sanwo-Olu at the event\n\nOn the 2nd of June, 2021 Unicorn Group held an event for the official launch of its Lagos campus. A number of distinguished dignitaries were present.\n\nTimipre Sylva Minister of State for Petroleum Resources; Lagos state governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu represented by his wife Joke Sanwo-Olu; Engr Simbi Wabote Exec. sec. Nigerian Content Development monitoring board and Mr Osh Agabi CEO Koniku. The vice-chancellors of Lagos State University and Obafemi Awolowo University, Prof. Oluwatoyin Ogundipe and Prof Eyitope Ogunbodede, respectively, were also in attendance.\n\nA group picture of the invited dignitaries\n\nUnicorn Group\u2019s ecosystem approach\n\nAt this event, the Unicorn Group shared its multifaceted approach to creating more unicorns in Africa.\n\nThis approach is made up of programs developed for startups and early-stage companies, campuses built across Africa to bridge the gap of inadequate infrastructure, advisers for the startups and partnerships with leading global organisations.\n\nThe five-step program caters to businesses at any stage. The first step is the Idea Lab, a program targeted at people with business ideas. The Idea Lab will run for a maximum of six months.\n\nThe Hub program is the second step, it\u2019s for businesses with a viable product. It\u2019ll run for a maximum of 12 months.\n\nThe third step is the incubator program for businesses with existing commercial products with market acceptance. It\u2019ll run for a maximum duration of two years.\n\nThe fourth and fifth programs are the Accelerator and the growth & scale program which are designed for established and profitable businesses.\n\nThe programs would run concurrently. Intentionally, its Lagos campus which is housed in a five story building is built in such a way that each floor caters for each step of the program.\n\nDr Akintoye Akindele, Chairman of Unicorn Group\n\nUnicorn Group has campuses in Lagos, Nairobi, Johannesburg and Accra. A fifth campus in Marrakesh is slated to open in 2022.\n\nWhat sets the Unicorn Group\u2019s approach apart from others? Ponmile Osibo, Chief investor relations officer told TechCabal, that for the Unicorn Group, it\u2019s beyond investing just money.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible to give someone money and it disappears. We\u2019ve come to understand that companies need access to a wide range of support.\u201d\n\n\u201cBack then in 2017, there was no path to becoming a unicorn. There are different types of business models. There are businesses that should monetize from the get go and those who should gain traction first before monetization. There\u2019s no African playbook for this.\u201d\n\nFor any investment company, the end goal is to get a good return on investment (ROI). The investment in creating five campuses amongst other things is an enormous upfront provision of capital. I asked Osibo how they plan to recoup its investment.\n\n\u201cAt some stages, we collect equity in exchange for the capital and support we give these companies but for us, it\u2019s even bigger than that,\u201d He said.\n\nThe bigger picture for the Unicorn Group is the impact it\u2019ll have on the economy. He said, \u201cThink about it, we\u2019ve found out that the average small business hires five people. If we\u2019re able to empower about 200,000 businesses that\u2019s a minimum of 1 million additional jobs that won\u2019t have existed. Think of the ripple effect on the economy.\u201d",

          "text": "Personal loans are good for a variety of purposes\u2014from consolidating debt to solving a myriad of pressing issues. They are personal, which means your reasons are yours.\n\nDo you remember the first time you needed more money than you had? Borrowing money then was not as easy as it is now.\n\nYou probably would have run to family members or friends which usually meant nothing was certain, or apply for a bank loan, which was a very tedious process, hard to get \u2013 especially if you do not have an enviable collateral in choice locations, or know someone in top management position in the banks to stand as a guarantor.\n\nThe situation is completely different now. There are financial services providers like Page Financials who have changed the game entirely, they have not only disrupted the borrowing and lending ecosystem but have also shaped how even the banks respond to providing these services today.\n\nWith the intervention of Page Financials, a leading financial services provider, anybody with a verifiable and consistent income, that meets a few other criteria \u2013 like having a good credit history \u2013 can now easily get a personal loan from the comfort of their home.\n\nIf you are still thinking about whether or not to consider a personal loan, we have highlighted 5 reasons why customers usually resort to getting a personal loan.\n\nCash Emergencies\n\nIf you need money right away to cover bills, an emergency cost or something else that needs immediate attention, you can take out a personal loan. Page Financials provide online applications that allow you to complete application conveniently in minutes.\n\nYou could receive funding immediately as well, depending on your past credit history and the information you have provided. You can use a personal loan to cover emergencies like:\n\nPaying past-due home payments and utilities\n\nMedical bills\n\nFuneral expenses\n\nAn unexpected car repair or purchase\n\nWhat you can do with a personal loan is limitless, and as established earlier, it is personal to you.\n\nDebt Consolidation\n\nOne of the popular reasons to get a personal loan from Page is for debt consolidation.\n\nIf you have existing facilities with different lenders, you\u2019d agree that managing multiple loans from several lenders can prove to be challenging. Missing on payments can result in negatively impacting your credit score. Availing a personal loan in such a situation can save you from financial distress.\n\nAll you require to do is approach Page and state that you have some other loans elsewhere and would like to consolidate different payments into one debt with the help of a loan. This method offers several benefits that include enjoying an overall lower rate of interest which can help in reducing the timeframe required to pay-off your loan.\n\nRent, Home Improvement and Repairs\n\nWhether you want to renew your rent or looking to move to a more befitting neighborhood, or simply looking to upgrade your apartment and fix some repairs, a personal loan is a great way to cover the costs conveniently.\n\nThe urgencies that come with meeting these needs are usually unprecedented which is why a personal loan may be your surest way to meet up with the deadline.\n\nFailure to meet up with rent on time for example will lead to series of embarrassments from your landlord, and\u2026you don\u2019t what that. In the same vein, if you see a new apartment that you love and fail to make payment on time, the house goes to someone else that has cash at hand.\n\nThis is why speed and convenience are of essence when it comes to personal loans and part of the USPs at Page Financials, you can access a loan and get support anytime whether it\u2019s 2 am or 2 pm so you don\u2019t have to miss any opportunity again.\n\nVehicle Financing\n\nAuto loans are available if you\u2019re looking to buy or lease a car, but personal loans are also available to finance any need you may have \u2013 including a vehicle financing.\n\nAnother great reason why you should consider a personal loan rather than going for an Auto loans are secured loans and use your vehicle as collateral. If you\u2019re worried about missing payments and your car getting repossessed, a personal loan might be a better option for you.\n\nStarting/Expanding Your Business\n\nSide hustles are very popular these days, and are a great way to test the entrepreneurial waters. If you have one, or you are thinking of starting one, you are going to need some funds to run or expand it.\n\nChanneling extra funds into your side hustle can help you take it to the next level. But if you don\u2019t have the money you need now, taking out a personal loan for your side business may help.\n\nGetting an outright business loan would normally require some sort of security or collateral \u2013 which most startups don\u2019t have, which is why taking a personal loan as a salary earner \u2013 to fund your side business, would be a smart thing to do.\n\nPersonal loans may be well-suited for side hustles because they are often smaller than typical business loans and don\u2019t require a high level of collateral or profitability. All you need is a proven source of income \u2014 and that can come from your current day job.\n\nWhat To Consider When Considering A Personal Loan\n\nApplying for a Page Loan is super easy, everything happens online and you don\u2019t need to visit their office.\n\nTo begin the application, click here to visit the website as a private sector employee or click here to visit the application page for public sector employee.\n\nThe application process is in stages, at each stage, you\u2019ll supply relevant information that helps make a decision to approve your loan.\n\n(See requirements for each category below)\n\nYou can upload all the documents online while filling the form so you do not have to worry about carrying files from one office(er) to another.\n\nThe first stage you will encounter while filling the application form is the BVN and IPPIS verification phase. You will be required to provide these details to help us to verify your identity and financial standing.\n\nLoan Requirements for Private Sector Employees\n\nTo be considered eligible for a loan as a private sector employee, it is required that:\n\nYou earn a monthly salary (minimum 150k monthly) You have up to 6-months\u2019 salary account statement You live/work in Lagos or Ibadan (bankers nationwide can apply) You have a valid work ID from where you work or an evidence of employment or promotion You have a BVN that is actively connected to your working mobile number\n\nSome of the items above will be retrieved automatically when you begin the application, it usually takes customers less than 3 minutes to complete the application if they have the requirements ready.\n\nTo apply as a private sector employee click here\n\nLoan Requirements for Public Sector Employees\n\nTo be considered eligible for a loan as a Federal Government Civil Servant, it is required that:\n\nYou have your work ID You have a valid Government issued ID You have at least 3 months\u2019 payslips You will present a signed letter of authority to debit (the letter is available for download on our website)\n\nTo apply as a public sector employee, click here\n\nReasons to Avoid a Personal Loan\n\nWhile personal loans can be a saving grace in times of great need, there are some instances you should avoid borrowing money. Consider avoiding a personal loan if:\n\nYou can\u2019t afford it. Borrowing money in the short term is one thing, but remember you\u2019ll still need to pay it back. If you can\u2019t afford monthly payments for your new personal loan, consider skipping it.\n\nBorrowing money in the short term is one thing, but remember you\u2019ll still need to pay it back. If you can\u2019t afford monthly payments for your new personal loan, consider skipping it. You don\u2019t need it. If you\u2019re taking out a personal loan to cover the cost of something you don\u2019t need in the immediate future, think about putting it off until you have more cash on hand.\n\nThe Page customer service is available 24/7 to answer any questions you may have.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "The Nigerian Federal Government has announced that it will be indefinitely blocking access to microblogging and social media platform, Twitter, in Nigeria.\n\nOn Friday, June 4, 2021, Nigeria\u2019s Federal Ministry of Information and Culture made this move known on its Twitter and Facebook handles.\n\nPRESS RELEASE\n\n\n\nFG Suspends @Twitter Operations in Nigeria pic.twitter.com/7z5BQ0Mi3U \u2014 Fed Min of Info & Cu (@FMICNigeria) June 4, 2021\n\nPer the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, the government made this suspension due to the \u201cpersistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis move comes just a few days after Twitter deleted a controversial tweet made by Nigeria\u2019s President Muhammadu Buhari. That action had since been criticised by some government officials, and decisive action appears to have been taken.\n\nInterestingly, Facebook has also deleted the President\u2019s message on its platform. Could the hands of Nigerian law also fall heavily?\n\nOver the years, Twitter has become an important social media platform for Nigerians. Several humanitarian causes and protests have moved from hashtags to reality. #OccupyNigeria and #BringBackOurGirls are some notable ones.\n\nNigeria\u2019s latest suspension means that it could order telecom companies to block access to Twitter if this move is not fought against.\n\nRecall that there were fears of a possible Internet shutdown, or, at least of social media after Twitter aided in the #EndSARS campaign \u2014 a nationwide protest against police brutality. That led us to curate an informative piece on how to bypass an Internet shutdown in Nigeria.\n\nIt is then interesting that all it took this time was a deleted tweet, for the Nigerian government to take such drastic action.\n\nThe Ministry of Information and Culture has also ordered the Nigerian Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to start licensing other over-the-top (OTT) and social media platforms going forward.\n\nIt is probably safe to state that this suspension might not end with Twitter if the NBC implements the full provisions of its broadcast code. In 2019, Nigerian lawmakers passed a Social Media Bill through a second hearing in record time, and it took several human rights bodies to pause proceedings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, all signs point to the fact that the Social Media Bill could be very much alive.\n\nSadly, Nigeria has finally joined the ranks of African countries that have implemented some form of Internet censorship.\n\nTwitter\u2019s decision to open its first African office in Ghana, while advertising job roles meant for Nigeria might now be deemed a masterstroke.",

          "text": "Kibanda TopUp, a Kenyan startup which aims at digitising the food supply chain for micro, small, and medium restaurants in Africa has closed a $460k pre-seed round to increase its customer base.\n\nThe round was led by US-based JAM Fund, with the participation of mPharma\u2019s CEO, Gregory Rockson; Flutterwave\u2019s CEO, Olugbenga GB Agboola; Alarko Ventures\u2019 Managing Partner, Cem Garih; and several angel investors.\n\nThe involvement of local investors like Rockson and Agboola continues a growing trend of African investment in early-stage startups.\n\nLaunched in February 2021 by Co-founders, Njavwa Mutambo and Emilie Blauwhoff, Kibanda delivers goods directly to restaurants via electric tricycles assembled in Nairobi by its partner, ARC Ride.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCustomers can order inventory such as grains, beverages, poultry, and beef via app or SMS and receive their order the next day.\n\nSince launch, the startup has reportedly served 130 restaurants \u2014 announcing restaurant 100 on May 31, 2021 \u2014 and plans to use the funding to hire critical team members in engineering and supply chain who will enable fast growth and development of additional products.\n\nIn a recent interview with the Tony Elumelu Foundation of which he is an alumnus, Mutambo revealed plans to expand to Lagos.\n\n\u201cWe are increasing restaurants\u2019 contributions to Africa\u2019s GDP by helping reduce cost with the supply chain. We are doubling down on our efforts in Kenya and our next location is Lagos \u2013 the reason being that we have to be where the majority of restaurants are, and Nigeria has a large number of these informal restaurants.\u201d says Mutambo\n\nKibanda faces the problem of solving issues around logistics and transport. To address the challenge of transportation costs, the company uses electric tricycles Kenya leading to a reduction in cost by 25%.\n\nWith plans to expand into other countries, this might pose a challenge of scalability especially in countries where it might not be able to use this to its advantage.\n\nMutambo is an experienced hand in the logistics space having served as CEO of Musanga Logistics \u2014 a Zambia-based Software as a Service (SaaS) platform connecting shippers and carriers in real time \u2014 and Global Lead for Product Operations at Lori Systems \u2014 an e-logistics company in Kenya.\n\nBased on Blauwhoff\u2019s skills in entrepreneurial digital strategy and project management, and Mutambo\u2019s experience in logistics, Rockson expresses confidence in the founders\u2019 vision.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLocal informal restaurants are the heart of social commerce in African neighbourhoods. Kibanda TopUp has a great opportunity to drive a transformation of these businesses into a formal restaurant cooperative to maximise the economic potential. I am excited about the team behind this journey as they have the right experience and intent to build a huge business,\u201d says Rockson",

          "text": "Its first flight is days away yet Green Africa, the Lagos-based startup budget airline, is edging closer to disrupting the Nigerian airspace forever. It has announced its entrance with cheaper airfares for seven routes including Lagos to Abuja, a strategy that looks well suited to a large country where average incomes are low and rising insecurity is increasingly discouraging road travel.\n\nGreen Africa\u2019s strategy is not new, at least not on the global scene. It has a similar playbook to the world\u2019s largest low-cost carrier, Southwest Airlines. Southwest, despite being a low-cost carrier has been able to stay profitable through many decades. It even has an economic term named after it popularly called \u201cthe Southwest effect\u201d.\n\nSouthwest started out with an idea to make air travel accessible for all. While most carriers in the U.S. focused on wealthy travelers, it set out to disrupt the market by giving more people the opportunity to travel by air at a low cost.\n\nSouthwest Airlines focused on four main things: a low-cost structure that stayed low due to fast growth, happy employees who liked their jobs and translated that to customers, being future-minded, and differentiated.\n\nGreen Africa, just like Southwest, is coming into the Nigerian aviation sector with a low-cost structure with fares between N16,500 and N23,000, which is about a 50 to 70 percent slash in average fares charged by other airlines. Although, there have been questions as to whether the prices will remain low.\n\nRead Also: Green Africa completes acceptance of 3 ATR 72-600s in preparation for deployment\n\n\u201cI would not say the price they have started with will be permanent, it is an introductory offer but you can be sure that of you pick the first three airline in the country with the lowest fare in two or three months, Green Africa would be one of them\u201d Olumide Ohunayo, a member of the Aviation Safety Roundtable Initiative (ASRTI) said.\n\n\u201cThey have started with a very low-cost aircraft, they are taking a smaller market that fits the Nigerian market and if they build on that and get good maintenance organisations, continue with the same fleet, get better deals with the manufacturer of such aircraft, the maintenance and cost of operation would go lower, their fare will definitely not increase.\u201d Ohunayo said.\n\nDespite the similarity in low fares, differences such as fleet and routes make Green Africa different from Southwest.\n\nGreen Africa will use ATR72-600S jetliners, a turboprop, while Southwest operates Boeing 737 jet planes. Turboprops are generally more fuel-efficient than jets whose fuel usage is higher.\n\nA BusinessDay analysis shows that for a one-way trip, a jet aircraft\u2019s flight from Lagos to Abuja consumes nothing less than 8,000 litres and at N220/litre, airlines pay about N1.76 million for fuel alone.\n\nA turboprop consumes about 58-100 gallons of fuel per hour compared to a jet aircraft which consumes about 77-239 gallons of fuel every hour, according to SherapReport. This means on average, turboprop\u2019s fuel consumption is about 155 percent lesser than jet aircraft, which helps Green Africa save costs.\n\nEight years ago, Southwest expanded its routes to 14 countries outside the US after it gained more domestic passengers than any US airline. For now, Green Africa will fly to seven domestic destinations from Lagos, including Akure, Ilorin, Abuja, Owerri, Port Harcourt and Enugu.\n\nUnlike full-service carriers, Southwest has all its activities tailored towards low-cost delivery. No meals are served, no seats assigned, or any premium class service.\n\nThe Nigerian market is dominated by full-service carriers; low-cost airlines like Southwest are uncommon. It is this niche Green Africa wants to fill.\n\n\u201cWe are crafting a network plan that will afford customers the opportunity to pursue their economic interest or simply spend more time with family and friends,\u201d Babawande Afolabi, the CEO of Green Africa said during the announcement that the airline was commencing operations.\n\nUnsafe roads make Nigerians take to the air\n\nGreen Africa is offering cheap airfares at a time when Nigerians are afraid to travel by road given the rise in the number of kidnap cases on road trips.\n\nRising insecurity on Nigerian roads showed up in data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) which reported a decline of 23.75 percent in Road Transport GDP in the first quarter of 2021 from the previous quarter.\n\nPR24 Nigeria Limited, a private security agency released a recent travel advisory report to highlight areas that are currently unsafe and no state in Nigeria was classified as safe.\n\nOf the 36 states, 14 were classified as high-risk regions; 3 (Adamawa, Borno and Yobe) were classified as dangerous while 19 were in the medium-risk group.\n\nOwerri and Enugu, two of the routes Green Africa plans to ply, were classified as high-risk regions which means only essential travel should be made to these states. For regions classified as medium risk travel security is advised when traveling to those areas.\n\nFriendly prices for infrequent flyers\n\nNigerians travel a lot; after food, Nigerians spend the most on transportation.\n\nAccording to the 2019 consumption expenditure by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the total household expenditure on food and non-food items was N40 trillion.\n\nMore than half of this was spent on food while 43.3 percent was spent on non-food items. In the non-food category, 6.4 percent was spent on transportation, followed by health, education and services with 6.1 percent, 6 percent and 5.5 percent respectively.\n\nWith the insecurity, air transport has become the preferred travel option for Nigerians, for those who can afford it.\n\nData from the NBS also show that on average, bus journeys within cities have increased 72 percent to N3,861 in April 2021 compared to N2,237 recorded in April 2020.\n\nAirfare cost also averaged N36,409 in April 2021, this is an 18.43 percent increase compared to N30,743 recorded in the same period last year, according to data from the NBS.\n\nTransportation costs are increasing at a time when 40 percent of the population is classified as poor. This means an average of four out of 10 individuals in Nigeria live below $1.90 (N780) per day.\n\nNigeria has the second-highest unemployment rate in the world after Namibia at 33.3 percent. With inflation at 18.12 percent and food inflation is also at 22.7 percent, Nigerians are having a hard time affording food and other basic necessities.\n\nAlthough Green Africa only covers seven domestic destinations for now its promise to charge airfare as low as 16,500, makes air travel attractive for more Nigerians.",

There\u2019s no explanation of how the cash-strapped state firm will pay. The NNPC says its vision is to boost the domestic refining capacity and to become a net exporter of petroleum products.\n\nNigeria\u2019s partly private fuel-import system had long been riddled with patronage and corruption. Fuel was imported only to be smuggled to neighboring states, and labor unions and civic groups accused the government of making billions of dollars of illegal payments for fuel subsidies. Idled government refineries served that system well.\n\nRead Also: Nigeria can forget million-dollar oil tax revenues as energy transition nears\n\n\u201cThe state\u2019s record at managing its own refineries speaks for itself \u2014 none of them have worked in years,\u201d said Antony Goldman, founder of Promedia Consulting, a political risk advisory firm. \u201cThis is just how a small, but influential network of traders likes it.\u201d\n\nWhile the NNPC may not be looking to control the plants, its influence would still be outsized. It\u2019s likely to be relied upon for crude, and the government is responsible for permits and rules that need to be adhered to for a private business to succeed.\n\nSince stakes weren\u2019t in the draft reform bill sent by the presidency to the National Assembly, the NNPC\u2019s proposal may not come to pass. Still, the move raises the whiff of interference from entrenched \u201clobbies seeking to dilute the reform process,\u201d Goldman says.\n\nWhile the NNPC says it wants to turn Nigeria into a fuel-products exporter, it hasn\u2019t demonstrated the capability to do so. The government may be best advised leaving it to others.",

Fr. Fidelis Arhedo made the call while delivering a keynote address to audience at an event organized by the body in Uromi, Esan North East Local Government Area of Edo State, to commemorate the 2021 Child Protection Day.\n\nHe described Child Protection as the safeguarding of children from violence, exploitation, abuse and neglect, adding that Article 9 of the UN Convention on the Right of the child provides for the protection of children in and out of schools and places of worship.\n\nThe clergyman also emphasized the need for leaders in the community to be supportive of children and families, just as he asked employers to provide family-friendly work environment.\n\nHe blamed lack of parenting skills, drug and alcohol use, poor parent-child relationship, difficulties in managing anger and stress, personal health issues, including low self-confidence, among others for the prevalence of child abuse in the society.\n\nRev. Fr. Arhedo consequently admonished parents to discipline their children thoughtfully, teach children their rights, invest in kids and implored people to endeavour to report any case of child abuse to relevant agencies for prosecution.\n\nSpeaking on the the theme of the 2021 Child Protection Day, \u201cThe Role of Parents and Caregivers in the Protection of Children, the Coordinator of the Edo State Child Protection Network, Barr. Stella Obehi Ojeme said it was the right of every child to be protected.\n\nHe listed the types of Child Abuse to include Physical, Emotional and Sexual Abuses, asserting that abusing a child constituted the worst thing anybody could do to a child.\n\n\u201d It is the right of children to be protected. When you protect children, you are not doing them a favour. It is the duty of everyone to protect children because we are all stakeholders.\n\n\u201cNot putting a child in school is another form of child abuse. Every child deserve to be well treated. Discrimination against children is yet another form of abuse\u201d, she said.\n\nParticipants at the event were secondary students from the five local government areas of Edo Central Senatorial Districts, parents, teachers, security agents, civil society groups, among others.\n\n...",

VPNs protect you from online snooping, interference, and censorship.\n\nHere are some VPN providers you can pick from;\n\n1.

          "text": "The challenges hitherto experienced by Importers and exporters at the nation\u2019s ports and borders may soon become a thing of the past as the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control NAFDAC and the Global Alliance for Trade Facilitation GATF have commenced putting together strategies aimed at achieving standardization and harmonization of documents for export and import trade with a view to simplifying trade formalities and procedures and ultimately ensuring ease of doing business in Nigeria.\n\nThis was disclosed by the Director General of NAFDAC, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye at a virtual meeting with the Global Alliance for Trade Facilitation, Nigeria top officials led by its Project Lead, Mr. Bernard Traynor.\n\nThe project is being powered by the Global Alliance for Trade Facilitation. It\u2019s an organization that is being hosted by the Centre for International Private Enterprise, International Chambers of Commerce, and the World Economic Forum. The project in Nigeria is being implemented by the German Technical Cooperation popularly known as GIZ. The alliance is supported by the governments of US, Canada, Germany, Denmark and government of Australia through their respective agencies.\n\nIn a statement by NAFDAC Resident Media Consultant, Sayo Akintola on Friday, June 4, 2021, Prof Adeyeye who was represented by Dr Abimbola Adegboye, Head of Trade and International Relations at the Agency reiterated measures that NAFDAC has already put in place to ensure that there\u2019s a seamless and more robust operational procedure with both export and import at the borders; and achieve cooperation amongst government agencies at the borders.\n\nShe said NAFDACs focus now is to ensure smooth trade facilitation and regulation, stressing that operations of regulators should not pose an hinderance to trade transactions but facilitate them. \u2019\u2019We are focused on making sure that there are not so many interferences between the users of our facilities and ourselves. So, we try as much as possible to remove both human interferences under the guise of consultants. Because more or less they do not facilitate trade. They tend to distort it\u2019\u2019.\n\nAccording to Prof. Adeyeye, trade should be on basis of safety and quality, noting that, that is the only way trade could be sustained. \u2018\u2019If quality is not put into your product, It gives the country a bad name. They blacklist the company involved. The consumers are the losers because they do not have value for money and their health is compromised\u2019\u2019.\n\nShe noted that these are the issues that the global alliance is trying to address, adding that \u2018\u2019what will make all these visible and possible is to ensure that operations at the borders are seamless.\n\nIf you have perishable items that are to be exported or that are to be allowed into the country and they are delayed unnecessarily, and they are not held at premium conditions such products could go bad, and quality and the integrity of such product would be compromised leading to health issues with the end-users.\n\nAnything that would make trade operations very easy both for inflow and outflow, that would make the whole process of regulation friendly, we are all for it\u2019\u2019.\n\nIn other not to make the whole process too cumbersome for exporters and importers, she stated that for ease of doing business the agency has ensured that all NAFDAC import licenses consisting of approvals, import and export permits have been made in electronic format which can be verified on the NAFDAC single window for trade portal. \u2018\u2019The import of this is that there is no need for any scanned documents when an importer needs to process form \u2018M\u2019.\u2019\u2019\n\nIn his submission, the Project Manager of Global Alliance for Trade Facilitation, Nigeria. Mr. David Okeku, the title for the project is Standardization and Harmonization of Trade formalities and procedures in Nigeria. He disclosed that his organization is being powered by the Centre for International Private Enterprise, International Chambers of Commerce, and the World Economic Forum.\n\nHe further explained that the project in Nigeria is being implemented by the German Technical Cooperation popularly known as GIZ and supported by the governments of US, Canada, Germany, Denmark and government of Australia through their respective agencies.\n\n\u2018\u2019Being an alliance, we also have critical private sector partners,. which we work with: BLM, BSM, DHL, Mascline, UPS and WALMART. On a global scale, we have series of projects which we are currently implementing in Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Zambia, Senegal, Uganda and Latin America, Asia and middle East countries\u2019\u2019.\n\n\u2018\u2019How we work in the alliance is that we partner with multinationals, local businesses because we believe strongly that they will bring in their expertise and also best practices; and also bring in supply-chain companies. We use them as our ambassadors globally and in-country. Local businesses also contribute in form of expertise and resources in kind towards the alliance\u2019\u2019\n\nIn Nigeria, he said the on-going project, Harmonization and Simplifying Trade Formalities and Procedures in Nigeria, seeks to support implementing three articles of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Trade Facilitation Agreement. \u2018\u2019This speaks to article 10.1 which borders around formalities and documentary requirements, article 8 which talks about border agencies cooperation and article 2.2 which talks on consultation.\u2019\u2019\n\nAccording to him, the aim of the project is to simplify, standardize and harmonize export and import formalities and trade procedures in Nigeria, adding that it also aims at reducing the average release time and the associated costs, its documentary requirements and border compliance for exports and imports.\n\nHe further explained that the scope of the project is capacity building for border agencies, e.g., NAFDAC, Customs, SON, Quarantine, and other agencies on the ground. \u2018We are also working clearly on defining export data, documents and processes for the Nigeria Customs service, and other partner agencies.\n\nFor now, he said the project is focusing on the Cargo operations in Lagos, after which \u2018\u2019we would then take the lessons learnt and scale it up to Sea cargo operations subsequently\u2019\u2019.\n\n\u2018\u2019Our partners on the ground are the Nigeria Customs Service, FMITI and border agencies like NAFDAC, SON, NDLEA, FAAN while on the side of the private sector, we have the International Chamber of Commerce, Nigeria, MAN, LCCI, the Association of Nigeria Licensed Customs Agents, the Nigeria Private sector alliance, and the Organization for Women in Internal Trade. Private sector companies like DHL, UPS, MARZK are our partners on the ground\u2019\u2019, he said.\n\nMr. Okeku said his organization had conducted a gender study to identify gender specific bottlenecks on air cargo trade, adding that \u2018\u2019We also worked out or defined mainstreaming approaches and series of targeted actives which are currently being incorporated into our work plan\u2019\u2019.\n\n\u2018\u2019In February we realized a memorandum of understanding with the Nigeria Customs as a lead agency for border operations in Nigeria. We had series of capacity buildings for the customs service with trade facilitation related topics. Last month we had an executive master class for the management of the Nigeria Customs Service on trade facilitation agreement issues in Nigeria\u2019\u2019.\n\nGoing forward, he said a policy steering group at the headquarters level which will be chaired by the Federal Ministry of Trade and Investment and the NCS would be set up with a similar group at the operational level on the ground at the Lagos Airport.\n\nHe said a baseline assessment at the Lagos airport would be conducted and agreed with stakeholders on target model and workplan. For the policy steering group and operational steering group, \u2018\u2019we would need a representation at the headquarters level that would be giving the management direct feedback\u2019\u2019, adding that the policy steering group would cut across all other agencies and private sector key partners. \u2018\u2019It would be in form of high-level group in Abuja for policy and decision-making purposes\u2019\u2019.\n\nFor the operational purposes in Lagos, he said there would be the operational group consisting of the clearing agents on the ground. \u2018\u2019NAFDAC\u2019s representative at the Airport with the key IT division would be representing NAFDAC at the Airport committee level\u2019\u2019.\n\n\u2018\u2019We are having these two approaches for the purpose of fast-tracking our work and for ease of flow of information between the agencies. It\u2019s also a way of enforcing inter-agency cooperation and collaboration both at the high level in Abuja and on the ground in Lagos\u2019\u2019, he said, stressing that \u2018\u2019We strongly believe that this approach will help us in implementing our projects and ultimately help Nigeria achieve the three articles which we are looking at in helping Nigeria implement in Lagos\u2019\u2019.",

It was diffident, conciliatory, even apologetic.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Nobel laureate, after much internal pressure, Buhari eventually visited the scene of slaughter in Benue but rather than threaten to \u201cshock the killers\u201d the President asked them to \u201clearn to live peacefully with your neighbours\u201d.\n\nHe said Buhari only later asked security agents to shoot criminals on sight after much pressure, a move which he said was belated.\n\nSoyinka argued that the world had moved on from the civil war and wondered why Buhari still spoke of it with nostalgia.\n\n\u201cThe evocation of the civil war, where millions of civilians perished, is an unworthy emotive ploy that has run its course. In any case \u2013 and this has been voiced all too often, and loudly \u2013 the nation is already at war, and of a far more potentially devastating dimension than it has ever known.\n\n\u201cEvery single occupant of this nation space called Nigeria has been declared potential casualty, children being pushed to the very battlefront, without a semblance of protective cover. We have betrayed the future. We need no breast-beating about past wars. The world has moved on, so have nations,\u201d he wrote",

          "text": "... Sweden, Amnesty, others ask Buhari to respect free speech\n\n\u2026.NBA, SERAP threaten court action\n\nBy OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nThe decision of President Muhammadu Buhari government to ban social media platform, Twitter in Nigeria, has triggered outrage among Nigerians, even as local and international bodies, including the Swedish government, Amnesty International, Nigeria Bar Association (NBA), among others, have called for immediate reversal of the ban, while Socioeconomic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP), has vowed to drag the government to court.\n\nIn a statement via its twitter handle, the Swedish embassy in Nigeria, called on the Buhari government to respect the right of Nigerians to freedom of speech, as according to it, free speech remained an important part of democracy.\n\nThe embassy in a statement via its handle, @SwedeninNigeria, noted that, \u201cNigerians have a constitutional right to exercise their freedom of expression and a right to access of information. This must be respected. Safeguarding free, independent media and civic spaces for democratic voices is an important part of Sweden\u2019s drive for democracy.\u201d\n\nNigerians have a constitutional right to exercise their freedom of expression and a right to access of information. This must be respected. Safeguarding free, independent media and civic spaces for democratic voices is an important part of Sweden\u2019s #DriveForDemocracy #TwitterBan \u2014 Sweden in Nigeria (@SwedeninNigeria) June 4, 2021\n\nSimilarly, global human rights body, Amnesty International, called on the government to reverse the ban, describing it as an attempt to stifle free speech, which according to it cannot be allowed in a democracy.\n\nIn a statement titled, \u201cAmnesty International condemns the Nigerian government\u2019s suspension of Twitter, Amnesty noted the microblogging site, is a social media widely used by Nigerians to exercise their human rights, including their rights to freedom of expression and access to information.\n\n\u201cWe call on the Nigerian authorities to immediately reverse the unlawful suspension and other plans to gag the media, repress the civic space, and undermine Nigerians\u2019 human rights,\u201d Amnesty said.\n\n\u201cThis action is clearly inconsistent and incompatible with Nigeria\u2019s international obligations including under the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\u201d\n\nStill, the Nigerian Bar Association, in a statement by its president, Olumide Akpata, @OlumideAkpata, while condemning the ban as an infringement of free speech, warned that the impact of such arbitrary decisions on investor confidence is better imagined.\n\nAkpata in the statement asked that the ban be reversed, failure of which the NBA would take legal action against the government.\n\n\u201c@NigBarAssoc has noted with great concern the extraordinary decision of the Federal Govt to suspend the operations of @Twitter in Nigeria and, by necessary implication, the right of Nigerians to freely express their constitutionally guaranteed opinions through that medium,\u201d the statement issued by Akpata said.\n\n\u201cThe FGN also directed the @NgComCommission to immediately commence the process of licensing all OTT and social media operations in Nigeria, which is, at best, yet another disguised attempt to regulate social media, restrict freedom of speech and shrink civic space.\n\n\u201cWhether one likes it or not, we are operating a constitutional democracy, the primary consequence of which is that everything must be done according to law; government must be conducted within the framework of recognised rules and principles which restrict discretionary power.\n\n\u201cThe @NigBarAssoc finds no constitutional or legal authority to support the peremptory action of the Federal Government to suspend the operations of Twitter in Nigeria. Beyond the dent on our constitutional democracy, at a time when the Nigerian economy is unarguably struggling the impact of arbitrary decisions such as this on investor confidence is better imagined.\n\n\u201cConsequently, if this decision is not immediately reversed, the @NigBarAssoc will have no choice but to challenge same in the interest of the public and for the sake of our democracy.\n\nOn its part, SERAP, @SERAPNigeria, said it is commencing immediate legal action against the government over the decision, while maintaining that freedom of speech is a fundamental human right.\n\n\u201cNigerians have a right to freedom of expression and access to information including online, and we plan to fight to keep it that way,\u201d the body said. \u201c@NigeriaGov, we\u2019ll see you in court.\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s Federal Government had suspended the operations of Twitter in Nigeria indefinitely.\n\nThis was disclosed by the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, via a statement issued by the Ministry\u2019s spokesperson, Segun Adeyemi on Friday.\n\nThe Minister cited the persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government has suspended, indefinitely, the operations of the microblogging and social networking service, Twitter, in Nigeria,\u201d the statement read.\n\n\u201cThe Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, announced the suspension in a statement issued in Abuja on Friday, citing the persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\n\n\u201cThe Minister said the Federal Government has also directed the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to immediately commence the process of licensing all OTT and social media operations in Nigeria.\u201d",

          "text": "The parents of the abducted 136 pupils of the Salihu Tanko Islamiyya school in Tegina town, Rafi LGA, in Niger state have spoken up.\n\nThey accused the state government of abandoning them just as they say the bandits have raised the ransom for their release from N120 million to N200 million.\n\nArmed bandits stormed the school riding in motorcycles and abducted the pupils, some of them who were under four years, on Sunday, May 27. Three teachers were also abducted.\n\nIn an emotional-laden interview on AriseTV today, June 4, the headteacher of the school, Abubakar Alhassan, whose child was also abducted alongside his sister, broke down in tears as he accused the state government officials of not contacting the state government of neglecting them or even showing sympathy to them.\n\n\u201cMy own children. They took them to an unknown place. They took them to bushes where they are to sleep on the ground. No leaf, no mat. How do you expect them to live like that?\n\nAll eyes are on me as the head teacher. I have witnessed the funeral prayers of one of the parents very close to the school. She had just one child in the school.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t around when the incident happened. When she came back, they told her that this is what is happening.\n\nREAD ALSO: Why i stayed a baby mama for four Years \u2013 Omawumi\n\nBefore you know, within 10-15 minutes, she fainted and that was the end of her, she died. That was the day before yesterday.\n\nOne day after the incident happened, another parent, a woman, died from heart attack.\n\nThe government, are we not Nigerians? Are we not Nigerlites? That the government cannot intervene in this issue? This money they are sending to them from the Federal government, is it their money? No sympathy at all. None of the government officials didn\u2019t say hi or sorry to us. Are we animals? We are not. We are Nigerians. I am too sad\u201d\n\nAnother parent of one of the abducted students, Tanko Zagi, said they are yet to hear from the state government\n\n\u201cSince that day up till now, we have not seen anything from the state government. But the local government chairman has been up and doing so that these children can be rescued. But the state government, we don\u2019t know. No official of the government has come to condole with us\u201d he said\n\nThe state government on Wednesday said it was doing everything possible to ensure the safe return of the students.",

          "text": "By Kazeem Ugbodaga\n\nNobel Laureate, Prof. Wole Soyinka has berated President Muhammadu Buhari for threatening to treat the Igbo in the language they understand.\n\nBuhari had said: \u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian Civil War.\n\n\u201cThose of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.\u201d\n\nSoyinka, in a lengthy statement titled: \u2018To Shock and Awe,\u201d said when, however, a Head of State threatened to \u201cshock\u201d civilian dissidents, to \u201cdeal with them in the language they understand\u201d, and in a context that conveniently brackets opposition to governance with any blood-thirsting enemies of state, there was need to call attention to the precedent language of such a national leader under even more provocative, nation disintegrative circumstances.\n\n\u201cWhat a pity, and what a tragic setting, to discover that this language was accessible all the time to President Buhari, where and when it truly mattered, when it would have been not only appropriate, but deserved and mandatory!\n\n\u201cWhen Benue was first massively brought under siege, with the massacre of innocent citizens, the destruction of farms, mass displacement followed by alien occupation, Buhari\u2019s language \u2013 both as utterance and as what is known as \u201cbody language\u201d \u2013 was of a totally different temper. It was diffident, conciliatory, even apologetic. After much internal pressure, he eventually visited the scene of slaughter. His language? Learn to live peacefully with your neighbours.\n\n\u201cThe expected language, rationally and legitimately applied to the aggressors, was exactly what we now hear \u2013 \u201cI shall shock you. I shall deal with you in the language you understand\u201d. That language was missing at the moment that mattered most. It remained \u201cmissing in action\u201d for years until a belated \u201cShoot at sight\u201d outburst. Too late, and of course, inappropriately phrased. The precedent had been set, the genie let out of the bottle, consolidating a culture of impunity that predictably spread its bloody stain all over the nation,\u201d he said.\n\nSoyinka added that Buhari\u2019s recent deployment of this language was thus wrongly targeted, and tragically untimely, adding that even while he was threatening dissidents, an agenda of both secessionism and alien occupation was taking place not too distant from Aso Rock.\n\nHe said ISWAP was taking over the already excised territories of Shekau\u2019s Boko Haram, appointing new warlords of the occupational forces, sectioning Nigeria into vassal states and unfurling their replacement flags of domination.\n\nSoyinka lamented that the evocation of the Civil War, where millions of civilians perished, was an unworthy emotive ploy that had run its course.\n\nHe added: \u201cIn any case \u2013 and this has been voiced all too often, and loudly \u2013 the nation is already at war, and of a far more potentially devastating dimension than it has ever known. Every single occupant of this nation space called Nigeria has been declared potential casualty, children being pushed to the very battlefront, without a semblance of protective cover. We have betrayed the future.\n\n\u201cWe need no breast beating about past wars. The world has moved on, so have nations. Some, however, prefer to move backwards. The continent is full of these atavists. In Nigeria, powerful cliques of this persuasion still roam the corridors of power We are indeed at war. It does not take the formal declaration of hostilities, with or without lethal bombardments, for a nation to find itself shell-shocked. The populace of this nation is already in that shell-shocked condition. So, what is there left to shock?\u201d\n\nThe Nobel laureate said it is time to think \u201coutside the box\u201d and that many, in so doing, found no landing place except dissolution, \u201cis not a crime. It is not peculiar to any peoples, and is embedded in the ongoing history of many, and not only on this continent.\n\n\u201cIt is their natural right as free citizens, not slaves of habit and indoctrination. Where disillusion rides high, sentiment tumbles earthwards, and the only question becomes: what can be salvaged? It thus remains the responsibility of leadership to persuade them, through both discourse and remedial action, that there are other options. Attempted bullying is not a language of discourse, nor the facile ploy of tarring all birds with the same feather.\u201d",

President Buhari must immediately rescind this unconstitutional suspension. We will see in court if the suspension is not rescinded within 48 hours.\u201d\n\nThe statement, read in part: \u201cSuspending Twitter in Nigeria would deny Nigerians\u2019 access to information, and disrupt the free exchange of ideas and the ability of individuals to connect with one another and associate peacefully on matters of shared concern. It would also seriously undermine the ability of Nigerians to promote transparency and accountability in the country, and to participate in their own government.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe call on the Nigerian authorities to guarantee the constitutionally and internationally recognized human rights of Nigerians including online.

          "text": "\u2026It\u2019s a threat to nation\u2019s corporate existence \u2013 CDS \u2018\u20266,145,000 illegal arms with civilian non-state actors\u2019\n\n\u2026Increases insecurity, deaths \u2013 Ex-head of state\n\n\u2026Drives increasing violence rate in Nigeria \u2013 Oxfam\n\n\u2026Land borders, maritime routes poorly manned \u2013 Experts\n\nDespite the efforts being made by security agencies to tackle the myriads of security challenges confronting the country, insecurity is on the increase and experts have attributed it to the proliferation of weapons. BENJAMIN SAMSON in this report takes a second look at the issues amidst citizens\u2019 growing concerns.\n\nThe Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), Gen. Lucky Irabor, recently decried the proliferation of illegal arms in Nigeria, saying it was a threat to the country\u2019s corporate existence.\n\nIrabor stated this in Asaba, the Delta state capital, while addressing journalists after a courtesy visit to Governor Ifeanyi Okowa, adding that the presidential directive to shoot-on-sight anyone illegally bearing an AK-47 rifle was very clear and must be enforced. While saying Nigeria as a country forbade illegal bearing of arms, he warned that anyone found with such weapons was an enemy of the state and would be treated as such.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe mandate of the president for dealing with everyone holding AK-47 illegally is a mandate that must be enforced because we are a state that does not condone illegal bearing of arms.\n\n\u201cThe armed forces and other security agencies are the only institutions that are mandated to carry arms in the course of their duties. So, anyone who is carrying an AK-47 or any other weapon, for that matter, is considered a threat to the existence of the state.\u201d\n\nStatistics\n\nAccording This Day Newspapers, a March 2017 research report by Oxfam estimated that Nigeria had two million small and light arms in the hands of non-state actors. Also, in October 2020, an Africa-focused geo-political research firm, SBM Intelligence, also raised the alarm that the proliferation of small arms and ammunition was driving the increasing rate of violence in Nigeria.\n\nIn the report, the firm noted that \u201cthe number of small arms in circulation in Nigeria, in the hands of civilian non-state actors is estimated at 6,145,000, while the armed forces and law enforcement collectively account for 586,600 firearms.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, the trend of arms proliferation in Nigeria has had an impact on Nigeria\u2019s internal security, which has led to violence and the deaths and injury of thousands of innocent citizens.\n\nA further testament to the harm arms proliferation was doing to Nigeria was the Global Terrorism Index 2020 report, which ranked it the third most terrorised country in the world due to insecurity.\n\nAbdulsalami\u2019s alarm\n\nSimilarly, Nigeria\u2019s former Head of State, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar (retd.), recently expressed concerns over the proliferation of all calibres of weapons in the country.\n\nAbubakar, who spoke during a dialogue session of the Committee with stakeholders in Abuja, lamented the state of affairs in the country, acknowledging that the proliferation of weapons has heightened insecurity and led to over 80,000 deaths and close to three million Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) across the country.\n\n\u201cThe proliferation of all calibres of weapons in Nigeria is worrying. It is estimated that there are over six million of such weapons in circulation in the country. This certainly exacerbated the insecurity that led to over 80,000 deaths and close to three million internally displaced persons.\n\n\u201cWe believe Nigeria must find a way out of these problems. Our hope is that perhaps among us, by listening to your different perspectives, we can begin to build up confidence among our people so that we can hold together. So, our hope is that we shall not only share our collective lamentations about the current situation, but propose some concrete suggestions that can point the way forward, suggestions that can inspire more confidence among our people and ensure that our country remains one,\u201d Abubakar, who is also the chairman of the National Peace Committee (NPC), said.\n\nPorous borders\n\nExperts who spoke with Blueprint noted that the increase in cases of banditry, kidnapping, ethnic conflicts, cult clashes, among others, is as a result of Nigeria\u2019s porous borders.\n\nAlso, the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS), in 2014, through its then comptroller-general, David Parradang, revealed that although the country had 84 approved borders, there were over 1,400 illegal routes.\n\nParradang, who made the disclosure while addressing the National Conference Committee on Immigration, cited the examples of Ogun and Adamawa states, with 83 and 80 illegal posts, respectively.\n\nA security expert, Dr. Don Belema, in his view, blamed it on the lack of harmonious relationships among security agencies in arms proliferation and poor border management.\n\nHe stressed that the federal government should ensure it builds intelligence gathering for the security apparatus in order to tackle the menace.\n\nHe said, \u201cMost of the arms that filtered into the country came in through most of our neighbouring countries that have suffered some kind of armed conflict in the form of insurgency, rebellion, civil war, and so on. Places like Sudan, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Libya, worsen the situation.\n\n\u201cNow, we should begin to ask ourselves: What has been the problem with Nigeria\u2019s security architecture? If we are talking about the security architecture in Nigeria, we should learn to incorporate our entire sister agencies, other than the armed forces and the police. Then we talk about roles, responsibilities and the porous areas, from where these arms come into the country.\n\n\u201cWe have had Customs confiscate rifles that were shipped into the country. We have had them impound 12 cartridges. But those in the security sector will tell you that the problem of the Nigerian security is not such arms like compaction rifles and the double barrels and single barrels because they are firing gauge 12 cartridges, and by law, actually are not prohibited arms. However, they are supposed to be licensable.\u201d\n\nIsa Alkali, a security analyst, said Nigeria\u2019s land borders, particularly in the northern regions, and maritime routes were being poorly manned by those responsible for the tasks. He charged the federal government to revisit the firearms regulations and make it effective.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have porous borders, where many weapons are being brought illegally. There are people hiding arms and ammunition and smuggling into the country. The government needs to look again at the firearms regulations in this country. The law is old; it is a colonial law. We need to look at it and see how to move regulations that could control small arms in the country.\n\n\u201cThere is a committee of federal government bodies that are in charge of small arms proliferation and prevention. The agency should be able to be well-funded in order to do their jobs.\u201d\n\nBorder security\n\nA security/international relations expert and chief executive officer of X-Ray Systems, Mr. Abraham Etukudo, in a chat with this reporter, called on the government to re-strategise and come up with innovative approaches on how to tackle the porous nature of our border.\n\nHe said, \u201cA country is rated by the way it protects its borders from intruders. Nigeria is perennially at the mercy of gunrunning syndicates, smugglers and pastoral herdsmen. The Buhari regime needs to re-strategise quickly on the issue of security in border communities.\n\n\u201cA holistic, innovative approach to achieving operational control of the border is sorely needed now. It is time to re-jig our national patrol strategy. With just a workforce of 22,300 in 2014, the NIS staff strength might need to be re-examined.\n\n\u201cThe allocation of resources, manpower and material, should be based on detailed threats and risk assessments of the borders. Rapid border intervention teams, surveillance systems, radar, satellite and helicopters should be deployed. In the United States, electronic sensors are placed at strategic locations along the nearly 6,000 miles of Mexican and Canadian international land borders and over 2,000 miles of coastal waters surrounding the Florida Peninsula and the island of Puerto Rico to detect people or vehicles entering the country illegally. Video monitors and night vision scopes are also used to detect illegal entries.\n\n\u201cThe federal government must strive to maximise the available resources and apply appropriate prosecutorial pressure and punishment in order to discourage illegal entry into the country.\u201d\n\nInsecurity\n\nIn his view, Dr. Belema said it has posed security and development challenges and resulted in the deaths of thousands of people every year.\n\n\u201cNowadays, if bandits are not attacking communities and kidnapping helpless residents, including students, Boko Haram terrorists or \u2018unknown gunmen,\u2019 usually armed to the teeth, will be attacking security personnel and facilities, carting away every weapon they can lay their hands on in the process\n\n\u201cArms proliferation is enabling the bandits to defy a long list of militancy operations aimed at dislodging them. The bandits have continued to intensify their terrorist operations with recent high profile mass abduction events in Kankara, Katsina state, Jangebe Niger state, Zamfara state, Afaka, Kaduna state and more tragically Greenfield University Kaduna state where five students were executed.\n\n\u201cSecession rhetoric is becoming violent in the South-east and South-west. The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) recently attacked the Owerri Prison, freed over 1,800 persons and torched the facility. It also attacked Police Headquarters in Owerri. Many police personnel have been shot dead in the East, and their service weapon seized, further proliferating weapons.\n\n\u201cKiller Fulani herdsmen who have been declared the fourth most deadly terrorist group in the world have also been able to take over whole communities in the Middle Belt and the Southwest by the force of arms ejecting the inhabitants from their ancestral land.\u201d\n\nFG\u2019s action, battles\n\nIn a bid to tackle the challenges posed by arms proliferation, President Muhammadu Buhari recently established the National Centre for the Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons (NCCSALW) and appointed Maj.-Gen. A.M. Dikko (retd.) as its pioneer coordinator.\n\nThe NCCSALW is domiciled in the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA) and replaces the defunct Presidential Committee on Small Arms and Light Weapons (PCSALW). It will serve as the institutional mechanism for policy guidance, research and monitoring of all aspects of Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) in Nigeria and forms part of the ongoing restructuring of the nation\u2019s security architecture.\n\nAmong others, it is expected to help address emerging threats and strengthen the regional mechanism for the control, prevention and regulation of SALW.\n\nIn a statement, the ONSA while announcing the centre, said it was one of the measures to help tackle the general insecurity in the country as it would \u201cBe fulfilling the requirements of the ECOWAS Moratorium on Import, Export and Manufacture of Light Weapons, as well as the UN Plan of Action to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit trade in SALW.\n\n\u201cThe NCCSALW will serve as the National Focal Point on SALW in Nigeria and lead a multi-stakeholder process involving Ministries, Departments, Agencies (MDAs) and the civil society in implementing all national, UN and ECOWAS plans of action on the control of SALW.\n\n\u201cThe centre will maintain international cooperation and also operate zonal offices in the six geopolitical zones to ensure quick response and effective mobilisation of resources.\u201d\n\nBeyond the centre\n\nReacting on the creation of the centre, Etukudo said it was just the beginning of the battle against arms proliferation, adding that what Nigerians want to see is results.\n\n\u201cAlthough we are averse to the creation of new agencies, which often than not do not add much value to the country as it rather increases the cost of governance, I support anything that will help to address the insecurity situation in the country.\n\n\u201cHowever, it must be noted that the creation of the centre is just the beginning of the battle. It must be made to work so that Nigerians can see results. The centre should hit the ground running; working in synergy with the police, military, Department of State Services (DSS), National Intelligence Agency (NIA), immigration and other paramilitary groups towards meeting set goals.\n\n\u201cStakeholders, especially those that man the borders \u2013 land, air and water \u2013 must not allow pecuniary benefits to continue to put Nigeria at risk. They should reduce the volume of the corrupt practices within their ranks that allows the inflow of SALW into the country in the first place.\n\n\u201cThey should work and share intelligence not only with relevant national security agencies, but also neighbouring countries and regional organs like ECOWAS. The centre is coming on board at a very critical time in the nation\u2019s history and it should ensure that it makes the necessary impact,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

          "text": "The Federal Government on Friday said it has suspended, indefinitely, the operations of the microblogging and social networking service, Twitter, in Nigeria.\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed,\n\nannounced the suspension in a statement issued by his office in Abuja.\n\nThe statement, signed by Ministry spokesperson, Segun Adeyemi, cited the persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\n\nAccording to the statement, the Minister said the Federal Government has also directed the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to immediately commence the process of licensing all OTT and social media operations in Nigeria.\n\nIt is not yet clear how the suspension will work but the Twitter website was still accessible from Lagos as of Friday afternoon.\n\n\u2018Civil War\u2019 Tweet\n\nThe suspension comes days after Twitter deleted a tweet from President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s official account.\n\nThe tweet had referenced the Nigerian civil war as the President threated to treat Nigerians \u201cmisbehaving\u201d in \u201cthe language they understand\u201d.\n\nIt sparked reactions from many Nigerians who interpreted the statement as a threat to commit human rights violations.\n\nFormer presidential candidate Kingsley Moghalu said Buhari\u2019s threat \u201cis not the kind of word he should say as the president.\u201d\n\nBuhari made the threat after receiving security reports from the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), on the series of recent attacks on INEC facilities nationwide.\n\n\u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigeria Civil War,\u201d the tweet said.\n\n\u201cThose of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.\u201d\n\nA video of Buhari making the remark was also deleted by Twitter from the official Presidency account on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThis Tweet is no longer available because it violated the Twitter Rules. Learn more,\u201d Twitter said.\n\nTwitter activities \u2018suspicious\u2019\n\nReacting to the tweet deletion, Minister Mohammed had held a press conference on Wednesday at the State House in Abuja.\n\nHe accused Twitter of being impartial in its curation and said the social media firm\u2019s activities were suspicious.\n\n\u201cWe have a country to rule and we will do so to the best of our ability. Twitter\u2019s mission in Nigeria is very suspect, they have an agenda,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe mission of Twitter in Nigeria is very suspicious. Has Twitter deleted the violent tweets that Nnamdi Kanu has been sending? Has it? The same Twitter during the ENDSARS protests that were funding ENDSARS protesters, it was the first to close the account of the former president of the US, Trump.\n\n\u201cAnd you see when people were burning police stations and killing policemen in Nigeria during ENDSARS, for Twitter, it was about the right to protest. But when a similar thing happened on the Capitol, it became insurrection.\u201d\n\nHe said Twitter had displayed bias during the #EndSARS protest which led to the looting and destruction of government and private property.\n\nThe minister asked what rule President Buhari had violated to warrant his tweet to be deleted.\n\n\u201cTwitter may have its own rules, it\u2019s not the universal rule,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Mr. President, anywhere in the world feels very bad and concerned about a situation, he is free to express such views. Now, we should stop comparing apples with oranges.\n\n\u201cIf an organisation is proscribed, it is different from any other which is not proscribed. Two, any organisation that gives directives to its members, to attack police stations, to kill policemen, to attack correctional centers, to kill warders, and you are now saying that Mr. President does not have the right to express his dismay and anger about that?\n\n\u201cWe are the ones guilty of double standards. I don\u2019t see anywhere in the world where an organisation, a person will stay somewhere outside Nigeria and will direct his members to attack the symbols of authority, the police, the military, especially when that organisation has been proscribed. By whatever name, you can\u2019t justify giving orders to kill policemen or to kill anybody you do not agree with.\u201d",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government has suspended, indefinitely, the operations of social networking service Twitter.\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, announced the suspension in a statement issued in Abuja on Friday, citing the persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\n\nThe Minister said the federal government has also directed the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to immediately commence the process of licensing all OTT and social media operations in Nigeria.\n\nThe federal government had on Wednesday accused the social media giant of double standards in its treatment of issues affecting Nigeria.\n\nIt warned that it would not allow the microblogging site to dictate to President Muhammadu Buhari his views on national issues.\n\nThe accusation followed the decision of Twitter to delete a controversial post by Buhari on the Nigerian civil war.\n\nThe president, in the post on Tuesday, had warned against insurrection, saying that those fomenting trouble in the South-east are in for a rude shock.\n\nBuhari, in a series of tweets on Tuesday via his verified Twitter handle @mbuhari had said: \u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian civil war. Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.\u201d\n\nBuhari\u2019s statement, which was also tweeted, sparked outrage on social media with some Nigerians reporting it to Twitter.\n\nHowever, some said the president sounded firm in his warning against perpetrators of violence in the South-east.\n\nBut on Wednesday, Twitter pulled down the tweet for violating its community standards.\n\nTwitter, in a comment, said: \u201cThis Tweet violated the Twitter Rules.\u201d\n\nThe federal government, however, kicked against the decision with the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, wondering why Twitter would object to a submission by the president on national issues but would ignore provocative postings by the leader of the proscribed Independent People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu on its site.\n\nThe minister told journalist at the end of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting at the State House, Abuja that Twitter\u2019s mission in Nigeria is suspect.\n\nHe wondered if Twitter has ever deleted offensive tweets by Kanu.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe mission of Twitter in Nigeria is very suspect. Has Twitter deleted the violent tweets that Nnamdi Kanu has been sending? Has it? The same Twitter during the ENDSARS protests promoted tweets trying to raise funds for the ENDSARS protesters. It was the first to close the account of former President of US, Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cAnd you see, when people were burning police stations and killing policemen in Nigeria during ENDSARS, for Twitter, it was about the right to protest. But when a similar thing happened at the Capitol, it became insurrection. You see, we are not going to be fooled by anybody.\n\n\u201cWe have a country to rule and we will do so to the best of our ability. Twitter\u2019s mission in Nigeria citing those two examples is very suspect. What is their agenda?\n\n\u201cHow does Mr. President\u2019s speech that anybody who is destroying infrastructure, who is destroying police stations, who is destroying INEC offices should be ready for the consequences; is that inciting violence?\u201d\n\nWhile accepting the fact that Twitter may have its own rules, Mohammed said that should not stop Buhari from expressing his views against a banned organisation like IPOB inciting people to commit arson and the likes in the South-east.\n\nHe stated: \u201cTwitter may have its own rules, it\u2019s not the universal rule. If Mr. President, anywhere in the world feels very bad and concerned about a situation, he is free to express such views. Now, we should stop comparing apples with oranges.\n\n\u201cIf an organisation is proscribed, it is different from any other which is not proscribed. Two, any organisation that gives directives to its members to attack police stations, to kill policemen, to attack correctional centres, to kill warders, and you are now saying that Mr. President does not have the right to express his dismay and anger about that? We are the one guilty of double standards.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see anywhere in the world where an organisation \u2013 a person will stay somewhere outside Nigeria, and will direct his members to attack the symbols of authority, the police, the military, especially when that organisation has been proscribed.\n\n\u201cBy whatever name, you can\u2019t justify giving orders to kill policemen or to kill anybody you do not agree with.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m saying that you cannot compare anybody with Kanu who boldly say, go and kill policemen. I think sometimes\u2026policemen are brothers, they are our uncle, they are children. We kill them their wives become widows, their children become orphans. And what is the offence of these policemen \u2013 because they are working to keep the country one.\n\nWhat about soldiers that are putting down their lives so that you and I can sleep? It is not acceptable anywhere in the world for anybody, anywhere, to stay in the comfort of wherever he is and now give directives to go and kill soldiers, go and kill policemen.\u201d",
