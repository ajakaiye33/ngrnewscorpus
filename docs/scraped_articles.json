          "title": "ATTACK ON CLARK: PANDEF asks Ohaneze Ndigbo to rein-in IPoB",
          "text": "By Emma Amaize\n\nPAN Niger Delta Forum, PANDEF, umbrella group of the coastal states of Niger-Delta, has urged the leadership of Ohaneze Ndigbo, apex socio-cultural of organization of Igbo people, to call the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPoB, to order over the group\u2019s attack on South-South leader and former Federal Commissioner for Information, Senator Edwin Clark.\n\nNational Chairman, PANDEF and former Deputy Chief Whip of the Senate, Senator Emmanuel Ibok Essien, in a statement, lampooning IPoB for disrespecting the South-South leader, said: \u201cAnything short of that would be inferred to be the tacit approval of the balderdash of IPoB.\u201d\n\nPANDEF chair asserted: \u201cOver the years, the highly respected chief who was a federal minister of information and distinguished Senator of the Federal Republic, has in his capacities as an educationist, politician, public servant, lawyer, lawmaker, community leader and nationalist, continued to play vital roles to stimulate unity, peace and development in the Niger Delta region, and Nigeria, at large.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has been working with other patriotic Nigerians, including the leadership of the apex Igbo socio-Cultural organization, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, and eminent personalities of Igbo extraction, towards the realization of a better Nigeria, where equity, fairness and justice would reign, and which, he remains doggedly committed to, even at age 94.\n\n\u201cThough PANDEF assumes no well-meaning Igbo son or daughter would sanction the aspersion by IPOB on our respected national leader, however, we would insist that the leadership of the Igbo nation denounce the irresponsible statement by IPOB, and tender a public apology to the elder statesman, and, indeed, the entire Niger Delta people, in the interest of healthy relations between the South-East and South-South zones. Anything short of that would be inferred to be tacit approval of the balderdash of IPoB,\u201d he said.\n\nReckless, disgraceful\n\nPANDEF described as \u201cidiotic and foolhardy\u201d the IPoB statement being circulated in the media, credited to one Emma Powerful, a supposed spokesman of the group against Senator Clark., adding: \u201cThe preposterous expressions in the said article could only have emanated from deluded and demented minds, and are quite indicative of the silliness of the IPOB officialdom.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a shame that they cannot differentiate between fact and fantasy. This stupidity would erode any sympathy they had hitherto received from the South-South geopolitical zone.\n\nS\u2019South can\u2019t be Biafra\n\n\u201cLet us restate, without any equivocation, that the Niger Delta region is not part of Biafra and that no inch of the South-South geopolitical zone shall be part of any imagined \u2018Republic\u2019.\n\n\u201cIt is rather puerile for IPOB or any other group to consider that Niger Delta region would be part of any arbitrary contraption. If it becomes necessary for the Niger Delta people to pull out of this country, we shall do so, on our terms.\n\n\u201cRegarding the unsavory remarks, it\u2019s needless to mention the privileged credentials and contributions of the iconic nationalist and esteemed nonagenarian, whose life is a rich source of inspiration to many, within and beyond the borders of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, since the IPOB belligerents are so infantile and uninformed, it would suffice to state that the influence and significance of Chief E. K. Clark transcend the South-South zone and the Niger Delta. He is an unswerving voice that resonates across Nigeria; for decades, speaking out against oppression, discrimination, and marginalization in the country,\u201d PANDEF chairman asserted.",

          "text": "The member representing Nkwerre State Constituency in the Imo House of Assembly, Obinna Okwara, has described the suspension of six members of the House as a normal occurrence which is not alien to assemblies across the country.\n\nThe lawmaker, who doubles as the Chief Whip of the Assembly, maintained that the suspended lawmakers went contrary to the rules and regulations of the Assembly and were subsequently suspended.\n\nThe reason, according to him, was to restore decorum and implant sanity in the legislative system of the state.\n\nThe Chief Whip, in a press briefing on Friday, said that the House was not witch hunting anyone but was only concerned in maintaining the sanctity of the Assembly.\n\nOn the introduction of the term, \u2018unparliamentary conduct\u2019 in Imo State House of Assembly, he disclosed that it was one of the suspended members of the Assembly who served at the previous House that coined the phrase.\n\nOrji Kalu links prison term to 2023 presidency\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe originator of the phrase was one of the arrowheads in the previous House. He personally coined the phrase and used it against five lawmakers who were suspended at the Acho Ihim-led 8th Assembly.\n\n\u201cThe immediate past speaker of this 9th Assembly, Chiji Collins, was one of those who were affected at the previous House.\n\n\u201cYou see, power is transient. You don\u2019t see it as a lifetime thing. When you have it, don\u2019t use it to intimidate others.\n\n\u201cA lot of people have been asking to know what the suspended lawmakers committed that was termed \u2018unparliamentary\u2019. Note that the legislature is an independent arm of government and also has rules and regulations guiding it. Because it is entirely a legislative affair, we know when our members go contrary to the rules.\n\n\u201cWe are not witch-hunting anybody. The suspended lawmakers were found wanting in the rules and regulations, and were suspended in order to restore decorum in the Assembly.\n\n\u201cAlthough, one of the suspended members has appealed to the ad hoc disciplinary committee to plead for his misconduct. That was why the speaker set up that committee.\n\n\u201cAfter thoroughly hearing his case by the deputy speaker, Amara Iwuanyanwu-led ad hoc disciplinary committee, they will now take a decisive step either to reinstate the lawmaker or allow the suspension to continue.\n\n\u201cFor those who doubt if the speaker has power to suspend a member of the House, the answer is yes. The Assembly sometime ago, amended the House rules where the speaker was given power to discipline erring members by way of suspending them or referring them to the Committee on Ethics and Privileges.\n\n\u201cAll the six suspended members were part of the amendment. In fact, one of them was a cosponsor of the amendment bill.\n\n\u201cSo why are they shouting and crying to high heaven? Why are the PDP lawmakers talking to the media and talking all sorts of rubbish. When they were in power, they did their bidding and no one raised an eyebrow. They should simply come and apologize for their misconduct instead of making it a serious issue,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, an Assembly source revealed to DAILY POST that the suspended member who allegedly coined the phrase at the previous House was Kennedy Ibeh who represents Obowo state constituency.\n\nOrji Kalu reacts to attack on Abia INEC office",

Igboho yesterday made good his threat to sue the federal authorities over the July 2 raid of his Sooka, Ibadan residence by operatives of the Department of State Security (DSS).\n\nIgboho filed a suit at the Oyo State High Court, Ibadan, against the DSS and the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami (SAN), seeking N500 billion damages.\n\nHe is praying the court for an order for the enforcement of his fundamental human right.\n\nThe suit was filed on a day one of his counsel dismissed as untrue speculations that a Beninese passport was found on the activist.\n\nBesides, a Federal High Court in Abuja yesterday ordered the Department of State Services (DSS) to produce before it on Thursday, July 29, 2021, 12 associates of Igboho who were arrested during the July 2 raid of his Ibadan residence.\n\nIgboho\u2019s suit, according to his lawyers, derived from the fundamental human rights (Enforcement Procedure Rules 2009) and under the inherent jurisdiction of the court as preserved by Section 6 of the 1999 Constitution.\n\nDuring the security raid of the plaintiff\u2019s residence, two of his aides were shot dead while14 others were arrested. The DSS has paraded the suspects and ammunition which they allegedly recovered from the house.\n\nBut the embattled campaigner, who is currently standing trial in Cotonou, Benin Republic, denied that he kept ammunition in his house, saying the armed law enforcers must have come with the said ammunition.\n\nIn the suit, Igboho, through his lawyer Chief Yomi Aliu (SAN), is seeking orders declaring the invasion as a violation of his fundamental human right, and destruction of his property as a violation of his fundamental right to peacefully own property and wealth.\n\nHe wants N500 billion as compensation.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe sum was described as \u201cexemplary and/or aggravated damages for breaching the applicant\u2019s fundamental rights in the course of illegal and/or malicious invasion of his residence situate, lying and being at Igboho Villa. No.1, Dalag Street, Off Soka Bus Stop, Soka Area, Off Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, Ibadan.\u201d\n\nIgboho is also asking the court for a declaration that it was \u201coppressive, malicious, arbitrary and grossly unconstitutional for the 2nd & 3rd respondents to invade\u201d his residence lying and being at Igboho Villa, 1, Dalag Street, Off Soka Bus Stop, Soka Area, Off Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, Ibadan \u201cwithout announcing who they were and ask the applicant to open his gate but rather shot their way through killing two people including an elderly Imam doing Tahjud (night vigil), shooting at cars thereby destroying them and not sparing animals like cats and dogs in total violation of the intendments of the Fundamental Human Rights\u2019 provision in CFRN, 1999 and African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights (Ratification and Enforcement), Act, LFN 2010 protecting the-dignity of human person, sanctity of human life and privacy of citizens and their homes.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiff urged the court to declare that the respondents\u2019 resolve in preventing him from \u201cpropagating his belief in association with other like minds in creating a Yoruba Nation and/or Oduduwa Republic for his Indigenous Yoruba People and hunting him with gun with a view to arresting him dead or alive when he has not called for war in achieving same is against his fundamental rights to freedom of thought, conscience and association since campaign for self-determination is recognised by Nigerian Law and international treaties of organisations to which Nigeria belongs.\u201d\n\nHe prayed the court for an injunction restraining the respondents from arresting, harassing or disturbing him in any way that can violate his fundamental human rights.\n\nIgboho had, soon after the raid, demanded an apology from the DSS and payment of N500 million as damages for destroying his Ibadan residence during the midnight raid.\n\nHis lawyer had, in a statement entitled \u2018Illegal and Grossly Unconstitutional Invasion\u2019 declared that his client has \u201calways preached peace and warned his followers never to have recourse to violence, saying that \u2018it is God and alale (ancestors) that will fight for Yoruba Nation.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cThere is nowhere in the civilised world that a citizen who had no prior invitation by security agent or had resisted arrest will be so invaded with his rights to dignity of human persons, ownership of property and sanctity of life trampled upon during the invasion.\n\n\u201cNo demand to enter was made but rather they shot their way into the house allegedly killing seven people, though a DSS spokesman admitted killing two people.\u201d\n\nIgboho arrested with Nigerian, German passports, says lawyer\n\nOne of Igboho\u2019s counsel, Ibrahim David Salami, yesterday dismissed as untrue speculations that a Beninese passport was found on the activist.\n\nSalami told BBC Yoruba in Cotonou that only Nigerian and German passports were found in his possession at the time of his arrest last Monday while on his way to Frankfurt.\n\nEarlier reports had suggested that Igboho was being quizzed by the Beninese authorities partly on account of that country\u2019s passport he carried at the time of his arrest.\n\n\u201cNo Beninese passport was found on Sunday Igboho when he was arrested,\u201d Salami said.\n\nHe added: \u201cWhat was found on him were Nigerian and German passports.\n\n\u201cHis wife had her German passport at the point of arrest.\u201d\n\nFollowing the bloody raid on Igboho\u2019s Sooka residence, the Department of State Services arrested and detained 13 of Igboho\u2019s associates, adding that during a \u201cgun duel,\u201d it had killed two of Igboho\u2019s supporters later identified as Adogan and Alfa.\n\nDSS had presented seven AK-47 rifles allegedly recovered during the raid on Igboho\u2019s house on July 1, as well as three pump-action guns, 30 fully charged AK-47 magazines, 5,000 rounds of 7.62mm ammunition, five cutlasses, one jack-knife, one pen knife, two pistol holsters, a pair of binoculars, a wallet containing $5, local and international driving licences in his name, ATM cards, a German residence permit No. YO2N6K1NY bearing his name, two whistles, 50 cartridges and 18 walkie-talkies.\n\nOthers were three charm jackets/traditional body armour, two laptops, one Toshiba and one Compaq laptop, Igboho\u2019s passport and those of his aides.\n\nHearing in Igboho\u2019s case in Cotonou is scheduled to resume on Monday.\n\nThe Court on Thursday evening ordered that he be remanded in the custody of Brigade Criminelle in Cotonou pending the submission of charges by the Nigerian government.\n\nThe activist and his wife, Ropo, were arrested at the Cardinal Bernardin International Airport, Cotonou on Monday while trying to catch a flight to Germany.\n\nSpokesman for the Yoruba self-determination groups\u2019 umbrella body, Ilana Omo Oodua (IOO) Mr. Maxwell Adeleye, quoting Igboho\u2019s lawyers, said the activist could not be extradited to Nigeria for two principal reasons: Nigeria and Benin have no Extradition Agreement; and Nigeria has not been able to come up with charges that could lead the court to order lgboho\u2019s extradition to Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat Nigerian government came up with were mere allegations against Igboho such as trafficking in arms and inciting violence that could result in the social disturbance without evidence\u2026\u201d he said.\n\nIgboho has been remanded in the custody of Brigade Criminelle while his wife was released.\n\nCourt orders DSS to produce detained Igboho\u2019s associates\n\nA Federal High Court in Abuja yesterday ordered the Department of State Services (DSS) to produce before it next Thursday 12 associates of Igboho who were arrested during the July 2 raid of his Sooka, Ibadan residence.\n\nJustice Obiora Egwuatu gave the order while ruling on an ex-parte application argued by the lawyer to the 12 detainees, Pelumi Olajengbesi.\n\nOlajengbesi told the court that the plaintiffs have been kept incommunicado since their arrest. The detainees are Abdullateef Ofeyagbe, Amuda Babatunde (alias Lady K), Tajudeen Erinoyen Diekola Ademola, Abideen Shittu, Jamiu Noah, Ayobami Donald, Adelabe Usman, Oluwapelumi Kunle, Raji Kazeem, Taiwo Opeyemi and Bamidele Sunday.\n\nJustice Egwuatu, in his ruling, ordered the DSS to produce them in court on the next date to enable the court inquire into the circumstances constituting grounds of their arrest and detention since July 2, 2021\n\nThe judge also ordered the DSS to show cause why the 12 detainees should not be released on either conditional or unconditional bail.\n\nHe said that in view of the urgency involved in the case, further hearing in the fundamental rights enforcement suit marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/647/2, filed by the detainees, shall be heard during the court\u2019s vacation.\n\nHe adjourned till July 29 for further hearing in the suit which has the DSS and its Director General as respondents.\n\nOlajengbesi, in court documents, said the reliefs sought by his clients were informed by the fact that they \u201care law abiding citizens of Nigeria who enjoy the protection of the Constitution as well as other applicable laws, particularly the provision of sections 35(4) and 36(5) of the Constitution and Section 32 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act (2015).\n\n\u201cThe applicants were arrested in the early hours of Thursday, the 2nd of July, 2021 by officers and agents of the respondents at the residence of Chief Sunday Adeyemo, popularly known as Sunday Igboho, in Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria, and are being detained at the Respondents facility in Abuja.\n\n\u201cThe state of affairs relating to the arrest of the applicants was later confirmed and published by the respondents, who claimed responsibility for their arrest and detention in Abuja.\n\n\u201cUpon the applicants\u2019 arrest, the applicants were subsequently transferred to Federal Capital Territory, Abuja under the watch and guide of the respondents, who have since held the applicants in detention till date.\n\n\u201cFollowing the applicant\u2019s arrest, concrete and concise efforts have been made by their lawyers to get access to the applicants in order to provide them with necessary legal representation as stipulated under the law, but same has been glaringly frustrated by the respondents who have as well denied the applicants access to their lawyers and other family members.\n\n\u201cDespite the clear provisions of law, which place responsibility on law enforcement agency to charge a suspect within 24hrs of arrest, the respondents in flagrant disregard to the provisions of the law have continued to keep the applicants under detention without any charge against them before a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\n\u201cThe applicants are aware that they enjoy the constitutional protection of presumption of innocence as well as fair trial within a reasonable time under the applicable laws in Nigeria.\u201d",
          "summary": "Igboho filed a suit at the Oyo State High Court, Ibadan, against the DSS and the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami (SAN), seeking N500 billion damages.\nHe is praying the court for an order for the enforcement of his fundamental human right.\nADVERTISEMENTThe sum was described as \u201cexemplary and/or aggravated damages for breaching the applicant\u2019s fundamental rights in the course of illegal and/or malicious invasion of his residence situate, lying and being at Igboho Villa.\nHe adjourned till July 29 for further hearing in the suit which has the DSS and its Director General as respondents.\n\u201cUpon the applicants\u2019 arrest, the applicants were subsequently transferred to Federal Capital Territory, Abuja under the watch and guide of the respondents, who have since held the applicants in detention till date.",

          "title": "56 Days After, Bandits Hold on to 116 Tegina Pupils, Amass N50m Ransom",
          "text": "*Make fresh demand for six motorcycles\n\nLaleye Dipo in Minna\n\nNo fewer than 116 of the 136 pupils of Salihu Tanko Islamiyya School in Tegina, Rafi Local Government Area of Niger State, abducted by terrorists on May 30 are 56 days old in the dungeons of their kidnappers today, with hope for freedom still distant.\n\nTears continue to flow in many homes in Tegina, as traumatised parents await a miracle for the release of their kids, following the refusal of the abductors to free the pupils after collecting N50 million ransom contributed by sympathisers.\n\nSeventeen of the initial 136 abductees escaped, while three others died in the forest where they are being held.\n\nThe kidnappers had agreed to free the remaining 116 pupils if the ransom reduced from the initial N200 million to N50 million was paid.\n\nLast Monday, sympathisers mobilised N30 million to the kidnappers at an agreed location in the forest, after an initial N20 million was paid in June. But after counting the money, the abductors declared that it was N4.6 million short, and detained the conveyor of the ransom. The pupils were also not released.\n\nIt was the second time the kidnappers will declare ransom incomplete. In the initial N20 million paid in June, the abductors said it was N2 million short after counting it.\n\nThe kidnappers subsequently phoned the parents last Monday to send the N4.6 million balance, plus another N2 million short from the initial payment of N20 million, totaling N6.6 million.\n\nBesides, the kidnappers are also making fresh demand. They want the parents to supply six brand new Bajaj motorcycles before the pupils would be released.\n\n\u201cWe are fed up, we are leaving everything to God\u201d one of the parents told THISDAY yesterday.\n\nWhen contacted, the Head Teacher of the school, Mallam Abubakar Alhassan confirmed the story saying: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what to do next\u201d.\n\nAlhassan said: \u201cAll the parents are now Koboless. We have sold everything we have to raise the ransoms collected by the bandits, yet they refuse to release our children.\u201d\n\nThree of the abducted pupils have died in the dungeons of the kidnappers, and many of the remaining pupils are said to be seriously ill, resulting from hunger, cold and trauma.\n\nThe pupils, some of their teachers and passersby were abducted on May 30, but 17 of the abductees escaped from the clutches of the bandits three weeks after their abduction.\n\nThree pupils also died in captivity few days back. It was gathered that the bandits gave the sad information to some of the parents in a telephone conversation, but they (bandits) did not disclose the names of the deceased pupils.\n\nThe Chief Imam of Tegina also said he made similar announcement after one of the regular Muslim prayers in the town early this week.\n\nAccording to THISDAY findings, the bandits told the parents contacted that they would send the video of the burial of the late pupils and that of the present condition of the others to confirm their state of health. As at press time, the bandits had not sent the video.\n\nSome parents told THISDAY that the Niger State Government promised to help offset part of the ransom but failed to deliver.\n\nHowever, Secretary to the Niger State Government, Alhaji Ibrahim Ahmed Matane, debunked the claim saying, \u201cThere was never a time that government promised to pay ransom to bandits or assist the parents to pay any or part of the ransom. We have a policy not to pay ransom. We still stand by that policy.\n\n\u201cYou know this issue of payment of ransom is not healthy. Government, as a policy, does not do it but I know that because they are engaging with the bandits, they can tell them anything.\u201d\n\nThe SSG also distanced the government from any official pledge that government would pay part of the ransom saying, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know who that government official is because I coordinate security and I am not aware.\u201d\n\nAsked if government was aware that three of the children had died, he said: \u201cI\u2019m not aware that three of the girls have died. You know these people (bandits) can be very deceptive. They raise a lot of emotions and sentiments so that we will accept their bidding.\u201d\n\nThe pupils, all from Muslim homes, spent the Eid-el-Kabir festival in the den of their abductors.\n\nThe mother of one of the pupils, whose name was not given, died early last month as a result of trauma. The remains of the deceased were interred in Tegina according to Islamic injunction.\n\nSome of the kidnapped pupils are between ages four, and 13. The headmaster of the school, whose two children and a sister are among the abducted, said some of the victims were too young for the ordeals they were facing.\n\nHe also indicted both the federal and state governments for abandoning the school and the parents of the students in their moment of despair.\n\nAlhassan, popularly called Mallam by his community, in an emotion-laden interview on June 5, claimed there had been no sympathy from the government, and wondered why the federal government failed to provide the ransom demanded by the bandits.\n\nHe said it was a lie that the government had sent vehicles and motorcycles into the bush for rescue operation, and denied the report that he had prior information of the attack.\n\nThe head teacher disclosed that the abduction had already led to the death of two parents of the victims, warning that more casualties may happen unless the students regained their freedom quickly.\n\nFighting back tears, Alhassan said on June 5: \u201cI have witnessed the funeral prayer of one of the parents here, very close to the school. She died because she had just one child who is our student. She was not around when the incident happened. When she came back, they told her and within 30 minutes, she collapsed and died. That was the day before yesterday.\n\n\u201cA day after the incident happened, another parent died. She had two children. One was sent to the town while the one with her was kidnapped. She died of heart attack.\n\n\u201cAs I\u2019m talking to you now, my wife is down. She was put on drip, she didn\u2019t cook; she didn\u2019t eat. My little child at home, who slept with me on my bed, woke up only to begin to shout the name of his elder sister, asking me \u201cBaba, when is she coming back?\n\n\u201cOne painful thing was that my sister called me before the last discussion with the bandits, crying. She swore that the children are sick, they cannot walk. She told me they have removed their hijabs. They have unveiled them. They removed their shirts and they are left with only trousers.\n\n\u201cThere is no food. They gave them kulikuli (groundnut cake). How do you expect them to survive? They took them to unknown environments. I heard people saying they kept them on the floor. When you are talking about floors you are not talking about classrooms or a house. No, they are kept in the bush. They are sleeping on the ground, no leaves, not mat. How do you expect them to live like that?\u201d\n\nAnother parent, a mother, Mrs. Hashimu, in an interview, few days after the abduction said: \u201cThe whole incident was terrifying because everything happened in my presence. I was hearing everything. I saw when the bandits were going away with these children but there was nothing I could do. Government is not helping matters at all saying this, saying that, yet we cannot see anything on the ground.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Francis Sardauna in Katsina\n\nBandits, yesterday morning, launched fresh onslaught on Dansadau community, in Maru Local Government Area of Zamfara State, killing four villagers. They also kidnapped 14 others and set ablaze a military armoured personnel vehicle in the community.\n\nA resident of the community, Nuhu Dansadau, who confirmed the incident to THISDAY in a telephone interview said the bandits invaded the community at about 2:45am and operated till 6:am before they whisked away the 14 residents.\n\nHe said the bandits besieged the community and fired several shots in the air and then went into some houses and abducted the 14 p\n\neople, including children and women, saying several people in the community fled for safety.\n\nHe added that the invaders also injured seven other residents before they burnt the military armoured personnel vehicle, stating that despite the ongoing peace and reconciliation programme being run by the state government, killing and kidnapping of innocent people remained the order of the day in Zamfara.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs we speak, one of the injured victims has been moved to Federal Medical Centre, Gusau. The 14 kidnapped victims include seven children, three women and four men.

          "text": "*Emir of Daura urges President to remain focused on securing Nigeria\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday warned contractors and businessmen who have enjoyed government\u2019s patronage against bribing him and other top government officials, including ministers.\n\nRather, he advised the affected contractors to be alive to their Corporate Social Responsibilities (CSR) through which they could give back to the immediate community where they operate.\n\nThis is just as the President\u2019s son, Yusuf Buhari, was named the new Talban Daura by the Emir of Daura, Dr Umar Faruk Umar.\n\nThe President, according to a statement issued by his spokesman, Garba Shehu, gave the warning against bribery, while on a visit to the Emir of Daura, urging businessmen, contractors and other privileged Nigerians who are beneficiaries of government\u2019s patronage to always engage in CSR, instead of seeking to favor individuals with gifts.\n\nPresident Buhari said pointedly, \u201cI don\u2019t want your cheque. Go and assist our communities instead of trying to return kickbacks to public officers, including my office.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want cheques from anyone or organisation as returns or influence of any kind. Let them remember their Corporate Social Responsibilities.\u201d\n\nThe President noted that he would love to visit Daura more frequently, but for the high cost of presidential movements and exposing security personnel to the weather, assuring that his heart remains with the people.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are known for farming and I have my farm here. I could come every two weeks and no one can stop me. But the cost of the movement is high. I would rather that it be used to better our schools, clinics and hospitals.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari said the grace of God had kept Nigeria together as a country in spite of differences that led to a 30-month civil war.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe want to thank God always for keeping us together as a country. From January 15, 1966, the country was thrown into political crisis. We had 30 months civil war that resulted in the loss of about a million lives.\n\n\u201cWe still thank God for keeping us together. We remain grateful to all those who showed interest in our unity and progress. May God continue to bless them.\u201d\n\nThe President, who recalled fond memories of his visit to the palace as a military Head of State, expressed happiness that the warmth and hospitality of the traditional institution had been sustained over the years.\n\nIn his remarks, the Emir of Daura, thanked the President for always creating time to visit his hometown and the palace despite his tight schedule.\n\n\u201cYour visit to Daura reflects your good character which we are very proud of. I can assure you that men, women, children, marketers and artisans are always pleased to receive you and they will be praying for you. Today is not for speeches but for appreciation. We have been blessed so much as a community because you are the leader of the country. You have brought honour to our domain.\n\n\u201dAs a community, we have benefited a lot with increased traffic of people and organisations coming to help us here. We know it\u2019s because of you. May the good Lord always go before you and behind you, and remove all obstacles from your path,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Emir enjoined the President to remain focused on getting results particularly in securing the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cNigeria is lucky to have you at this time. I am not saying it to please you, but if you had not been in power it would have been very difficult. I doubt if we will be here today.\u201d\n\nEmir Faruk also publicly announced conferment of the title of Talban Daura on the President\u2019s son, Yusuf Buhari.\n\nAccording to him, a date would be announced for the turbaning ceremony of the President\u2019s son, which might likely be before his marriage.\n\nThe Emir also announced the creation of a District in the President\u2019s community, with headquarters in Dimurkol.\n\nHe said the turbaning of young Buhari and creation of the District was to further extend and deepen the long relationship between the Palace and the family.\n\nThe royal father said the decision was in agreement with the kingmakers in Daura Emirate Council.\n\nDuring the presidential visit, the Palace used the opportunity to clarify the difference between two titles, Talban Hausa, given to the President of Guinea, Alpha Conde and Talban Daura designated for Yusuf, the President\u2019s son.\n\nThe Palace explained that Daura, as the linchpin of the Hausa society, had conferred titles that have bearing on the Hausa Kingdom and those that are specific to the Emirate.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Says country\u2019s asylum seekers grew from 27,557 to 408,078 in 10 Years\n\n*Applications for refugee status increased by 1,380%\n\n* Estimates 4,000 Nigerian children made orphans by COVID-19 World Bank: Nigeria Going through Its Worst Unemployment Crisis\n\nBy Ndubuisi Francis and Emmanuel Addeh\n\nNigeria is currently going through one of its worst unemployment crises in recent times, a new report by the World Bank has stated.\n\nThe multilateral institution also noted that the socio-economic challenges facing Nigerians in the last 10 years have led to an astronomical increase in the number of citizens seeking asylum and refugee status in other countries.\n\nThis is as the World Bank, in a separate report, has estimated that about 4,000 Nigerian children were made orphans by the COVID-19 pandemic between March 2020 and July 2021.\n\nThe report, which expressed concern about the country\u2019s rising unemployment situation was published by the Washington-based institution with support from the Korea World Bank Partnership Facility (KWPF) and the Rapid Social Response (RSR) trust funds.\n\nIn the report titled: \u2018Of Roads Less Travelled: Assessing the Potential for Migration to Provide Overseas Jobs for Nigeria\u2019s Youth\u2019, the World Bank further estimated that there were 2.1 million Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in Nigeria in 2020 alone.\n\nWorld Bank, however, blamed a combination of rising unemployment, booming demographics, and unfulfilled aspirations as resulting in increasing pressure on young Nigerians to migrate in search of gainful employment overseas.\n\nIn addition, the Washington-based institution disclosed that the number of international migrants from Nigeria has increased threefold since 1990, growing from 446,806 in 1990 to 1,438,331 in 2019.\n\nIt explained that despite this trend, the share of international migrants as a proportion to Nigeria\u2019s population has remained largely constant, increasingly slightly from 0.5 per cent in 1990 to 0.7 per cent in 2019.\n\nAccording to the bank, recent rise in irregular migration notwithstanding, the share of international migrants in Nigeria\u2019s population was much lower compared to the shares in Sub-Saharan Africa and globally.\n\nThe data showed that the number has risen by over 1,380 per cent in the years between 2010 and 2019, indicating that in comparison, the number of persons coming into Nigeria from outside has been relatively stagnant in the decade under consideration.\n\n\u201cAn important trend that is observed in the data is the rise in the number of refugees and asylum seekers from Nigeria. The share of refugees and asylum seekers from Nigeria has increased drastically in the last decade, growing from 27,557 in 2010 to 408,078 in 2019,\u201d it stated.\n\nIt noted that although the country was reaping dividends from the success of its citizens in the diaspora, which was put at five per cent of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2019, when it comes to the discourse on international migration, the narrative has not been palatable.\n\n\u201cNigeria is facing one of the most acute jobless crises in recent times. Between 2014 and 2020, Nigeria\u2019s working age population grew from 102 million to 122 million, growing at an average rate of approximately 3 per cent per year.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, Nigeria\u2019s active labour force population, that is, those willing and able to work among the working age population, grew from 73 million in 2014 to 90 million in 2018, adding 17.5 million new entrants to Nigeria\u2019s active labour force.\n\n\u201cSince 2018, however, the active labour force population has dramatically decreased to around 70 million\u2014lower than the level in 2014\u2014 while the number of Nigerians who are in the working-age population but not active in the labour force has increased from 29 million to 52 million between 2014 and 2020.\n\n\u201cThe expanding working-age population combined with scarce domestic employment opportunities is creating high rates of unemployment, particularly for Nigeria\u2019s youth,\u201d the World Bank report noted.\n\nHowever, between 2010 and 2020, the international financial institution estimated that the unemployment rate rose five-fold, from 6.4 per cent in 2010 to 33.3 per cent in 2020, with the rates being particularly acute since the 2015/2016 economic recession and further worsened as COVID-19 led to the worst recession in four decades in 2020.\n\nIncreasingly, it noted that educated Nigerians were struggling to find employment opportunities in the country while unemployment rates increased substantially for Nigerians across all education levels over the years, becoming progressively challenging for educated Nigerians to find employment opportunities.\n\n\u201cCombined with significant demographic changes and increased aspirations of the youth, Nigeria\u2019s unemployment crisis is creating migratory pressure in the economy.\n\n\u201cUnemployment is considered to be a key driver of migration. Consequently, multiple surveys show that the number of Nigerians, who are looking to migrate internationally is high and increasing,\u201d it pointed out.\n\nIn the last few years, the bank stated that the number of persons eager to migrate has increased from 36 per cent in 2014, to 52 per cent in 2018, noting that the desire to migrate remains higher among unemployed (38 per cent), youth (39 per cent), secondary education graduates (39 per cent), urban residents (41 per cent) and post-secondary graduates (45 per cent) in Nigeria.\n\nIt maintained that since there has not been an expansion of legal migration routes for youth increasingly eager to find opportunities in the overseas labour market, young Nigerians are opting for irregular migration routes to realise their hopes for a better life.\n\n\u201cWhat is worrying, however, is the increase in the number of forced and irregular migrants from Nigeria,\u201cit disclosed.\n\nIt stressed that to ensure mutual cooperation, the European Trust Fund for Africa (EUTF), which was established in 2015, with the aim to promote areas of mutual development interest between Europe and Africa, has since provided more than \u20ac4 billion in aid to African countries to address various development-related challenges and priorities in Africa.\n\nSince its inception, the EUTF, the bank stated, has provided more than \u20ac770 million for migration-related projects in Nigeria, with most of the funds invested in border control measures, awareness campaigns to stop trafficking, and the creation of jobs domestically, including for returned Nigerian migrants.\n\nWhile predicting that by 2100, Europe\u2019s working age population between the ages of 20 and 64 would decline by 30 per cent owing to low birth-rates and increased longevity, it further projected that at same time, the working age-population in Nigeria could increase by 140 per cent.\n\n\u201cBy expanding legal pathways for migration and implementing supporting measures to reap dividends from current migrants in the diaspora, Nigeria can further benefit from international migration.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s institutions are well-placed to promote managed migration approaches that help create opportunities for prospective Nigerian jobseekers to find employment internationally and can be supported to help design schemes that increase the returns to human capital investments for Nigerian youth,\u201d the report concluded.\n\n4,000 Nigerian Children Orphaned by COVID-19\n\nIn a related development, the multilateral institution has estimated that 4,000 Nigerian children were made orphans by the COVID-19 between March 2020 and July 2021.\n\nThe report by the bank\u2019s experts at the Imperial College of London, revealed that over 4,100 Nigerian children lost one or both primary caregivers within the aforementioned period, while 4,300 lost one or both primary and secondary caregivers.\n\nThe report posted on the bank\u2019s blog was jointly authored by World Bank\u2019s Lead Economist, Laura Rawlings and a senior technical advisor, Centre for Disease Control (CDC) COVID-19 International Task Force, Susan Hillis, and titled: \u201cFor every two COVID-19 deaths, one child loses a caregiver. We must do more to address the orphan crisis.\u201d\n\nThe report stated: \u201cThe COVID crisis will leave many unwanted legacies. The world has been closely tracking the COVID-19 death toll, with official mortality counts now reaching over four million people, largely concentrated among adults. The children left behind have been practically invisible.\n\n\u201cOur estimates of the toll on children left behind, just released, are that for every two people, who die of COVID, one child is left orphaned, facing the death of a parent or grandparent caregiver, who had been living in their home.\n\n\u201cBy the end of June 2021, because of COVID-19, our estimates show that nearly two million children under 18 years had lost a mother, father, and/or grandparent caregiver, who lived in their household.\u201d\n\nAccording to the experts, countries with primary caregiver death rates of at least one per 1,000 children include Peru (10.2 per 1,000 children), South Africa (5.1), Mexico (3.5), Brazil (2.4), Colombia (2.3), Iran (1.7), the USA (1.5), Argentina (1.1), and Russia (1.0).\n\nThey also noted that at the current rate, one child was being orphaned every 12 seconds due to a COVID-19-associated death, adding that the toll was growing.\n\nThe authors noted that the COVID-19 related deaths had a wide range of effects on the children from economic, developmental to psychological impacts, which would reverberate across generations.\n\nAccording to them, children orphaned by COVID face a constellation of risks, which often arrive with rapid and broad consequences.\n\n\u201cThe threats of poverty, malnutrition, displacement and separation from siblings or other family members, school dropout, depression, violence and child marriage can emerge suddenly from the Pandora\u2019s box of COVID-19,\u201d they said.\n\nNigeria had as of July 20, 2021, recorded about 2,128 COVID-19 deaths, suggesting that for every one death in the country, an average of two children become orphans.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "James Emejo with agency report\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) yesterday disclosed that its much-anticipated digital currency will be launched on October 1.\n\nCBN Director, IT Department, Mrs. Rakiya Mohammed, revealed this during a private webinar, explaining that the banking sector regulator had been conducting research towards the launch of digital currencies since 2017.\n\nShe added that the central bank may conduct a proof of concept before the end of the year.\n\nThe move to adopt the electronic currency was first disclosed by the CBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, during the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) in May.\n\nHe had said a digital currency will soon become a reality in the country, adding that the central bank had already set up its committee which was working on the concept.\n\nThe CBN governor had further restated the determination of the apex bank to drive the e-Naira project during the recent 306th Banker\u2019s Committee meeting, pointing out that the process was ongoing.\n\nMohammed was quoted by Nairametrics to have highlighted the benefits of the digital currency, saying it would enhance macroeconomic management, boost economic growth, facilitate cross border trade, boost financial inclusion and monetary policy effectiveness.\n\nMohammed said the digital payment instrument would further improve payment efficiency, revenue tax collection, remittance improvement, and targeted social intervention.\n\nShe added that the innovation would also benefit the fintech ecosystem by enhancing operational efficiency, opportunities for fintech start-ups in building services and products as well as financial inclusion that will contribute to economic growth, and the creation of a new system complimenting the traditional payment system.\n\nMohammed had last month said the proposed digital would be launched before December.\n\nAccording to her, every Nigerian would have access to the digital currency.\n\nShe had while briefing journalists at the end of a Bankers\u2019 Committee meeting said: \u201cLet me state categorically that cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin and the rest of them are not under the control of the central bank; they are purely private decisions that individuals make and are not part of this arrangement.\n\n\u201cWe have spent over two years studying this concept of central bank\u2019s digital currency and we have identified the risks. And it is one of the reasons why I said we are setting up a central governance structure that would involve all industry stakeholders to access all the risks as we continue on this journey.\n\n\u201cVery soon we would make an announcement on the date for the launch and by the end of the year, we should have the digital currency.\u201d\n\nAccording to her, about 80 per cent of central banks across the world are presently exploring the possibility of issuing the central bank\u2019s digital currency, saying that Nigeria cannot be left behind.\n\nMohammed had added: \u201cYou are aware that we have two forms of fiat money: The notes and the coins. So, the central bank\u2019s digital currency is the third form of fiat money. So, this digital money is going to complement the cash and note that we have.\n\n\u201cThe central bank digital currency will just be as good as you having cash in your pocket. So, if you are having the currency in your pocket, you are as good as having cash on your phone.\n\n\u201cNow, why did we need to go into this? There are different cases that the central bank is looking at.\n\nFor instance, we have remittances, which is a huge market in Africa. We also know that in the last EFInA report, our target for this year was to achieve 80 per cent financial inclusion. We are about 60 per cent and at the rate we are going, it is unlikely we would meet this target. But the central bank digital currency would accelerate this target.\u201d\n\nShe said it would support the cashless policy as well as innovation, adding that the central bank has a \u201cvery clear roadmap on this and we are about to move to the next stage of a proof of consent after which we would start a pilot.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "CBN regulations holding back mobile money revolution in Nigeria",
          "text": "In Ghana, it would be an \u201canomaly\u201d for a supermarket, small store, or business merchant to not use a mobile money service for transactions. Daniel, a colleague at TechCabal, who visited Ghana two weeks ago said the same during a recent meeting.\n\nMobile money was first introduced in Ghana in 2009. However, it took some time for it to gain traction due to a restrictive Branchless Banking policy of the Bank of Ghana.\n\nNew agent and electronic money guidelines were released in 2014, allowing network operators to run mobile money services, with supervision from the banking regulator.\n\nEver since, players such as MTN have invested heavily in mobile money operations with great success. The telco giant launched its MoMo service in January 2017. By January 2019, over 100,000 merchants were using the service.\n\nUptake in mobile money services and financial inclusion have equally increased across the country. A March 2020 Summary of Economic and Financial Data published by the Bank of Ghana showed that the country had 14.7 million active mobile money accounts and 235,000 active agents.\n\nOn the other end of the cardinal point is M-Pesa\u2019s success in East African countries, particularly Kenya. The mobile money service, owned and operated by telco Safaricom, has significantly contributed to improving the financial inclusion rate in Nairobi.\n\nIn Ethiopia, the government is banking on a mobile money service run by the state-owned network operator, Ethio Telecom, to increase financial inclusion among low-income groups. The service soared to more than 1 million registered users in one week, 4 million in a month, and 6 million in two months.\n\nDespite being home to Africa\u2019s largest unbanked population, Nigeria has not witnessed the same exponential growth in mobile money adoption and lags behind its regional peers when it comes to penetration.\n\nChasing financial inclusion\n\nFinancial inclusion for 200 million Nigerians has been a much-touted priority of Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration and the central bank under governor Godwin Emefiele\u2019s leadership. Still, it\u2019s a goal that has been elusive.\n\nNigeria has a significantly large population without access to financial services. In 2017, it was home to 3.4% of the world\u2019s unbanked people despite contributing 2.6% to the global population.\n\nSome progress has been made over the past decade to bring more Nigerians under the formal financial system, according to a report by EFinA, but the figures remain disturbing.\n\nAt the end of 2020, over 36% of the adult population (or 38 million adults) were unbanked as the central bank missed out on its 80% national financial inclusion target. In addition, just over 40 million out of an estimated 105.5 million Nigerian adults have bank verification numbers (BVN), an important metric for gauging how many people have access to financial services.\n\nThe CBN has adopted several measures \u2013 such as the creation of special Payment Services Banks (PSBs) in 2018 \u2013 to drive financial inclusion.\n\nHowever, the apex bank has shown reluctance towards adopting a framework that has proved to be very effective in improving financial inclusion in many African countries: telecoms-driven mobile money services.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nPayment service banks, not mobile money operators\n\nIn 2018, CBN announced a new regime that would allow non-financial companies to apply for mobile banking licences \u2013 either as PSBs or Mobile Money Operators (MMOs).\n\nUnder the guidelines, mobile network operators are allowed to provide financial services to millions of unbanked Nigerians. However, they can do so only as payment service banks and through a subsidiary separate from their core operations.\n\nPayment service banks are like small-scale banks. While they\u2019re similar to typical banks, the scope of their license is strictly to deepen financial inclusion and the regulator forbids them from engaging in credit risk and foreign exchange operations.\n\nMore than two years after the CBN\u2019s announcement, just three companies (including mobile operators 9mobile and Globacom) have been granted PSB licences. The two other network companies in the country, MTN and Airtel, are yet to get a regulatory nod to launch their Payment Service Banks. Although the former launched an agent network for money transfers in 2019.\n\nThe lack of progress on licences \u2013 particularly for two telcos that have significant mobile money experience in other markets in sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 calls into question how dedicated the central bank is to really broaden access to financial services in the country.\n\nSome industry stakeholders blame the issue on lobbying by traditional financial institutions said to be wary of telco-led mobile money services. Banks perceive that network operators would claim their territory if allowed to offer standalone financial services.\n\nAccording to one telecom industry expert who asked not to be named, the \u201cbig banks are fighting back behind the scenes to ensure telcos don\u2019t come to have their lunch.\u201d\n\nWill telcos ever lead?\n\nIn Nigeria, the mobile money landscape is dominated by banks, technology, and financial services companies. Contrary to what is seen in Kenya and Ghana, telecoms operators are not allowed to apply directly for mobile money licences and are instead restricted to the provision of network infrastructure for the use of mobile money operators.\n\nThe regulatory framework is one of the core reasons why mobile money uptake has been relatively slow in Nigeria. As of 2019, there were just over 15 million mobile money accounts in the country, compared to nearly 60 million in Kenya, which is home to fewer than 55 million people.\n\nFintech companies have recorded significant strides towards advancing financial inclusion in Nigeria. Companies such as Paga and Teamapt democratise access to financial services through their agent networks and mobile payments infrastructure.\n\nBut telecoms companies are more positioned to deepen mobile money services due to their subscriber numbers, available infrastructure, and broader agent networks, which outnumber those of banks and fintechs. MTN and Airtel agents can be seen selling recharge cards in nearly every corner of the country.\n\n\u201cThe telecoms industry has ready infrastructure and resources to push financial inclusion all over the country. If you truly want to deepen the use of mobile technology for financial service, the last mile to reach the people is through network operators,\u201d the expert said.\n\nThere have been calls for a more liberalised regulatory framework where telcos lead. However, if the CBN\u2019s latest mobile money regulatory framework published July 9 is anything to go by, network operators will continue to play the second fiddle in Nigeria\u2019s mobile money space under the current administration.\n\nIn the new framework, the banking regulator reiterates its long-held stance that Nigeria will not adopt the model in which telecommunications companies are the drivers of mobile money services.\n\n\u201cThe CBN recognises the importance of Mobile Network Operators in the operations of mobile money services and appreciates the criticality of the infrastructure they provide. However, the telco-led model (where the lead initiator is an MNO) shall not be operational in Nigeria,\u201d the 40-page document reads.\n\nThe framework stated only two acceptable models for the implementation of mobile money services: bank-led (bank and/or its consortium as lead initiator) and non-bank-led (a corporate organisation duly licensed by the CBN as lead initiator).\n\nAlthough the CBN says it recognises the importance of telecoms companies in providing the infrastructure to drive the exchange of messages for mobile payments, it feels compelled to prohibit the Telco-led option. This, according to the bank, is to \u201cretain full control of monetary policy operations, minimise risks and ensure that the offering of financial services is driven by organisations that have been licensed to do so.\u201d\n\nAfter failing to meet its 2020 target, the CBN has revised its financial inclusion goal to 95% by 2024. But with its continued regulatory conservatism towards telecoms-led mobile money, the regulator is likely to find it only more difficult to bring millions of unbanked Nigerians into the financial system.\n\n\u201cCBN\u2019s models will only slow down financial inclusion penetration,\u201d the expert said. \u201cInstead, telecoms companies should be allowed to take the lead in the mobile money space as seen in other African countries. This is the only way speedy coverage and easy access can be achieved and financial inclusion improved.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "This app wants to simplify Twitter giveaways, without bank accounts",
          "text": "Let\u2019s say I wanted to send a surprise \u2018happy birthday\u2019 cash gift to a friend; my first thought would be to ask for their bank account number. I would do this for people I know very well but also for someone I only know on social media.\n\nBut what if my virtual friend, feeling we are not buddies as such or having been scarred by online money doubling scams, hesitates to share such personal information? Can I thrill them on their special day by using public information I have about them?\n\nSometime in June, I tried Vendly, a web app that is trialling a solution for this need (or desire, if you\u2019re not yet persuaded). \u2018Payments made Social\u2019 the landing page declares on a light green background. Bob Nzelu, the brain behind it, described it to me as a way to share and receive items of digital value \u2013 money, crypto, airtime, e-tickets \u2013 over social media.\n\n\u201cLike sending money through email addresses using PayPal, Vendly hopes to replicate that using social media handles,\u201d he said.\n\nBut that is just the basic use case he anticipates, cutting in to assuage my skepticism that money transfer on social media is a compelling enough value to build a (potentially venture-backed) company on. Long-term, Vendly will help social media users monetize their social media presence, the CEO said.\n\nBack to social money vending. Nzelu believes Vendly is similar to Cash App and Venmo because it seeks to simplify transfers between people who don\u2019t know each other. \u201cVendly is not built for chummy friends who have each other\u2019s account details.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFor this type of relationship, creating a \u2018vend\u2019 with a social media handle and sharing the link with a beneficiary walks a fine line of not being too personal or invasive while caring.\n\nIt\u2019s the online equivalent of a co-worker dropping a birthday cake with a card at your desk but not inside your drawer.\n\nSomeone who receives a vend can decide to either make a claim for or ignore it by clicking the link in their DM. The message states the amount sent; recipient inputs the bank account where they want the cash to go. And like cakes, the link expires after some time (Nzelu sent me a vend of about $1 as a demo).\n\nVendly stores the recipient\u2019s bank details to make future transfers seamless but the sender never sees the account information. Because a sender can create one vend to go to multiple social media handles, Nzelu thinks it should appeal to brands or influencers who target giveaways at 3 million Nigerian social media users who have a bank account and phone number.\n\nVendly is part of a crop of social gifting apps seeking to delight people online.\n\nA few months ago, after my managing editor promised to get me a book, I got a Tweet from Showlove, a Lagos-based company, with a voucher to claim my books at a particular bookstore (thanks again, KK). Getcards, a product of the cryptocurrency startup Buycoins, was floated last December for people who want to gift services like a Netflix subscription, an Amazon or Delta airlines ticket to friends and family.\n\nLike these two services, Vendly hopes that its first platform for traction will be Twitter, because the platform is the most friendly for services that require people to click links to claim rewards.\n\nBut Nzelu knows that can\u2019t be the long-term plan. After all, Twitter is officially banned in Nigeria at the moment, an event that currently hampers Vendly\u2019s ability to be fully functional. An alternative is to send vends using phone numbers, although that option might raise privacy concerns. Integrating other platforms \u2013 Instagram, Facebook \u2013 is on their roadmap.\n\nRight now, Vendly is a prototype undergoing iteration. It may yet face hard questions about monetization, like Abeg\u2019s mobile app which launched last year to enable peer-to-peer money transfers using social handles. But Nzelu says Vendly will answer most user concerns at launch in a few weeks.\n\nHe\u2019s been working at it for two years now and feels the time is right to tap into the social and creator economy bump that started last year. Being Nigerian, his home country is the market of choice. But if it proves tough for a start, Vendly will seek initial users in Ghana, Kenya and Uganda.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "The Pasteur Institute in Senegal will produce rapid antigen tests for diagnosing the coronavirus disease from early 2022 with the help of a new tech transfer agreement.\n\nThe Dakar-based centre is partnering with Bionote, a South Korean company that provides diagnostic solutions for Covid-19, and Mologic, a British biotech company set to be acquired by a Bill Gates-backed consortium.\n\nAn antigen test is regarded as a suitable \u2018first line of defense\u2019 against the coronavirus disease for individuals who have symptoms. It is a simpler and quicker procedure compared to other approaches like PCR testing.\n\nA typical antigen testing takes around 15 minutes to determine whether a patient is infected, although it is less accurate than PCR, according to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nThe agreement between Pasteur and the companies was disclosed in a statement from two international health agencies, UNITAID and FIND, a global alliance for diagnostics, as reported by Reuters.\n\n\u201cHigh-quality antigen tests are the primary diagnostic tool for detecting active infection in poorer settings where molecular testing is not available,\u201d the statement read.\n\nUnder the deal, the technology and expertise for making the Covid tests will be passed from the foreign pharmaceutical giants to Pasteur\u2019s DiaTROPIX, a diagnostic test production unit launched in November. The goal is to boost Covid detection in Africa.\n\n\u201cExpanded production capacity in local and regional hubs is critical to ensuring that healthcare providers in low- and middle-income countries can implement effective testing strategies to contain the spread of the virus,\u201d UNITAID spokesman Herve Verhoosel, said.\n\nDiaTROPIX will seek regulatory approval in Senegal for the tests transferred from Mologic and Bionote and commercialise them under its own brand. It plans to make 2.5 million tests per month in 2022, according to the statement.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nUnprecedented surge in infections\n\nCompared to its regional peers like South Africa and Nigeria, Senegal has seen fewer coronavirus-related cases and deaths.\n\nDakar has so far recorded more than 52,000 infections and 1,220 deaths since the outbreak started. The numbers pale in comparison to South Africa\u2019s (2.24 million infections and 65,000+ deaths) and Nigeria\u2019s (169,000+ infections and 2,000+ deaths).\n\nHowever, the rapid antigen test deal involving the Pasteur Institute comes at a time when Senegal is grappling with soaring coronavirus cases.\n\nAccording to health ministry spokesman Mamadou Ndiaye, the West African nation was seeing an \u201cunprecedented\u201d surge in Covid infections. He said this after a new daily record of 733 cases was recorded, beating the previous record of 529 cases.\n\nMore than 25% of the 2,854 tests carried out in the past 24 hours to Wednesday came back positive, according to Ndiaye.\n\nVaccinations have been slow, making Senegal vulnerable to fresh surges. Out of over 16 million people, only 590,969 have been vaccinated. Senegal lacks enough doses to vaccinate everyone, like most African countries.\n\nSenegalese authorities are expecting 165,000 doses of the Johnson & Johnson Covid vaccine and 300,000 doses of China\u2019s Sinopharm shots, Ndiaye said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has disclosed that it\u2019ll launch the pilot scheme of its digital currency on October 1, 2021.\n\nAccording to TheCable, CBN revealed this during a private webinar with stakeholders on Thursday, July 22, 2021.\n\nThe apex bank announced earlier on June 10, 2021, that it would launch a pilot scheme for its digital currency before the end of the year.\n\nRakiya Mohammed, CBN Director of Information Technology, said, \u201cBefore the end of the year, the Central Bank will be making a special announcement and possibly launching a pilot scheme in order to be able to provide this kind of currency to the populace,\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Director also revealed that the project tagged GIANT will run on the Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain.\n\nHyperledger Fabric blockchain\n\nThe Hyperledger Fabric blockchain is a private and permissioned blockchain network designed by computer hardware company, International Business Machines Corporation (IBM). The network is an open-source platform by the Linus foundation, which means several developers contributed to its code.\n\nThe blockchain network is built specifically for enterprise-grade applications. It is recommended for businesses or private entities hoping to keep transactions exclusive.\n\nSince it\u2019s a private network, the CBN decides who can enter the platform. The regulator can approve or override a transaction if it deems fit, unlike bitcoin, where transactions are approved upon the agreement of majority nodes.\n\nThe Hyperledger Fabric has been criticised as not even being a blockchain network with less expensive solutions offering the same level of security.\n\nIn a Cointelegraph article on July 2, 2019, Stuart Popejoy, blockchain expert and founder of hybrid blockchain platform, Kedena, said that \u201cFabric\u2019s architecture is far more complex than any blockchain platform while also being less secure against tampering and attacks. You would think that a \u201cprivate\u201d blockchain would at least offer scalability and performance, but Fabric fails here as well. Simply put, pilots built on Fabric will face a complex and insecure deployment that won\u2019t be able to scale with their businesses.\u201d\n\nIn comparison, he says, blockchain is a decentralised and immutable platform where truth is enforced with a consensus mechanism. On a network like Bitcoin or Ethereum, a consensus is achieved through mining or Proof of Work (PoW).\n\nHowever, IBM says the network is permissioned, meaning only authorised and known participants can access it. In addition, it has a hardware security module support, vital for safeguarding and managing sensitive data.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, CBN says Nigeria cannot be left behind when 80% of central banks globally are considering issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC).\n\nPer Coin Insider, China pioneered the CBDC movement while other countries like Sweden, Japan, and The Bahamas are testing their digital currencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun Website Writer and tech enthusiast\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Micro-blogging platform, Twitter is testing a way to upvote or downvote replies as part of efforts to understand what users find relevant in a conversation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow does this work? Twitter says while the downvote button will be visible, only the reply owner can know the exact number received.\n\nFor now, it is a test for a research the company is conducting to see if the up and down voting match what it suggests as relevant replies. It is currently available to a few iOS users.\n\nHave we seen something similar? Platforms like Reddit and YouTube have a downvote and dislike button, respectively.\n\nHowever, according to Twitter, this is not a dislike button and while it bears some resemblance to Reddit\u2019s downvote button, it will not affect the order of replies. This means they will not be ranked according to the highest numbe of downvotes.\n\nWait a minute, how will this improve interaction on Twitter? Will it reduce toxic tweets? Won\u2019t this encourage trolls especially since only the recipient can see it?\n\nWell, I found Ashton Kutcher, actor and tech investor\u2019s comments on a \u201cdislike button\u201d quite interesting.\n\nPer CNET, Kutcher believes a dislike button will head off more volatile expressions of disagreement on social media platforms, giving people a simple, frictionless way to give negative feedback.\n\nI\u2019m somewhat inclined to agree but I still have some reservations. I also wonder if there might be an option to turn this feature off if you don\u2019t want it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, in May 2021, Jane Wachung Wong, an app researcher, revealed that Twitter was working on adding Facebook-like reactions \u2014 \ud83d\ude02, \ud83e\udd14, \ud83d\ude13 \u2014 to the platform.\n\nWhat is Twitter going to spring on us next? Any ideas? Let me know what you think in the comments section below.\n\nCellulant\u2019s licence approval in Tanzania\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTanzanian shilling notes\n\nWhat happened? Kenyan African payments company, Cellulant, has received approval-in-principle from the Bank of Tanzania (BOT) to operate as a Payment Solution Service Provider (PSSP) in the country, having met all the necessary requirements.\n\nWhat does this mean? It means Cellulant is now one of the PSSPs supported by the Bank of Tanzania to offer digital payments solutions across the country.\n\nDo you know? Cellulant was founded in 2002 as a music streaming platform that enabled musicians to get a percentage of the money paid by fans to download their songs.\n\nThen over the years, the music streaming platform rebranded as a fintech company, offering digital payments and managing an ecosystem of retailers, merchants, banks, mobile network operators, governments, and international development partners.\n\nWith a physical presence in 18 African countries, the company boasts of offering more than 154 payment choices in 34 countries, and connecting 220 million users to a single inclusive network, enabling interoperability that has evaded multiple companies in the payments market.\n\nIn July 2021, Cellulant launched Trigg, a digital payments network, in Zambia, that enables companies around the country to seamlessly take payments from their customers.\n\nTrigg is said to help businesses wishing to digitise their payments to collect and make payments across many payment methods and currencies with the greatest customer experience.\n\nEdwin Kiiru, Tanzania\u2019s Cellulant Country Manager, says the approval by the BOT will enable the company to extend its payment solutions across all spectrums of Tanzania\u2019s payments ecosystem.\n\nCellulant\u2019s new approval will allow it connect to banks, online merchants, payment processors, merchants, state governments, and customers to meet their digital payment demands in Tanzania.\n\nConvergence Partners raises $120 million\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth African tech investment firm, Convergence Partners, has raised $120 million to drive inclusion in Africa.\n\nWho participated in the round? CDC Group the UK\u2019s development finance institution, the United States International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), the European Investment Bank (EIB), the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Proparco \u2014 private sector arm of the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD Group) \u2014 participated in the round.\n\nWhat about Convergence Partners? Founded by Andile Ngcaba, CEO, in 2006, the investment firm is focused on the Technology, Media and Telecom (TMT) sector in Africa.\n\nAccording to the official website, the firm has invested in submarine cable systems, geostationary satellites, terrestrial long-haul, metro and access fibre, wireless networks, data centres, and service provision like enterprise connectivity, fintech and healthtech solutions, and data switching since its launch.\n\nIn February 2021, it acquired Ctrack, a telematics Software-as-a-Service (Saas) digital infrastructure platform that offers fleet management, insurance and weather telematic solutions and asset tracking solutions to its subscribers in Africa and the Middle East.\n\nThe new funding will be utilised to further digital infrastructure\u2019s emerging growth areas, particularly fibre, wireless, data centres, 5G, Cloud, Internet of Things (IoT), network virtualisation, and artificial intelligence.\n\nAlso, the funding when invested is aimed at boosting entrepreneurship, innovation, skills development, and creating jobs while increasing access to the Internet and all the critical digital tools it provides.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nTwitter may be adding voice effects to Spaces.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood day,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nGoogle x Maliyo Games partnership\n\nNew features on Instagram and YouTube\n\nClubhouse killing invite-only feature\n\nGoogle x Maliyo partners to train 500 game developers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle has partnered with Nigeria-based gaming studio, Maliyo to organise the GameUpAfrica Bootcamp to give Africans an opportunity to be a part of the booming gaming industry.\n\nThe programme would involve training mobile game developers. Open to Kenyans, Nigerians, and Ghanaians, applications began on July 19 and will close on August 2, 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGaming has evolved from a simple way to pass the time to one of the most profitable industries in the world.\n\nFor context: In September 2013, on launch day, Grand Theft Auto V made $800 million. According to Fast Company, this is more sales in 24 hours than any movie or musical album in history.\n\nMobile gaming: Per Business Wire, the mobile gaming market was worth $98 billion globally in 2020 and is expected to grow to $272 billion by 2030.\n\nInterestingly, people play more games on mobile than personal computers (PC) and consoles. According to Kevuru games, 59.9% of games were played on mobile in 2020, while 28.70% and 16.11% were played on PC and console, respectively.\n\nWhile nothing beats gaming on a 60\u201d, 4K display TV\u2014 at least for me \u2014 smartphones are mobile, hence their lead.\n\nTo know more about the GameUpAfrica Bootcamp, check out this article\n\nNew features on Instagram and YouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram is giving users more control over the kind of content they consume on the app.\n\nOn July 20, 2021, the company announced in a blog post that it was launching Sensitive Content Control. The feature will help users control the content they want to see on the content discovery page, Explore.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat does this mean? Essentially, Instagram is giving you the option to decide which kind of content you want to see while you scroll through the \u2018Explore\u2019 page. Not a puppy person? No more doggy pictures jumping out of your timeline.\n\nAccording to Instagram, sensitive content isn\u2019t content that breaks the rules but could upset some users.\n\nMore control: Back in May 2021, Facebook and Instagram allowed users to remove the Like count on their posts to give them more power over their experience on the apps.\n\nWhile Instagram is giving more power, YouTube wants to help creators make more money.\n\nOn July 20, 2021, YouTube announced it is rolling out a beta version of its new feature, Super Thanks.\n\nWhat\u2019s that? Well, YouTube says in its blog post that it\u2019s a way for fans to show appreciation to their favourite creators on the platform.\n\nHow does it work? While you\u2019re watching a video \u2014 live or not \u2014 you can purchase a Super Thanks that ranges between $2 to $50 to show your appreciation.\n\nYou can make payments through Google Pay, the same way you pay for apps on the Play Store.\n\nStill in beta: According to YouTube, \u201cSuper Thanks is currently in beta and with today\u2019s expansion, is now available to thousands of monetising creators. The feature is available to creators and viewers in 68 countries on desktop and mobile devices.\u201d\n\nClubhouse no longer requires an invite\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Dmitry Mashkin on Unsplash\n\nOn Wednesday, July 21, 2021, live-audio chat platform Clubhouse announced in a blog post that it is no longer in beta testing and the app is no longer invite-only.\n\nFor the past 16 months, Clubhouse was exclusive to invites only. Before now, you needed someone already invited to the platform with your phone number to send you an invite. Business Insider says some people even started a business out of selling invites\n\nWhile this exclusivity made it even more appealing, it was a way to control the rise in the number of app users.\n\nIn its blog, Clubhouse said the invite system was essential to its history. By adding people in waves, it has been able to \u201cgrow Clubhouse in a measured way, and (mostly \ud83d\ude2c ) keep things from breaking\u201d\n\nBreaking the barriers: The invite system wasn\u2019t the only thing that made Clubhouse exclusive. Until May 2021, it was only available to iPhone users.\n\nAs competition mounts from Twitter and Facebook, the app seems to be shedding its exclusivity to accommodate more users.\n\nWhat I\u2019m watching\n\nDON\u2019T buy a new PC for Windows 11!

          "title": "COVID-19: Breach of measures fuels third wave amid poor communication",
          "text": "The breach of essential preventive measures for COVID-19 has contributed to the rise of a third wave in Nigeria, according to the centre for disease control, but this has been poorly communicated.\n\nSeven months ago, in the wake of a second wave that saw COVID-19 cases shooting up from 122 to an all-time-high of 2,314 in January, communication from the government on the state of things was at a relative high level.\n\nThe Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) on COVID-19, in the company of key agencies such as the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPCDA) held frequent briefings, highlighting the danger lurking.\n\nRead Also: With 1,301 new infections, Nigeria\u2019s COVID-19 cases rise to 111,305\n\nBut as a third wave looms with more than 100 percent rise in daily caseloads, the convergence of communication from these government bodies has nosedived.\n\nThe presidential committee has stopped meeting for daily briefings and all communications have been split through individual channels of ministries and agencies.\n\nThis is unfortunately a post-Twitter-ban era, when agencies such as the NCDC, NPHCDA or state ministries of health no longer enjoy the widespread visibility that comes with tweeting updates on new case confirmations, deaths or recoveries for all to see.\n\nOsagie Ehanire, the minister of health, admitted to the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance on Thursday that the setting up of the PSC with relevant ministries and agencies as a response mechanism had given strong support to the fight against the pandemic.\n\nCommunication for the NCDC, for instance, has reduced to posting updates on its official website, cutting the length of reach to many Nigerians who had become conscious of the data around the pandemic.\n\nThe centre has a lot to say and reiterate to the population as cases keep rising but it seems withdrawn to winking in the dark.\n\nThe last four days have seen cases sustained at over 200, a situation Chike Ihekweazu, director-general, NCDC, told BusinessDay was being fuelled by continued breach of preventive measures.\n\nThis coupled with the faster spread of Delta, the latest variant of concern that is rocking most countries.\n\n\u201cThere are varying factors associated with an increase in COVID-19 cases. Many countries across the world are experiencing periods of surges in COVID-19 infections. In most countries, this has been associated with the Delta variant of the virus, which has increased transmissibility,\u201d Ihekweazu explained in a mailed response to BusinessDay.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, as the virus spreads when people are in contact with others, the resumption of social gatherings with poor adherence to public health and social measures are contributing to an increase in cases,\u201d he said.\n\nThe pandemic is far from over, according to the director-general, and the recent rise in cases in Nigeria highlights the urgent need for people to take personal and collective responsibility.\n\nIf preventive measures such as avoiding large gatherings, wearing a face mask properly in public, regular hand washing with clean water and soap or using alcohol-based hand sanitiser are abandoned for carefreeness, some could suffer the risk posed by the virus.\n\nThe Delta variant is tearing through unvaccinated populations, presenting a huge risk to health workers, older populations and those with underlying conditions.\n\n\u201cIt is also very important to get vaccinated as this provides protection against the disease,\u201d he said, noting, \u201cIt is critical that we do all these now as we still have a window of opportunity to prevent a surge in COVID-19 cases in Nigeria and its devastating impact on lives and livelihood.\u201d\n\nThese vital pieces of information could have been shared on Twitter. But the government has maintained a draconian suspension on the social media application, accusing its management of undermining its sovereignty.\n\nAbubakar Malami, attorney-general of the Federation on Friday, told Nigerians to use alternative media such as WhatsApp, Facebook and Tiktok, among others, whereas most of these important agencies and ministries do not hold official accounts on these apps.\n\nUntil the government rescinds its action, it could be a long walk with a dark view for pandemic communication in the country.",

          "text": "Writing a compelling Curriculum Vitae (CV) is very important especially at a time when the job opportunities in Nigeria are reducing by the day.\n\nTo most recruiters or Human Resource (HR) professionals, a CV is the first advertisement of yourself to show the kind of person you are. This is why having a good, detailed and well written CV can help attract the right jobs.\n\nFive HR professionals polled in a Business Day survey gave tips on how to write a compelling CV that attracts employers.\n\nHere are some of the tips:\n\nJENNIFER OYELADE, director of Transquisite Consulting, an international human resource consultancy and expatriate management services\n\nWhen reviewing a CV to get the right candidates for interviews, I look at result-driven ones that stipulate the achievements of the applicants. Another aspect I pay attention to is the use of English and punctuation marks. That may sound basic, but I have to trash several CVs for this reason. I am a fan of long CVs, because I believe it conceptualises your personal experience.\n\nRead Also: Board readiness- Useful tips\n\nFor example, if I am hiring a Chief Financial Officer (CFO) to manage a million dollar organisation, you will not hire a CFO with a two-page CV. So basically I like a CV that tells a story and is thought-provoking. Like why they took that exam, course, what professional development courses they did after their degrees and the reason. This gives the employer an insight into their thought process.\n\nWinnifred Omobolanle, Operations Lead at Utiva, an Edutech company\n\nThe first thing I look at when seeing CVs is neatness and presentation. If it doesn\u2019t tick these boxes, it just speaks to the individual\u2019s lack of excellent communication skills and disorderliness because in almost every job you see out there, communication skills are very important both written and oral.\n\nIt is also very important that people include and briefly explain their responsibilities on their current jobs. It is never enough to simply state the jobs, locations, duration or name of a company. It is helpful to list out the responsibilities you had on that job because employers want to see if a person can match the responsibilities that they want to recruit the person for.\n\nAdditionally, CVs should have the person\u2019s right and complete information. There are a lot of people that have holes in their CVs. For example, I wanted to recruit someone that had the right skills that I was looking for but the person only stated his email address but no phone number. Very sloppy.\n\nUnini Mosimabale, HR at Alles Charis Gas Limited\n\nA CV should have a professional summary of a few lines and should be written in the third person. It should contain the individual\u2019s personal values, career goals and what they the value they bring to any organisation.\n\nExperience and academic qualifications should be arranged from the most recent, down to the oldest one. Also, we look out for experiences that matter to the organisation, so edit your CV in such a way that it fits the requirements that the recruiter is looking for.\n\nAnother one is to write in the present continuous tense not past tense especially if you are currently engaged by one organisation but still looking for other opportunities. In addition, you don\u2019t need to put references in your CVs unless the recruiter asks for it.\n\nThen put hobbies that are behavioural controlled e.g. reading, mentoring, travelling, playing chess etc. those kinds of hobbies are seen as productive.\n\nAdebambo Aina, HR Advisor at Afrinvest (West Africa) Limited\n\nAlways make sure that your fonts are legible and clear, it saves the recruiter a lot of time and increases the chances that your CV is actually read. Your font colour also matters. It is advisable to use the black colour and not flashy ones.\n\nThen grammar and punctuation are also key for me. When you are supposed to use capital or small letters, please use it. If I were to follow this standard, almost 85 percent of candidates would fail. How can I trust you to write a business memo, letter or document?\n\nFunbi Matthew, a business management and human resource professional\n\nSome of the things that make a CV standout are relevant experience, qualification and possibly grade where required, well formatted and good abstract, accomplishments, training and possibly relevant certifications.",

          "text": "The federal government has said the decision to ban microblogging platform Twitter was because it was being used by Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), and to promote EndSARS protests on October 1.\n\nAbubakar Malami, Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) said this in response to a motion filed by Inihebe Effiong, a human rights lawyer. In the counter-affidavit filed by the AGF, the government said it at no time restrained Nigerians from using Twitter.\n\nThe motion filed at the Federal High Court had contended that the Twitter ban was a fundamental human rights bridge breach. Effiong asked the court to grant nine reliefs including an order of perpetual injunction restraining the respondents from further suspending, deactivating, or banning the operation and accessibility of Twitter or any other social media service in Nigeria because the act was in violation of his rights.\n\nRead also: How Nigeria\u2019s Twitter ban will stifle digital ecosystem\n\nThe lawyer is also asking the court to declare as illegal the threat of criminal prosecution by Malami and Lai Mohammed against Nigerians who \u2018violate\u2019 the suspension or ban of Twitter, despite the absence of any written law.\n\nBut the AGF countered, saying Nigerians were still using Twitter despite the suspension.\n\nIt would be recalled that the government slammed Twitter with a ban after deleting a tweet by President Muhammadu Buhari it deemed inciting. But following the public backlash, the government said its decision was not because the platform deleted the President\u2019s tweet. However, it needed to act because Twitter was being used by some people to destabilise the unity of the country.\n\nBut the explanation only came after the Federal Government through the office of Malami had threatened to prosecute every Nigerian using VPN to circumvent the ban on Twitter.\n\nThe threat to prosecute was challenged at the Economic Community of West African States court. In its judgment, the court ruled that President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s government can\u2019t impose sanctions or do \u201canything whatsoever to harass, intimidate, arrest or prosecute\u201d Twitter users, according to the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project. The non-governmental organization has filed a suit against the suspension of Twitter and the criminalization of its users in Nigeria, and a hearing is scheduled for July 6.\n\nThe government told the court that the Twitter suspension would be lifted once the platform registers with the NBC and the Corporate Affairs Commission.",

          "text": "The Cour De\u2019appal De Cotonou, Benin Republic, has adjourned the hearing of the case of Yoruba Nation activist, Sunday Adeyemo, alias Sunday Igboho till Monday, July 26.\n\nThe umbrella body of the Yoruba self-determination group, Ilana Omo Oodua confirmed this in a statement on Friday.\n\nThe statement signed by the group\u2019s Communications Manager, Maxwell Adeleye, was titled, \u2018Update On Chief Sunday Adeyemo Ighoho\u2019s Case In Republic Of Benin By Ilana Omo Oodua\u2019\n\nIn its statement, Ilana Oodua said, \u201cYesterday (Thursday), the court set Mrs. Adeyemo, lgboho\u2019s wife free since it has been found that she has committed no offence and there\u2019s no complaints whatsoever against her. Consequently, her German passport was returned to her.\n\n\u201cThe lawyers handling the case reported after the proceedings that Chief Sunday Adeyemo lgboho cannot be extradited to Nigeria for two principal reasons:\n\n\u201cThat contrary to insinuations, Nigeria and Benin have no Extradition Agreement.\n\n\u201cThat Nigeria has not been able to come up with charges that could lead the court to order lgboho\u2019s extradition to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWhat Nigerian Government came up with were mere allegations against Ighoho such as trafficking in arms and inciting violence that could result in the social disturbance without evidence which the Government of Benin Republic considered spurious and untenable, and insufficient to warrant extradition.\n\n\u201cLastly, the case has been adjourned till Monday, 26th July to allow the Nigerian Government bring up whatever evidence they may have, and Mr. lgboho has been taken back to the police custody.\u201d\n\nThe Beninese court had on Thursday ruled that Igboho\u2019s wife, Ropo, should be released unconditionally as there were no charges against her.\n\nThe court, however, ruled that Igboho be remanded in police custody till the next date of adjournment.\n\nThe two were arrested at the Cadj\u00e8houn Airport in Cotonou on Monday while they tried to catch a flight to Germany.\n\nThis comes as the Department of State Services declared Igboho wanted for allegedly stockpiling arms, an allegation he has denied.\n\nOn July 1, the secret police raided his house, killed two of his associates and arrested over 10 others.",

          "text": "For about 20 years running, dreams of a budding Nigerian actor, Chukwuma Kabarachi, have been put on hold after he suffered a spinal cord injury in an accident on August 28, 2001 in Lagos.\n\nAt 42 then, Kabarachi, who adopted Chukwuma Ugwumba, as his cast name in the movies, was a bubbly man of many ambitions. Aside from being an actor, he had his eyes fixed on a thriving music career.\n\nOur correspondent learnt that he was billed for a studio session to record his songs to jumpstart his music career on the week the accident occurred.\n\nSince then, the father of one has been exposed to a flipside of life steeped in pain, loneliness and despair. He was billed between N3.5m and N3.8m at a hospital in Lagos some years back but he couldn\u2019t afford it.\n\nWhile narrating his plight to City Round, Kabarachi said the bill might have increased due to the country\u2019s economic situation.\n\nHe stated, \u201cI had an accident in Lagos which resulted in spinal cord injury. I was rushed to a private hospital for medical attention. Unfortunately, the hospital had neither the required medical personnel nor the equipment to take care of my medical needs. After five months, I was moved away from the hospital as my health condition got worse with nine bedsores two of which required plastic surgery. It\u2019s almost 20 years since I had the accident and I am still on a sickbed with bedsores around my waist and a fracture a little above my left ankle. It is still on these bedsores I lie down after they are dressed every day. The pain I go through is indescribable, and the mental torture is better imagined than experienced. I now depend on pain relieving drugs every day to reduce the pain.\n\n\u201cFor many years I have been confined to a room in my father\u2019s compound and this is where I was when I lost him and my step-mother who were supposed to enjoy their old age under my watch and care, having earlier lost my dear mother and my sister. Now I have found myself at a lonely and secluded part of life where loneliness, feeling of abandonment and betrayal have become my day-to-day companion. \u201d\n\nEvery day, Kabarachi, a native of Obinato in the Ideato South Local Government Area of Imo, reflects on his short-lived blissful marriage and how the incident had deprived him of the ability to sustain the happy union.\n\n\u201cThere were times I wished I had died. When I look at the face of my younger brother who has borne the brunt of taking care of me all these years, and I remember the young lady that left her people in Ondo State for a marriage of two years and eight months and our son of about two years and six months, I weep like a baby for becoming an unexpected burden to them,\u201d he stated, grimly.\n\nFor his surgery and treatment, he said his doctor referred him to a medical facility that can provide services of specialist neurologist, dermatologist, orthopedician and anaesthetics.\n\nHe added, \u201cHis estimate was between N3.5m and N3.8m. This was made a long time ago and may have changed as a result of many factors, including other health complications. I am now seeking financial assistance to enable me to undergo a thorough medical treatment in a specialised tertiary medical institution, so that if I cannot stand again, I can, at least, sit comfortably in a wheelchair.\u201d\n\nA letter signed by the Managing Director of Trinity Medical Centre, Dr A.N Oyekwena, stated that Kabarachi currently receives \u201cancillary services\u201d at the hospital, \u201chaving been totally incapacitated following an accident that affected his spinal cord.\u201d\n\nDonations for Kabarchi\u2019s treatment can be made to his younger brother\u2019s First Bank account with the name, Ikechukwu Emeghiebo, and account number: 3035627668.

I could come every two weeks and no one can stop me. But the cost to the movement is high. I would rather that it be used to better our schools, clinics and hospitals.\u201d\n\nThe President also spoke on the unity of Nigeria.\n\nHe said only the grace of God had kept Nigeria together as a country in spite of differences that led to a 30 months civil war\n\n\u201cWe want to thank God always for keeping us together as a country. From January 15, 1966, the country was thrown into political crisis. We had a 30 months civil war that resulted in the loss of about a million lives.\n\n\u201cWe still thank God for keeping us together. We remain grateful to all those who showed interest in our unity and progress. May God continue to bless them,\u201d he added.\n\nThe President, who recalled fond memories of visiting the Palace as a military Head of State, expressed happiness that the warmth and hospitality of the traditional institution had been sustained over the years.\n\nIn his remarks, the Emir of Daura thanked the President for always creating time to visit his hometown and the palace despite the tight schedule.\n\n\u201cYour visit to Daura reflects your good character which we are very proud of. I can assure you that men, women, children, marketers and artisans are always pleased to receive you and they will be praying for you.\n\n\u201cToday is not for speeches but for appreciation. We have been blessed so much as a community because you are the leader of the country. You have brought honour to our domain.\n\n\u201dAs a community, we have benefited a lot with increased traffic of people and organisations coming to help us here. We know it\u2019s because of you.\n\n\u201cMay the good Lord always go before you and behind you, and remove all obstacles from your path,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Emir said the President must remain focused in getting results particularly in securing the country.\n\n\u201cNigeria is lucky to have you at this time. I am not saying it to please you, but if you had not been in power it would have been very difficult. I doubt if we will be here today,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "Senator representing Bayelsa West District in the National Assembly, Seriake Dickson, has described the recently passed Petroleum Industry Bill, PIB , and the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill, 2021 by the parliament as offensive and insensitive to concerned Nigerians.\n\nDickson, who addressed journalists yesterday in Abuja over the perceived shortcomings in the two bills, however, warned that the approved three percent Host Communities Trust Fund in the PIB may lead to unrest in the Niger Delta region.\n\nThis is as he justified the backlash being faced by the Senate from Nigerians over amendment made to clause 52(3) of the Electoral Act, which according to him, unconstitutionally subordinated independence of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC to Nigerian Communication Commission, NCC\n\nThe former Bayelsa State governor specifically declared that the PIB passed with 3% for Host Communities Fund, will not in anyway, help Nigeria and investors in the oil and gas sectors .\n\nAccording to him, the 5% earlier recommended by both Committees of the National Assembly which is even lower to the 10% being demanded for by stakeholders across the various oil producing communities, supposed to have been retained in the interest of fairness, justice and equity.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhen PIB was first introduced and forwarded to the National Assembly by the late President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua, 10% was proposed for Host Communities fund and Frontier Basins for exploration of oil as against the Bill recently passed, given 3% for Host Communities and 30% for Frontier Basins.\n\n\u201cThese, as far as the people of Niger Delta or oil producing states are concerned are unjustifiable and look like opening another chapter for unrest in the area which will not benefit anybody.\n\n\u201cImagine the problem the country has been facing with Boko Haram insurgency in the North East for the past ten years , the Armed banditry and Kidnapping also being faced in the North West within the last three to four years as well as agitations being faced in South West and South East, to now be added up with avoidable crisis in the South South.\n\n\u201cThose of us from the area did our best to prevail on our colleagues to listen to us and buy into our demands but number or majority position was used , which in actual fact do not build a nation with diversities like Nigeria.\n\n\u201cMight and majority do not build a diversified nation like Nigeria, but presence of justice, fairness. Mere reliance on numbers without fairness, equity and justice is inimical to nation building,\u201d he added.\n\nHe therefore appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari not to assent to the bill, but send it back for more consultation and required Inclusiveness in its proposals.\n\nHe disclosed that he along with other lawmakers from the zone staged a walk out from the dinner night President Muhamnadu Buhari had with the 109 senators and 360 members of the House of Representatives, held before the final consideration and passage of the bill when they discovered that it was 3% being canvassed for host communities.\n\n\u201cIt was a terrible evening for us on account of the 3% proposal, which as a politician of conviction and not that of convenience, led to my walk out from the dinner along with some other senators.\n\n\u201cWe put up the required moves on the floor of the Senate to push it up to 5% as recommended by the joint committees of both chambers but those who rely solely on numbers, have their way,\u201d he further argued.\n\nOn the controversial amendment made by the Senate on Clause 52(3) of the Electoral Act, Dickson said the backlash being received by Senate over the amendment was not unexpected because the original proposal made in the clause had already taken care of whatever exigencies being envisaged on electronic transmission of election results.\n\n\u201cAs a member of the Senate Commitee on INEC, the phrase of where and when practicable used in clause 52(3) was enough to take care of any exigencies , making the amendment which included NCC in the entire process, unnecessary and unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cFortunately a window of striking out that amendment is already provided by the House of Representatives which adopted the clause as originally proposed.\n\n\u201cSo it is expected that the earlier version of the clause, will be the one to be adopted by the confluence Commitee which will be set up by both chambers for the required harmonization of reports before transmitting the bill to the President for assent,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has urged businessmen, contractors and other privileged Nigerians who are beneficiaries of government patronage to always engage in Corporate Social Responsibility, instead of seeking to favour individuals with gifts.\n\nAccording to a statement by the Senior Special Assistant to the President, Media & Publicity, Garba Shehu, the President said this on Friday in Daura, Katsina State when he visited the Emir of Daura, Dr Umar Faruk Umar, at his Palace.\n\nHe said: \u201cI don\u2019t want your cheque. Go and assist our communities\u201d instead of trying to return kickbacks to public officers, including his office.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want cheques from anyone or organisations as returns or influence of any kind. Let them remember their Corporate Social Responsibilities,\u201d he added.\n\nSpeaking further, President Buhari noted that he would love to visit Daura more frequently, but for the high cost of presidential movements and exposing security personnel to the weather, assuring that his heart remains with the people.\n\n\u201cWe are known for farming and I have my farm here. I could come every two weeks and no one can stop me. But the cost to the movement is high. I would rather that it be used to better our schools, clinics and hospitals\u201d.\n\nThe President said the grace of God had kept Nigeria together as a country in spite of differences that led to a 30-month civil war in the 1960\u2019s.\n\n\u201cWe want to thank God always for keeping us together as a country. From January 15, 1966, the country was thrown into political crisis. We had a 30 months civil war that resulted in the loss of about a million lives.\n\n\u201cWe still thank God for keeping us together. We remain grateful to all those who showed interest in our unity and progress. May God continue to bless them,\u201d he added.\n\nThe President, who recalled fond memories of visiting the Palace as a military Head of State, expressed happiness that the warmth and hospitality of the traditional institution had been sustained over the years.\n\nIn his remarks, the Emir of Daura thanked the President for always creating time to visit his hometown and the palace despite the tight schedule.\n\n\u201cYour visit to Daura reflects your good character which we are very proud of. I can assure you that men, women, children, marketers and artisans are always pleased to receive you and they will be praying for you.\n\n\u201cToday is not for speeches but for appreciation. We have been blessed so much as a community because you are the leader of the country. You have brought honour to our domain.\n\n\u201cAs a community, we have benefited a lot with increased traffic of people and organisations coming to help us here. We know it\u2019s because of you.\n\n\u201cMay the good Lord always go before you and behind you, and remove all obstacles from your path,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Emir said the President must remain focused in getting results particularly in securing the country.\n\n\u201cNigeria is lucky to have you at this time. I am not saying it to please you, but if you had not been in power it would have been very difficult. I doubt if we will be here today,\u201d he added.\n\nAt the meeting, the Emir publicly announced the conferment of the title of Talban Daura on Yusuf Buhari, son of President Buhari.\n\nHe said a date would be announced for the turbanning ceremony of the President\u2019s son, which might likely be before his marriage.\n\nThe Emir also announced the creation of a District in the community of the President, with headquarters in Dumurkol.\n\nHe said the turbanning of the young Buhari and the creation of the District are to further extend and deepen the long relationship between the Palace and the family.\n\nAccording to him, the decision was in agreement with the kingmakers in Daura Emirate Council.",

The captured territory includes parts of the southern province of Kandahar, where the Canadian military spent the longest amount of time during its 13-year mission in the country.\n\nAlso on Friday, the US called on the Taliban to negotiate after the group said that there will not be peace in Afghanistan until there is a new government in Kabul and President Ashraf Ghani is removed.\n\nIn an interview with The Associated Press, Taliban spokesman, Suhail Shaheen, who is also a member of the group\u2019s negotiating team, laid out their stance on what should come next in a country on the precipice.\n\nShaheen said the Taliban will lay down their weapons when a negotiated government acceptable to all sides in the conflict is installed in Kabul and Ghani\u2019s government is gone.\n\nDuring a news briefing held over the phone, State Department spokesperson Jalina Porter said \u201cwe call on the Taliban to engage in serious negotiations to determine a political road map for Afghanistan future that leads to a just and durable settlement.\u201d\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki affirmed Biden\u2019s support for the Afghan president. She said Biden was scheduled to speak with Ghani by phone later in the day.\n\n\u201cThe president and the administration supports the leadership of the Afghan people, including Ashraf Ghani,\u201d Psaki told reporters.\n\n\u201cI would note that there are ongoing political negotiations and discussions that we certainly support between Afghan leaders, members of the Afghan government and the Taliban. And we believe a political solution is the only outcome to lasting peace in Afghanistan,\u201d she said.",

          "text": "In a move that pours cold water on the dreams of a few billionaire space explorers, the US has tightened its definition of the word \u201castronaut\u201d.\n\nNew Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) rules say astronaut hopefuls must be part of the flight crew and make contributions to space flight safety.\n\nThat means Jeff Bezos and Sir Richard Branson may not yet be astronauts in the eyes of the US government.\n\nThese are the first changes since the FAA wings programme began in 2004.\n\nThe Commercial Astronaut Wings programme updates were announced on Tuesday \u2013 the same day that Amazon\u2019s Mr Bezos flew aboard a Blue Origin rocket to the edge of space.\n\nTo qualify as commercial astronauts, space-goers must travel 50 miles (80km) above the Earth\u2019s surface, which both Mr Bezos and Mr Branson accomplished.\n\nBut altitude aside, the agency says would-be astronauts must have also \u201cdemonstrated activities during flight that were essential to public safety, or contributed to human space flight safety\u201d.\n\nWhat exactly counts as such is determined by FAA officials.\n\nIn a statement, the FAA said that these changes brought the wings scheme more in line with its role to protect public safety during commercial space flights.\n\nOn 11 July, Sir Richard flew on-board Virgin Galactic\u2019s SpaceShipTwo to the edge of space as a test before allowing customers aboard next year.\n\nMr Bezos and the three other crew members who flew on Blue Origin\u2019s spacecraft may have less claim to the coveted title. Ahead of the launch, Blue Origin CEO Bob Smith said that \u201cthere\u2019s really nothing for a crew member to do\u201d on the autonomous vehicle.\n\nThose wishing for commercial wings need to be nominated for them as well. An FAA spokesperson told CNN they are not currently reviewing any submissions.\n\nThere are two other ways to earn astronaut wings in the US \u2013 through the military or Nasa.\n\nThe wings spotted on Mr Bezos and Sir Richard following their flights were custom-made pins by their own companies.\n\nHowever, a glimmer of hope remains for Sir Richard, Mr Bezos and any future stargazers hoping to be recognised as astronauts.\n\nThe new order notes that honorary awards can be given based on merit \u2013 at the discretion of the FAA\u2019s associate administrator.\n\nAstronaut wings were first awarded to astronauts Alan Shepard Jr and Virgil Grissom in the early 1960s for their participation in the Mercury Seven programme.",

          "title": "Family of James Brown Settles 15-year Battle Over His Estate",
          "text": "The family of entertainer James Brown has reached a settlement ending a 15-year battle over the late singer\u2019s estate, an attorney involved in the mediation said Friday.\n\nDavid Black, an attorney representing Brown\u2019s estate, confirmed to The Associated Press that the agreement was reached July 9. Details of the settlement were not disclosed.\n\nLegal wrangling over the Godfather of Soul\u2019s estate has been ongoing since his death at the age of 73 on Christmas Day 2006.\n\nThe performer\u2019s death touched off years of bizarre headlines, beginning with Tomi Rae Hynie \u2014 a former partner who claimed to be Brown\u2019s wife \u2014 being locked out of his 60-acre (24-hectare) estate while photographers captured her sobbing and shaking its iron gates, begging to be let in.\n\nBrown was renowned for hundreds of iconic musical works including hits like \u201cI Feel Good\u201d and \u201cA Man\u2019s World,\u201d and was known around the world for his flashy performances and dynamic stage presence. But years of drug problems and financial mismanagement caused his estate to dwindle.\n\nMore than a dozen lawsuits were filed over the years by people trying to lay claim to the singer\u2019s assets, which courts have estimated to be worth anything from $5 million to more than $100 million.\n\nThe fight over Brown\u2019s estate even spilled over into what to do with his body. Family members fought over the remains for more than two months, leaving Brown\u2019s body, still inside a gold casket, sitting in cold storage in a funeral home.\n\nBrown was eventually buried in Beech Island, South Carolina, at the home of one of his daughters. The family wanted to turn the home into a shrine for Brown similar to Elvis Presley\u2019s Graceland, but that idea never got off the ground.\n\nLast year, the South Carolina Supreme Court ruled that Hynie had not been legally married to Brown and therefore did not have a right to his multimillion-dollar estate.\n\nJustices also ordered a circuit court to \u201cpromptly proceed with the probate of Brown\u2019s estate in accordance with his estate plan,\u201d which outlined creation of a trust that would use his music royalties to fund educational expenses for children in South Carolina and Georgia.\n\nA 2009 settlement plan would have given nearly half of Brown\u2019s estate to a charitable trust, a quarter to Hynie, and the rest to be split among his adult children. The state Supreme Court overturned that deal in 2013, writing that then-Attorney General Henry McMaster \u2014 now the state\u2019s governor \u2014 hadn\u2019t followed Brown\u2019s expressed wishes for most of his money to go to charity, having instead selected a professional manager who took control of Brown\u2019s assets from the estate\u2019s trustees to settle debts.",

          "title": "Nigeria: 56 Days After, Kidnappers Hold on to 116 Tegina Pupils Despite Receiving $100,000 Ransom",
          "text": "No fewer than 116 of the 136 pupils of Salihu Tanko Islamiyya School in Tegina, Rafi Local Government Area of Niger State, abducted by terrorists on May 30 are 56 days old in the dungeons of their kidnappers on Saturday, with hope for freedom still distant.\n\nTears continue to flow in many homes in Tegina, as traumatised parents await a miracle for the release of their kids, following the refusal of the abductors to free the pupils after collecting N50 million ransom contributed by sympathisers.\n\nSeventeen of the initial 136 abductees escaped, while three others died in the forest where they are being held.\n\nThe kidnappers had agreed to free the remaining 116 pupils if the ransom reduced from the initial N200 million to N50 million was paid.\n\nLast Monday, sympathisers mobilised N30 million to the kidnappers at an agreed location in the forest, after an initial N20 million was paid in June. But after counting the money, the abductors declared that it was N4.6 million short, and detained the conveyor of the ransom. The pupils were also not released.\n\nIt was the second time the kidnappers will declare ransom incomplete. In the initial N20 million paid in June, the abductors said it was N2 million short after counting it.\n\nThe kidnappers subsequently phoned the parents last Monday to send the N4.6 million balance, plus another N2 million short from the initial payment of N20 million, totaling N6.6 million.\n\nBesides, the kidnappers are also making fresh demand. They want the parents to supply six brand new Bajaj motorcycles before the pupils would be released.\n\n\u201cWe are fed up, we are leaving everything to God\u201d one of the parents told THISDAY on Friday.\n\nWhen contacted, the Head Teacher of the school, Mallam Abubakar Alhassan confirmed the story saying: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what to do next\u201d.\n\nAlhassan said: \u201cAll the parents are now Koboless. We have sold everything we have to raise the ransoms collected by the bandits, yet they refuse to release our children.\u201d\n\nThree of the abducted pupils have died in the dungeons of the kidnappers, and many of the remaining pupils are said to be seriously ill, resulting from hunger, cold and trauma.\n\nThe pupils, some of their teachers and passersby were abducted on May 30, but 17 of the abductees escaped from the clutches of the bandits three weeks after their abduction.\n\nThree pupils also died in captivity few days back. It was gathered that the bandits gave the sad information to some of the parents in a telephone conversation, but they (bandits) did not disclose the names of the deceased pupils.\n\nThe Chief Imam of Tegina also said he made similar announcement after one of the regular Muslim prayers in the town early this week.\n\nAccording to THISDAY findings, the bandits told the parents contacted that they would send the video of the burial of the late pupils and that of the present condition of the others to confirm their state of health. As at press time, the bandits had not sent the video.\n\nSome parents told THISDAY that the Niger State Government promised to help offset part of the ransom but failed to deliver.\n\nHowever, Secretary to the Niger State Government, Alhaji Ibrahim Ahmed Matane, debunked the claim saying, \u201cThere was never a time that government promised to pay ransom to bandits or assist the parents to pay any or part of the ransom. We have a policy not to pay ransom. We still stand by that policy.\n\n\u201cYou know this issue of payment of ransom is not healthy. Government, as a policy, does not do it but I know that because they are engaging with the bandits, they can tell them anything.\u201d\n\nThe SSG also distanced the government from any official pledge that government would pay part of the ransom saying, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know who that government official is because I coordinate security and I am not aware.\u201d\n\nAsked if government was aware that three of the children had died, he said: \u201cI\u2019m not aware that three of the girls have died. You know these people (bandits) can be very deceptive. They raise a lot of emotions and sentiments so that we will accept their bidding.\u201d\n\nThe pupils, all from Muslim homes, spent the Eid-el-Kabir festival in the den of their abductors.\n\nThe mother of one of the pupils, whose name was not given, died early last month as a result of trauma. The remains of the deceased were interred in Tegina according to Islamic injunction.\n\nSome of the kidnapped pupils are between ages four, and 13. The headmaster of the school, whose two children and a sister are among the abducted, said some of the victims were too young for the ordeals they were facing.\n\nHe also indicted both the federal and state governments for abandoning the school and the parents of the students in their moment of despair.\n\nAlhassan, popularly called Mallam by his community, in an emotion-laden interview on June 5, claimed there had been no sympathy from the government, and wondered why the federal government failed to provide the ransom demanded by the bandits.\n\nHe said it was a lie that the government had sent vehicles and motorcycles into the bush for rescue operation, and denied the report that he had prior information of the attack.\n\nThe head teacher disclosed that the abduction had already led to the death of two parents of the victims, warning that more casualties may happen unless the students regained their freedom quickly.\n\nFighting back tears, Alhassan said on June 5: \u201cI have witnessed the funeral prayer of one of the parents here, very close to the school. She died because she had just one child who is our student. She was not around when the incident happened. When she came back, they told her and within 30 minutes, she collapsed and died. That was the day before yesterday.\n\n\u201cA day after the incident happened, another parent died. She had two children. One was sent to the town while the one with her was kidnapped. She died of heart attack.\n\n\u201cAs I\u2019m talking to you now, my wife is down. She was put on drip, she didn\u2019t cook; she didn\u2019t eat. My little child at home, who slept with me on my bed, woke up only to begin to shout the name of his elder sister, asking me \u201cBaba, when is she coming back?\n\n\u201cOne painful thing was that my sister called me before the last discussion with the bandits, crying. She swore that the children are sick, they cannot walk. She told me they have removed their hijabs. They have unveiled them. They removed their shirts and they are left with only trousers.\n\n\u201cThere is no food. They gave them kulikuli (groundnut cake). How do you expect them to survive? They took them to unknown environments. I heard people saying they kept them on the floor. When you are talking about floors you are not talking about classrooms or a house. No, they are kept in the bush. They are sleeping on the ground, no leaves, not mat. How do you expect them to live like that?\u201d\n\nAnother parent, a mother, Mrs. Hashimu, in an interview, few days after the abduction said: \u201cThe whole incident was terrifying because everything happened in my presence. I was hearing everything. I saw when the bandits were going away with these children but there was nothing I could do. Government is not helping matters at all saying this, saying that, yet we cannot see anything on the ground.\u201d\n\nLaleye Dipo in Minna",

          "text": "Bandits, Friday morning, launched fresh onslaught on Dansadau community, in Maru Local Government Area of Zamfara State, killing four villagers. They also kidnapped 14 others and set ablaze a military armoured personnel vehicle in the community.\n\nA resident of the community, Nuhu Dansadau, who confirmed the incident to THISDAY in a telephone interview said the bandits invaded the community at about 2:45am and operated till 6:am before they whisked away the 14 residents.\n\nHe said the bandits besieged the community and fired several shots in the air and then went into some houses and abducted the 14 people, including children and women, saying several people in the community fled for safety.\n\nHe added that the invaders also injured seven other residents before they burnt the military armoured personnel vehicle, stating that despite the ongoing peace and reconciliation programme being run by the state government, killing and kidnapping of innocent people remained the order of the day in Zamfara.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs we speak, one of the injured victims has been moved to Federal Medical Centre, Gusau. The 14 kidnapped victims include seven children, three women and four men. The military armoured personnel vehicle while trying to fight the bandits hit a pole and the soldiers abandoned it and ran away. When the bandits discovered that the soldiers left the armoured car, they went and set it ablaze.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe received information that the bandits are holding meeting in a nearby village called Danguruku and we have informed \u2013 the military, police and our civilian JTF. You know, they attacked our community because they said we assisted security personnel to rescue the military pilot that his aircraft was shot down.\u201d\n\nWhile calling on the government to deploy more security personnel to the community to end the scourge, Dansadau said military, police and other paramilitary personnel were grossly inadequate to tackle what he termed daily killing and kidnapping of farmers in the community.\n\nMeanwhile, the incident is coming barely a few days after 100 kidnapped victims from Manawa village under the Dansadau district were released by the marauders, and barely a week after a military Alpha jet was shot down by the bandits in the state.\n\nAs at the time of filing this report, the state police command was yet to confirm the latest attack, though the public relations officer promised to get back to journalists with more information.\n\nDansadau community is about 99 kilometers from Gusau the Zamfara State capital and is one of the hottest zones in terms of banditry, kidnappings, and other nefarious activities in the state.\n\nFrancis Sardauna in Katsina",
