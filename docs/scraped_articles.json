          "text": "After 126 days in captivity, 30 abducted students of the Federal Government College, Birnin Yauri, on Thursday, arrived Birnin Kebbi, the Kebbi State capital following their release by bandits.\n\nThe news of their release was broken to journalists in a statement issued by the Special Adviser, Media, to Kebbi State Governor, Yahaya Sarki.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cToday, Thursday, October 21, 2021, 30 students of the Federal Government College, Birnin Yauri have arrived Birnin Kebbi, the Kebbi State capital, following their release, while efforts are still continuing to secure the release of the remaining.\n\n\u201cThey shall undergo medical screening and support while being re-united with their families.\n\n\u201cWe thank all those who have helped in securing the release, while congratulating Mr President, Muhammadu Buhari, for the success.\u201d\n\nThe PUNCH had reported that 102 persons, comprising of 94 students, four teaching and another four non-academic members of staff of the school were abducted by bandits on June 17.\n\nMajority of the kidnapped students are those of SS1 and SS2 classes, who were caught up in the examination hall, writing their terminal test.\n\nAs of the last count, 13 of the students and two teachers have regained their freedom. Sadly, three students, one each from Kamba (Kebbi), Wushishi and Anaba areas of Niger state, were confirmed dead.\n\nWhen contacted, a parent of one of the abducted students, who did not want his name in print, told our correspondent that, he is not in the picture of under what terms and conditions some of the abducted students were released.\n\n\u201cAs affected parents, we have not been contacted officially by the authority of our children\u2019s release. What we heard was conflicting figures of 30 and 34 freed children. A lot of us are in pensive mood because we are yet to ascertain those released and those still languishing in the bandits den.\n\n\u201cThe news of the students released was not a surprise to us because we are aware that negotiations has been going forth and back and, we are full of optimism. What I cannot say is under what terms and conditions the students were released.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

We do not know the content of the report, but we want to say publicly that, upon the handover of the report, we will be making it public. We will not cover up anything.\n\n\u201cThis is not who we are and that is not what our Government stands for. We will make full disclosure of whatever recommendations that the panel will come up with. I assure citizens of Lagos that we will not leave anything to chance.\u201d\n\nOn the arrest of protesters at the Lekki Tollgate on Wednesday, the Governor announced that he had ordered an unconditional release of those detained by the police, except one person who was caught with dangerous weapons at the scene.\n\nSanwo-Olu continued: \u201cYesterday (Wednesday), we saw a protest in Lagos and everybody that was arrested in connection with the protest have all been released, except an individual that was caught with dangerous weapons and who confessed to the police that he joined the protest to cause mayhem.\u201d\n\nHe however, commended the police for being alive with its responsibility to identify and isolate troublemakers from among law-abiding people who conducted themselves in line with the laws.\n\nSanwo-Olu, also encouraged the youths to be stakeholders in the development of the state, while reiterating his commitment to reconciliation.\n\nSpeaking on the rebuilding effort, the Governor said the destruction had slowed down operational activities of the affected public institutions, but stressed that the state government would not shy away from its responsibility to rebuild the facilities and restore their operating capacity.\n\nSanwo-Olu stated: \u201cIt is exactly a year ago today when Lagos was hit by violence in the aftermath of the EndSARS protests. Lagos witnessed massive destruction of infrastructure, iconic buildings, transport infrastructure, police station and others.\n\n\u201cToday being a year after the event, there is no better time to say how difficult it has been for us as a state and how committed it has been for us.\n\n\u201cAs tough as it is, the Government will certainly not shy away from its responsibility. We see the incident as a challenge and we will fix it with everything that we have.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Policies need to be squarely focused on addressing the challenge of poverty to prevent the insecurity in the region.\n\n\u201cPolicymakers need to navigate among three challenging pressures: pressing spending needs to address the many social, human capital, and infrastructure needs; limited borrowing capacity given already high public debt levels in most cases; and the time consuming and politically difficult nature of mobilising tax revenues.\u201d\n\nThe director stated that countries, skillfully navigating the challenges, would have a huge bearing on the macroeconomic well-being and growth prospects.\n\nHe stressed the importance of international solidarity and support to facilitating divergent health, poverty, and economic outcomes.\n\nHe also said the global population was set to grow by about two billion people over the next three decades, with half of that increase coming from sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n\u201cThis presents a huge opportunity: a growing pool of human talent and ingenuity that will have a telling effect on the economic, social, and political trajectory of our planet. We need to pay more heed to this phenomenal opportunity.\u201d\n\nSelassie further reiterated the commitment of the IMF to supporting sub-Saharan Africa tackle the broad array of challenges it faced.",

Adeogun Adejoro at public hearing on Thursday, stopped representative of Polaris Bank after he introduced himself as the Legal Adviser of the bank.\n\nThe Chairman insisted that the committee could only speak with the Managing Director of the Bank, noting that the MD must appear before the committee.\n\n\u201cIf your bank refuses to come out straight and continue to play pranks with us, we will issue warrant of arrest against your MD. You people can take somebody\u2019s money and start playing with it? 32 Million Dollars is what we are talking about here,\u201d he stressed.\n\nAccording to the Legal advisor of Polaris Bank, \u201cMonies have been paid to the CBN account, and the CBN has the evidence\u201d.\n\nThe Chairman of the Committee, without hesitation asked the CBN director of Money if such was paid into the CBN account by Polaris Bank, an allegation the Director vehemently refuted, saying \u201cthe alleged $32 Million is still with them, nothing was paid into the CBN account\u201d.\n\nHon. Adeogun, therefore, warned Polaris to be mindful of the lies they are telling to the government. He also said, \u201cPolaris Bank Cannot be comfortably owing the federal government and refuse to pay, because, the money is supposed to be used to fund the 2022 budget\u201d.\n\nThe committee also summoned the executive director of First Bank Plc, Mr Abdullahi Ibrahim to explain some three pending issues unexplained from his payment.\n\nThe director, who corrected them, saying, \u201cit was two unexplained issues, which he explained thus: \u201cMr Chairman, N2.3 billion was remitted, but was not supported in any bank statement. Another N100 million was deposited as well, but it was not recorded. NNPC advised it should be closed.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs far as this recovered loot is concerned now, First Bank is not involved in such again, it has been settled. NNPC therefore agreed with the submission by First Bank.\u201d\n\nThe committee, insisted on appearance of heads of the affected agencies at an adjourned date slated for Wednesday next week.",

They said they were acting on orders from above.\n\n\u201cDoes the order from above also include ordering them to assassinate great Igbo leaders in broad daylight at the court premises? Is the Nigerian Court now the court of the North, where no Igbo man is allowed access? It is so pathetic. This present administration has destroyed all our democratic ethos,\u201d it lamented.\n\nIt further stated that: \u201cWhat played out at the court today is the height of insult against Ndigbo and we condemn it in its entirety. It is very clear that the present regime enjoys insulting the sensibility of the Igbo race.\n\n\u201cDr. Ezeife, Senator Ifeanyi Ubah and other great Igbo leaders were representatives of the Igbo Nation, they were denied access to the court in a matter involving their own son and brother, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu in a supposed democratic administration.\n\n\u201cOnly a society that has no respect for elders and fundamental human rights will stop highly respected statesmen in the society who are great and respected personalities from gaining access to the courtroom. Dr. Ezeife is a former Governor and Senator Ubah is a serving Senator but they were denied access because they are of the Igbo tribe.\u201d\n\nThe group said the DSS was a part of the executive arm of government that executes its orders and that they had no powers under a democratic government to dictate who enters the courtroom that is totally under the Judiciary arm of government.\n\n\u201cIt is an aberration and a travesty of the law for the DSS operatives to stand at the entrance of the courtroom to dictate who enters and who does not enter the courtroom.\n\n\u201cWhat happened today in court at the hearing of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s case clearly shows that we are not in a democratic administration but a military regime that has no respect for fundamental human rights and the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria which the President swore to protect.\n\n\u201cThere is nowhere in the world where the president in a democratic administration dictates what happens in the court. The Judiciary is an independent arm of government separated from the executive arm. The Judiciary is the last hope of the common man and everyone is entitled to approach the court.\u201d",

          "title": "From Black Lives Matter to EndSARS",
          "text": "SIR: The world did not only combat the dreaded Covid-19 virus in the year 2020, the world stood up against police brutality. May 25, 2020, at the peak of the global pandemic, George Floyd an African-American was murdered in the course of an arrest by a Minneapolis police officer called Derek Chauvin. Derek knelt on Floyd\u2019s neck and back for nine minutes and 29 seconds. On October 3, 2020, exactly 131 days later, a video showing a SARS police officer shooting a young Nigerian in front of Wetland Hotel, Ughelli, Delta State surfaced on the internet. It was alleged that the officers killed and took away the young man\u2019s vehicle.\n\nFloyd\u2019s death sparked a wave of heavy protests across the globe. The world stood up with Americans from Munich to Dakar to Tel-Aviv. People took to streets to express the need for police reform and racial equality. People held signs that read \u201cBLACK LIVES MATTER\u201d while others knelt in silence for the number of minutes it took Floyd\u2019s life to be snuffed out of him.\n\nThe video that trended the Nigerian internet space too provoked a similar protest which eventually became the #EndSARS protests. Thousands of people gathered in places far from Ughelli to express anger over extra-judicial killings, extortion and torture by members of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad. The calls resonated so loud that Nigerians in diaspora took to the streets of London and Washington to stand against police brutality. Both the \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d protest and the \u201cEndSARS\u201d protest took solace in a decentralized technique that made it difficult for governments to identify the leaders of the mass movement. \u201cSorosoke\u2019 became Nigeria\u2019s \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d.\n\nWhile Derek Chauvin, the police officer who suffocated George Floyd was arrested and prosecuted, the SARS officials who have rained brutality on innocent Nigerians continue to live their lives without justice being served on them. Few states have implemented the recommendations of ENDSARS judicial panels which amongst others called for the prosecution of certain police officers who abused their powers.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIt is unfortunate that the momentum of the powerful mass protests against extra-judicial killings was truncated by the military clampdown at Lekki tollgate.\n\nNonetheless, Nigerians demanded for an end to SARS and it was given although not on a platter of gold. Scores of people were killed during the protests in clashes with hoodlums, military and police officers.

          "text": "SIR: According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS\u2019) publication on Nigeria\u2019s capital importation report for the first and second quarters of 2021, the nation received a sum of $875.62 million foreign inflows in Q2 2021, representing a year-on-year decline. Despite this, the Absa Africa Financial Markets Index 2021 (AAFMI) produced by the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF) and sponsored by Absa Group Limited; a South African-based financial services group, ranked Nigeria as the third most attractive country in Africa for foreign investment.\n\nAccording to the AAFMI evaluation of financial market development in 23 African countries, Nigeria was highlighted as one of the top economies with the most supportive environment for effective markets.\n\nTo rank the countries\u2019 openness and attractiveness to foreign investment, AAFMI used six pillars and Nigeria\u2019s performance across the six pillars were: market depth, 62; access to foreign exchange, 20; market transparency, tax and regulatory environment, 86; capacity of local investors, 44; macroeconomic opportunities, 69 and enforceability of standard master agreement, 100.\n\nOverall, Nigeria scored 63 points to occupy the third position while the first and second positions went to South Africa and Mauritius, which scored 86 and 70 points respectively.\n\nThe report further stated that nine countries in the index, including Nigeria, have introduced products that could be classified as green or sustainable and emphasised that, \u201cgreen bonds are the most popular instrument, being at investors\u2019 disposal in seven countries\u201d. Nigeria is also among countries that are using technology in their stock exchanges to boost retail participation. Nigeria\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) launched FinPort, a fintech and innovation portal to assist fintech businesses to understand the regulatory requirements for the Nigerian capital market.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nTaking a look at the country\u2019s debt profile, the report noted that Nigeria had kept its official borrowing relatively low; \u201cAt 8.4 per cent of GDP, it has the best debt profile, boosting its ranking by five places to fifth\u201d.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThis is a confirmation that the Buhari government has not borrowed beyond its limit as against naysayers criticism that the loans under President Muhammadu Buhari were humongous and hence worrisome.\n\nAAFMI also acknowledged the fact that Nigeria has continued to make strides in creating an enabling investment environment for foreign investors, with the necessary regulatory developments and policy initiatives.\n\nIt is worthy to note that despite the challenges we are facing as a nation, Nigeria has been able to successfully turn the economy\u2019s compass in the right direction not just in terms of domestic growth but more importantly in the aspect of FDI. The implication of this is that it is going to drive economic growth. More money will flow into the country; more jobs will be created which in turn will lead to increased income and more purchasing power. It will also ignite economic activities which will boost the country\u2019s economy in the long run.\n\nThe federal government has been up and doing in a bid to create a viable business environment capable of attracting and retaining investors as well as boosting their confidence in our system. This ranking has proved that its efforts have not been put to waste, but rather yielding positive results.\n\nIt is believed that beyond rhetoric government will not relent until the country becomes the ultimate destination for foreign investment in Africa.\n\nIjanada Jantiku,\n\n[email protected]",

          "title": "One year after #EndSARS, no lessons learnt",
          "text": "October 2020 is a watershed in Nigeria\u2019s revolutionary history. It is a time that evokes courage, trepidation, solemnity, and despair. Nigerian consciences across divides mobilised and made demands on the government \u2013 to end police brutality \u2013 with the #EndSARS campaign. Regime power succumbed to people power \u2013 but sadly in the end, the citizens\u2019 action was commandeered and miscarried.\n\nLike most Nigerians, I was in support of the protest before it was seized and deployed for violence. Protests are only natural in a democracy. In fact, they are evidence that democracy is still kicking. But violence in whatever form should not be found among civilised people.\n\nI recall how the protest in Abuja was poisoned. Peaceful citizens converged on different areas in the city demanding a reform of the police. But some uncivil individuals infiltrated the ranks of the movement, blocking roads, setting bonfires and holding residents captive in a jungle of automobiles. Soon sponsored thugs descended on peaceful protesters and unleashed a violence never before seen in the Federal Capital Territory on citizens only doing their bounden duty.\n\nChaos everywhere; the earth was crimson and the atmosphere made putrid by the blazing of property and attack on pedestrians. The FCT was under siege \u2013 held by hoodlums and criminals magicked from neighbouring states by those who considered the protest as an attack on the government.\n\nSome residents killed, businesses destroyed, buildings razed and a fleet of cars at a vehicle mart set ablaze. But one year after, most of those who suffered losses in the savage attacks have not been compensated despite the promise made to them by Bello Mohammed, FCT minister.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nI am of the view that the #EndSARS protest in situ was an organic and unchoreographed citizens\u2019 response to the prevailing culture of impunity at all levels. It was devoid of political adventures ab initio, but some powerful forces sensing the political capital that can be extracted from it played their hand. Then the agents of the government reacted by sponsoring thugs to counter the tide. Anarchy was subsequently loosed on the country.\n\nThe government cannot be exculpated of blame in the violence that followed the #EndSARS protest just as the political influence on the movement by some interests cannot be discounted.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nSo, one year after the #EndSARS protest, what has changed? And what lessons have been learnt \u2013 by the government and protest entrepreneurs? I think nothing has changed, and there appears to be no lessons learnt.\n\nAccording to a report by Global Rights, an international human rights organisation based in Washington DC, in spite of the avalanche of protests against police brutality in October 2020, Nigeria recorded 164 cases of extra-judicial killing between January and September 2021.\n\nThe report said there were 14 cases of extra-judicial killing in January; three in February; six in March, six in April, nine in May; 12 in June, 23 in July; 14 in August, and 77 in September.\n\nA plus ca change; nothing changed. The impunity by law enforcement agents has persisted unhinged since the #EndSARS protest. But this impunity is systemic, really. Yes. Impunity is a Nigerian affliction, and it is beyond the police. Here, a \u201cbig man\u201d will threaten to lock you up for speaking to him unkindly. And a federal ministry will turn you back for wearing shorts or for having dreadlocks. Those with privilege abuse and assault their domestic staff; companies are run as slave camps where staff suffer indignities and are owed months and years of wages. It is the same impunity \u2013 everywhere.\n\nThe average Nigerian police officer is not different from the everyday Nigerian. They are encumbered by the same flaws, the same contours, and are from the same famished and oppressed phylum. Our police officers are made by our communities and socialised into impunity as everyone else.\n\nAgain, the problem is systemic. Police criminalise citizens; citizens see police as the enemy. But as long as there is a trust chasm between the civil population and the law enforcement agency, the police cannot secure the country. Every society gets the police it deserves.\n\nIt is in every government\u2019s best interest to address the underlying triggers of citizens\u2019 revolt such as the high youth unemployment, hunger, corruption and impunity by those entrusted with power. The #EndSARS protest happened at a time Nigeria was reopening the economy after weeks of lockdown owing to the COVID pandemic. There was already mass frustration owing to job losses and business failures brought on by the lockdown.\n\nThe excessiveness of some police officers at a time Nigerians were writhing from economic vexation ignited the mine. SARS had always been callous before the protest, but at that time, Nigerians said, \u2018if we perish, we perish\u2019. No government should take the patience and docility of citizens for granted. There is always a breaking point, and there is always a point of no return. The biggest lesson for the government is perhaps to be sensitive to the plight, complaints and challenges of citizens. There is a point a diffident goat is pushed to \u2013 and it bites.\n\nFor activists and the civil society, calling for protests is one thing, but managing demonstrations so that they are not commandeered by political interests and vultures is another matter. A lack of strategy and the absence of leadership made the #EndSARS protest vulnerable to political toxins. There should be an exit strategy, entente, and fair compromises where necessary.\n\nThere is always another day to fight.",

The people have a right to vote and select their leader.\n\n\u201cNo group or individual will be allowed to stimulate anarchy and chaos, leading to murderous activities.\n\n\u201cThe President has made it very clear that the Armed Forces and all law enforcement agencies must make sure that the elections take place even if it means overwhelming the entire environment with the presence of security agencies.\n\n\u201cThere are so many implications for elections to be sabotaged by non-state actors; in the first place, we are in a democracy, secondly it is important to note that if these non-state actors should succeed in destroying the potentials for orderly elections, then it is natural that other parts of the country would also want to copy this same situation.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mongonu, in the last two months, the military has recorded a lot of successes in the fight against insurgency in the North-East zone of the country which put pressure on the ISWAP and the Boko Haram Islamic terrorists.\n\n\u201cThe fact again is that the armed forces, the land forces have done an excellent job because in the span of one month we have been able to take out the leadership of the Islamic State of West African Province (ISWAP) \u2013 that is Abu Musab Al-barnawi.\n\n\u201cTwo days ago, the man who succeeded him, one Malam Bako, one of the prominent leaders of the Shura Council of the Islamic State of West African Province, was also taken out.\n\n\u201cThey are also contending with leadership crisis. You know these things are also accompanied with inherent issues of trust, conflicts, mutual suspicion and other things.\n\n\u201cSo, the operations being conducted by the armed forces in the Northern parts of the country put a lot of pressure on the Islamic State of West African Province, Boko Haram and also the tangential group known as Islamic State in the Greatest Sahara.\u201d\n\nThe Minister of Police Affairs, Maigari Dingyadi, on his part reiterated that the Police are ready to ensure there is peace in Anambra and all other parts of the country.\n\nHe said, \u201cIn particular, we talked about the Anambra governorship election coming on 6th of November and we want to assure the people of Anambra State and all Nigerians that the government is committed to conducting that election.\n\n\u201cThe election has to be free and fair, we are going to put every machinery in place to ensure that people are well secured. That is the only way to ensure that we promote democracy and good governance in this country.\u201d\n\nAmong those at the meeting were Vice President Yemi Osinbajo (SAN); Attorney-General of the Federation, AGF, and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami; Minister of Defense, Major General Bashir Magashi (retd); Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama; the Chief of Staff to the President, Professor Ibrahim Gambari; and the National Security Adviser, Major General Babagana Monguno (retd).\n\nOthers are the Chief of Defense Staff, General Lucky Irabor; Chief of Army Staff, Lt.

It is a reflection of our warm and cordial bilateral relations that this is the second time I\u2019ve had the pleasure of receiving my brother in Abuja.\n\n\u201cDuring the visit, we had very useful discussions on a number of bilateral issues, aimed at strengthening this cordial relationship between Nigeria and Turkey. The key issues we touched on included a series of bilateral agreements and Memoranda of Understanding that have been finalised.\n\n\u201cAs a positive outcome, eight major agreements, MoU on a number of the key sectors, including energy, defense, industry, mining, and hydrocarbons, among others, were signed today. We have agreed that implementation is to commence immediately.\n\n\u201cIn the course of our discussions, we also reviewed the travel ban based on the revised COVID-19 protocols, and removed Turkey from Nigeria\u2019s travel ban list. Turkey has indeed achieved remarkable success in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President commended President Erdogan for providing a safe haven for about four million refugees, who had to flee their war-torn home countries in search to peace and safety.\n\nOn his part, speaking in his native Turkish language and interpreted by one of the officials on his entourage, President Erdogan recognised Nigeria as one of the oldest allies of Turkey in Africa, having seen 60 years of diplomatic ties.\n\nAccording to him, steps would immediately be taken to expand the trade volume between the two countries to $5 billion, as the $2 billion mark achieved last year could not be said to be substantial enough.\n\nHe said: \u201cThanks for the bilateral discussions we\u2019ve had with Nigerian President, Mr. Buhari, we\u2019ve had the opportunity to observe and to assess all aspects and dimensions of the relations between Turkey and Nigeria and we had also exchanged our opinions and impressions as to how much further we can develop and strengthen our relations between our two countries. It gives me great pleasure to confirm once again that in terms of expanding our cooperation between the two nations, we share the same resolves.\n\n\u201cWe shall be celebrating the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between our two nations and Nigeria hosts one of the oldest diplomatic missions of the Republic of Turkey on the African continent. Nigeria is one of the outstanding members of international organisations, such as the G8, OIC, ECOWAS and the African Union, as well as being one of the most leading countries of both this region, and the rest of the world.\n\n\u201cWe should appreciate the tremendous efforts of Nigeria with eventual goal of bringing peace, stability, and economic development to the entire African continent. Nigeria holds the manufacturing position of the entire continent, and our trade volume between the two nations reached $2 billion last year. Thus, Nigeria became our most outstanding and the biggest trade partner in the sub-Saharan Africa for the Republic of Turkey.\n\n\u201cHowever, we still believe that this level we have achieved is far from being adequate. We hope and pray that we will be expanding our trade volume up to $5 billion immediately. We hope and pray that the relations between the two nations will be further developed on the basis of a win-win scenario, and on the basis of mutual respect\u201d.\n\nOn the beneficial ties between Turkey and Africa, especially Nigeria, President Erdogan said, \u201cwe\u2019ll keep on converging with the African continent as Republic of Turkey on every dimension possible. All relations are based upon the foundation of strategic partnership, and we are gaining new momentum every time we visit the continent.\n\n\u201cWe have increased the number of our diplomatic missions on the African continent up to 43 recently. The third round of the Turkish-African Business Forum will be hosted in Istanbul on October 21, and the 22nd, only to be followed by hosting of the third Turkish-African Partnership Summit on December 17, and 18th. We are committed to expanding our relations and our cooperation further with Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt also gives me great pleasure to be able to observe that many Nigerian youngsters are pursuing their further education, not only in Turkey, but also in the universities of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, and it gives me great pleasure to observe that they\u2019re also benefiting from the turkey scholarships available to them\u201d, he said.\n\nThe Turkish President used the forum to request Nigeria\u2019s collaboration with Turkey in the fight against terrorism in both countries, noting particularly that his nation had been following Nigeria\u2019s fight against insecurity, particularly the activities of terrorists.\n\nHe added: \u201cAs Turkey, we have been closely monitoring the developments unfolding in Nigeria, our brotherly and friendly nation. The terrorist organisations, the armed gangs and the marine bandits are continuously active in Nigeria and the Nigerian authorities are continuously fighting against them. So, in order to cooperate further in the fields of military, defense, and security, we are doing everything that will be available.\n\n\u201cOn this occasion, I also would like to take this opportunity, once again, to extend my most heartfelt condolences to our brothers and sisters of Nigeria, who have lost their lives as a result of terrorist attacks and I hope and pray that Allah will bestow upon those who stay behind, the utmost patience and strength.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to share our ever-expanding capabilities, as the Republic of Turkey, with Nigeria, especially in the field of defense industry and security, which are being praised by the entire globe.\n\n\u201cThis sensitivity that we showcase in fighting terrorism, I hope, will be reciprocated by our Nigerian brothers and sisters and our counterparts. As we\u2019re probably aware of the fact that Turkey has been fighting against terrorist organisations for many decades, such as the PKK, PYD, FETO, DASH and other terrorist organisations.\n\n\u201cThe perpetrator of the heinous failed coup of July the 15th, FETO, is still illegally active in Nigeria, and we are continuously sharing our intelligence with the Nigerian interlocutors and authorities. I hope and pray that our Nigerian brothers will forge a closer solidarity in this field with us, the Republic of Turkey. I hope and pray that our visit will yield the most auspicious results\u201d.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Baxi acquisition deal sees MFS Africa expand footprint into Nigeria",
          "text": "In a deal subject to approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria, MFS Africa has signed an agreement to acquire Capricorn Digital, one of Nigeria\u2019s largest digital solutions and distribution companies with a 90,000-strong agent network across the country, for an undisclosed amount.\n\nAs the largest fintech interoperability hub in Africa, MFS Africa connects banks, telcos, and money transfer operators across over 35 countries via a single integration point. Paga, MTN mobile money, Ecobank, and Safaricom are among the operators integrated on the hub, with an estimated 320 million mobile money customers interacting across various digital wallets without transaction fees associated with switching platforms.\n\nCapricorn, under its SME-focused brand, Baxi, operates an ecosystem of digital payment services. Its solution is built to help Nigerians with everyday payment needs; including utility bill payments, airtime purchases, pay-TV and data subscriptions, withdrawals, and money transfers. The company delivers these services through its retail network of agents and merchants in some of the remotest locations across Nigeria, and via its BaxiBox POS, BaxiPay, Baxi MPoS Device, and BaxiRIMS products.\n\nThe 100% cash acquisition, MFS Africa\u2019s third in five years, sees the pan-African payments giant expand into Africa\u2019s largest economy, where its presence to date has been limited given the country\u2019s small number of mobile wallets. Capricorn will be called MFS Africa but its core product, Baxi, retains its name.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBoth parties declined to disclose the value of the deal but on a call with TechCabal, Capricorn Founder and CEO, Degbola Abudu, said the deal is the second-largest of its kind in Nigeria\u2019s fintech space, behind the $200 million Stripe paid for Paystack last year.\n\nMFS Africa was founded in 2009 by Dare Okoudjou, a Beninese national, while Nigeria-born Abudu started Capricorn in 2014, with Folu Majekodunmi. The acquisition creates a larger, more versatile company that fuses interoperability between money operators and a super-agent network reaching the mass market.\n\nA pan-African march\n\nMFS Africa\u2019s big vision is to have a presence in all 54 African countries, serving 500 million people and millions of small businesses, according to Okoudjou.\n\n\u201cIf you have a phone or POS, it should be enough to transact with the rest of Africa and the world,\u201d he tells TechCabal. \u201cWe\u2019re building the foremost, currency-agnostic, real-time hub for payments on the continent, to enable people transfer money the way they can call each other.\u201d\n\nOften, MFS Africa\u2019s continental expansion plan has involved partnering with money operators and making minority investments in other fintech companies across Africa, as in the case of Julaya, Maviance, and Numida.\n\nHowever, Okoudjou explains that the company opts for full acquisition when both parties consider that more effective for achieving their shared long-term ambitions.\n\nDare Okoudjou, MFS Africa founder and CEO (left) and Degbola Abudu, co-founder of Baxi.\n\nWhy an acquisition?\n\nSimilar to Beyonic, a Ugandan fintech startup MFS Africa bought in June 2020 also for an undisclosed amount, acquisition talks with Capricorn evolved from a minority investment to a full buyout.\n\n\u201cThe more we spoke with Dee, the more we realised what we could achieve with a full acquisition instead of being only investors in which case there could be misaligned incentives.\u201d\n\nOkoudjou further explains that the need to \u201cbolster our presence in Nigeria\u201d given its unique market features\u2014the prevalence of offline payment touchpoints over mobile-first transactions\u2014drove MFS Africa\u2019s interest in Capricorn.\n\n\u201cIn other markets, one or two partnerships with mobile money operators could see us reach 60% of digital payment users in the country,\u201d he says. \u201cHowever, mobile money isn\u2019t that widely adopted in Nigeria. Instead, agent networks such as Capricorn\u2019s have grown rapidly.\u201d\n\nWhile MFS Africa can service SMEs online through Beyonic, for instance, Baxi enables the company to reach offline merchants in Nigeria and beyond.\n\nFor Abudu, the future of the mobile payments landscape in Africa is a game of few, where consolidation is the way forward, and attempting to scale alone would require more capital expenditure and a longer time to execute.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good time to partner with a company that brings a real pan-African presence and we see synergies across our operations. They offer a wide range of value-added products and services like cross-border payments while we have access to SMEs in Nigeria, one of the biggest markets in Africa,\u201d he says. \u201cWe believe that we\u2019ve barely scratched the market\u2019s potential. The deal brings many things that allow us to grow very quickly.\u201d\n\nFollowing the acquisition\u2019s close, MFS Africa will build Baxi into a key node on its digital payment network, allowing customers to make cross-border payments to and from Nigeria, similar to what it\u2019s done with mobile money operators across Africa. MFS Africa will also expand Baxi\u2019s proposition for offline SMEs to select markets within its footprint.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been able to build a large business with relatively small capital but now we want to be able to compete, not just in Nigeria but also across Africa,\u201d Abudu says. \u201cThe deal with MFS Africa gives us leverage to take Baxi and the model that\u2019s been so successful in Nigeria to other African countries.\u201d\n\nMFS Africa plans to engage with Nigeria\u2019s central bank and other regulators to seek any other additional licenses needed to operate its full-service offerings\u2014such as remittance, micro-lending, insurance\u2014while also exploring commercial partnerships in the country.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Editi Effiong: father, writer, producer and tech bro",
          "text": "Editi Effiong\u2019s genius is quiet yet obvious at the same time. He\u2019s a multifaceted creator, builder and thinker\u2014unafraid to tackle the impossible without doubt. From setting up Anakle, a Nigeria-based digital marketing agency, 10 years ago to transitioning into film-making a few years later, Editi has established himself as one of the leading entrepreneurs of his generation. When asked how he would define himself, he responded with, \u201cI\u2019m a father, writer, producer, and tech bro.\n\nThe big picture: Editi Effiong is not your average guy\n\nMany people know Editi Effiong as the brains behind Anakle. Some others might know him for the films he made through his production company, Anakle Films or might have stumbled across him after his involvement in the post-#ENDSARS judicial hearing panel in 2020. Editi attended and documented the daily proceedings, sharing videos, photos and commentaries on his Twitter page. His dedication to reporting on how Lagos State investigated the unforgettable event that took place on October 20 last year, garnered him respect, admiration and a flock of new followers and cheerleaders.\n\nAnakle Films\u2019 theatrical releases, Up North and The Setup, were acquired by Netflix in 2019 and 2020 respectively. Up North, which was based on a story written by Editi, is best described as one of Nollywood\u2019s most adventurous films. Up North did two things successfully: It brought some versatility to Nollywood, Nigeria\u2019s behemoth movie industry; and heralded the arrival of a different Editi. He was no longer just the CEO of a well-respected digital agency with a client list that most marketing agencies would love to get their hands on\u2014Wikipedia, Flutterwave, Glo, to name a few\u2014he was now a film producer and writer who took his craft seriously.\n\nAn illustrated photo of Editi at a filming location in Northern Nigeria\n\nThe Set Up pulled us in a different direction. In this film, there are no adventures or lush, green fields. But there\u2019s suspense and the dirty underworld of crime. Anakle Films distributed The Set Up with legendary film-maker, Niyi Akinmolayan, sitting on the director\u2019s chair.\n\nEditi displayed his writing chops in his most recent short film, Fishbone, released in May 2020. Fishbone, written and directed by Effiong himself, unearths the terrifying business of counterfeit drugs and how it strips our society of its ability to show love and compassion. Fishbone is a deliberately revealing film; it shows us snapshots of Effiong\u2019s mind and showcases his directorial ingenuity.\n\nIn this exclusive interview with TechCabal, Editi opens up about his childhood, the complexity that is his mind, building Anakle, being a father, and his decision to become a full-time film-maker and writer.\n\nAnakle and the race to get businesses online\n\nEven though Editi is eager to hand over the CEO reins to Anakle\u2019s COO, Munachi \u201cMuna\u201d Nwoke-Ekpo, and purposefully step into his role as founder and CEO of Anakle Films, I was compelled to kick off the interview with questions about Anakle\u2019s beginnings.\n\nIn 2011, digital marketing didn\u2019t have as much clout as it does now. It is hard to imagine a world that didn\u2019t exist with numerous digital and social media platforms. Our current economic climate demands that entrepreneurs move their businesses online and acquire a new crop of customers who are obsessed with social media and consumer technology. In conversation, Editi is a masterful storyteller who uses transparency and humour to pull his listeners in. At no point during our chat did he leave me feeling confused or unimpressed.\n\nKoromone Koroye: What inspired you to start Anakle? What did you see and understand about digital marketing that most people didn\u2019t back in 2011?\n\nEditi Effiong: Back in 2011, we had a slide that predicted that internet penetration would deepen in five years. We also predicted that more than five million Nigerians would be on the internet and that that number would eventually rise to 30 million by 2016. Back then, mobile penetration wasn\u2019t that great and Blackberry phones were still a thing. My business partner, Abass, would charge business owners \u20a650,000 to help them run digital marketing campaigns. And that 50K came with a money-back guarantee: if we weren\u2019t able to successfully promote their brands, they got their money back without any hassles. I mean, how on earth does someone believe that the internet can help you sell more? But we saw that there was a market online and we bet big on what we saw.\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: According to the Digital 2021 report, there were an estimated 104 million internet users in Nigeria in January this year. Additionally, internet penetration stood at 50% and 33 million Nigerians with active social media accounts, within that same period.\n\nDo you remember Anakle\u2019s first major campaign?\n\nEditi: In 2010, we ran Interswitch\u2019s first digital campaign. We did this whole flash animation video to push Interswitch\u2019s anti-fraud campaign. I designed the flash. In the early stages of Anakle\u2019s business, I was in charge of execution and Abass handled business operations. So, in this flash animated campaign, if someone emails you for your password or PIN, you don\u2019t give them because Interswitch would never ask you for your PIN or personal information. It was a really great campaign at that time. I mean now, we might take a simple campaign like that for granted; but 12 years ago, building and executing a campaign like that was a phenomenal experience for us and the brands we served during that period.\n\nHow did businesses relate with social media back when Anakle started out?\n\nEditi: \u200b\u200bThe first bank to get on social media was GTB (Guaranty Trust Bank) followed by Diamond Bank. We worked on a project with them and they had their brand assets burned onto a CD. Yes, CDs were a thing back then. But, anyway, they opted for the CD route because they didn\u2019t want anyone to distribute their assets to other sources or agencies. So I picked up Diamond Bank\u2019s CD on a Tuesday and started working on it straight till Thursday. And Thursday happened to be my wedding day.\n\nWoah. You did client work on your wedding day?\n\nEditi: Yes! I was out in the foyer of the hotel room working on this project until I got called into the hall to say my vows and, you know, get married. So I put down my laptop, you know, went and got married and came back and continued working even through my honeymoon. And to think that this was only the second bank that we helped build a Facebook app and get them on social media. Diamond Bank was the second bank in Nigeria to go down the digital marketing route.\n\nIn the summer of 2010, there was a huge opportunity to help businesses get online. And one of the things Anakle was trying to do was help smaller businesses improve brand visibility by getting them acquainted with the internet. We didn\u2019t just target the big brands and enterprise businesses, especially in the beginning. Anakle saw the future of digital marketing and built a business out of it. Our mission was to help businesses grow into the online space, and that\u2019s pretty much it.\n\nAt what point did you realise that Anakle had fulfilled its mission, or at least a part of it?\n\nEditi: There have been many moments. In 2017 we did a very successful campaign with Wikipedia. And that campaign was a forerunner to what became Anakle films. That campaign counted as a major milestone for us. There\u2019s also the part we played in hiring and training people who were new to the digital marketing space. For most of them, Anakle was their first job out of school, and now, most of them are running their own successful companies and projects. You know, making money and growing a company are necessary targets, but I\u2019ve always been more excited about mentoring people and helping them grow in the industry and become better versions of themselves even outside of the work they do at Anakle or anywhere else.\n\nIf our business no longer inspired the people who walked through its doors, then we have failed at our mission. So I get really excited when I see consistent growth in the people who walk through our doors; they come in, grow and become more than they thought they could be before they joined the company.\n\nWhat were Anakle\u2019s hiring values in the beginning? And did those values change after the business grew and garnered success?\n\nEditi: We were looking for people who had the \u2018Anakle spirit\u2019, which is a certain level of fearlessness. We wanted people who could work without fear. I didn\u2019t care too much about CVs and cover letters. We were looking for people who could challenge us; people who could look at the universe as it is and ultimately try to bend it. Because when people are able to challenge the status quo and say, \u201cI can take that on\u201d, then they can create a fire campaign for Sterling Bank or any other enterprise client.\n\nEditi Effiong\n\nHow did you delight Anakle\u2019s early employees?\n\nEditi: I\u2019ll be honest: Back then, we couldn\u2019t compete with Nigerian banks and their salary offerings and other benefits. so we ended up designing a workplace that was exciting. We wanted young people to feel excited about working for us and working out of our office. The Anakle office became our recruitment tool and it was so inspiring to hear people say they wanted to work with us, especially after visiting our office.\n\nNew beginnings: Anakle Films and the road to becoming a director, screenwriter, and producer\n\nKoromone: Moving swiftly along from building Anakle to setting up Anakle films\u2014\n\nEditi: Thank God!\n\nWhen did you know you were ready to make the move?\n\nEditi: Money! I had the money to make that leap of faith into Anakle Films.\n\nSo, how did it feel making that transition from running Anakle to leading the charge at Anakle films? Especially knowing that you were going to put a lot of time and effort into building out Anakle Films\u2019 brand?\n\nEditi: I think the biggest factor there is having a team that can do its job\u2014big props to Munachi. If you\u2019ve never heard of Muna, he\u2019s the best COO in the business. He\u2019s quiet but hard-working and has been with me for 11 years. Muna has done an amazing job at running the business at a group level, and having him around has been extremely helpful and instrumental. I recently received and turned down a global leadership position at a global company\u2014a fantastic offer with great pay\u2014but I turned it down because I wanted the freedom to wake up and do what I love doing or to not do something I hate doing. There\u2019s a madness to having that freedom that works for me. And I think I owe a lot of that to Muna. He gave me the courage to step out of Anakle.\n\nAn illustrated photo of Editi directing a film at a location in Nigeria\n\nTell us about your history and relationship with writing\n\nEditi: This isn\u2019t common knowledge, but I didn\u2019t start writing today. I\u2019ve been writing my entire life. I was also an avid reader when I was younger. My father studied literature and linguistics, so there were a lot of books around the house. I write almost every day and have written almost every day for my entire life. And when I cannot put into words things I want to say, I end up writing them down. I have hardly ever gotten in trouble for writing because I\u2019m able to articulate my thoughts without ambiguity. Wow! I just used a big word.\n\nMy move to Anakle Films is my way of preparing for retirement. I want to retire as a writer. My entire life is run by writing and this is the direction it is headed now. Anakle Films is my excuse to write; it gives me a reason to write, create and build something from the ground up. As you can imagine, there\u2019s a lot of craziness and madness around the work, but I love it.\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: Ambiguity is a situation or statement that is unclear because it can be understood in more than one way. [Source: Cambridge dictionary]\n\nEditi on documenting justice for #EndSars victims and survivors and finding his voice again\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: A few months after the #ENDSARS massacre, Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu set up a nine-person Judicial Panel of Inquiry to investigate allegations of police brutality perpetuated by the now-defunct Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) in Lagos State. This part of my conversation with Editi struck a raw nerve for the both of us, especially for Editi who had to restrain his emotions while he answered my questions. I think it takes a lot of courage to document the truth in the midst of pain and grief.\n\nKoromone: Let\u2019s pivot and talk about 2020. How did you find yourself involved in the #EndSARS Judicial Panel of Inquiry that sat in Lagos? A number of people don\u2019t know this, but you were shooting a film during that period.\n\nEditi: Yes, I was. When I couldn\u2019t attend sessions, I was on set. When I was a kid, I used to stutter. And, you know, I managed it through my teenage years until it went away. After October 2020, my stutter returned. I stutter a lot these days, especially when I\u2019m dealing with difficult situations. So if you pay attention when I speak, you will hear how slow and deliberate I am with my words. I speak slowly to avoid stuttering, and everytime I think about what went down during #EndSars, it messes up my speech.\n\nThe night of the shootings, I could hear the gunshots. And I was going to drive out there because our people were bleeding and needed help, but my wife said, \u201cNo, you cannot go. It is too dangerous.\u201d So, I didn\u2019t go, and that night, I couldn\u2019t speak at all. For hours, I could not say a word. Anytime I tried to say a word, something came up from inside me and blocked off my speech. And since then, I\u2019ve been managing a very bad stutter that comes and goes\u2014but mostly only comes when I\u2019m dealing with difficult subjects. And in the days following October 20, I felt nothing but numbness. Going to those panel sessions was kind of a metaphor for trying to find my voice again.\n\nFor a few weeks following the shootings, I couldn\u2019t speak properly, and writing about the sessions was my way of speaking and reconnecting with the voice I had lost.\n\nShare this article\n\nKoromone Koroye | Author",

          "title": "Who\u2019s afraid of crypto-salaries?",
          "text": "Like most Nigerian workers, Kola*, at his former job, used to be paid his salary in the country\u2019s official currency: the naira\u2014until he started working at a fintech company registered outside Nigeria. Now he gets paid in USD Coin (USDC), a Stablecoin tethered to the US dollar. With this switch in his salary\u2019s currency, Kola was offered a juicy opportunity to exit a quagmire many young Nigerians find themselves in: they make more money than their parents did but in a currency that has fallen so low their paycheck doesn\u2019t reflect in their purchasing power.\n\nNigeria, like many African countries, grapples with currency risk. Back in 2015, its current president, Muhammadu Buhari, campaigned on a promise to increase the value of the naira. But since the start of his presidency, the country\u2019s currency has plunged badly because demand for the dollar continues to outstrip supply. This plunge in the value of the naira has been majorly fueled by Nigeria importing more goods than it exports. With declining oil prices forcing the Nigerian government to devalue its official currency twice in the past year, and by roughly 35% over the past five years, the resultant inflation has thrown over 7 million people into poverty in 2020 alone, according to the World Bank.\n\nSince saving in naira is a dead plan, more Nigerians now save their earnings in foreign currencies. Data from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) revealed that Nigeria had a total domiciliary account balance of \u20a66.566 trillion as of March 2021, and when this figure is converted to dollars at the official rate of \u20a6410 per dollar, it translates to about $16 billion.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nVolatile naira drives Nigerians to digital currencies\n\nNigeria\u2019s weak currency has pushed its citizens into saving their money in foreign currencies, for wealth and value preservation. But even this is in limbo because uncertainties rule the country\u2019s financial regulatory climate. Nigeria\u2019s CBN has a long history of clamping down on individuals, groups and companies it suspects of being responsible for the slump in the value of the naira. Out of nowhere, the CBN banned the sale of foreign currencies to bureau de change operators\u2014also called the parallel or black market\u2014in the country, accusing them of creating an artificial foreign exchange scarcity. It also threatened to go after abokiFX, a website that collates the black market foreign exchange rates daily, asserting that there is only one acceptable exchange rate: the Investors\u2019 and Exporters\u2019 FX Window.\n\nThis has made a lot of people apprehensive, especially those with funds in their domiciliary accounts. Their fears were heightened after Ibrahim Obanikoro, a member of parliament, suggested in a tweet that the CBN close all domiciliary accounts for the next year.\n\nIn addition to saving in foreign currencies, Nigerians have turned to cryptocurrencies\u2014digital currencies that are out of the reach of federal government control.\n\nThis newfound hunger for cryptocurrency has seen Nigeria emerge as the leading country, per capita, for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency adoption in the world, according to a report by Statista\u2014despite government crackdown. In fact, the African continent has been the fastest adopter of cryptocurrency in the world. Chainalysis estimates that African countries collectively received around $105.6 billion worth of cryptocurrency between July 2020 and June 2021. For context, sub-Saharan Africa received an estimated $48 billion worth of remittances in 2019, about half of which went to Nigeria, according to a Brookings Institute study. Between July 2019 and June 2020, the volume of cryptocurrencies sent to Africa from outside the continent was the highest of all regions Chainalysis studied. With 96% of the crypto value coming from outside the continent, this suggests that more Africans are receiving remittances via crypto.\n\nDigital money is the future of finance\n\nIn February this year, the CBN placed a ban on cryptocurrency in the country when it directed banks to close the accounts of persons or entities involved in cryptocurrency transactions. At the time, the Nigerian apex bank claimed that cryptocurrencies and digital currencies were largely used in terrorism financing and money laundering, citing the anonymity of their transactions.\n\nBut months after that, the government, seeing it couldn\u2019t quench the fire of cryptocurrency in the country, bet on digital money as the future by launching a central bank digital currency (CBDCs) named eNaira and nicknamed \u201cProject Giant\u201d.\n\nDigital money like cryptocurrencies, CBDCs and Stablecoins will play a significant role in the future of financial services. Cryptocurrency is gaining worldwide acceptance; Stablecoin, a peculiar type of cryptocurrency, has been labelled the \u201cfuture of money\u201d by the Harvard Business Review; and all these are in direct competition with CBDCs.\n\nRest of World reported on how Stablecoins have found a use case in volatile markets like Nigeria, where CBN\u2019s regulations force Nigerians to spend limited amounts of US dollars via their dollar cards each month. In order to bypass this limitation, Nigerians have switched to using Stablecoins to make their payments.\n\nStablecoins, such as the Tether (USDT), Binance USD (BUSD) and USD Coin (USDC) are a form of cryptocurrency pegged to a traditional asset like the US dollar or gold. In sub-Saharan Africa, Stablecoin remittances can be up to 20 times cheaper than traditional money transfers. USDT and USDC transfer fees are often as low as 0\u20131%. Paxful, a leading cryptocurrency trading platform in the country, declares that 1.5 million Nigerian users, representing about 5% of the platform\u2019s trading volume, use USDT, the most popular Stablecoin.\n\nThere is a growing adoption of Stablecoins like $DAI, $USDT, $BUSD and $USDC in Nigeria. Unlike such cryptocurrencies as Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are notorious for their volatility, Stablecoin, like CBDCs, is a non-interest coin. Stablecoins have seen rapid growth this year, with USDC, the second-largest Stablecoin in the world, reaching a market capitalisation of over $30 billion.\n\nSalary alert\u2026but in crypto\n\nJust like Olaf Carlson-Wee, Coinbase\u2019s first employee who was paid entirely in Bitcoin, as far back as 2013, for three years, Nigerians also want to be paid in crypto.\n\nEarlier this year, in July, Timi Ajiboye, CEO and CTO of Helicarrier (formerly Buycoins), announced that the company\u2019s employees would now be paid in USDC. Twitter went agog, with many presenting themselves to Ajiboye for employment at his company.\n\nIn a process Kola describes as \u201cseamless\u201d when he receives his salary in USDC, he converts to naira only the amount he plans to spend for the week. \u201cI don\u2019t withdraw my full salary at once because you never know what the exchange rate will be tomorrow. So, even if waiting would add \u20a6500 to my salary, I\u2019d rather wait than withdraw all at once and have the naira in my account drop in value between when I withdraw it and when I spend it.\u201d\n\nKola says he can convert his crypto, using his company\u2019s product, a cryptocurrency trading app, within two hours. He is unbothered by persistent news around the steady drop of the naira. He isn\u2019t completely insulated from the naira crash, though, as a Nigerian living in Nigeria. But, he notes: \u201cAt least my salary\u2019s value isn\u2019t dropping as fast as it would have if I was earning in naira.\u201d\n\nA colleague of Kola\u2019s, Deji*, who receives his base pay and benefits in USDC as well, reveals that all employees were kept in the loop right from when the company decided that that was the route it would take regarding employee compensation. As a fintech company, there was no need to convince anyone on the team about how Stablecoins would protect them from the steady fall of the naira.\n\nThe problem with crypto-salaries\n\nAt Kola\u2019s company, individual contract staff, who make up a majority of its workers, are responsible for remitting their taxes. To help the employee with this process, an internal document containing information on tax and pension calculations and payments has been circulated around the company. This is the company battling the challenge that comes with paying employees in crypto, as legal barriers in many countries prevent this. Some of the barriers include the non-recognition of cryptocurrency as a legal tender and the challenge of calculating taxes when employees are paid in cryptocurrency.\n\nFor instance, it\u2019s still risky to pay employees in crypto in the US because the currency is recognised by the Inland Revenue Service (IRS) as a property and not a legal tender. A piece of legislation, the Fair Labour Standards Act\u2014a major custodian of employee rights\u2014backs this position. The act states that employees must be paid in \u201ccash or negotiable instrument payable at par\u201d.\n\nWhile legal systems around the world need more time to develop regulations that cater for crypto adoption, US-based Coinbase announced last week that it is launching a new direct deposit service, \u201cGet paid in crypto,\u201d that will let nearly anyone in the US receive all or part of their wages in cryptocurrencies. There are high hopes for the success of this rollout because if even a fraction of Coinbase\u2019s millions of US customers sign up, the service will contribute, in no small way, to making crypto mainstream in the broader American workforce.\n\nSome countries are already making progress with creating laws that define the payment of workers in cryptocurrency. For example, since 2019, New Zealand has made it legal to receive salaries in cryptocurrency and be taxed accordingly.\n\nBut in Nigeria, paying employees in crypto remains illegal. Nigeria\u2019s primary legislation on the relationship between an employer and employees, the Nigerian Labour Act\u2014established in 2004\u2014renders any contract where part or all of a worker\u2019s wages is made payable in another manner apart from legal tender illegal, null and void.\n\nDespite these legal constraints, Nigerian employers in technology startups continue to make smart moves to create value for their employees and the move towards remunerating employees in crypto is one that\u2019s unlikely to go away anytime soon.\n\n*Names have been changed.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nSultan Quadri | Author",

          "title": "I promise it\u2019s funnier in Swahili\u2026Kenyan Comedian Eddie Butita is Showing Netflix How Swahili\u2019s Done",
          "text": "For about a month now, Ubers branded with Netflix\u2019s logo have been zipping through Nairobi\u2019s streets. An Uber driver pulls up, blasting early-2000s hip-hop, ready to take on his next ride.\n\nWhen asked why his car is decked out in Netflix decals, he says that he and a group of other drivers were approached by a marketing company offering $90 to anyone willing to ride around the city with the Netflix promotion plastered on the side of their cars. \u201cEasy money,\u201d he says.\n\nStreaming Gets Serious\n\nNetflix is more serious than ever about capturing Kenyan viewers. Since September, Netflix has been offering freemium services and running targeted Twitter campaigns. But, in a move that displays a real willingness to solidify themselves in the hearts and minds of the East African nation\u2019s growing viewers, the streaming giant is now offering Swahili-language programming.\n\nTo roll out this project, the $25 billion company enlisted the help of celebrated Kenyan comic, Eddie Butita.\n\nOver a period of months, Butita translated and oversaw the dubbing for the Swahili language version of Wanda Sykes and Regina Y. Hicks\u2019 Netflix sitcom, The Upshaws.\n\nAt 28 years old, Butita has contributed to iconic series like Churchill Show and the work of other famous Kenyan comedians like Eric Omondi.\n\nBut it\u2019s clear that he was not approached by Netflix based on comedic talent alone. Butita is skilled at wielding digital technology in a market that\u2019s grown so big that Netflix can\u2019t ignore it.\n\nComedy Meets Digital Media\n\nComedy is big in Kenya, but digital media made it bigger.\n\nKenya\u2019s mobile penetration rate grew by 11% from 2020 to 2021 alone, making it one of the most connected countries in sub-Saharan Africa after Nigeria and South Africa. On top of higher-than-average mobile phone usage, the country is also home to some of the fastest mobile broadband speeds in Africa.\n\nMobile phone adoption in Kenya opened access to on-demand content via platforms like Youtube and Facebook. Before this, the nation\u2019s airwaves were more competitive than ever, forcing users to prioritise watch time.\n\n\u201c[It] has made it easier for people to access content anytime, anywhere. They don\u2019t have to be at home to watch certain TV shows. They can come back and watch. And if it\u2019s live, you can post it later,\u201d said Butita in an interview with TechCabal.\n\nThe flexibility viewers have to watch what they want when they want has the ability to extend the shelf life of content, opening the door for brand deals and collaborations for Kenyan comics\u2014an income stream that didn\u2019t always exist.\n\n\u201cPreviously you had to wait to perform or be featured in a movie. But now, you get a brand deal that gives you $10,000, $20,000 or $5,000 just to shoot content and do product placement,\u201d Butita said.\n\nBut Butita\u2019s collaboration with Netflix wasn\u2019t as simple as product placement. The process of translating and recording a dub from English to Swahili, for a US comedy show, was one that involved new levels of creativity and innovation, forcing Butita to ask himself \u201cSanifu or Sheng?\u201d\n\nLocalising Swahili\n\nSwahili is a regional language spoken throughout East Africa and it takes on different forms in each country.\n\nSanifu Swahili or \u201cproper Swahili\u201d is a term used to describe Swahili spoken in the standard form. Standard Swahili is spoken widely in Tanzania and on Kenya\u2019s coast, but in Nairobi, the language has taken on a new life. In the multicultural environment that is the Kenyan capital, a Swahili- and English-based slang called Sheng is spoken among the youth. The urban language has become popular enough for Butita to consider its use in his translations.\n\nBut Butita wanted to make sure that the comedy translated in his dubs could be felt by Swahili speakers across the world.\n\n\u201cI did some lines more than five or 10 times because you rewrite the sentence, it becomes funny, but now you feel like it\u2019s funny to just you because there\u2019s something you understand that other people might not understand. So you change the line. When you\u2019re recording again, you get a different feeling because of the cultural diversity that\u2019s there.\u201d\n\nROI on Local Content\n\nButita\u2019s dubbing and development of The Upshaws is nothing short of revolutionary, but one has to wonder if Netflix\u2019s Kenya-play will be the one that wins the game.\n\nAlthough Netflix is offering a free, limited mobile plan for Kenyan users in the short term, the viewer is still responsible for footing the data cost required to use the streaming service.\n\nMobile broadband speed in Kenya may be high, but the cost of data is high as well. According to the Worldwide Mobile Data Pricing (2021) report from Cable, a British technology research firm, Kenya takes the lead as the most expensive country for mobile data in East Africa. Viewing one hour of Netflix content on low resolution (480p) uses 300 MB of data per hour; in high resolution (1080p), Netflix uses 3 GB per hour. At an average cost of $1.05 per GB of data, Netflix viewers in Kenya stand to pay anywhere from $0.32 to $3.15 to watch a one-hour show.\n\nOn top of high data costs, Netflix will, in order to retain Kenyans\u2019 attention, eventually have to pivot to local content instead of dubs alone. The streaming giant has already done this with some success in South Africa, with shows like the teen drama, Blood and Water.\n\nBut in Kenya, content creation has been somewhat hampered by the low return on investment on original content due, in part, to the difficulty creators face finding fair-priced outlets to screen their content allowing them to recoup funds.\n\nGlobally Competitive Content\n\nMaybe this is where Netflix plans to make an intervention with streaming services. Netflix is a global platform that allows viewers to tap into content from any country at any time. The overnight success of the South Korean film, Squid Game, showed us just how successful well-made local content, that does not come from the West, can be. But, Korea\u2019s success in film and television has been hard-won through more than 40 years of carefully mobilized political and financial resources. It\u2019s paid off, in 2020 the nation\u2019s film industry was valued at around $884,229,150.\n\nIn markets like Kenya, where the culture of content creation is still growing, Netflix will have to spend more time and money developing local content that pops.\n\n\u201cIf we have platforms willing to purchase the content and make the returns be meaningful to creators, that means more content can come out and more people [can] get opportunities,\u201d Butita said.\n\nThere are signs that Netflix is already taking steps to make this happen. Netflix teamed up with UNESCO to fund six young creators in sub-Saharan Africa to develop six short films that reimagine folktales, set to be released in 2022.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nShare this article\n\nAlexandria Williams | Author @alexandriasahai",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, October 6, 2021, the BBC Insider Series hosted a few players in Africa\u2019s fintech sector during a panel discussion to discuss strides made by the sector to aid innovation and financial inclusion in Africa.\n\nModerated by BBC presenter, Zeinab Badawi, the panel had Olugbenga Agboola, founder and CEO of Flutterwave, Usoro Usoro, CEO, Y\u2019ello Digital Financial Services, MTN\u2019s fintech subsidiary, Bola Asiru, Principal/Divisional Lead, sub-Saharan Africa for Mastercard Advisors, and Yasmin Masithela, Managing Executive, Transactional Banking, Absa Corporate and Investment Banking.\n\nThe virtual event focused on fintech\u2019s allure to investors, the benefits Africans derive from fintech start-ups, partnerships between banks and fintech startups, and the role of regulators in the industry.\n\nDiscussing fintech\u2019s attractiveness to investors, the panelists were unanimous in their agreement that the scale of opportunity available to players in the fintech industry was a big factor in why investors are taken in by fintech.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the Mastercard Foundation, as of 2017, about 43% of people living in sub-Saharan Africa were financially included. This presents a huge opportunity for investors and entrepreneurs willing to look beyond the myriad of challenges that they are sure to face to build solutions.\n\nHowever, for Usoro, beyond the scale, the unserved segment of the market represents a huge opportunity as well. \u201cWhen we look at the market segment, you look at a lot of people that are unserved and when you look at the served segment, they\u2019re still lots of people that have not adopted the services. So it\u2019s both scale and the fact that a lot of people are still unserved that makes the market very attractive.\u201d\n\nWith the speed of innovation and execution exhibited by fintech, arguments have been made regarding fintech\u2019s potential to replace traditional banks. However, Agboola disagreed with that view, arguing that he sees a situation where fintech complement the works that banks do and vice versa, advocating for partnerships between banks and fintech.\n\nEven with the gains recorded, there is still a long way to go for fintech to plug the gaps in financial inclusion in Africa. For this Usoro argued that fintech in addition to providing a huge opportunity for investors also do good in the communities where they operate. \u201cIt\u2019s commercially attractive to investors but it also does some social good.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cWith the kind of services that we offer to customers, whether it\u2019s those micro-loans that enable SMEs to access inventory on daily basis, a lot of these services actually transform the lives of our customers.\u201d He added that with innovations in USSD technology and the adoption of agent banking networks, fintech are able to make it easier for most users to access financial services.\n\nDeepening financial inclusion is high on the agenda of Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank and Y\u2019ello Digital Financial Services has been playing its part in helping the apex realize this goal. With its wide network of over 150,000 MoMo agents, the organization offers financial services to customers.\n\nCustomers can pay bills, deposit and withdraw cash, as well as purchase data and airtime from agents. Through partnerships with over 40 banks and financial institutions in the country, customers can access funds in their accounts without using an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) in a secure manner.\n\nWith 54 countries in Africa, providing financial services to users comes with lots of regulatory hurdles in each country. However, startups need to build services for users regardless. Usoro stated that being able to build solutions that allow for these differences could fix these challenges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAt the technology and fintech level, the ability for us to build an interoperable switch to allow multi-currencies, multi-wallets, to speak to each other seamlessly may be one of the things we need to do to fix that hurdle.\u201d\n\nSome may argue that there are too many players in Africa\u2019s fintech sector but with the scale of the problem, there might be a need for more players to throw their hats in the ring to solve some of the problems.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn March 2020, as the coronavirus swept through cities and triggered lockdowns in many countries, Toyin Akintayo asked himself, \u201cWhat can give small businesses an edge against bigger ones?\u201d\n\nWhy small businesses? For Akintayo, the idea to work with Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) stems from his two decades of running small businesses.\n\nAlthough most of them failed, some succeeded. Currently, he runs Gift People, a delivery business, which, of course, uses his solution. As he laughingly tells Techpoint Africa, \u201cOf course you have to use your technology so that you know what the customers are feeling.\u201d\n\nSMEs account for 96% of businesses in Nigeria, providing 80% of the country\u2019s jobs. In the past five years, they\u2019ve contributed up to 50% of the country\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the ease of doing business is a challenge. As of 2019, Nigeria ranked 131 out of 190 on the World Bank\u2019s Ease of Doing Business Index, which is based on how conducive the regulatory environment is and stronger protection of property rights, among others.\n\nAkintayo says, \u201cIt\u2019s tough to do business in Nigeria. Every small business owner is struggling. Struggling in terms of capital, operations, and infrastructure. My experience and my engagement with quite a number of small business owners taught me this.\u201d\n\nAnd it was at this point that he arrived at his answer: digitising small businesses. The idea of BIZ301 was formed, and \u201cThat was how the journey began,\u201d he recalls.\n\nThe journey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIZ301 team at an event in Federal University of Technology Akure, Ondo State, Nigeria. Source: Supplied\n\nMost startup owners wax eloquently about how important a team is to the company. Beyond startups, a good team is always a recipe for success in any venture, and Akintayo began the journey by assembling his team.\n\n\u201cSo I began to look at the areas of operation of small businesses? At this point, I sat at the drawing table and tried to understand the exact structure of small businesses. So I put together my team and said, \u2018Guys, we need to figure out how we can help small businesses in every aspect of their operation.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe journey to the actual launch, however, involved months of iteration and careful planning. From March 2020 to March 2021, Akintayo and his team worked on what would become BIZ301.\n\nIn the days between March and May 2021, after launching the platform in Beta, the company says it onboarded its first 100 SMEs, a number Akintayo says has doubled since its full launch in June 2021.\n\n\u201cThis is simply through two methods: word of mouth and referrals from existing customers.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA strategy that he reveals is deliberate.\n\nBut what does BIZ301 do?\n\nA suite of operations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIZ301 applications\n\nTo explain how BIZ301 works, Akintayo uses the example of one of its customers.\n\n\u201cFor instance, we have a customer who just delivers bread. He used to use manual invoices, but it was beginning to give him headaches. So we introduced BIZ301 to him.\n\n\u201cNow, when he gets to a customer, he issues them an e-invoice, and it records online. So when they make payments, it automatically updates, and reconciliation is made easy for him.\u201d\n\nWith a staff strength of three people \u2014 owner, driver, and marketer \u2014 Akintayo says he generates over 1,000 invoices monthly from over 30 supermarkets.\n\nBut beyond issuing e-invoices, the company offers a suite of operations. The platform currently has six applications that cut across four aspects of a business: sales, operations, human resources, and marketing.\n\nUsers can now access the finance, invoices, employee and payroll management, expense and budgeting management, helpdesk, and facility management applications. With the employee and payroll function, the business owner automates the salary payment process.\n\nIf a business offers after-sales support, the helpdesk application would be beneficial. To explain this, Akintayo explains this using another customer example.\n\n\u201cSo, this company has multiple outlets, and they have issues reported from those locations daily. So what they did was, rather than the WhatsApp messages they were using, they signed up on our platform and used the helpdesk application.\n\n\u201cWhat that does is, all the reports from the different outlets come to a central point at the head office. So once they log in, they can see what the Abule Egba branch is complaining about. They need this and this; same goes for other branches.\u201d\n\nUnlike WhatsApp, which would require a lot of scrolling, all the user has to do is filter by date or keyword. And there are no limits to the number of inquiries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIZ301 website\n\nWhile all applications can be used as standalones, they can also be interwoven. Using the bread supplier as an example once again, Akintayo says,\n\n\u201cIf his business grows in another six months or another one year, and the number of staff increases, we will introduce our employee and payroll management to him.\u201d\n\nThe idea is to help business owners piece together the fragmented aspects of their business on one platform.\n\nAkintayo says the company caters for all aspects of the business. So, instead of using three or four different apps, all the user does is sign in on one platform where they can easily see everything going on in the business at once.\n\nAnd with the ability to onboard employees, this eliminates the issue of calling in to get reports, reducing time wasted and possible errors.\n\nThe first user licence is free for life. So a sole-practitioner can sign on to use the service without paying but would have to pay to onboard subsequent users.\n\n\u201cAs your business grows, we want to grow with you.\u201d\n\nThe business owner pays \u20a61,000 per user every month for other user licences, so it works as a subscription model.\n\nBut how is BIZ301 funded?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company is currently completely self-funded. But the idea is to bootstrap the startup for as long as possible, and Akintayo explains why.\n\n\u201cWe want to offer a competitive price. We see Zoho as our biggest competitor because they are also looking at the market now, as the African market is ripe. It\u2019s going to be very tough to be competitive if we get external funding.\n\nTo keep prices low, Akintayo says the company has \u201cgone back to school,\u201d employing mostly university students \u2014 70% of BIZ301\u2019s workforce.\n\n\u201cThe moment we collect investors\u2019 money, we will be under pressure to jack up our prices and deliver value. So we want to be self-funded.\u201d\n\nTo better understand, Techpoint asked if BIZ301 would be open to funding if he finds an investor with the same values. In response, Akintayo said that it would still be a hard sell, citing experiences of friends who accepted investor money and began to face pressure.\n\nPressing further, we asked if this would still hold true in, say, two, three years, and he said, \u201cLet\u2019s look at it case by case. In two, three years, we can evaluate the situation again. There are some core principles it must not affect, like pricing and the value we offer. As I speak, we want to remain the way we are.\u201d\n\nAccording to Akintayo, the idea is to help businesses grow while easing business costs.\n\n\u201cThe guy is already spending a lot, paying for the shop, bringing in products, and paying the staff. We are not going to place a huge burden by also saying, \u2018Okay, pay this amount of money for the software that would help you integrate every aspect of your business to one platform.\u2019\u201d\n\nA not for profit?\n\nWhile the goal is altruistic, BIZ301 is still a profit-seeking venture. Apart from the subscription-based model of user licences, the company earns a commission on transactions.\n\nFor example, when a user issues an invoice and gets paid, the company takes a commission \u2014 \u20a6100 \u2014 of the amount. So even on a free user licence, a business owner still pays some money. A freemium model, so to speak.\n\nUsing the payroll application as another example, the company collects a payroll administration fee. This means that, for every employee salary paid through the platform, BIZ301 gets \u20a6150. So if you have three employees, the startup earns \u20a6450.\n\nAs long as the small business owner is making money, BIZ301 makes money too, free user licence or not.\n\nPresent challenges; future conquests\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource; Supplies\n\nWith a team of seven, Akintayo says the biggest challenge currently is slow onboarding due to a lack of technical know-how.\n\n\u201cPeople are not as tech-savvy as we think. A lot of these people are not our peers and may not understand how to use this application. I don\u2019t want people just signing up, and they are not using it. I want to onboard people and show them how to integrate different parts of their operation.\u201d\n\nA challenge that he says he is willing to take on and hopes the work being put in now would translate into more revenue in the long run.\n\n\u201cOrganic growth is critical at this stage we are in, so we are using word of mouth and referrals deliberately rather than doing a lot of publicity and advertising, and we are okay with it.\u201d\n\nCurrently, he has a short-term plan, which he hopes to execute in 36 months.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve earmarked about eight cities in Nigeria that are critical for us. People are signing up, but we need someone on the ground who will provide that hand-holding, and we are looking at the next six months.\u201d\n\nAn ambitious project, to be sure. The eight cities are Port Harcourt, Kaduna, Ibadan, Kano, Abuja, Awka, Ilorin, and its current base, Lagos.\n\nOver the next 36 months, he hopes to be in 10 African countries and says groundwork is already being done in three of them. An endeavour Akintayo believes is doable based on previous successes.\n\nAnd although he says the business management space in Africa is nascent, he welcomes more players. Still, he decries the challenges of inconsistent tech policies, which he calls reactive rather than proactive.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay to look at what has been done in more developed climes. Sit down and ask yourself, \u2018What can we adapt, what changes can we make to get this to work?\u2019 The government needs to create idea-enabling policies, so the tech space grows.\u201d\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScrolling through Twitter a few days ago, something caught my eye. It started a chain of reactions culminating in a midnight call and a new story idea for this month\u2019s Privacy Roundtable.\n\nOn Friday, October 15, 2021, we sent out a tweet asking readers to fill a form for a story on why they do not care about privacy. As you might have already guessed, today\u2019s article has gone off on a tangent. And for this, I apologise to everyone. We will talk about it in next month\u2019s edition.\n\nWhile you are here, please populate the form with your answers.\n\nFor today\u2019s story, our focus would be on data privacy rights and possible exceptions. I paint a picture in the following paragraphs that guides this article\u2019s narrative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAda is a 24-year-old graduate with a theatre arts degree. If there\u2019s one thing she loves, it\u2019s talking to her friends on the phone. She could spend the whole day doing that. Perhaps, that\u2019s why she\u2019s unemployed.\n\nA few days ago, she saw a trending post on Twitter about this new fintech app that allows you to send money as airtime to anyone with a tag. Expectedly, she jumped on the train because she always needs airtime since she spends all day talking on the phone.\n\nLike most of us, without reading the terms and conditions or the company\u2019s privacy policy, Ada downloads and installs the app and chooses the tag \u2018adda\u2019. Of course, she immediately sends this to her friends and asks them to download the app so they can send her airtime anytime.\n\nToday, though, Ada has a problem. While trying to send her airtime, her friend mistakenly sent it to a user with a similar but slightly different tag; this user has an underscore (_) at the end of theirs.\n\nAda is distraught and decides she wants to change her tag to something unique but still identifiable by her friends. She goes on the app and tries to change her tag but is told she cannot. Now, she\u2019s angry. Why can\u2019t she change her tag? It\u2019s hers, after all.\n\nThe issues\n\nUnder the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation 2019, a data subject has several rights over the use of their personal data. These include the right to transparent information relating to the processing of data and prior information before data processing.\n\nIt also includes the right to erasure, rectification and restriction of data, and the right to move your data to another platform, among several others.\n\nAda has the right to know extensively how her personal information is being handled and when it is handled. She can also choose to delete, correct, or restrict access to that data. If she wishes to move her personal information on that particular app to another with similar functions, she can do that too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it\u2019s not as cut and dried as this, and this brings me to the idea behind this story.\n\nWhat\u2019s the big idea?\n\nA Twitter thread caught my eye two days ago; it went something like this,\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t change your Abeg tag or your name on the Abeg App. You can\u2019t also delete your account on the app.\n\n\u201cThis is in breach of the Nigerian Data Protection Regulations which protects the right of a data subject to rectification and erasure of their personal data.\u201d\n\nYou can't change your Abeg tag or your name on the Abeg App. You can't also delete your account on the app.\n\n\n\nThis is in breach of the Nigerian Data Protection Regulations which protects the right of a data subject to rectification and erasure of their personal data. \u2014 Equivocator (@Oluwanonso_Esq) October 18, 2021\n\nThis Twitter user, a lawyer with the handle, @Oluwanonso_Esq, then proceeded to share a screenshot of the conversation between him and an Abeg Customer Service Agent, L\u00f9, on the startup\u2019s Instagram account.\n\nL\u00f9 told him that he could not change his Abeg tag.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of the conversation between @Oluwanonso_Esq and L\u00f9\n\nTwo questions come to mind. Is this usual with fintechs? Is there truly a problem here?\n\nIs this an isolated incident?\n\nI currently have several fintech apps on my phone. So, I decided to do a little investigation using the ones I could access.\n\nUsing Roqqu, Cowrywise, Risevest, Piggyvest, Accrue, and Barter as case studies, I tried to find answers.\n\nOn Roqqu, I found that I could not change the name associated with my account.\n\nCowrywise allows you to change your name and unique tag.\n\nRisevest and Piggyvest require you to send their support team an email.\n\nBarter does not allow you to change your name, but you can change your handle.\n\nIs there really a problem?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto credit: Iwaria\n\nTo better understand if this was indeed a problem, I spoke with Nigerian lawyer, Motunrayo Ope-Ogunseitan, to get a general idea of possible defences in a similar scenario.\n\nShe said there might be different reasons why a company would not allow an individual to change their data on its platform. The first is what she called the \u201cStartup Syndrome.\u201d This means the company is probably not paying attention to complying with the NDPR and is basically trying to get going as soon as possible.\n\nThe other reason she gave was that there might be a legitimate defence to such an action. Why? All laws have exceptions. A good example is the right to freedom of movement as contained in the Nigerian Constitution and the abrogation of that right in a state of emergency or when a crime is committed.\n\n\u201cMy best bet would probably be that such companies would say, \u2018Oh, we cannot allow you to frequently go on the app and delete your personal data or amend it because it may compromise the interests of other people.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut she also said this defence would need to be looked at on a case by case basis as all companies might not be able to rely on the same defence.\n\n\u201cThe idea of the startup app might be philanthropic, to give or provide for people who are in need. So imagine a situation where I get some money, I change my profile details, and I enter another giveaway and keep amassing a lot of money when the money is actually supposed to reach as many people as possible.\n\n\u201cOr a scenario where someone credits my verified account with a huge sum of money to assist with sharing it and I just delete my account or deactivate and go offline. Given the nature of the app, considering the fact that it\u2019s largely a financial platform, you shouldn\u2019t just allow people to modify their data. There\u2019s a higher standard of care involved.\u201d\n\nBut she advised companies to communicate these decisions to users.\n\nAnother thing she referred to is the golden rule of interpretation in law. This rule states that a law could be interpreted to show the spirit or the intent of the law rather than a literal interpretation.\n\n\u201cIn as much as it provides for these rights, they don\u2019t necessarily tell the companies how to achieve it. The laws don\u2019t say the right to rectification of data by the data subject must be done on the platform by the individual, or it must be achieved immediately.\n\n\u201cAs a platform provider, I can say, \u2018Oh yes, you have a right, but you just can\u2019t do it yourself and randomly.\u2019 And that\u2019s why a lot of companies just say, \u2018You have a right to delete your data, amend your data.

          "text": "As the global economy shifts, businesses will need to be aware of the changing trends in order to meet the challenges ahead.\n\nDuring the ThinkBusiness conference, Ogho Okiti, an economist and managing director, BusinessDay Media, identified five factors driving business shifts in the world today.\n\nAccording to Okoti, the first is competition. He noted that competition drives innovation as companies are finding new ways and methods to compete. Global players such as Gilt, Charles, Tyrwhit and Next, are now selling their products to the Nigerian consumers directly, he noted.\n\n\u201cThis means Nigerian businesses do not only have competitors in the country to contend with but also global competitors,\u201d he said.\n\nThe competition for education and skills and its uses are changing rapidly, as an increasing number of people such as content writers, programmers and even dissertation writers are working here in Nigeria but getting paid in US dollars.\n\nSecondly, he identified economic crisis as another factor that drives business shifts. Some top companies in the world today were founded during crisis.\n\nRead Also: Global economy rattled by surging covid cases as firms delay workers return\n\nFor instance, multibillion-dollar business, Airbnb, was founded in 2008, when the founders Joe Gebbia and Brian Chesky launched a simple online platform to rent out an air mattress. When the Great Recession hit later that same year, suddenly the need for short-term, low-commitment living quarters exploded exponentially. The site grew to over 10,000 users and 2,500 listings by March 2009.\n\nOther companies that rose during the crisis include Uber (2009), Disney (1929), Apple (1976), IBM (1911) and Zoom (2011).\n\nThirdly, he pointed out that government policies also drive business shifts.\n\nThe government can change the way businesses work and influence the economy, either by passing laws or by changing its own spending or taxes.\n\nFurthermore, technology is a crucial driver of business shifts, he said, saying, \u201cBusiness owners should not consider any business model without considering the impact of data and technology.\u201d\n\nFinally, climate change and the pressure to reduce carbon emission are driving shifts in the business world.\n\n\u201cThere is pressure from activists and developmental organisations for governments and companies to reduce carbon emission, and this has led to many businesses changing their models,\u201d he said.\n\nCompanies like TotalEnergies, driven by developmental strategy to play a leading role in the global energy mix, are beginning to transition to cleaner energy sources. TotalEnergies spends about $2-$3 billion each year investing in electricity and renewables.\n\nSeplat, an indigenous energy firm, also has changed its name from Seplat Petroleum Development Company plc to Seplat Energy plc as it begins its transition into a full energy solutions company.\n\nThere is also a shift towards electric automobiles. In 2020, there were over 10 million electric cars on the road, a 43 percent increase compared with 2019. Electric vehicles represent about 2 percent of total global vehicle sales in 2021 so far, but it has been projected that it would be about 24 percent of total sales by 2030.\n\nImportantly, the COVID-19 pandemic and changing consumer preference also influence business shifts, he explained. The taxi and hotel industry, the music industry, and the media have changed fundamentally due to the shift in consumer choices.",

          "text": "The Nigerian economy will create more wealth for its 200 million people by changing its approach to trade and focusing more on exports, according to Ogho Okiti, a doctoral degree holder in Economics from the University of Manchester, U.K and Managing Director of BusinessDay Media.\n\nAccording to Okiti, rather than focus solely on producing to meet local demand, the government should incentivise local businesses to serve the international community in order to earn much-needed foreign exchange and trigger wealth creation.\n\n\u201cIf we got 10 companies in Nigeria and asked them to produce for the international community, it would translate to higher foreign exchange earnings for Nigeria and create more wealth locally,\u201d Okiti said.\n\nOkiti questioned Nigeria\u2019s obsession with producing for home when wealthy nations in Europe and Asia are concerned about what they can produce for others.\n\n\u201cCountries don\u2019t prosper because they feed themselves, they prosper because they exchange,\u201d Okiti, who was speaking at the Think Business conference, said.\n\nNigeria is home to the world\u2019s largest number of poor people, with 87 million people according to a Brookings Institution report, the populations of Spain and Canada combined.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari is keen to grow the economy and create wealth for the vast majority of Nigerians through agriculture after many years of oil dependence. Buhari\u2019s agriculture policy thrust is centred around the country feeding itself when the actual focus should be more on producing to feed the outside world.\n\nRead Also: How Nigeria exports wealth, jobs through its raw materials\n\nCritics say Buhari has a penchant for running a closed economy that does not prioritise trading with the outside. In 2019, he shut the land borders for nearly two years to curb smuggling even when it was hurting exporters.\n\n\u201cPolicies that make an economy open to trade and investment with the rest of the world are needed for sustained economic growth,\u201d IMF economists said in a report as far back as 2011.\n\n\u201cThe evidence on this is clear. No country in recent decades has achieved economic success, in terms of substantial increases in living standards for its people, without being open to the rest of the world,\u201d the IMF said.\n\nNigeria needs to boost economic growth and improve living standards now more than ever. Average incomes have contracted every year since 2015, according to data by the government data agency, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).\n\nWhile global incomes have tripled since 1960, Nigeria\u2019s average income has only grown by 0.5 percent, according to Okiti, a reflection of the poor living standards in the country.\n\nIn the last five years alone, the economy has contracted twice, 2016 and 2020. The first contraction was caused by a sharp decline in oil prices, while the second was induced by the COVID-19 pandemic which yet again caused a sharp dip in oil prices.\n\nThe IMF and Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) see the Nigerian economy recovering next year on the back of higher oil prices and improved production, however that recovery is tipped to fizzle out by 2025 as oil prices begin to cool.\n\nOkiti said the pre-pandemic condition of Nigeria already means it will be difficult for the country to see sustained recovery without addressing underlying issues from rising poverty to escalating debt levels and high unemployment.",

It is important for me to mention that we set up a panel after the protest last year. And as you all are aware, the panel has concluded its sitting about three days ago and they have asked for time to put their report together.\n\n\u201cAnd we have granted them that request. We do not idea of what the outcome of that report would be but we must say here publicly that we will make the report known to everyone, We are not going to cover anything. That is not who were and what our government stands for as well as what we belief government is all about. We will make full disclosure of the report including recommendations and others. I want to assure you all that we will not leave anything to chance on it.\n\n\u201cWe saw some protests in Lagos yesterday and some people were arrested. But I want to tell you here that all those that were apprehended by the law enforcement agency have been released except for one person that was caught with dangerous weapons. And he indeed confirmed to the Nigerian Police that he was at the scene to cause mayhem\u201d, he added.\n\nEarlier, the Radical Agenda Movement of the Nigerian bar Association (NBA) has through a statement made available to newsmen, narrated how the protesters regain freedom and return to their various homes.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cIndeed struggle pays as CP HAKEEM ODUMOSU, the Commissioner of Police of Lagos State bowed to pressure and released 33 peaceful protesters arrested at the Lekki Toll Gate. The \u201cLekki 33\u201d , as additional 7 persons were brought from Onikan to join the Panti 26 , were eventually released by 12pm midnight, 20th October, 2021.\n\n\u201cAll appreciation to esteemed comrades and well wishers who mounted pressure on the Commissioner of Police\u201d, it added.\n\n...",

To this end, over 45,000 hectares have been allocated to six (6) oil palm investors under the ESOPP initiative.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Edo State Government in its bid to generate employment for the teeming youth population and create wealth through agricultural activities put in place an agricultural entrepreneurship development initiative called the Edo State Agripreneur Programme. The main objective of the programme is to promote sustainable livelihoods in agriculture that will create at least 30,000 jobs in crops, livestock and catfish value chains.\n\n\u201cThis year, a total of 444 hectares have been cultivated for rice grain production at Agenebode, Warraproductionke and Agbede.

          "text": "The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Screening Committee has disqualified three aspirants from participating in the national convention slated for October 30 and 31.\n\nThe Chairman of the Convention Committee, Governor Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa State, disclosed this during the unveiling of the party\u2019s national convention logo and promotional materials on Thursday in Abuja.\n\nThe committee was headed by a former Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mohammed Adoke.\n\nMr Fintiri said the committee set up to screen the aspirants had completed its work and submitted its report to the organising committee on Thursday afternoon.\n\nHe noted that 31 candidates indicated interests for various national positions in the party, out of which 27 were cleared, one withdrawn and three disqualified.\n\nHe listed the disqualified aspirants as Wale Oladipo, Okey Muo-Aroh and Eddy Olafeso.\n\nMr Oladipo was vying for the position of deputy national chairman (south), while Messrs Muo-Aroh and Olafeso were eyeing the positions of national secretary and national publicity secretary, respectively.\n\n\u201cAll these aspirants have been disqualified because they took the party to court. Their intention also was to stop the national convention.\n\n\u201cSo, if you have taken the party to court without exhausting the internal mechanism of settling whatever grievances you have and you try to stop the convention.\n\n\u201cThe committee felt you cannot also enjoy the convention.\n\n\u201cMore so, the provision of Section 51 sub 1L in our party constitution clearly spells out that you must exhaust all the internal mechanisms in the party.\n\n\u201cThe same constitution of our great party has also made a provision that if you have not exhausted Section 58 (1L), you can be punished under Section 59 (1e). So, you can see that the screening committee has done what is needful of them.\n\n\u201cYou must be disciplined in the party for us to survive. I think we have to move away from the past as we are trying to open a new chapter for the party,\u201d Mr Fintiri said.\n\nHe said that if any of the disqualified aspirants had reason not to agree with their disqualification, they had the opportunity to appear before the appeal committee on Friday.\n\nMr Fintiri said such a person might be considered depending on the reason they may put forward.\n\nHe said the committee had done a great job as it paved the way for PDP to move forward.\n\n\u201cI assure you that on October 30 and 31, we will have one of the best open, transparent, and democratic conventions in the recent history of this country,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the number of delegates, Mr Fintiri said that about 4,000 delegates were being expected. He said even though there were litigations surrounding the list, efforts were on to clear it.\n\nHe stressed the need for the party to bring out its best at the convention to steer the affairs of PDP with their skills, experience and integrity.\n\n\u201cWe need to bring people of high integrity to manage the affairs of the party and to pilot us to winning the 2023 general elections, particularly the president,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Fintiri appealed to members of the committee to make the necessary sacrifice that would ensure success of the convention.\n\nIn his remarks, the PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said the 2021 national convention committee led by Mr Fintiri was prepared to hold a convention that would lead PDP to victory in the 2023 general elections.\n\nMr Ologbondiyan, who is also the Secretary of the National Convention Publicity Sub-Committee, said the national convention of PDP presents an opportunity to Nigerians to come together and support the party in 2023.\n\n(NAN)",

          "text": "BY EMEKA EJERE\n\nThe Managing Director, Intra-African Trade Initiative, Afreximbank, Mrs. Kanayo Awani, has urged Nigerian business owners to be encouraged to attend the forthcoming Intra-African Trade Fair (IATF2021) in Durban by focusing on the opportunities and the benefits it offers.\n\nKanayo, who spoke on the sideline of Nigeria Roadshow preparatory to the event in Lagos, argued that it does not make any business sense to be discouraged by the perceived cost implication of participating in the trade fair as the cost of not attending will be huge.\n\nThe trade fair is one of the initiatives that the Intra-African Trade is working on.\n\nOrganised by the African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank), in collaboration with the African Union and AfCFTA Secretariat, the 2nd Intra- African Trade Fair (IATF 2021), will be hosted by the Government of the Republic of South Africa in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal, from 15 to 21 November 2021.\n\nThe first edition was held in Cairo, Egypt in 2018.\n\nThe trade fair, Kanayo said, is not an end in itself but a means to an end.\n\nShe said: \u201cYou\u2019re not just coming there. You\u2019re supposed to come there and exchange ideas, exchange information \u2013 trade and market information. It is an opportunity to connect buyers and sellers, investors to the investment opportunities.\n\n\u201cIn fact, in the times of recession, you should be heading for a trade fair to be able to stimulate your businesses.\n\nWe think that even in a post-COVID era, the trade fair will stimulates Africa\u2019s economic development in a sense, given the events of the past two years.\n\n\u201cYou did hear in one of the presentations made by the Secretary General of the AfCFTA, who said that while in most parts of the world, people are doling out bailout, money as stimulus package, our own stimulus package in Africa is the AfCFTA. AfCFTA is about growing the traffic in trade; it\u2019s about industrialization. And this is one of the platforms that we need to grow the traffic in trade.\n\n\u201cRemember, it\u2019s not just people exhibiting their goods, we\u2019re also supporting their hosting buyers. What that means is that you can\u2019t be an exhibitor and a sale of goods. We will be able to match-make you to potential buyers. That\u2019s why we also talk about the B to Bs and the B to Gs, so you can make business connections.\n\nSharing some success stories of the trade fair, she said:\n\n\u201cThe $32 billion deals that we announced we closed in 2018 were the deals of buyers and sellers making these deals. I saw a Nigerian custard maker who has contract now in Kenya, in Ivory Coast.\n\n\u201cThere is also a Nigerian youth, his name is Ndubuisi Eze, he\u2019s one of the success stories of that trade fair. He was involved in the area of Robotics. Soon after the trade fair he was acquired by the Singapore Government and he\u2019s now doing drones for agriculture in Singapore.\n\n\u201cSo the platform is an opportunity. I think Nigerians should take advantage of it, because the cost of not attending will be huge.\u201d",

This rebound is most welcome and largely results from a sharp improvement in global trade and commodity prices. Favorable harvests have also helped lift agricultural production.\n\n\u201cBut the recovery is expected to be slower than in advanced economies, leading to a widening rift in incomes. This divergence is expected to persist through the medium term\u2014partly reflecting different access to vaccines, but also stark differences in the availability of policy support.\n\n\u201cThe outlook remains extremely uncertain, and risks are tilted to the downside. In particular, the recovery depends on the path of the global pandemic and the\n\nregional vaccination effort, and is also vulnerable to disruptions in global activity and financial markets.\u201d",

          "text": "The Lagos State Government on Thursday disclosed that it has trained over 30,000 public servants since the beginning of this year.\n\nCommissioner for Establishments, Training and Pensions, Mrs. Ajibola Ponnle disclosed this during a strategic meeting with the management staff of the ministry.\n\nShe said the number of those trained cuts across grade level, cadre, gender and Agency of assignment.\n\nPonnle revealed that about 28,000 public servants have benefitted from online courses while 2,500 have had physical (face-to-face) training, stating that the figure excludes those involved in micro learning Webinar series.\n\nShe declaring that the figure was unprecedented and marked a watershed in the training administration in Lagos State, adding that it represented a dramatic shift from the previous arrangement where only 3,000 public servants were trained in four years.\n\nThe commissioner asserted that the introduction of the Learning Management System, which has a variety of learning contents with over 4,000 free, self-enrollment courses and 8,000 courses from the LinkedIn Learning Library, has brought remarkable changes in the training climate in Lagos.\n\nShe pointed out that the intention was to drive radical change in the public sector to address capacity deficit, enhance efficiency and competence among civil servants.\n\n\u201cOne significant aspect of this programme is that it has made it possible to practically phase out low training quota in the State\u2019s civil service which used to be 3,000 staff in four years prior to this administration. For us, it is really a game changer, and I think the beauty of the process is also that we are able to mandate public servants to do certain courses,\u201d she said.\n\nPonnle said the figures could be higher because some MDAs compelled their staff to undergo certain courses making reference to the Ministry of Science and Technology which since the middle of the year mandated 25 courses for their technical and non-technical staff.\n\nShe maintained that training programmes transcended the entire spectrum and hierarchy of the State Service, disclosing that some of those who have not benefitted from previous trainings have been nominated already.\n\nThe Commissioner hinted that the state government was changing the style of training to workshop/experiential learning session in the next phase of training.\n\nThe objective of that change, according to her, was to ensure that the participants really understand the key objectives of the training and were able to practicalise it immediately in their various ministries and agencies.\n\n\u201cSo the workshop style approach is basically to ensure that trainees are able to apply concepts learn at workshop in their MDAs\u201d. She cited a workshop on writing job descriptions, where at the end of the program participants had to go back to their MDAs and develop Job Description for the core jobs there,\u201d she said.",

It should also be noted that, these 10 athletes were not banned from participating in the Olympics but were ineligible to compete due to their missing the mandatory out-of-competition tests at the appropriate times,\u201d Dare said.\n\nOn the allowances of D\u2019Tigress, it was through the adopt-an-athlete initiative of the Minister that the sum of Two Hundred and Thirty Thousand Dollars($230,000) was raised from a group of Banks for the D\u2019Tigress and D\u2019Tigers. This money came in during the Olympics and was deposited into the NBBF\u2019s CBN account.\n\nAccording to the Minister, \u201cWe issued a statement regarding the $230,000 and on return from Olympics the players of both teams were asked to submit their account details so the CBN could process the payment at once, as we speak, we have only details of the female team; D\u2019Tigress and none of D\u2019Tigers obliged to this.\n\n\u201cPrior to now, the CBN have been instructed to process payment of the 12 female team members as first trench payment.\n\n\u201cThe process for the payment for D\u2019Tigress is in place and near completion, the money is intact in the CBN account as CBN has provided statement of account to prove that the $230,000 NBBF fund was not misappropriated.\u201d\n\nAccording to one of the members of the Committee, Honourable Dachung Musa, representing Jos South/Jos East Federal consistency, \u201cWe are satisfied now that you have provided the right information, especially the fact that our athletes were not banned or found guilty of taking illegal substances. I will dare to say, information is key in portraying the good image of our dear country.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Around 10:30 in the morning, they reached their final destination \u2013 the Federal Government College, Birnin-Yauri.\u201d",

          "text": "The Executive Committee of Nigeria Football Federation has approved the re-instatement of Coach Salisu Yusuf to his position as Assistant Coach of the Super Eagles and Head Coach of the Super Eagles B team, with effect from 1st November 2021.\n\nGeneral Secretary of the NFF, Dr Mohammed Sanusi, disclosed on Thursday that the re-instatement of the former Kano Pillars, Enyimba FC and Rangers International FC gaffer by the NFF Board was on the recommendation of the NFF Technical Department.\n\nHighly respected for his match\u2013reading ability, calm demeanour and proficiency in talent discovery and development, Yusuf, in his playing days featured for Rancher Bees of Kaduna and El-Kanemi Warriors of Maiduguri, among others.\n\nYusuf\u2019s return to the three-time African champions coincides with the closing stages of the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 qualifying second round phase and the commencement of preparations for the 33rd Africa Cup of Nations finals taking place in Cameroon early next year.\n\nCaptain Asisat Oshoala has promised that the Super Falcons will put up a better show when they confront their Ghanaian counterparts at the Accra Sports Stadium on Sunday, in the second leg of their 12th Women AFCON qualifying fixture.\n\nA brace from Sweden \u2013based Uchenna Kanu gave Nigeria a 2-0 lead from the first leg played at the Mobolaji Johnson Arena on Wednesday, but the Super Falcons realize it is not over yet against one of the fiercest rivals of Nigeria in African football. Wednesday\u2019s game happened on the 70th year anniversary of the football rivalry between both West African giants.\n\n\u201cWe know that the Black Queens are strong and determined when playing at home. Now, we have to up our game and play like we did not win this first leg. We have to go all out and attack better than we did here. Qualification for the AWCON is non-negotiable,\u201d Oshoala said as the squad met with President of Nigeria Football Federation, Mr Amaju Melvin Pinnick and the General Secretary, Dr Mohammed Sanusi after Wednesday\u2019s encounter.\n\nA record number of 44 entries for the preliminaries means that after the fixture with Ghana, the nine-time champions still have another round to prosecute before being eligible to feature in the finals in Morocco, which will also determine Africa\u2019s representatives at the 32-team FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup finals in Australia and New Zealand in 2023.\n\nThat next round could well be against Lady Elephants of Cote d\u2019Ivoire, who mauled their counterparts from Niger Republic 9-0 in their own first leg encounter on Wednesday. The final round of qualifiers comes up in February next year.\n\nThe Confederation of African Football has appointed Ivorian officials to superintend Sunday\u2019s clash in Accra between Nigeria and Ghana. Zomadre Sonia Kore will be the referee, with her compatriots Denise Akoua (assistant referee 1) and Ndeko Edwige Appia (assistant referee 2) also in action. Beatrice Gouchoedou from Benin Republic will be fourth official and Latr\u00e9-Kayi Lawson-Hogban from Togo will serve as match commissioner.",

Over the past 100 years, the CPC has united and led the Chinese people through tenacious struggle to achieve great success in the new-democratic revolution, to achieve great success in reform, opening up, and socialist modernization.\u201c\n\nPertaining the hot phenomena related to China, such as the economic miracle, the tremendous transformation of society, as well as great achievement in containing COVID-19 pandemic which is still devastating other parts of the world, and so on, all of them could find answers from the study on the governing experience of the CPC.\u201d\n\nHe said the success of CPC hinges on 6L- Love, Liberate, Learn, Lead, Listen and Live, noting that \u201cChina has realized the first centenary goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects. Nowadays, the CPC is rallying and leading the Chinese people on a new journey toward realizing the second centenary goal of building China into a great modern socialist country in all respects. This would undoubtedly insert strong boost to the cooperation and friendship between our two countries in all-round manner.\u201d\n\nJianchun while stating that Nigeria and China share a lot in common as they are friends, brothers and partners in the common pursuit of national development and social prosperousness, said: \u201cYou have something to learn from China to move forward. It is not all rosy with China, we have our challenges. CPC has to fight with the people to get power, and after getting the power liberated the people.\u201d\n\nHe said he believes the book will contribute to deepening the understanding of readers in Nigeria on China, and to enhancing the communications and exchanges between the two countries.\n\nThe Actor of the book, Charles Onunaiju said there are definitely lessons for Nigeria from China experience, he said Nigeria need not take the Chinese way but need to fashion out Nigerian way to the very top.\n\nHe said Nigeria should not based on the many challenges currently faced give up hope of becoming a great nation but rather climb on the back of the challenges to become a great nation.\n\nMichael Olugbode in Abuja",

          "title": "Eight South Africa-based Nigerians Charged in US with Internet Scams, Money Laundering",
          "text": "Eight Nigerian have been charged in New Jersey, United States with conspiring to engage in internet scams and money laundering from South Africa.\n\nA statement from the United States Embassy in Nigeria said seven defendants, leaders of Cape Town zone of Neo-Black Movement of Africa, also known as \u201cBlack Axe\u201d and an eighth man who conspired with a Black Axe leader, were charged with multiple federal crimes relating to internet scams they perpetrated from South Africa.\n\nThe Acting U.S. Attorney Rachael A. Honig for the District of New Jersey announced the charges against them on Thursday.\n\nThe accused are Perry Osagiede, aka \u201cLord Sutan Abubakar de 1st,\u201d aka \u201cRob Nicolella,\u201d aka \u201cAlan Salomon,\u201d 52; Enorense Izevbigie, aka \u201cRichy Izevbigie,\u201d aka \u201cLord Samuel S Nujoma,\u201d 45; Franklyn Edosa Osagiede, aka, \u201cLord Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela,\u201d aka, \u201cEdosa Franklyn Osagiede,\u201d aka \u201cDave Hewitt,\u201d aka, \u201cBruce Dupont,\u201d 37; Osariemen Eric Clement, aka, \u201cLord Adekunle Ajasi,\u201d aka, \u201cAiden Wilson,\u201d 35; Collins Owhofasa Otughwor, aka, \u201cLord Jesse Makoko,\u201d aka, \u201cPhilip Coughlan,\u201d 37; and Musa Mudashiru, aka \u201cLord Oba Akenzua,\u201d 33; all originally from Nigeria, are charged by superseding indictment with wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy, spanning from 2011 to 2021.\n\nThe statement said one defendant remains at large.\n\nAccording to the statement, Perry Osagiede, Franklyn Osagiede, Clement, and Izevbigie are also charged with wire fraud. Perry Osagiede, Franklyn Osagiede, and Otughwor are charged with aggravated identity theft.\n\nToritseju Gabriel Otubu, aka \u201cAndy Richards,\u201d aka \u201cAnn Petersen,\u201d 41, also originally from Nigeria, is charged by separate indictment with wire fraud conspiracy, wire fraud, aggravated identity theft, and money laundering conspiracy, spanning from 2016 to 2021.\n\nThe statement quoting Acting U.S. Attorney Honig, said: \u201cAmericans are too often victimized by criminal organisations located abroad who use the internet to deceive those victims, defraud them of money, and, many times, persuade the victims to wittingly or unwittingly assist in perpetuating the fraudulent schemes,\u201dadding that: \u201cThe public should be on guard against schemes like these. And, more importantly, anyone thinking of engaging in this kind of criminal conduct should understand that the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office and our partners will find them and bring them to justice, no matter where they are.\u201d\n\nU.S. Secret Service Office of Investigations Assistant Director Jeremy Sheridan, was quoted as saying: \u201cTransnational organized criminal networks continue to victimize U.S. citizens and threaten the financial infrastructure of the United States,\u201d noting that: \u201cThe Secret Service, alongside our partner agencies, works tirelessly in its global investigative mission to dismantle these groups and arrest those who lead them. We are proud to be a part of the international law enforcement mission to combat all forms of financial crimes and thank all those involved in this investigation. The U.S. Secret Service extends its gratitude to the U.S. Department of State\u2019s Diplomatic Security Service for its assistance.\u201d\n\nFBI Special Agent in Charge George Crouch Jr. said: \u201cForeign nationals who think they can hide in another country or in cyberspace while preying on our citizens need to know one thing, the FBI has a global footprint and will use every resource available to protect the American people. The strong working relationship among our federal and international law enforcement partners allows us to reach across geographical boundaries. In other words, anyone who thinks they can avoid American justice simply by operating outside the United States should rethink their strategy.\u201d\n\nAccording to documents filed in these cases:\n\nPerry Osagiede, Izevbigie, Franklyn Osagiede, Clement, Otughwor, and Mudashiru (the Black Axe defendants) were all leaders of the Neo-Black Movement of Africa, also known as \u201cBlack Axe,\u201d an organization headquartered in Benin City, Nigeria, that operates in various countries.\n\nThe Black Axe is organized into regional chapters known as \u201czones,\u201d and the defendants were all leaders within the Cape Town, South Africa, Zone. Perry Osagiede founded the Cape Town Zone of Black Axe and worked as its zonal head, along with Izevbigie. The Black Axe defendants and other members of Black Axe took part in, and openly discussed, fraud schemes amongst their membership.\n\nFrom at least 2011 through 2021, the Black Axe defendants and other conspirators worked together from Cape Town to engage in widespread internet fraud involving romance scams and advance fee schemes. Many of these fraudulent narratives involved claims that an individual was traveling to South Africa for work and needed money or other items of value following a series of unfortunate and unforeseen events, often involving a construction site or problems with a crane.\n\nThe statement said the conspirators used social media websites, online dating websites, and voice over internet protocol phone numbers to find and talk with victims in the United States, while using a number of aliases.\n\nThe conspirators\u2019 romance scam victims believed they were in romantic relationships with the person using the alias and, when requested, the victims sent money and items of value overseas, including to South Africa. Sometimes, when victims expressed hesitation in sending money, the conspirators used manipulative tactics to coerce the payments, including by threatening to distribute personally sensitive photographs of the victim.\n\nThe conspirators used the bank accounts of victims and individuals with U.S.-based financial accounts to transfer the money to South Africa. On certain occasions, the conspirators convinced victims to open financial accounts in the United States that the conspirators would then be permitted to use themselves. In addition to laundering money derived from romance scams and advance fee schemes, the conspirators also worked to launder money from business email compromise schemes. In addition to their aliases, the conspirators used business entities to conceal and disguise the illegal nature of the funds.\n\nOtubu also engaged in romance scams and used the victims of those scams to obtain money and to launder the proceeds of business email compromises back to South Africa. Otubu conspired with an individual identified in the criminal complaint as Co-conspirator 1, who was a founding member and leader of the Cape Town Zone of Black Axe.\n\nThe wire fraud conspiracy and wire fraud charges each carry a maximum term of 20 years in prison and a maximum fine of $250,000. The money laundering conspiracy charge carries a maximum term of 20 years in prison and a maximum fine of $500,000 or twice the value of the property involved in the transaction, whichever is greatest. The aggravated identity theft charges carry a mandatory term of two years in prison, which must run consecutively to any other term of imprisonment imposed on a defendant.\n\nSeven defendants were arrested in South Africa yesterday by the South African Police Service. Those defendants had their initial appearances in South Africa and are awaiting extradition to the United States on these charges. Both cases are before U.S. District Judge Michael A. Shipp in Trenton federal court.\n\nActing U.S. Attorney Honig credited special agents of the FBI, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge George M. Crouch Jr. in Newark; and the FBI Legal Attach\u00e9 Office at the U.S. Embassy in Pretoria, South Africa, under the direction of Legal Attach\u00e9 Jennifer Snell Dent; special agents of the U.S. States Secret Service, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Mark McKevitt in Newark, Special Agent in Charge John Hamby in Seattle, Resident Agent in Charge Michael Burgin in the Pretoria Resident Office and Special Agent in Charge Jason Kane of the Criminal Investigative Division, with the investigation leading to the charges.\n\nMichael Olugbode in Abuja",

          "text": "South Korea has conducted the first test launch of its domestically built rocket, joining the ranks of advanced space-faring nations.\n\nTelevision images on Thursday showed the Korean Satellite Launch Vehicle II \u2013 informally called NURI, which means \u201cworld \u2013 rising upwards from the launch site in Goheung trailing a column of flame.\n\n\u201cIt looks like it\u2019s soaring into the sky without problems,\u201d a commentator said.\n\nThe three-stage rocket, emblazoned with South Korea\u2019s flag and carrying a dummy satellite, blasted off at 4pm (07:00 GMT) from the Naro Space Centre, nearly 500 kilometres (311 miles) south of the capital, Seoul.\n\nThe NURI weighs 200 tonnes, is 47.2 metres (155 feet) long, and is fitted with a total of six liquid-fuelled engines. It is designed to put 1.5-tonne payloads into orbit 600km to 800km (373 miles-497 miles) above the Earth and has been 10 years in development at a cost of 2 trillion won ($1.6bn).\n\nSouth Korea has risen to become the world\u2019s 12th-largest economy and a technologically advanced nation but has lagged in the headline-making world of spaceflight, where the Soviet Union led the way with the first satellite launch in 1957, closely followed by the United States.\n\nChina, Japan and India all have advanced space programmes, and the South\u2019s nuclear-armed neighbour North Korea put a 300-kg (660-pound) satellite into orbit in 2012 in what Western countries condemned as a disguised missile test.\n\nOverseen by the Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI), NURI rocket was moved to its launch pad on Wednesday and raised into position.\n\n\u201cAll preparations like umbilical connection and confidential inspection have been done,\u201d the Ministry of Science and Technology said in a statement.\n\nSpace launches have long been a sensitive issue on the Korean Peninsula, where North Korea faces sanctions over its nuclear-armed ballistic missile programme.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s future plans call for launching surveillance, navigation, and landing a lunar probe by 2030. The programme also includes military satellites, but officials deny that the NURI has any use as a weapon itself.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest initial advantages potentially with this launch system is that it will provide South Korea the ability to put satellites into space that provide capability to have a system of surveillance over North Korea \u2013 and this will give south Korea the ability to monitor potential North Korea launches of ballistic and cruise missiles,\u201d Jon Grevatt, a defence industry analyst with Janes, told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cIn the next few years, South Korea plans to develop and start operating a series of space launch vehicles from the NARO Space Centre, and these launch vehicles will be putting small vehicles into lower orbit, further increasing South Korea\u2019s space defence capabilities,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s the plan and this is the first stage.\u201d\n\nSeoul\u2019s space programme has a chequered record \u2013 its first two launches in 2009 and 2010, which in part used Russian technology, both ended in failure, the second one exploding two minutes into the flight.\n\nThe first successful launch was in 2013 and came after multiple delays and several failed tests. That rocket was also jointly developed with Russia.\n\nHaving its own launch vehicle will give South Korea the flexibility to determine payload types and launch schedules, as well as protect \u201cconfidential\u201d payloads such as spy satellites, officials told the Reuters news agency.\n\n\u201cRockets are the only means available to mankind to go out into space,\u201d Lee Sang-ryul, the director of the Korea Aerospace Research Institute, told South Korean newspaper Chosun Biz.\n\n\u201cHaving such technology means we have fulfilled basic requirements to join this space exploration competition.\u201d",
