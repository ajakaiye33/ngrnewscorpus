          "title": "Naira will fall from N570/$1 to N400/$1 at black market if\u2026 \u2013 CBN ex-deputy gov, Moghalu",
          "text": "A former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Kingsley Moghalu, says the value of the naira will fall from N570/$1 to N400/$1 at the parallel market if there is a massive rush of dollars into the Nigerian market through export earnings.\n\nMoghalu made this known in a PUNCH Live Interview on Thursday.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe reason we have the prices we have is that the official rate is perceived by the market not to be the real rate; that\u2019s the fundamental reason why you have a huge gap of N410 at the official rate \u2013 Investors and Exporters\u2019 Window \u2013 and then N570 in the black market. That is unbelievable.\n\n\u201cNormally, you will have a gap between the official rate and the parallel market but in our time, we made sure that that gap was not a lot \u2013 it wasn\u2019t more than N10, N15, max N20.\n\n\u201cWhat is happening now shows that there is a very fundamental crisis in the Nigerian economy. And unfortunately, the economy does not respond to political commands, the economy does not respond to political statements, the economy does not respond to military orders; the market responds to its own dynamics \u2013 demand and supply.\n\n\u201cIf you have a massive rush of dollars into the Nigerian market today, the price of the dollar would crash and the naira can come to N400 in the black market, you may be shocked.\n\n\u201cSo, it is about going to fix what would bring in the quantity of dollars that would rebalance the equation.\u201d\n\n\u2018CBN needs to gain investors\u2019 confidence\u2019\n\nMoghalu, who was a deputy governor at the apex bank between 2009 and 2014, also explained how the apex bank stabilised the naira against the dollar for five years during his time at the bank, noting that the CBN must work on gaining the confidence of investors.\n\nMoghalu had deputised Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, who was CBN Governor from June 2009 to February 2014.\n\nBoth Sanusi and Moghalu were at the apex bank during the administrations of the late President Umaru Yar\u2019adua and then-President Goodluck Jonathan.\n\nDuring the period, the naira steadied around N150/$1. However, the naira has maintained an unprecedented downward trend in the last six years since the beginning of the administration of the current President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), and the CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele.\n\nThe naira now trades at N570/dollar at the parallel market while it trades around N412/$ at the I&E forex window which is the only official rate recognised by the CBN.\n\nThe downward trend of the naira had fueled calls for the sacking or resignation of the CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele, by some political groups including the Peoples Democratic Party. They blamed Emefiele, who has been CBN governor since June 2014, for poor monetary policies.\n\nHowever, speaking on Thursday, Moghalu blamed the downward trend of the naira on the activities of speculators and the lack of autonomy of the apex bank.\n\n\u2018Apex bank not autonomous\u2019\n\nWhen asked how he and Sanusi stabilised the naira against the dollar for years, Moghalu told PUNCH Live that the apex bank worked on investors\u2019 confidence during the period.\n\nThe CBN ex-deputy governor, however, lamented that the CBN has lost its autonomy to the political class and has little or no investors\u2019 confidence.\n\nAccording to the former presidential candidate of the Young Progressive Party in the 2019 election, the government of the day does not respect the independence of the CBN and it becomes a choice for whoever is the governor whether to play along or assert his or her independence and bear whatever cost given the kinds of political leaders that are in the country.\n\nThe PUNCH had earlier reported that the CBN in July stopped selling forex to Bureau De Change operators and asked legitimate travellers to approach the banks to access cheap forex but the banks have been inundated with fake demands.\n\nEmefiele had said that the BDCs defeated their purpose of existence to provide forex to retail users and had become wholesale and illegal dealers.\n\nAsked whether the stoppage of forex sales BDCs was the cause of the downward trend of the naira in recent weeks, Moghalu said the CBN should not have sold FX to the BDCs in the first instance.\n\n\u201cA Central Bank supplying foreign exchange to BDCs is very odd, Nigeria must be the only country or one of the very few countries that does that. It is only part of the wider problem.\n\n\u201cStatism is killing the Nigerian economy, the government interferes too much in the market and in that process, distorts the markets and the Nigerian citizen suffers,\u201d he said, adding that the sale of FX to the BDC encourage hoarding, roundtripping and exploitative tendencies by those who do not need FX but who have access to it.\n\nHe also said that the presidential order directing the CBN not to release money for food importation including heavily consumed commodities like milk was part of the problem of the rising demand for forex because the country does not produce sufficient milk whereas there is a high demand for the product amongst Nigerians.\n\nContinuing, Moghalu said that by pumping more forex into the market, the CBN is depleting the foreign reserves of the government, noting that economic diversification and exportation were the way out of the FX crisis",

          "text": ".\n\n..Says FG spends N8.9trn on infrastructure devt\n\nBy Chioma Onuegbu Uyo\n\nTHE Vice president of Nigeria, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo has said he is very proud of governor Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom state for his great achievements in the area of infrastructure and industrialization in six years of his stewardship as the governor of the state.\n\nOsinbajo who spoke while commissioning the 21-Storey Dakkada Towers on Friday in Uyo, recalled that in 2015 the governor had shared the vision of his administration to construct the tallest building in the South-South and Southeast regions.\n\nHe noted that the 21-storey smart building is not just the tallest region, but certainly among the tallest in Nigeria and in West Africa, congratulated the state governor for his visionary leadership.\n\nHe also congratulated members of his team who have worked so hard to ensure the realization of the vision as well as the project developers for delivering the edifice in good time.\n\nHis words, \u201cSo the completion of the Dakkada Towers will most definitely address the questions of the paucity of world-class office accommodation for both the local and corporate international companies, especially oil and gas companies. This will certainly boost the revenue of the state and open doors for further investments.\n\n\u201cWith this development, the big players in corporate Nigeria especially in the oil and gas industry should now find it entirely auspicious to relocate their administrative headquarters to Uyo. I hear that various expressions of interest have already been received from Companies in the oil and gas, banking and all various sectors of the economy.\n\n\u2018The Dakkada towers is a catalyst for the private sector, to leverage on the emerging real estate market by constructing more skyscrapers which will be required, as the promoters and partners of several of the industrial projects here in Akwa Ibom state begin to demand quality accommodation for their offices.\n\n\u201d I am very proud of what my brother has achieved in the six years of his stewardship as the governor of this state, especially with his industrialization agenda. There will also be new jobs created, transfer of knowledge and technology as the Tower is put to use\u201d\n\nThe Vice president who earlier flagged off the 557 low density \u201cDakkada Luxury Estate, underscored the importance of infrastructure in attracting investment, noting that the Federal government has spent over N8.9trillon on infrastructural development in the country as of last year.\n\n\u201cAs you are aware, since the inception of our administration Mr President has prioritised the development of Infrastructure. And despite the severe economic headwind we experienced in the past six years we have invested more than any administration on infrastructure.\n\n\u201cAs of last year, we had expended over N8.9trillion on infrastructure. Just last month the Federal Executive Council approved the Lagos-Calabar rail project which will pass through Uyo as a major station. At the end of last year the Council also approved the Full business case for the Ibom Deep seaport\u201d, Osinbajo disclosed.\n\nIn his remarks earlier, the state governor, Mr Udom Emmanuel appreciated the VP for his consistent show of love towards Akwa Ibom state, saying he was greatly excited because when he started the project the naysayers said he won\u2019t be able to complete it.\n\n\u201cBut today we are presenting to Akwa Ibom people in Nigeria, in the Diaspora, the smartest, the most intelligent, and the tallest building that Nigeria can boast of\u201d Emmanuel said.\n\nHe noted that the IOC\u2019s will have no excuse not to relocate their administrative headquarters to the state, stressing, \u201d If you check the balance sheet of the IOCs hardly, will you see them erecting any building, but they pay rent. They used to complain we can\u2019t do this, we can\u2019t have office accommodation, that excuse has ended today.\n\n\u201cWe are spearheading innovations that will generate revenue, create jobs and put us on the world map. People see me working, and they say you are not working as a second-term governor. There is no second term in my blood vein. What I am doing is to move Akwa Ibom forward. That is why I refused to be distracted\u201d\n\nEarlier in his goodwill message, the Turkish Ambassador to Nigeria, Mr Hakan Cakil, expressed satisfaction over the quality of work done at the 21-storey smart building and thanked the government for inviting him to be part of the inauguration of the edifice which was designed and constructed by a Turkish firm, VKS Construction Company Limited.\n\nHe noted that VKS is a global company incorporated in Nigeria for over 40 years, adding, \u201cI hope our bilateral relations will continue to grow and made stronger\u201d\n\nAlso in his goodwill message, a former Governor of Cross River State, Donald Duke lauded Governor Emmanuel for fulfilling his vision to move the state forward, saying, \u201cSo today I want to congratulate you, the people of Akwa Ibom state for what is happening here. It is leadership, some may not see it, but in a couple of years to come, they will appreciate what has been done here\u201d,\n\nOn her part, the Senator representing Akwa Ibom South (Eket Senatorial district) Senator Akon Eyakenyi, said Akwa Ibom people were proud of the governor because they unanimously gave him the mandate to serve in 2015, and that his performance has lived up to expectations.\n\nShe recalled that over the years lack of conducive office space was the excuse given by IOC\u2019s for not moving to the state, stressing, \u201cAnd when governor Emmanuel came on board he ensured that there will be no more excuses. Today we have this edifice standing to the glory of God. We are people are very proud of you\u201d.\n\nWhile giving technical details of the 21-storey smart building, the Commissioner for Special Duties, Mr Okpolupm Etteh reminded the VIce president that the demand for the relocation of the IOC\u2019s to the state resurfaced during his (VP) visit to the State, and recalled that he had immediately directed the then Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Mr Ibe Kachikwu, to liaise with the IOC\u2019s on the way forward over the issue.\n\n\u201cMay I respectfully intimate you that this ultra-modern Tower is situated on a massive site area of 48, 200 square metres (4.82 hectares). It is an ICT compliant intelligent structure with a 24hours power supply.\n\n\u201d It is 104 metres high with 21 floors of rentable office spaces, surrounded by a podium which includes restaurants, banks and adequate convenience services. It has a parking space which can accommodate about 400 cars\u201d, Etteh explained.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "title": "2023: Nigeria has adequate ICT Infrastructure for e-Transmission of election results \u2014 INEC insists",
          "text": ".\n\n\u2026Says, it won\u2019t cede role to NCC, NASS\n\nBy Omeiza Ajayi, Abuja\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission INEC has again reiterated its readiness to embark on electronic transmission of election results whenever it gets a legal backing, saying Nigeria is ripe for the deployment of such technology.\n\nINEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu who stated this in a 25-page \u201cPosition Paper No. 1 of 2021\u201d released Saturday in Abuja, said Nigeria has adequate Information Communication Technology ICT infrastructure for e-transmission.\n\n\u201cThe Independent National Electoral Commission INEC believes that it has developed adequate structures and processes to successfully transmit election results electronically. Electronic transmission of results will improve the quality of election result management and that our engagement with stakeholders shows that the Nigerian public supports it. The technology and national infrastructure to support this are\n\nadequate. Consequently, if the choice was up to INEC, the Commission prefers to transmit election results electronically once the necessary legal framework is provided. This Position Paper will, among other things, try to elaborate on the reasons why the transmission of election results electronically is both desirable and doable\u201d, the commission declared.\n\nINEC added that to require it to obtain attestation from the Nigerian Communication Commission NCC and approval of the National Assembly to implement electronic transmission of election results will be in breach of the Constitution.\n\nAccording to Yakubu, recent debates regarding e-transmission have not bothered to look at the desirability or otherwise of using the innovation fo elections in Nigeria.\n\nHe said; \u201cTwo guiding principles underlying the Commission\u2019s application of technology are timeliness and relevance. These principles underscore the Commission\u2019s belief that the time has come for Nigerian elections to transcend the cumbersome, tardy and vulnerable manual transmission and collation of election results to electronic transmission.\n\n\u201cRecently, in the course of the National Assembly seeking to amend or repeal and re-enact the Electoral Act 2010, a national debate has arisen over the question of electronic transmission of election results. The controversy has revolved around the readiness of INEC and the capacity of national infrastructure for transmitting election results electronically. It is worthy of note that none of the sides in this controversy appears to substantially question the desirability of electronic transmission of election results. It seems that only the preparedness of INEC and the capacity of national infrastructure are questioned.\n\n\u201cSince INEC\u2019s readiness has become a cardinal issue in these debates, the Commission has decided to articulate and make public its position and thinking on this question, particularly for two reasons. First, many Nigerians have called on the Commission to make its position public. Second, we hope that by doing so, some of the partisan fervour that has tainted the discussions may recede and make common grounds and consensus possible in order to chart a more progressive way forward.\n\n\u201cThis Position Paper is borne out of this thinking. Among other things, it distils the Commission\u2019s position and thinking on the question of electronic transmission of election results in an easily readable form. The positions canvassed in this paper are informed by a decade of the Commission\u2019s technical field experience, piloting and engagement with critical stakeholders, particularly the Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) on electronic transmission of election results.\n\n\u201cSurely, a decade is not a short time for the Commission to determine whether it is ready. Our position is not meant to support or undermine any side in the ongoing debates. Our understanding is that as a responsible corporate citizen, particularly one whose constitutional responsibilities are at stake, INEC should lend its voice to such a momentous issue of public concern. As such, INEC\u2019s intervention in these debates, particularly through this Position Paper, should not be misconstrued as denuding the powers of any other agency or authority to perform its functions or to hold views on the issues in question that are contrary to those of the Commission.\n\nIn that spirit, and on behalf of the Commission, I strongly commend this Position Paper No. 1 of 2021 to all stakeholders who are interested in knowing the Commission\u2019s thinking and position on the electronic transmission of election results\u201d.\n\nINEC contended that recent debates in Nigeria over the provision of Clause 52 (3) of the Electoral Bill 2021 regarding the electronic transmission of election results appear to be generating a lot of heat but throwing very little light on the cardinal issues.\n\nHe said they have been marked by entrenched partisan positions, incomplete information, unsubstantiated fears, groundless conspiracy theories and profound misconceptions.\n\n\u201cThis is particularly the case regarding the level of understanding of the position, requirements and preparedness of INEC on the question. It is curious that the perspectives of the Election Management Body on this very important issue of election management remain either completely absent in the debates or at best misconceived. This is a major missing link in the debates and this Position Paper seeks to address it. adequate\u201d, INEC stated.\n\nThe electoral umpire added that the answer to the question of the desirability of electronic transmission of election results in Nigeria today may be summed up in three words \u2013 trust, efficiency and safety.\n\nINEC said it has for instance used the IReV online publishing of Polling Unit results to test the capacity of the national infrastructure to support the future electronic transmission of results.\n\nAccording to the Commission, results were transferred in real-time from all parts of the country covering different types of elections from densely populated urban areas to rural locations, forest areas to the savannah region, islands to the mainland, creeks to mountains and even areas affected by insecurity such as insurgency and banditry.\n\n\u201cThe Commission has been able to successfully transfer images of polling unit level results to IReV from Oworonsoki in Kosofe LGA of Lagos State, Ariaria Market in Aba North LGA of Abia State to far-flung locations such as Dugge in Rijau LGA of Niger State, Mahin in Ilaje LGA of Ondo State, Kwalkwalawa in Bakura LGA of Zamfara State, Dumadumin Toka in Kafin Hausa LGA of Jigawa State, Foropa in Southern Ijaw LGA of Bayelsa State, Iguobazuwa in Ovia South-West LGA of Edo State, Briyel in Bayo LGA of Borno State, Bundot in Dass LGA of Bauchi State and Okwelle in Onuimo LGA of Imo State. Since August 2020, the Commission has conducted elections and transmitted election results from 20 States and the FCT, covering 27 constituencies spread across 84 LGAs, 925 Wards and 14,296 polling units involving 9,884,910 registered voters.\n\nAdequate ICT Infrastructure\n\n\u201cThe conclusion that the Commission draws from these diverse pilots conducted since 2011 is that the country is ready for electronic transmission of results. The national ICT infrastructure is also adequate for the purpose of electronic transmission of results. This is underscored by all the discussions we held with the Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) and the regulator, Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), over the ten-year period of these pilots, but especially between 2018 and 2019.\n\n\u201cThe Joint Committee (of INEC and NCC) also found that mobile networks adequately covered 93% of INEC Polling Units with the capacity to cover the outstanding 7%. The Committee went on to allocate Polling Units to the four major mobile network operators \u2013 Airtel, Glo, 9Mobile and MTN \u2013 for the purpose of transmitting election results.\n\n\u201cA total cost implication of Three Hundred and Ninety-Five Million, One hundred and Twenty-Three Thousand Naira (N395,123,000) was worked out for the services covering the cost of SIM, system configuration and integration, system support and data bundle with one-year validity.\n\n\u201cIn addition, the Joint Committee made other technical recommendations, including the allocation of one terabyte (1TB) of data bucket per 10,000 SIMs per annum by the network operators and configuration of one Access Point Name (APN) and Virtual Private Network (VPN) \u201cby all operators towards INEC platform to enhance security\u201d. Such detailed work and recommendations involving the major MNOs and the NCC as the regulator of telecommunications in Nigeria, profoundly convinced INEC that electronic transmission of election results was possible for the 2019 General Election.\n\n\u201cHowever, INEC expected to receive a clear legal mandate for electronic transmission of election results with the Electoral Act amendment that was ongoing at the time in order to commence implementation. Unfortunately, that did not happen.\n\n\u201cBased on the foregoing, INEC is convinced that the nation has the infrastructure to implement the electronic transmission of election results. The MNOs have the capacity to do so and network coverage across the country is adequate and secure. This position is substantiated by the 2018 position of the people who should know namely, the MNOs, who informed the Joint Committee that they had provided such services to other customers, including the NCC which regulates telecommunications in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis is particularly so because the Joint Technical Committee submitted its report three years ago. With the massive developments that constantly take place in the telephony and data transmission sector, the capacity would have further improved since then. In other words, the capacity is even more reliable today than it was three years ago when the MNOs and the NCC certified that electronic transmission of election results was possible. The contrary positions are probably built on some misconceptions which must be addressed\u201d.\n\nSCR technology different from e-transmission\n\nINEC added that the recent trend among some politicians is to suggest that the challenges experienced with the Smart Card Readers SCR during elections indicate that the commission is not ready for electronic transmission of results.\n\n\u201cThis is unfortunate. The SCR, as it is presently deployed for elections, is not used for result transmission, it is not permanently connected to the data network and it does not require a permanent electricity supply to function once its battery is properly and fully charged. Therefore, there is no connection between any imagined issues with the SCR and the electronic transmission of election results. It seems that this orchestrated attack on the SCR which began in 2014 is a diversionary euphemism for partisan discomfort with the transparency that careful application of technology to our electoral process can bring\u201d, INEC stated.\n\nINEC won\u2019t abdicate constitutional duty for NCC\n\nINEC said it will not abdicate its constitutional duty of superintending the electoral and political process, explaining that it has always created partnerships with diverse agencies of government, private sector and civic groups in its determination to establish a virile and world-class electoral process for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cTo this end, INEC works with security agencies, the judiciary, Office of the Surveyor-General of the Federation (OSGOF), the National Population Commission (NPC), the National Orientation Agency (NOA), the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), civil society organisations, trade unions, the media and other stakeholders whenever the need arises.\n\n\u201cINEC\u2019s longstanding partnership with NCC and MNOs should be seen in this regard. However, constitutionally it is the role of INEC alone to register voters, register and regulates political parties and conduct elections. Any process that facilitates the denudation of the constitutional responsibilities of INEC to conduct elections or subjects those constitutional responsibilities to the approval of an agency of government will only undermine the electoral process.\n\n\u201cConsequently, while INEC needs the partnership of NCC to transmit election results electronically, it does not require its approval. In fact, Section 160 of the Constitution empowers INEC to \u201cimpose duties\u201d on other federal government agencies in the discharge of its functions viz:\n\n\u201cSubject to subsection (2) of this section, any of the bodies may, with the approval of the President, by rules or otherwise regulate its own procedure or confer powers and impose duties on any officer or authority for the purpose of discharging its functions, provided that in the case of the Independent National Electoral Commission, its powers to make its own rules or otherwise regulate its own procedure shall not be subject to the approval or control of the President.\n\n\u201cPut simply, to require INEC to obtain attestation from NCC and approval of the National Assembly to implement electronic transmission of election results will be in breach of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cWhat is critical for the Commission is a legal framework that enables rather than constrains innovation for transparent and credible elections. It should remain the responsibility of the Commission to organise, undertake and supervise elections as enshrined in Sec. 15, Part I of the Third Schedule to the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended).\n\n\u201cFinally, electronic transmission of election results and balloting are, for the Commission, one more step towards completing the four phases of electronic voting. The others are biometric register and electronic accreditation of voters, which have already been implemented by the Commission\u201d, INEC added.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "title": "Power rotation: Southern leaders, MBF slam Northern elders",
          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Enugu, Chukwudi Nweje, Lagos, Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nFor insisting that the presidency would be retained in the North in 2023 and beyond, the Northern Elders Forum has attracted the wrath of leading groups in the South-West, South-East and Middle Belt. They have slammed the Northern leaders, saying they were living in the past.\n\nPan Yoruba socio-cultural political organisation, Afenifere, said the Northern elders were like a drowning ship clinging to whatever it could. Director, Research and Strategy for Afenifere, Dr Akin Fapohunda said: \u201cThey don\u2019t know that the Middle-Belt is out. Can they reckon with Benue, Plateau, the way it was during the civil war? Can they reckon with Southern Kaduna as part of the North?\u201d\n\nOhanaeze Ndigbo said the gentleman\u2019s agreement on power rotation between the North and the South should be sustained by all means.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chief Alex Ogbonnia, said for\n\njustice, equity and fairness, power must rotate to the South East in 2023.\n\nPresident, Middle Belt Forum, Dr Bitrus Porgu said power shift is an arrangement by political parties, not that of northern elders.\n\n\u201cIt is not for northern elders to determine what happens in PDP, APC or any political party for that matter. It is what the parties want to do that will carry the day. So, they are just making a political statement,\u201d he said. Leading Igbo groups, including the Ohanaeze Ndigbo Women wing, Concerned Igbo Stakeholders Forum (CISF), and Coalition of South East Youth Leaders (COSEYL), slammed the spokesman of Northern Elders\u2019 Forum (NEF), Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, for declaring that the north would retain power in 2023 and beyond.\n\nThey said Nigeria was not an estate of the north, adding that the era of one region lording it over the rest of the country was long gone. Leader of the Concerned Igbo Stakeholders Forum (CISF), Chukwuma Okenwa, in a statement in Enugu, described such comments as very disappointing and an aspersion to the intelligence and patience of southerners.\n\nHe said such comments were capable of exacerbating the already fragile peace of the country, by further fueling secessionist movements.\n\nFor the COSEYL, it was unfortunate that a man of his standing whom the youths looked up to for better direction and guidance held such view on such important and sensitive issue.\n\nExpressing their disappointment, President General of the group, Goodluck Ibem and Secretary General, Kanice Igwe, in a statement said the likes of Baba-Ahmed wanted Nigeria to return to pre-amalgamation, when there were Northern and Southern Protectorates.\n\nThe youth leaders said: \u201cIt is a well-known fact that the North cannot produce Nigerian President without the support of the Southern Nigerians. President Buhari had the full support of the North and he contested in 2003 and he lost. He contested again in 2007 and 2011 and lost. He won the election in 2015 when he aligned with the Southern part of the country who voted for him and he emerged as president.\n\n\u201cWe are very surprised that Hakeem has suddenly forgotten so soon how President Buhari emerged as president. History doesn\u2019t lie, he should go back to history to refresh his memory.\u201d\n\nFor the Ohanaeze Ndigbo Women Organisation, since the North was very determined to lord it over the Southern Nigeria perpetually, then they can prepare their votes and vote a President of Northern Nigeria and not a President of the entire Nigeria. Chairman, Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF), Abia Onyike said the northern elders were daydreaming. He said: \u201cThe North is no longer a monolithic power block today. Unless a miracle happens, I don\u2019t see the core North and the Middle Belt operating as one cohesive political entity. President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s government has divided and devastated the old Northern block.\u201d\n\nIgbo stakeholders\u2019 leader, Okenwa said in the spirit of equity and fairness that a president from southern extraction, specifically the South-East, should be a non-negotiable agenda. According to him, Southern Nigeria is more united than ever; and will vehemently resist any attempt to impose a Northern President on Nigerians come 2023.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, New York\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has told world leaders at the 76th Session of the high-level General Debate of the UN General Assembly at the UN headquarters in New York on Friday, to set term limits especially for African leaders.\n\nHis call came after the continent has experienced three successful coups (two in Mali and one recently in Guinea), and one unsuccessful coup attempt in Niger, as well as an arbitrary military transfer of power in Chad following the assassination of its president.\n\nPresident Buhari stressed that the recent trend of unconstitutional takeover of power on the continent must not be tolerated by the international community.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe must deal not only with the symptoms of conflict but also the immediate causes that fuel conflicts in the first place.\n\n\u201cThese include poor and undemocratic governance, human rights abuses, poverty, ignorance, injustice and inequalities.\n\n\u201cThere are no easy solutions to these conditions.

          "title": "Achike Udenwa: If you kill Nnamdi Kanu, another will rise",
          "text": "Former Imo State governor, Chief Achike Udenwa has said only a political solution could resolve the IPOB and Nnamdi Kanu issue, noting that legal options wouldn\u2019t go anywhere.\n\nIn an interview with VINCENT KALU, the former Minister of Commerce and Industry said Northern elders were being confrontational over its position on power rotation in 2023.\n\nYou have always harped on power rotation between the North and the South, as a way of ensuring peaceful coexistence in the country. However, within the week, some Northern elders said the region should continue after President Buhari. What is your reaction on this?\n\nThough power rotation is not constitutional, but it is conventional. We have done it all the time, to rotate power between the North and the South since 1999 till now. First, it was Obasanjo from the South; then to Yar\u2019Adua, from the North; to Jonathan from the South and now Buhari, from the North. So, morally, anybody serious with One Nigeria, united Nigeria, should not be suggesting that power remains in the North. It was credited to Hakeem, I hope he is not stating the opinion of Northern Elders Forum because that will be vey confrontational and will not be good for our polity. Power should rotate.\n\nEven your party, PDP that has rotation principle, its body language suggests that the party may zone the presidency to the North. What is your view on this?\n\nI don\u2019t know where you got the body language thing. I haven\u2019t seen the body language. What PDP has done so far is to set up zoning committee, which has representatives from all the zones in the country. This committee has just started working. So, I don\u2019t know where you got the body language, maybe from what people are saying. Everybody has his opinion and his wishes. Not even opinion, some people may wish it remains in the North and some people will wish it comes down to the South. So, you hear all sorts of thing. Until that committee finishes its work, considers all the variables and comes out with a zoning formulae, and tells the party what they recommended. It is left for the National Executive Committee of the party to accept or reject their recommendations. What the NEC finally approves is what we consider as the opinion of PDP, not anybody\u2019s personal opinion. Let us not speculate until we have finally heard from the committee and NEC of the party.\n\nHowever, if they decide that it goes to the North, what will be your position?\n\nThey will give enough reasons to justify that, and we will also look at the reasons. The recommendation of the zoning committee is not final; it is still subject to the NEC approval. We will look at whatever reasons they would give and see how tenable such reasons are. I cannot begin to preempt what will happen or what will not happen. Until we go through the entire processes, we are still at the preliminary, which is for the committee to meet and consider everything. They will go deep before they come out with recommendation, then the NEC will look at it and debate it. NEC is not a one-man body; it is made up of eminent members of the party \u2013 governors, NASS members, National Working Committee members, Board of Trustee members. By the time these people sit to consider the report of the zoning committee, they will come out with a position which will be the stand of the party. Today, PDP hasn\u2019t taken any stand.\n\nIn the event that PDP NEC takes a stand and zones it to the North, saying the party is interested in winning the election and the ruling APC does the same, what position should the South that has insisted on power rotation take?\n\nIt is too early for me to say what the South will do because NEC has not taken that decision. For NEC to take that decision there must be some fundamental issues involved. It is too early for me to speculate what the South will do. You know NEC is made up of both North and South; it is not made up of only Northerners or Southerners. So, Southerners will be part of the NEC that will take this final decision. If NEC takes that final decision, it means there was a very genuine reason for that.\n\nThe South-East is asphyxiating following the sit-at \u2013home by IPOB that is affecting the economic activities of the region. How can peace be brought back to that zone?\n\nIPOB has come out to say that there should be no more sit-at-home. The problem you have when you have this type of situation is that while IPOB may be saying one thing, their operatives in the locality are doing another. We must come to a point where sanity will prevail and there will be an understanding by all parties involved because we may not be able to survive having this sit-at-home indefinitely all the time. It is positive that IPOB has come out to officially say, no more sit-at-home. We take it that as its official position. It is left for them to pass it down to their own local level so that we don\u2019t have ugly incidents of people acting on IPOB\u2019s statement and getting into trouble with its local operatives. People are beginning to see that the economy of the South-East is suffering.\n\nIs it not failure of leadership in Igbo land, where IPOB is dictating what happens in the region? One would have expected that the elders should shout at the young ones to stop what they were doing and they would obey?\n\nI don\u2019t think you are right when you say nobody has come out to tell them to stop what they are doing. A lot of people have come out in the social media to tell them the implications of the sit-at-home; its negative impacts on our economy, the society. It is not right to say nobody has come out to say anything. On the other hand, you should know that IPOB is not a body that is constituted by law. It is part of the failure of not just the leadership but of the society. It is easy to start up a mob action, but difficult to control. That is why you must be very careful before you start any mob action. Once a mob action has taken off, it is difficult to arrest; it is not a question of failure of leadership. Which leadership are we talking about? The state governors in the South-East cannot order IPOB to stop. It is not failure of leadership. People keep on pointing out the implications of what is happening and appealing to IPOB.\n\nIt is out of the appeal by the leadership; their calls and the analysis of what is happening that IPOB has come out to say there is no more sit-at-home every Monday.\n\nHow do we tackle this Nnamdi Kanu phenomenon because it is what gave birth to this sit-at-home and other things happening in the South-East. What should the Igbo leadership do?\n\nJust as people have already suggested, a political solution has to be found. If we continue following a legal process to it, it will have no end because the mere fact that you jail Nnamdi Kanu, or even kill him, thinking that the problem is over, another Nnamdi Kanu would come up. There has to be a political solution; there has to be a dialogue. The government of the day has to dialogue not just with the leadership of the Southeast, but in such a dialogue, the youths should also be involved because there are the main people who carry out the action, not the elders. But the leadership can ensure that there is a dialogue. In that dialogue, the issue will be tabled and every side presents its own position. But if it is resolved on the conference table, it is better than a legal solution that will not end it because Nnamdi Kanu is not alone; he has a lot of followers, he has a lot of deputies. If you imprison him today, someone else jumps up.\n\nA dialogue is important. Even though I was not there when President Buhari visited Imo State, he had discussions with South-East leaders. I don\u2019t know what they discussed, but there is no discussion the president or anybody will have with South-East leaders that won\u2019t include the present impasse. Let\u2019s hope that they mentioned it and try to find a way out. I\u2019m sure that would have happen.\n\nSouthern Governors Forum has been meeting and they have come up with resolutions that would reposition the region, the issue of anti open grazing, presidency from the South in 2023, fiscal federalism, VAT collection, etc. Curiously, South-East governors are behind, while South-West and South-South are the ones driving it. What does this portend and what would you have done if it were during your time?\n\nI\u2019m very much surprised that some of our governors are not attending at all; some are sending their deputies, while one sent the Secretary to the State Government. It doesn\u2019t show seriousness on our path. I don\u2019t believe the coincidence of fixing such a meeting was such that no South-East governor was chanced, except the host, Governor Ugwuanyi of Enugu State; the other ones didn\u2019t have chance at all. It shows our governors are not taking this issue seriously, or they are not representing our interests.\n\nIn our time, I was one of those who started the meeting; I hosted it, Rivers State hosted it, Lagos State hosted it first. Enugu also hosted it. We went to many states. It was such a forum where we talked of things, irrespective of your political leaning. We talked of the things concerning our region, not whether you were PDP, AD or ANPP. By then, PDP was in government, but all the other parties attended, and nobody absented. I don\u2019t now know why our governors are not forthcoming. These are things that are fundamental to our own existence, to the survival of this country. The issues involved \u2013 security, open grazing, fiscal federalism. These are basic issues, so why our governors don\u2019t want to get involved is what I cannot say. I\u2019m surprised, I\u2019m shocked because it is a forum where you go, even if you don\u2019t agree, you say it there. The highest thing is that you would refuse to sign the communiqu\u00e9, but you have aired your views. But in a situation where you boycotted the meeting is what I don\u2019t understand. By the time you start sending your deputy, it means you are not serious. It is only when you are unavoidably absent that your deputy can represent you. We even have cases of one or two of the governors who have not even attended it for the first time. They have held three meetings and we have South-East governors who have not attended any. I don\u2019t understand this; it never happened at our time that a state in the South boycotted meetings. Maybe, one was outside the country and his deputy represented them, but in a situation where it has been held three times and you have not attended, it is a serious issue. It shows that some people don\u2019t appreciate what we are going through right now in the country. It is very serious issue, I cannot offer any apologies, and I don\u2019t know what is behind it.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Enugu, Chukwudi Nweje, Lagos, Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan, and Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri\n\nA number of socio-cultural groups and organisations in the Southern part of Nigeria as well as the Middle Belt Forum (MBF) yesterday launched scathing attacks on Kaduna State governor, Malam Nasir el-Rufai over his comments that the anti-open grazing law passed by the Southern states was not implementable.\n\nEl Rufai had said at the National Secretariat of the All Progressives Congress (APC), in Abuja, on Tuesday, that the southern states of Nigeria were politicising the issue of anti open grazing.\n\nHe also said the Northern States Governors Forum had already taken a position that open grazing is not a sustainable way of livestock production, but that ranching could not be done overnight, even as the law passed by the respective state assembly was not implementable.\n\nOhanaeze Ndigbo, Afenifere, Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB), Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB), Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF) and other groups descended of Kaduna State Governor, Malam Nasir el-Rufai on what they termed his \u201cunguarded statement.\u201d\n\nThe groups said the governor by his statement merely displayed the supremacist arrogance that the Fulani were noted for.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Chief Alex Ogbonnia said El Rufai\u2019s statement is a manifestation of his arrogance and attempt to intimidate the south.\n\nHe said: \u201cGov El Rufai is trying to show arrogance in the sense that 17 southern governors met and took a position on anti-open grazing and he, one governor, cannot even respect the position of 17 of his colleagues. Secondly, he is contradicting himself. Gov El Rufai talked about open grazing no longer being sustainable and said he is constructing ranches and at the same time he is saying that the anti-open grazing law signed by his southern counterparts is not implementable. Thirdly and most importantly, he is telling us that control of the security infrastructure of the country lies somewhere else and that we don\u2019t have the security apparatus to enforce the anti-open grazing law. That is why we must insist on restructuring of Nigeria so that regional security outfits like Ebubeagu and Amotekun will be fully empowered to implement the law.\u201d\n\nThe Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), in a statement by its spokesperson, Emma Powerful affirmed that the bill has come to stay just as it vowed to implement it if the southern governors fail to do so.\n\nPowerful who also maintained that the Kaduna governor\u2019s utterance has exposed his ignorance about the bill, assured that he can never intimidate the south into backing out of their agreement.\n\n\u201cIPOB and Biafra in general can\u2019t afford to allow El-Rufai divide us. The Southern governors have come together against him and his co-traitors in the country and that is what matters. They have bitten more than they can chew.\n\n\u201cAnti-Grazing bill in the South has come to stay and there is nothing anybody can do to change our resolve towards this law against anti- grazing in our territory. El Rufai\u2019s utterances show he\u2019s ignorant.\n\n\u201cIf the Southern governors fail to implement the bill, IPOB will implement it and we would stand shoulder to shoulder with them.\u201d\n\nADF spokesman, Abia Onyike said the Kaduna governor and his gang should bury their heads in shame for destroying the country instead of infuriating already angry Nigerians.\n\nOnyike said: \u201cThat is a demonstration of el-Rufai\u2019s arrogant display of his Fulani supremacist mentality. Otherwise, who is he to dictate to Southern Nigeria? Is he not ashamed of the crisis and violence in Nigeria today, which he and his fellow travellers bequeathed to the country? He should keep quiet and bow out in shame by 2023.\u201d\n\nMASSOB leader, Uchenna Madu said the governor was hypocritical on the ban on open grazing of Fulani cattle by the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum. He said that it was unfortunate and disappointing that the wheels of disunity and disaffection among ethnic nationalities was being driven by el-Rufai, a supposed nationalist.\n\nMASSOB said the governor would not decide for the people of Southern Nigeria, pointing out that the era of divide and rule, planting of disaffections and brotherly discord by the Arewa people in the southern regions was no longer fashionable and workable.\n\nAccording to Madu, the governor can no longer withstand the future political reality that will eventually change the political narrative of the Nigerian state.\n\n\u201cMASSOB advises the governors of Southern regions and other leaders to disregard him and his parasitic teammates because of their venomous hatred against the political interest of people of the southern regions. He has insulted the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum and Christians in general.\n\n\u201cThe indigenous people\u2019s of southern Nigeria can no longer tolerate such political neglect or callous statements against the interest and justification of their interest in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cEven though MASSOB struggle is for Biafra actualization and restoration, we are not against the political and social interest of the south. Every political and economic rights of the people of the southern regions must be supported and sustained,\u201d the MASSOB leader stated.\n\nPresident of the Middle Belt Forum (MBF), Dr Bitrus Pogu said the submission of Gov El Rufai on the anti-open grazing law was unfounded. He said the Nigerian government has no business taking care of the foreign Fulani, who he said constitute majority of the migratory herders in Nigeria and insisted that they be sent back to their respective countries to be catered for by their home governments.\n\nHe said: \u201cEnforcement of the anti-open grazing law is based on determination. If Gov Samuel Ortom is able to implement anti-open grazing law in Benue State, then it is implementable. The southern governors should find out how Gov Ortom was able to implement the law in his state and do the same thing. Moreover, most of the Fulani roaming the forests are not Nigerians, let every foreign Fulani go back to his home country. Every country should take care of its Fulani. The ECOWAS Protocol on Free Movement does not mean that foreign Fulani should come to Nigeria and cause trouble.\u201d\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

In Nigeria, Boko Haram terrorist group, though fragmented by internal strife and weakened by our defence forces, is still active and preying on soft targets.\n\n\u201cNigeria will continue to work closely with the UN Counter-Terrorism bodies and entities with a view to bringing this scourge to an end.\n\n\u201cNigeria has spared no efforts in addressing the challenges of terrorism posed by the activities of Boko Haram in North-East Nigeria, the Lake Chad region as well as banditry in the North-West and the North-Central.

As a result of the renewed vigour of our military, many terrorist fighters are voluntarily surrendering to our security forces.\u201d\n\nThe President lamented that Nigeria was concerned about illicit trading and movement of small arms, which he said had led to an increase in criminality and insurgency in the country.\n\nPresident Buhari also lamented that countries such as Nigeria spend the bulk of their revenues on debt servicing, leaving little for infrastructure development and other essential aspects of the economy such as healthcare and education.\n\nAs a result, he called for the extension of the debt repayment timeline for developing countries, especially those severely suffering the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBuhari said \u201cthere is an urgent need for debt repayment extension for developing countries that are still recovering from the pandemic and also struggling with liquidity challenges.\u201d\n\nHe also called for an inclusive agenda that would build resilience and stability against future shocks; to deliver on the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nHe said: \u201cDeveloping countries have been faced with unsustainable debt burdens even before the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risk of new wave of deepening debt, where vital public financial resources are allocated to external debt servicing and repayments at the expense of domestic health and financing for critical developmental needs.\n\n\u201cI must commend the current initiatives by the international financial institutions and the G20, aimed at significantly mitigating the economic situation of the indebted countries and urge for more efforts in this regard.\n\n\u201cTherefore, there is an urgent need to consider expansion and extension of the Debt Service Suspension Initiative to include all Developing, Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States facing fiscal and liquidity challenges.\n\n\u201cIn addition, a review of the eligibility criteria for debt suspension, including outright cancellation, is needed for countries facing the most severe challenges.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari also took a swipe at the recent coup detat in Mali and Guinea and canvassed the support of the international community to reject the unconstitutional governments in the two West African nations.\n\nHe declared that the recent trend of unconstitutional takeover of power must not be tolerated by the international community.\n\nThe President warned that democratic gains of the past decades in West Africa \u201care now being eroded\u201d due to these negative trends.\n\nHe affirmed Nigeria\u2019s support to efforts by Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), African Union (AU) and the United Nations (UN) to address this growing challenge, saying, \u201cAs leaders of our individual Member-States we need to adhere to the constitutional provisions of our countries, particularly on term limits. This is one area that generates crisis and political tension in our sub-region.\u201d\n\nThe President urged the international community not only to deal with the symptoms of conflict but also the immediate causes of conflicts in the first place.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThese include poor and undemocratic governance, human rights abuses, poverty, ignorance, injustice and inequalities.\u201d\n\nHe renewed his advocacy for equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, outlining steps Nigeria had taken to achieve \u201cmoderate success\u201d in containing the virus and halt its deadly onslaught in the country.\n\nBuhari said: \u201cNigeria remains grateful for the assistance received from our partners and friends all over the world. Vaccination is the key to our safe emergence from the pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe fully support the COVAX initiative from which we have benefitted. We also thank the United States of America, Turkey, India, China, European Union, and others for the vaccines provided.\n\n\u201cDespite the acknowledgement however, I would like to reiterate my call for a fairer and more equitable distribution of vaccines to all countries so that, together, we can fight and contain the pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe rising wave of newer and more contagious strains make this even more urgent. No country can afford the socio-economic implications of prolonged shutdown. It is imperative to underscore that no one is safe until everyone is safe.\u201d\n\nCommenting on international trade, the Nigerian leader canvassed for reforms that would engender recovery from the COVID-19 crisis, build resilience to future shocks and pursue transformative development strategies that can deliver the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nHe said: \u201cNigeria reaffirms that international trade is an engine for development and sustained economic growth, as well as the global eradication of poverty.\n\n\u201cMy delegation would like to reaffirm the critical role that a universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system can play in stimulating economic growth and development. Fair and equitable trade would eventually eliminate the need for aid.\n\n\u201cMy country and indeed all African countries do not intend to stay indefinitely looking for aid. All we need is a fair and equitable system of international trade.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari also reiterated his call for the reforms of the UN Security Council, stressing that inter-governmental negotiation on the issue, was taking too long.\n\n\u201cNo reform of the United Nations system is more urgent than that of the Security Council. Stakeholders around the world are asking how such power could be concentrated, with scant representation.\n\n\u201cWe must avoid going in circles. Consensus has been achieved in some of the elements of this reform, especially that of the representation of Africa on the basis of the Elzuwini consensus and the Sirte Declaration.\n\n\u201cIt is unreasonable to expect unanimity in this matter. The issue, indeed, is about justice, not unanimity. Without justice, the legitimacy (even efficacy) of our organisation is called to question.\n\n\u201cWe can and must make substantial, irreversible progress on Security Council reform in the current session,\u201d he said.\n\nUN Scribe Urges Buhari to Ensure Stability of West Africa\n\nSecretary General of the UN, Antonio Guterres, yesterday called on President Buhari to use his leadership qualities towards ensuring the stability of the West African sub-region.\n\nHe also flayed the recent reversal of democratic fortunes in some West African nations including Guinea, Mali and Chad.\n\nThe UN scribe also commended Buhari for his leadership roles in Africa as well as stabilisation of the West African sub-region.\n\nThe Secretary General spoke at a meeting with the Nigerian President at the sidelines of the 76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly taking place in New York.\n\nAccording to the UN Scribe, Africa, especially West Africa was generally seen as an ocean of stability and good governance, but was deeply concerned at recent reversal of fortunes in democratic rule in some parts of the West African sub-region with coups overturning elected institutions.\n\nHe, therefore, urged Buhari to continue to show leadership as he looks up to Nigeria to help stabilise the sub-region in terms of democracy and good governance.\n\nOn terrorism, Guterres commended the efforts of Nigeria on the global phenomenon, assuring the Nigerian leader of the United Nations\u2019 continued support in her efforts to address the prevailing security and humanitarian challenges that have arisen especially with the Internally Displaced Persons.\n\nIn his remarks, Buhari applauded Gutterres for his global leadership and the success of the 76th Session.\n\nHe assured the UN Scribe that Nigeria had achieved appreciable successes in tackling the insecurity caused by terrorists and bandits.\n\nThe President also thanked him for the global organisation\u2019s intervention in activities towards reducing the effects of Climate Change especially with the support for the Great Green Wall programme, which is aimed at arresting desertification across the Sahel as well as the campaign against deforestation in Nigeria.\n\nPresident Buhari added that Nigeria was ready to support and work closely with the United Nations towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nProtests and Counter-protests\n\nWhile President Buhari was reading his speech at the UN, there were protests and counter-protests outside the headquarters of the United Nations.\n\nWhile one was organised by the Yoruba Nation and Biafra agitators, the other was held by OneNation group.\n\nThe agitators, who held placards with various inscriptions, chanted \u201cUN do something, your silence is killing us\u2019, and \u2018help Nigeria to save lives\u2019 among others.\n\nThey also sang Osun State anthem, noting that they want a referendum\n\nOne of the protesters, identified as TJ, said, \u201cWe want them to know what Nigeria is all about. UN needs to intervene to rescue the situation.\u201d\n\nAnother protester, Omo Oba, said the protest was organised to show that people were oppressed in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis is for all that are oppressed, hungry on the streets of Nigeria, those who want to live a humane lifestyle,\u201d she said.\n\nOn their part, the OneNigeria group held placards promoting the activities of Buhari and preaching unity in Nigeria.\n\nThey displayed placards with inscriptions \u2018Unity in diversity\u2019, and \u2018Nigerians want unity\u2019 among others.\n\nThe Yoruba Nation and Biafra agitators later moved to the Nigerian embassy, to continue their protests.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Says FG\u2019s agency remains overseer of VAT unless appellate court rules otherwise\n\nBennett Oghifo\n\nThe Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed has directed the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) to continue the collection of value added tax (VAT) and advised all Nigerians to pay their VAT to FIRS until the appellate court rules otherwise.\n\nThe Rivers State Government had last month secured a major court victory over the federal government in the collection of VAT in the state, and had gone ahead, along with Lagos State, to enact necessary laws and agencies for the collection of the tax.\n\nBut the Abuja Division of the Court of Appeal on September 10 ordered all parties that had submitted themselves before the court to maintain status quo ante bellum pending the hearing of an application seeking to stay the judgment of the Federal High Court, Port Harcourt.\n\nFollowing the Appeal Court ruling, the Organised Private Sector of Nigeria (OPSN), became confused, and desperately called on the federal government to clear the confusion.\n\nApparently in reaction, the Minister of Finance, in a newspaper advertorial on Thursday, stated the position of the federal government on the rulings, directing the FIRS to continue the collection.\n\nThe minister stated: \u201cThe tax-paying public has been confused about whom to pay VAT to as a result of the Federal High Court\u2019s judgement in Suit No. FHC/PH/CS/149/2020.\n\n\u201cThe Appeal Court\u2019s ruling, halting the execution of the judgement of the Federal High Court required all parties to maintain the status quo ante bellum. As such, FIRS shall continue to administer VAT in all the states of the federation unless the appellate court rules otherwise.\n\n\u201cThe ruling of the Court of Appeal, therefore, implores all taxpayers in all the states to continue to pay their VAT, and for the FIRS to continue to collect VAT on behalf of the government in compliance with the VAT Act.\n\nShe appealed to all parties to stop their litigations in the interest of the nation, stating that the economy had ominous challenges and needed the support of every Nigerian for it not to go under.\n\nAhmed said, \u201cThe uncertainty caused by the recent pronouncements of the Federal High Court, sitting in Rivers State and the subsequent enactment of Value Added Tax (VAT) laws by some states is unnecessary and very regrettable.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian economy, just as the economy of other nations, is facing serious challenges occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\nAccording to her, \u201cGovernment is facing serious revenue challenges and, therefore, this is not the time for litigations, but for all hands to be on deck, to pull through this difficult period.\u201d\n\nThe ruling of the Court of Appeal, she said \u201chas provided the much needed certainty, clarity, and consistency that will enable compliance without disruption to business while final resolution is awaited.\u201d\n\nShe said the federal government \u201cshall continue to update the tax-paying public on this matter as the proceedings unfold at the appellate courts. All businesses are hereby encouraged to continue with their lawful operations.\u201d\n\nThe leaders of the Organised Private Sector of Nigeria (OPSN), had on September 17, spoken in one voice, urging the federal government to make a statement that would clear the VAT confusion.\n\nThey said that the reality and consequences of the controversy \u201cportend grave danger for the business community and by extension, the fragile economic recovery the country had been witnessing in recent times.\u201d\n\nThe OPSN, which is comprised of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), Nigeria Employers\u2019 Consultative Association (NECA), and the Nigeria Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA), the Nigeria Association of Small Scale Industries (NASSI) and the Nigeria Association of Small and Medium Enterprises (NASMEs), said a statement from the federal government would give a clear direction to the business community.\n\nIt said it would also save them the dilemma of remitting their VAT to the wrong government that might necessitate double payment; it would also save them the consequence of paying penalty fees for withholding the remittance of their VAT beyond the due date of Tuesday, September 21, 2021.\n\nThe Chairman of the OPSN, Mr. Taiwo Adeniyi, said: \u201cWe want to pay the VAT. But it is for the government at the centre to make a pronouncement because we do not want the situation where we will pay the VAT to the FIRS and the court will later say that it is state governments that shall collect VAT. We are shouting that the government will give us a direction as to what to do. It is not even late as a pronouncement can be made on Tuesday, September 21.\n\nAdeniyi said that the OPSN was seriously concerned about the consequences of the ongoing controversy over the right of the government to collect VAT in the country, adding that it would be an \u201caberration to punish businesses or make them suffer from the proverbial \u2018two elephants fighting.\u201d\n\nHe said the situation had created an environment of uncertainty, which would negatively affect business competitiveness and sustainability in the country.\n\nThe federal government, through the FIRS by virtue of the Value Added Tax Act of 1993, has been the sole collecting authority of VAT in Nigeria until the Rivers State Government\u2019s court victory, which empowered it to collect VAT from businesses located in the state.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Global supply disruptions aiding rise\n\nEmmanuel Addeh with agency report\n\nA bit of good news came in for the Dollar-strapped Nigerian economy yesterday with the price of Brent crude rising to three-year high amid supply constraints and a drop in crude inventories of the United States, the world\u2019s top oil consumer.\n\nThe global output disruptions forced energy companies to pull large amounts of crude out of inventories.\n\nThe rally was slightly dampened by China\u2019s first public sale of state crude reserves.\n\nBrent futures eventually sold at $78.09 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude sold at $73.98 yesterday evening.\n\nThat was the highest close for Brent since October 2018 and for WTI since July 2021, both for a second day in a row.\n\nIt was the third week of gains for Brent and the fifth for WTI mostly due to U.S. Gulf Coast output disruptions from Hurricane Ida in late August.\n\nU.S. oil refiners were hunting to replace Gulf crude, turning to Iraqi and Canadian oil, traders said.\n\nSome members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, known as OPEC, have struggled to raise output due to under-investment or maintenance delays during the pandemic.\n\nRussia said it would remain a reliable supplier of energy to global markets. But Russian gas giant, Gazprom, had been accused of doing too little to increase its natural gas supplies to Europe, where prices have soared.\n\nIran, which wants to export more oil, said it would return to talks on resuming compliance with the 2015 Iran nuclear deal \u201cvery soon\u201d, but gave no specific date.\n\nEdward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA, said: \u201cExtra Iranian barrels of crude seem unlikely to be a 2021 story,\u201d noting negotiations \u201cwill be a long drawn-out process.\u201d\n\nIn the United States, drillers added 10 oil rigs this week, putting the oil and gas rig count up for a 14th month in a row.\n\nBrent could hit $80 by the end of September due to stock draws, lower OPEC production and stronger Middle East demand, UBS analysts said.\n\nAnalysts at UBS told Reuters that Brent oil price could hit $80 a barrel by the end of September due to stock draws, lower OPEC production and stronger demand in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cWhat still might allow Brent to hit that mark over the coming weeks is the ongoing drop in oil inventories driven by unplanned supply disruptions,\u201d the analysts said.\n\nMarket analysts added that surging natural gas prices were also attracting the rise as the supply shortage of gas could encourage power utilities to shift from gas to oil if winter turns out to be colder this year.\n\nThe rise in crude oil price means an increase in revenue for Nigeria but a headache for the country\u2019s subsidy shortfall payments.\n\nRecently, Mele Kyari, Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), said the supply crisis affecting the natural gas market might push crude oil prices up by $10 a barrel.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "EXPOSED: How Nigerian Government Gave Indicted Cocaine Trafficker Multi-million Dollar Contract To Supply Passports To Citizens",
          "text": "This report exposes the rot, racketeering, ethnic nepotism, complete failure of due diligence, and how an indicted cocaine trafficker has come to control the supply of passports to Nigerian citizens.\n\nThe investigation, which was done by Nigerian journalist, David Hundeyin and reported by West Africa Weekly, delves into how the rot in the system led to an embarrassing scarcity of passports for Nigerians at home and abroad.\n\n\u201cWe acknowledge and apologise for the challenges faced in the past few weeks regarding passport booklets availability. I am glad to inform you that booklets are now available and are being distributed to all our passport issuing centres.\u201d\n\nWith these words on March 31, former Comptroller-General of the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) Babandede verbally signed a cheque that the NIS would subsequently fail to cash. Through the course of his tenure as CG, Nigerians had become used to chronic passport booklet shortage and the associated black market arbitrage, but the shortage had become acute by 2021. He needed to make a statement to reaffirm his competence.\n\nSpeaking at the commissioning of the Maitama Passport Express Centre - itself a master class in formalised black market arbitrage - Babandede made that statement, and then some. A special team would be dispatched to \u201cfacilitate enrollment and production\u201d of passports across Nigeria and its foreign missions. New passport offices to service air passengers would be sited at the airports in Lagos, Kano and Abuja. The new \u201cpremium passport processing centre\u201d in Abuja would cut the length of passport issuance and renewal from several weeks to just 72 hours.\n\nUltimately, Babandede\u2019s statement turned out to be just that - a statement.\n\nFrom when he made these pronouncements until his retirement earlier this month, passport booklets continued to be a scarce and expensive commodity in Nigeria. Several factors were blamed for the baffling inability of Africa\u2019s most populous country to provide passports for its citizens. Chronic corruption at the NIS; disputes between the NIS and a private contractor responsible for printing booklets; scarcity of forex to pay for security printing materials; even an alleged unofficial government policy to stem brain drain by making passports hard to access - all these have variously been blamed for this state of affairs.\n\nAs is so often the case in Nigeria, no theory or explanation should be dismissed out of hand, which is why when I set out to find out what is really behind the perennial shortage of these little green booklets, I was prepared for anything. Or at least I thought I was. What would emerge as I sank my teeth into this however, was not a story about supply chain disruptions or government inefficiencies. It was nothing like I had ever seen before, which is saying something.\n\nThink Transformers meets Black Mirror meets Karishika, with protagonists who are part Elon Musk, part Lawrence Anini and part Bakin Zuwo. There is a murder in New York; a million dollar cocaine deal in Bogot\u00e1. Court cases in New Jersey; a legitimate high tech manufacturing operation in Kuala Lumpur; art exhibitions in Lagos; high society marriages; prominent placement in lifestyle and celebrity magazines, and the most comically brazen lawbreaking hidden in plain sight. If this story were a movie, it would be the conceptual offspring of Michael Bay and Ugezu J. Ugezu, which is to say, low on plot and purpose, but high on sheer crash-bang value.\n\nThere are 3 main characters in this story. Their existence and relevance was determined after speaking to 5 different sources within the NIS ecosystem. These 3, more than any other people, have had the most influence on passport issuance and the wider state of the Immigration Service. Unsurprisingly, the first name on the list is immediate past CG Muhammad Babandede.\n\nNone of my sources have any especially nice words to say about him, but neither do they have any bitter personal complaints either. The impression that comes through about Babandede is that of a fundamentally limited man who is neither virtuous nor especially malevolent. As one of the sources puts it frankly:\n\n\u201cHe tried to make some moves such as the passport express centres, but it didn\u2019t work out because he was just there to make money before he retired. He didn\u2019t really care about fixing any systemic issues like staff motivation or the ISTL contract. All that one was not his business.\u201d\n\nThe sources inform me that under Babandede\u2019s tenure, complete opacity was institutionalised, with Immigration officers now not even knowing how much to expect on their payslip at the end of the month. Apparently during his tenure, NIS staff were migrated to the Integrated Payroll and Personnel information system (IPPIS), and with that went any sort of transparency regarding staff pay scales, deductions and entitlements. As a source colourfully puts it during one of our long conversations:\n\n\u201cIt has now got to the point that you don\u2019t know what will come in at the end of the month, and whatever it is that comes in - you just have to take it like that. The deductions vary every month so we don\u2019t know how much we will take home. So tell me as a man with people depending on you, how else will you survive if not through \u2018egunje\u2019 (bribes)?\u201d\n\nWhile the sources mention different things that Babandede could have done to protect NIS staff welfare and morale, they all have one consistent criticism of him - his alleged ethnocentric posting policy. During his tenure they say, desirable NIS postings such as NIS offices in Lagos, were given exclusively to northerners, while the southerners working there were all posted out. The Ikoyi immigration office I am told, is now staffed almost exclusively by northerners - a state of affairs that would be impossible if the roles were reversed.\n\nUnder Babandede and even in these early days of his successor Idris Jere, the sources say, many northerners in the NIS, encouraged by the prebendalist disposition of their superiors, are keen to let everyone know that it is \u201ctheir turn\u201d and they are in power. Following Idris Jere\u2019s appointment a source claims, the next most senior Deputy Comptroller - a southerner from Lagos - who might have been next in line to succeed Jere, was promptly transferred to Sokoto. At press time, I have been unable to independently verify this.\n\nThe other name that every source mentions is a certain \u201cLiman\u201d at the Ikoyi Passport Office. None of the sources bothers to hide how they feel about this fellow. This man and his extreme racketeering they say, is one of the major reasons behind Nigeria\u2019s passport shortage. A bit of research brings up his name as Abdullahi I. Liman, a Deputy Comptroller in charge of the Ikoyi Passport Command of the NIS.\n\nEvery single source has a terrible story to tell about Abdullahi Liman. Liman they say, is responsible for the northernisation of the Ikoyi Passport Command. Even worse one source tells me, under Liman\u2019s tenure, the atmosphere at the Command has taken on explicitly polarised ethnic and religious overtones. Take this anecdote from one of the sources for example:\n\n\u201cYou can imagine that you are in the middle of doing a capture, then all of a sudden your colleague who is also capturing will just stand up and leave his station with a crowd of people there - because he says he is going to pray. You now end up doing his work for him, can you imagine that? This did not happen before Liman came in.\u201d\n\nLiman they say, is in the habit of pointedly using Hausa to converse with his subordinates at work, which automatically puts every southerner working under his command at a real career disadvantage. Speaking English - or in fact any other language but Hausa - at work is now a career demerit at the Ikoyi Passport Command under Liman\u2019s watch.\n\nA few days after I speak to this source, this story by the Foundation for Investigative Journalism was published, detailing persecution of a southern NIS officer at the Ikoyi Command in the exact ways described by my sources. Notice the reporter\u2019s description of his interaction with Liman.\n\nUp to this point, I have relied on testimony from sources I consider trustworthy, but even their knowledge of affairs at the NIS has its limits. While people like Abdullahi Liman are running rackets within the NIS to restrict access to passport booklets in large population centres like Lagos so as to create a lucrative black market, the sources are also clear that they believe that the NIS simply does not have enough passport booklets. To truly understand why the NIS appears to have not just a distribution problem, but also a supply problem with passport booklets, I had to figure out whose interests were served by the status quo.\n\nFirst, a brief primer on how Nigeria\u2019s passport system works.\n\nStarting in 2003, Nigeria adopted the e-passport standard to defeat counterfeiting, resulting in a contract awarded to IRIS Smart Technologies Limited (ISTL) which commenced in 2007. The scope of the contract was to implement the Nigeria Harmonised ECOWAS Electronic (SMART) Passport Autogate Systems as well as to supply e-passport booklets, wafers, laminates and maintenance services from 2006 and 2015. ISTL is affiliated with Malaysia\u2019s Iris Corp, which carries out the actual security printing services including supply of e-passport booklets.\n\nThe services that ISTL renders to the NIS include creating and maintaining the electronic database containing the passport details of Nigerian citizens, as well as maintaining the communication infrastructure that keeps a constant uplink between passport registration offices and the ISTL data centre. In case the reader has not seen the problem with this, allow me to spell it out clearly:\n\nA private company working for a profit incentive has full and unrestricted access to the sensitive data of all Nigerian passport holders, but more importantly, it alone has access to this data. In other words, ISTL has more access to passport holders\u2019 data than the NIS itself. ISTL does not actually produce passport booklets, but sub-contracts production to the Malaysian firm Iris Corp. Essentially, this company that most people have never heard of, controls a valuable sovereign database exclusively, and all it has to do is maintain a few dozen closed VSAT links from passport registration centres. Essentially, tech support.\n\nThis in fact caused a row between the NIS and the company in 2017 when the 10-year contract came up for renewal. Speaking to Daily Trust in 2017, some NIS insiders claimed the following: That the initial contract was a threat to national security because it vests control of the Country Signing Certification Authority (CSCA) - an official government seal - in ISTL, instead of the Nigerian government, which on paper is a risk factor for fraud;\n\nThat its implementation did not follow due process;\n\nThat the database and other infrastructure was paid for by the Nigerian government, but ISTL holds on to government property and uses tactics such as refusing to train NIS officers in the management of the system as a way to strong-arm the government into renewing its contract;\n\nThat NIS officers cannot conduct basic maintenance and repairs on the ISTL systems, meaning that the Nigerian government cannot withdraw from the ISTL contract without incurring catastrophic costs, which violates public procurement regulations;\n\nThat the contract had questionable exclusion clauses that gave undue advantage to ISTL at the expense of the Nigerian taxpayer.\n\nThe Malaysian company subcontracted by ISTL to print the booklets meanwhile, has found itself facing corruption probes by Malaysian authorities over its activities in other African e-passport jurisdictions such as Guinea. So putting this picture together, we have a tech support company that has somehow wrangled its way into a $138 million 10-year government contract (which was eventually renewed in 2019). Its main activity is maintaining equipment and an electronic database, and it sub-contracts passport booklet printing to a company halfway around the world whose executives have been arrested on corruption charges.\n\nFor the purpose of balance, it must be pointed out that the $138 million figure is not paid by the government, but rather comes from the company\u2019s revenue generation activities within the scope of the e-passport project. It is also important to point out that the criticisms of the ISTL contract were possibly made in bad faith by individuals who merely wanted to replace ISTL with their own companies. Indeed, the senior NIS official quoted by the Daily Trust in 2017 remarked, \u201c[The controversy] is between contractors who want the contract. The NIS\u2019 concern is simply the supply of the booklets.\u201d\n\nIt is also important to mention that the cost of sub-contracting Iris Corp to print the booklets is paid is USD, while ISTL\u2019s revenue comes in naira, with the CBN refusing to provide forex for the company. This I am reliably informed, is the material reason behind the chronic booklet shortages since 2017 - the cost of printing passport booklets has more than doubled in dollar terms since 2015. Hence, ISTL simply cannot afford to print as many booklets as before.\n\nWith that being said, we now know that there is an incredibly lucky or powerful entity behind ISTL. Who is this person? This is where the story really takes a few turns, so hold on to your hats.\n\nHigh Society Gentleman or Ex-Cocaine Trafficker?\n\nOn its website, ISTL describes itself as a \u201cmajor subsidiary of the flagship company, Image Technologies Limited (Imagetech).\u201d A quick CAC database check on Imagetech brings up the elusive character behind the curtain.\n\nFor a Lagos socialite, Olayinka Fisher is a man who somehow keeps a decidedly low profile. For one thing, while researching this story, establishing what exactly his name is turns out to be quite the task. In some places, he is \u201cYinka Fisher.\u201d In some other places, he is \u201cOlayinka Fisher.\u201d In still other places, he is \u201cOlayinka Fischer\u201d or \u201cSonayon Fisher.\u201d Only in a few places that he would rather the world did not know about, does his full and correctly spelled government name appear: \u201cOlayinka Sonayon Fisher.\u201d So who is this guy and what is there to him?\n\nQuite a bit, as it turns out.\n\nThe story starts in Mr. Fisher\u2019s previous iteration as a high flying Nigerian diplomat in in mid-to-late 1970s. At the time, when he was still known to the world as Olayinka Sonayon Fisher, he was the Second Secretary of the Nigerian Mission to the United Nations.\n\nResearching the many variants of his name online, references to his diplomatic career can be seen right up until about 1980 when he seems to vanish off the face of the historical earth. In 1989, he resurfaces on CAC documents in Nigeria as the majority shareholder in a new company called Imagetech. Presumably at this point, the high-achieving diplomat has decided to pivot into a career in tech entrepreneurship. Nigeria being what it is, nobody ever really bothers to ask why, and by 2003 he is signing the contract above for ISTL under President Olusegun Obasanjo.\n\nThe good times are rolling. Following the end of his marriage to River State scion Doris Amachree, he weds Dr. Pius Okigbo\u2019s daughter Anne. He becomes an avid art collector and patron of the arts. He hosts art exhibitions with the Spanish Embassy in Lagos, which are co-curated by both of his sons who share his love of the visual arts. To all intents and purposes, he is the SI unit of the classy and respectable old money Lagosian. There\u2019s just one problem:\n\nAccording to U.S. court records, Mr. Fisher allegedly used to be part of an intercontinental cocaine smuggling ring.\n\nI obtain the following documents from the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. They detail court proceedings from a 1983 case involving a violent drug dealer wanted for a murder in the Bronx, New York, a successful American businessman who dabbled into the illegal drug business with him, and a Nigerian diplomat who used his diplomatic immunity to traffic shipments of cocaine into the U.S. on their behalf.\n\nThe diplomat\u2019s name? A certain Olayinka Sonayon Fisher.\n\nAccording to Tracy Wong, the indicted American businessman, he paid Fisher the sum of $50,000 for a single shipment. The indictment further states that this arrangement lasted for at least 2 years with multiple Cocaine trafficking trips made worth several million dollars. Exactly how much Fisher made from this arrangement in total is a question only he can answer, but it certainly raises a few interesting questions.\n\nPerhaps the most telling part of this story is that following the release of this NYT article and his subsequent exit from the diplomatic corps, Fisher appears to have intentionally dropped all mention of \u201cSonayon\u201d from his name. In fact, it took the extraordinary step of making a few calls to my hometown Badagry, where the name \u201cSonayon\u201d also originates from, to confirm his identity. The fact that this has somehow slipped under the radar for decades despite his custody of one of the most sensitive databases in Nigeria is a sign of a catastrophic failure of state intelligence and due diligence.\n\nMaking this point further, I speak to a lawyer, Solomon Igberaese to give his professional opinion of this issue. He points out that according to the Public Procurement Act 2007, someone with Fisher\u2019s background should have been disqualified from the public procurement process. In his words:\n\n\u201cFalsification of fact can be interpreted to also include drug trafficking. Carrying out drug trafficking under any other guise will constitute falsification of fact. That he concealed packages inside diplomatic pouches certainly qualifies as falsification of fact. Again the section said falsification of facts relating to any matter.\u201d\n\nSo there we have it - possibly the most mind-bending story in Nigeria\u2019s rich history of dodgy public procurement and contracting. For added measure, the third person in the drug ring, a career drug dealer called Joseph Anthony Margarite was also wanted in connection with a murder at the time of his involvement with Wong and Fisher.\n\nThe full and unredacted set of court records relating to this case is available here.\n\nIf you enjoyed this story and you want to see more in-depth investigative work like this, kindly support independent journalism by purchasing a subscription using the button below.",

          "text": "This report exposes the rot, racketeering, ethnic nepotism, complete failure of due diligence, and how an indicted cocaine trafficker has come to control the supply of passports to Nigerian citizens.\n\nThe investigation, which was done by Nigerian journalist, David Hundeyin and reported by West Africa Weekly, delves into how the rot in the system led to an embarrassing scarcity of passports for Nigerians at home and abroad.\n\n\u201cWe acknowledge and apologise for the challenges faced in the past few weeks regarding passport booklets availability. I am glad to inform you that booklets are now available and are being distributed to all our passport issuing centres.\u201d\n\nWith these words on March 31, former Comptroller-General of the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) Babandede verbally signed a cheque that the NIS would subsequently fail to cash. Through the course of his tenure as CG, Nigerians had become used to chronic passport booklet shortage and the associated black market arbitrage, but the shortage had become acute by 2021. He needed to make a statement to reaffirm his competence.\n\nSpeaking at the commissioning of the Maitama Passport Express Centre - itself a master class in formalised black market arbitrage - Babandede made that statement, and then some. A special team would be dispatched to \u201cfacilitate enrollment and production\u201d of passports across Nigeria and its foreign missions. New passport offices to service air passengers would be sited at the airports in Lagos, Kano and Abuja. The new \u201cpremium passport processing centre\u201d in Abuja would cut the length of passport issuance and renewal from several weeks to just 72 hours.\n\nUltimately, Babandede\u2019s statement turned out to be just that - a statement.\n\nFrom when he made these pronouncements until his retirement earlier this month, passport booklets continued to be a scarce and expensive commodity in Nigeria. Several factors were blamed for the baffling inability of Africa\u2019s most populous country to provide passports for its citizens. Chronic corruption at the NIS; disputes between the NIS and a private contractor responsible for printing booklets; scarcity of forex to pay for security printing materials; even an alleged unofficial government policy to stem brain drain by making passports hard to access - all these have variously been blamed for this state of affairs.\n\nAs is so often the case in Nigeria, no theory or explanation should be dismissed out of hand, which is why when I set out to find out what is really behind the perennial shortage of these little green booklets, I was prepared for anything. Or at least I thought I was. What would emerge as I sank my teeth into this however, was not a story about supply chain disruptions or government inefficiencies. It was nothing like I had ever seen before, which is saying something.\n\nThink Transformers meets Black Mirror meets Karishika, with protagonists who are part Elon Musk, part Lawrence Anini and part Bakin Zuwo. There is a murder in New York; a million dollar cocaine deal in Bogot\u00e1. Court cases in New Jersey; a legitimate high tech manufacturing operation in Kuala Lumpur; art exhibitions in Lagos; high society marriages; prominent placement in lifestyle and celebrity magazines, and the most comically brazen lawbreaking hidden in plain sight. If this story were a movie, it would be the conceptual offspring of Michael Bay and Ugezu J. Ugezu, which is to say, low on plot and purpose, but high on sheer crash-bang value.\n\nThere are 3 main characters in this story. Their existence and relevance was determined after speaking to 5 different sources within the NIS ecosystem. These 3, more than any other people, have had the most influence on passport issuance and the wider state of the Immigration Service. Unsurprisingly, the first name on the list is immediate past CG Muhammad Babandede.\n\nNone of my sources have any especially nice words to say about him, but neither do they have any bitter personal complaints either. The impression that comes through about Babandede is that of a fundamentally limited man who is neither virtuous nor especially malevolent. As one of the sources puts it frankly:\n\n\u201cHe tried to make some moves such as the passport express centres, but it didn\u2019t work out because he was just there to make money before he retired. He didn\u2019t really care about fixing any systemic issues like staff motivation or the ISTL contract. All that one was not his business.\u201d\n\nThe sources inform me that under Babandede\u2019s tenure, complete opacity was institutionalised, with Immigration officers now not even knowing how much to expect on their payslip at the end of the month. Apparently during his tenure, NIS staff were migrated to the Integrated Payroll and Personnel information system (IPPIS), and with that went any sort of transparency regarding staff pay scales, deductions and entitlements. As a source colourfully puts it during one of our long conversations:\n\n\u201cIt has now got to the point that you don\u2019t know what will come in at the end of the month, and whatever it is that comes in - you just have to take it like that. The deductions vary every month so we don\u2019t know how much we will take home. So tell me as a man with people depending on you, how else will you survive if not through \u2018egunje\u2019 (bribes)?\u201d\n\nWhile the sources mention different things that Babandede could have done to protect NIS staff welfare and morale, they all have one consistent criticism of him - his alleged ethnocentric posting policy. During his tenure they say, desirable NIS postings such as NIS offices in Lagos, were given exclusively to northerners, while the southerners working there were all posted out. The Ikoyi immigration office I am told, is now staffed almost exclusively by northerners - a state of affairs that would be impossible if the roles were reversed.\n\nUnder Babandede and even in these early days of his successor Idris Jere, the sources say, many northerners in the NIS, encouraged by the prebendalist disposition of their superiors, are keen to let everyone know that it is \u201ctheir turn\u201d and they are in power. Following Idris Jere\u2019s appointment a source claims, the next most senior Deputy Comptroller - a southerner from Lagos - who might have been next in line to succeed Jere, was promptly transferred to Sokoto. At press time, I have been unable to independently verify this.\n\nThe other name that every source mentions is a certain \u201cLiman\u201d at the Ikoyi Passport Office. None of the sources bothers to hide how they feel about this fellow. This man and his extreme racketeering they say, is one of the major reasons behind Nigeria\u2019s passport shortage. A bit of research brings up his name as Abdullahi I. Liman, a Deputy Comptroller in charge of the Ikoyi Passport Command of the NIS.\n\nEvery single source has a terrible story to tell about Abdullahi Liman. Liman they say, is responsible for the northernisation of the Ikoyi Passport Command. Even worse one source tells me, under Liman\u2019s tenure, the atmosphere at the Command has taken on explicitly polarised ethnic and religious overtones. Take this anecdote from one of the sources for example:\n\n\u201cYou can imagine that you are in the middle of doing a capture, then all of a sudden your colleague who is also capturing will just stand up and leave his station with a crowd of people there - because he says he is going to pray. You now end up doing his work for him, can you imagine that? This did not happen before Liman came in.\u201d\n\nLiman they say, is in the habit of pointedly using Hausa to converse with his subordinates at work, which automatically puts every southerner working under his command at a real career disadvantage. Speaking English - or in fact any other language but Hausa - at work is now a career demerit at the Ikoyi Passport Command under Liman\u2019s watch.\n\nA few days after I speak to this source, this story by the Foundation for Investigative Journalism was published, detailing persecution of a southern NIS officer at the Ikoyi Command in the exact ways described by my sources. Notice the reporter\u2019s description of his interaction with Liman.\n\nUp to this point, I have relied on testimony from sources I consider trustworthy, but even their knowledge of affairs at the NIS has its limits. While people like Abdullahi Liman are running rackets within the NIS to restrict access to passport booklets in large population centres like Lagos so as to create a lucrative black market, the sources are also clear that they believe that the NIS simply does not have enough passport booklets. To truly understand why the NIS appears to have not just a distribution problem, but also a supply problem with passport booklets, I had to figure out whose interests were served by the status quo.\n\nFirst, a brief primer on how Nigeria\u2019s passport system works.\n\nStarting in 2003, Nigeria adopted the e-passport standard to defeat counterfeiting, resulting in a contract awarded to IRIS Smart Technologies Limited (ISTL) which commenced in 2007. The scope of the contract was to implement the Nigeria Harmonised ECOWAS Electronic (SMART) Passport Autogate Systems as well as to supply e-passport booklets, wafers, laminates and maintenance services from 2006 and 2015. ISTL is affiliated with Malaysia\u2019s Iris Corp, which carries out the actual security printing services including supply of e-passport booklets.\n\nThe services that ISTL renders to the NIS include creating and maintaining the electronic database containing the passport details of Nigerian citizens, as well as maintaining the communication infrastructure that keeps a constant uplink between passport registration offices and the ISTL data centre. In case the reader has not seen the problem with this, allow me to spell it out clearly:\n\nA private company working for a profit incentive has full and unrestricted access to the sensitive data of all Nigerian passport holders, but more importantly, it alone has access to this data. In other words, ISTL has more access to passport holders\u2019 data than the NIS itself. ISTL does not actually produce passport booklets, but sub-contracts production to the Malaysian firm Iris Corp. Essentially, this company that most people have never heard of, controls a valuable sovereign database exclusively, and all it has to do is maintain a few dozen closed VSAT links from passport registration centres. Essentially, tech support.\n\nThis in fact caused a row between the NIS and the company in 2017 when the 10-year contract came up for renewal. Speaking to Daily Trust in 2017, some NIS insiders claimed the following: That the initial contract was a threat to national security because it vests control of the Country Signing Certification Authority (CSCA) - an official government seal - in ISTL, instead of the Nigerian government, which on paper is a risk factor for fraud;\n\nThat its implementation did not follow due process;\n\nThat the database and other infrastructure was paid for by the Nigerian government, but ISTL holds on to government property and uses tactics such as refusing to train NIS officers in the management of the system as a way to strong-arm the government into renewing its contract;\n\nThat NIS officers cannot conduct basic maintenance and repairs on the ISTL systems, meaning that the Nigerian government cannot withdraw from the ISTL contract without incurring catastrophic costs, which violates public procurement regulations;\n\nThat the contract had questionable exclusion clauses that gave undue advantage to ISTL at the expense of the Nigerian taxpayer.\n\nThe Malaysian company subcontracted by ISTL to print the booklets meanwhile, has found itself facing corruption probes by Malaysian authorities over its activities in other African e-passport jurisdictions such as Guinea. So putting this picture together, we have a tech support company that has somehow wrangled its way into a $138 million 10-year government contract (which was eventually renewed in 2019). Its main activity is maintaining equipment and an electronic database, and it sub-contracts passport booklet printing to a company halfway around the world whose executives have been arrested on corruption charges.\n\nFor the purpose of balance, it must be pointed out that the $138 million figure is not paid by the government, but rather comes from the company\u2019s revenue generation activities within the scope of the e-passport project. It is also important to point out that the criticisms of the ISTL contract were possibly made in bad faith by individuals who merely wanted to replace ISTL with their own companies. Indeed, the senior NIS official quoted by the Daily Trust in 2017 remarked, \u201c[The controversy] is between contractors who want the contract. The NIS\u2019 concern is simply the supply of the booklets.\u201d\n\nIt is also important to mention that the cost of sub-contracting Iris Corp to print the booklets is paid is USD, while ISTL\u2019s revenue comes in naira, with the CBN refusing to provide forex for the company. This I am reliably informed, is the material reason behind the chronic booklet shortages since 2017 - the cost of printing passport booklets has more than doubled in dollar terms since 2015. Hence, ISTL simply cannot afford to print as many booklets as before.\n\nWith that being said, we now know that there is an incredibly lucky or powerful entity behind ISTL. Who is this person? This is where the story really takes a few turns, so hold on to your hats.\n\nHigh Society Gentleman or Ex-Cocaine Trafficker?\n\nOn its website, ISTL describes itself as a \u201cmajor subsidiary of the flagship company, Image Technologies Limited (Imagetech).\u201d A quick CAC database check on Imagetech brings up the elusive character behind the curtain.\n\nFor a Lagos socialite, Olayinka Fisher is a man who somehow keeps a decidedly low profile. For one thing, while researching this story, establishing what exactly his name is turns out to be quite the task. In some places, he is \u201cYinka Fisher.\u201d In some other places, he is \u201cOlayinka Fisher.\u201d In still other places, he is \u201cOlayinka Fischer\u201d or \u201cSonayon Fisher.\u201d Only in a few places that he would rather the world did not know about, does his full and correctly spelled government name appear: \u201cOlayinka Sonayon Fisher.\u201d So who is this guy and what is there to him?\n\nQuite a bit, as it turns out.\n\nThe story starts in Mr. Fisher\u2019s previous iteration as a high flying Nigerian diplomat in in mid-to-late 1970s. At the time, when he was still known to the world as Olayinka Sonayon Fisher, he was the Second Secretary of the Nigerian Mission to the United Nations.\n\nResearching the many variants of his name online, references to his diplomatic career can be seen right up until about 1980 when he seems to vanish off the face of the historical earth. In 1989, he resurfaces on CAC documents in Nigeria as the majority shareholder in a new company called Imagetech. Presumably at this point, the high-achieving diplomat has decided to pivot into a career in tech entrepreneurship. Nigeria being what it is, nobody ever really bothers to ask why, and by 2003 he is signing the contract above for ISTL under President Olusegun Obasanjo.\n\nThe good times are rolling. Following the end of his marriage to River State scion Doris Amachree, he weds Dr. Pius Okigbo\u2019s daughter Anne. He becomes an avid art collector and patron of the arts. He hosts art exhibitions with the Spanish Embassy in Lagos, which are co-curated by both of his sons who share his love of the visual arts. To all intents and purposes, he is the SI unit of the classy and respectable old money Lagosian. There\u2019s just one problem:\n\nAccording to U.S. court records, Mr. Fisher allegedly used to be part of an intercontinental cocaine smuggling ring.\n\nI obtain the following documents from the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. They detail court proceedings from a 1983 case involving a violent drug dealer wanted for a murder in the Bronx, New York, a successful American businessman who dabbled into the illegal drug business with him, and a Nigerian diplomat who used his diplomatic immunity to traffic shipments of cocaine into the U.S. on their behalf.\n\nThe diplomat\u2019s name? A certain Olayinka Sonayon Fisher.\n\nAccording to Tracy Wong, the indicted American businessman, he paid Fisher the sum of $50,000 for a single shipment. The indictment further states that this arrangement lasted for at least 2 years with multiple Cocaine trafficking trips made worth several million dollars. Exactly how much Fisher made from this arrangement in total is a question only he can answer, but it certainly raises a few interesting questions.\n\nPerhaps the most telling part of this story is that following the release of this NYT article and his subsequent exit from the diplomatic corps, Fisher appears to have intentionally dropped all mention of \u201cSonayon\u201d from his name. In fact, it took the extraordinary step of making a few calls to my hometown Badagry, where the name \u201cSonayon\u201d also originates from, to confirm his identity. The fact that this has somehow slipped under the radar for decades despite his custody of one of the most sensitive databases in Nigeria is a sign of a catastrophic failure of state intelligence and due diligence.\n\nMaking this point further, I speak to a lawyer, Solomon Igberaese to give his professional opinion of this issue.

Zilch!\u201d\n\nHe further stated that Nigerian university senate members have produced rigged elections results without achieving academic breakthroughs.\n\nHis post reads, \u201cThis bizarre, backward and belligerently insane memo emanated from a Nigerian University, to be specific, this nonsense, was released from Adekunle Ajasin University in ONDO state.\n\n\u201cThis state is always touted to have produced some of the best brains in Nigeria and now the Senate of the University must have recently appointed a \u201cHisbah\u201d commander as its Vice Chancellor and the only thing the university could do was turn its Senate into a Fashion Police force.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t get worse than this. There is something wrong with the crop of leaders managing every aspect of Nigeria\u2019s institutions life. How on earth do you RUSTICATE a student for one semester for INDECENT dressing?\n\n\u201cEvery member of that University Senate who signed up to this rubbish should be fired for indecent reasoning! And as for the students, I dare say, RESISTANCE is your best bet! Aluta Continua! #RevolutionNow\n\n\"...I became a student of UNILAG in 1989 and left in 1995, there was never a time the University of Lagos authorities imposed a dress code on students. I can\u2019t speak to what the mini tyrants did after we left. Prof. Nuruddeen Alao (A Muslim Scholar was our Vice Chancellor - Not a great fan of his but he never imposed any moral codes on campus).\n\n\u201cULSU President, Olusegun Maiyegun wore his dreadlocks with pride. He would wear hats/caps to cover it because of DSS when leaving and returning to campus. I still see him wear hats over his dreads these days. We followed \u201cRedDrum\u201d as he was then popularly known, everywhere.\n\n\u201cWe use to wear bathroom flip flops to class. No one dare ask us how to dress to class or on campus. It did not happen. Except you attended a different UNILAG in the 90\u2019s. UNILAG students partied very hard (reason it was nicknamed \u201cEko-For-Show\u201d) students organised beauty pageants on campus and even produced Nigeria\u2019s \u201cMost Beautiful Girl\u201d at some point, I think her name was Sandra Petgrave, a student from Economics department. You could imagine that she couldn\u2019t have \u201cdecently\u201d dressed to win that title.\n\n\u201dUniversities worldwide are not for enforcement of moral codes, they are places of research and learning. The content of a person\u2019s character can\u2019t be defined by the nature of their dress.\n\n\u201cNigerian university senate members have only produced rigged elections results in the last 20 years or more. They haven\u2019t had much academic breakthroughs; check the rankings of the best 1000 universities in the world tell me if anyone of them have dress codes, except in strictly religious nation states. Nigeria is a secular state.\n\n\u201cI spent two years studying at Columbia University in New York City, in front of the main admin building you would find female students on the stairwell sunbathing (tanning) during the summer months, topless. You have no business asking them why they\u2019re doing so.\n\n\u201cIt is their right. I\u2019ve heard of nude colonies in some universities in California, yet they produce the cell phones you use and most of the hardware and software that drives your life. They are the same adults in Silicon Valley.\n\n\"They have what they call \u201cSpringbreaks\u201d an annual ritual by and for students broadcast to the world via channels like MTV. The world has moved past Primordial Stone Age patriarchal /matriarchal chauvinists and moral guardians, they do these because you egg them on by falling for their tricks.\n\n\u201cTell me what the decently dressed thieves have done for you and your country all these years. Zilch! These jobless Senate at Adekunle Ajasin University in Ondo state ought to be disowned, dissolved and disbanded with immediate effect. I thank you!\u201d\n\nThe management of the school, in a circular dated September 7, 2021 threatened to rusticate any student involved in any form of indecent dressing.\n\nIt states that anyone who fails to comply with the directive will be rusticated from the school for a semester.\n\nThe circular with reference number AD/ REG//CIR/58/VOL. VI/309 was signed by the registrar of the school, Olugbenga Arajulu.\n\n\u201cThis is to inform you that the Senate had at its 171st Regular Meeting of Wednesday, 25th August 2021, observed and frowned at (sic) the high rate of indecent dressing among the students of Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba-Akoko, Ondo State.\n\n\u201cFor clarity of purposes, indecent dressing includes, but not limited, to the following: wearing of skimpy skirts and blouses; leaving the cleavages open by female students; and wearing of braids or dreadlocks, earrings, nose rings, tattered jeans, sagging, etc, by some male students.\n\n\u201cAfter thorough deliberation on the issue, the Senate, in its wisdom, decided that the penalty for indecent dressing shall henceforth be rustication for one semester, effective from 25th August, 2021.\n\n\u201cAny student of Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba-Akoko who violates the above Senate decision on indecent dressing is deemed to have committed a misconduct and he/she shall be sanctioned accordingly.\u201d",

          "text": "ChatBots Africa and Fashtracker have been announced as winners of the partnership and investment pitch sessions, respectively, organised by TechCabal as part of the \u2018Future of Commerce\u2019 conference.\n\nHeld on Friday, 24th of September, the partnership pitch session saw a total of three growth-stage startups pitch to corporate organizations for potential partnerships while the investment version involved four early-stage startups pitching to potential investors.\n\nBoth companies emerged as winners, selected by a panel of judges that comprised leading tech personalities in Africa; including the likes of Tomi Davies, Yemi Keri, and Uwem Uwemakpan. As winners, each of the startups gets \u20a6500,000 worth of TechCabal coverage.\n\n\u201cFor my team and I, winning at the pitching session validates our vision for the future of e-commerce in Africa, that is, conversational and social commerce,\u201d Ronald Tagoe, Founder of ChatBots Africa, told TechCabal. \u201cWe are very elated by this validation and look forward to an exciting future.\u201d\n\nBased in Kenya, ChatBots is a multi-channel bot platform that allows companies to use AI chatbots on WhatsApp. According to the company, the solution is built for all ranges of experiences; from the complete newbie to the advanced user.\n\nAccording to Tagoe, the startup won because the solution and business model were \u201cvery clear and the customers\u2019 pain point was something the judges gravitated towards.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFor Wunmi Akinsola, CEO and founder of Fashtracker, winning the investment pitch session represents \u201ca major validation\u201d for the startup.\n\nNigeria-based Fashtracker connects trusted and sustainable African fashion brands to people within and outside the continent through its online platform. \u201cWe aim to be the go-to fashion destination within Africa, and globally, for African brands,\u201d a statement on the company\u2019s website reads.\n\n\u201cI feel super motivated to keep building Fashtracker,\u201d the elated founder said. \u201cThe fact that Techcabal, the investors, and other stakeholders involved bought into the idea from a 2-minute pitch is a major validation that is a necessary component for the success of any startup.\u201d\n\nAkinsola believes certain factors propelled the judges to select the startup as the winner; such as the fact that the African fashion marketplace is \u201crelatively untapped and is a huge opportunity\u201d considering the barriers to entry such as logistics, payments, and scale, are already being solved.\n\n\u201cThere are too many opportunities for scalable integrations including menswear, skincare, B2B, Saas, VAS, and this could all be on a Pan African/Global-scale if done right,\u201d she adds.\n\nIn addition, Akinsola notes that startups like Fashtracker have the capacity to alleviate thousands of creatives, and fashion entrepreneurs economically. \u201cEspecially during such tough times in Nigeria \u2013 economic prosperity is key.\u201d\n\nA screenshot of ChatBots Africa website. Image credit: TechCabal\n\nTagged the #FutureOfCommerce2021, the high-production event enabled registered stakeholders to learn the shifts in the industry and buying behaviour, and how they can better prepare to take advantage of the rising tide, whether as organizations or individuals.\n\nThe hybrid conference brought together startups, investors, banks, telecoms companies, FMCGs, policymakers, small businesses, tech enthusiasts, and everyday consumers to discuss their thoughts and predictions around all the changes coming to how people buy and sell on the continent.\n\n\u201cThe organisation (TechCabal) is top-notch and the ideas and insights shared were thought-provoking,\u201d Tagoe said when asked about the Future of Commerce. \u201cThumbs up to the team. I look forward to attending in person next year.\u201d\n\nA screenshot of the Fashtracker website.

          "title": "What will commerce look like in Africa over the next decade?",
          "text": "With Covid-19 restrictions forcing more people to shop online, e-commerce companies and platforms on the continent have enjoyed a surge in activity. Jumia, for instance, saw a significant uptick in major indicators in the second half of last year. Also, retailers that did not previously have an online presence were compelled to do so.\n\nThe pandemic essentially propelled widespread growth in African e-commerce. However, there are questions of whether that growth can be sustained in the long run. Juliet Anammah, Group Chief Sustainability Officer and Chairperson of Jumia Nigeria thinks it can.\n\n\u201cThe boom in e-commerce is not just a function of the pandemic,\u201d she says during a panel discussion at the ongoing TechCabal Future of Commerce conference. \u201cIt\u2019s also due to the fact that there\u2019s a fundamental problem that\u2019s being solved \u2013 finding what you want, doing it much faster, getting more choices and best pricing online. If we can provide all of that, then consumers will always opt for that option.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAs part of the major shifts expected in buying and selling in Africa, Anammah sees even more Africans shopping online over the next few years. This is provided e-commerce platforms continue to solve problems consumers face and offer more suites of offerings.\n\nTechnologies and innovations like Virtual Reality and interoperable payment systems are also expected to play an increased role in buying and selling, and broadly change consumer behavior and the way e-commerce is seen.\n\n\u201cStakeholders just need to keep ensuring that online platforms are solving problems. Nobody goes online just for the sake of it,\u201d Anammah says. \u201cAs long as stakeholders are building solutions that are solving fundamental problems, people will always go online.\u201d\n\nBuilding blocks for growth\n\nTo enable further growth in African commerce through digital channels, certain \u2018building blocks\u2019 must be in place. According to Nkebet Mesele, Senior Director for Solutions Management in sub-Saharan Africa at Visa, that entails making commerce in Africa \u201cmobile-led\u201d.\n\n\u201cFor commerce to grow across Africa, the building blocks that have to be in place are first, it has to be mobile-led. We need to shift commerce, banking, and the movement of money from what we know it as traditionally to building an end-to-end mobile experience for commerce to thrive,\u201d Mesele said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of SME intra-Africa money movement and trade that\u2019s happening. Hence we need to ensure cross-currency flows and commerce is happening seamlessly between a consumer in Nigeria, for example, and a merchant in Kenya.\u201d\n\nIn addition to those, SME support initiatives and adequate fraud controls also have to be in place. \u201cConsumers and the merchants have to be comfortable buying online and also have that understanding and awareness of how to be safe while shopping.\u201d\n\nKhadijah Abu, Paystack\u2019s Head of Product Expansion notes that providing access to credit for merchants and SMEs is equally important to enabling further growth, as is exposing sellers to more consumers across the country, continent, or world.\n\n\u201cIf you can only exchange goods with people standing in front of you, then the scope of your market will always be limited,\u201d she says. \u201cBut if you can stay at home and create something that someone halfway across the continent or the world is willing to pay for, then all of a sudden, you\u2019re exposed to a whole new level of growth.\u201d\n\nAbu adds that increased internet penetration and financial inclusion levels are key indicators for e-commerce as they would imply that people have money and can access sellers not just in their immediate vicinity but also across other markets or regions.\n\nMore so, efficient use of technology to automate businesses, incentives, and grants from the government or larger organisations and initiatives that include logistics and supply chain management will \u201cdefinitely help\u201d people build and produce more.\n\nWhile building, however, stakeholders have to \u201crealise that there\u2019s not going to be a one-size-fits-all solution that makes sense for the entire continent,\u201d Wiza Jalakasi, Vice President of Global Developer Relations, at Chipper Cash cautions.\n\n\u201cAfrica is fragmented from a cultural perspective and because of that, people have different ways of doing things. So whatever solutions are built have to be contextually aware of the environment and be sensitive to the needs of individuals in the specific countries.\u201d\n\nIt might be possible to aggregate some of the market systems in these countries at some point, Jalakasi says. \u201cBut it starts with building solutions for people on the ground.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nYou can follow the Future of Commerce 2021 event on YouTube.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Phishing scams are becoming more prevalent in African countries",
          "text": "\u201cThe 12 billion dollar scam\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what the FBI nicknamed phishing in 2018; a name that reflected the estimated amount of money lost to the cyberattack globally between 2013 and 2018. In 2018 alone, about $1.2 billion was lost to phishing and in 2020, phishing scammers made over $1.8 billion\u2014 more than via any other type of cybercrime.\n\nAccording to RiskIQ, businesses across the world lose about $17,700 every minute to phishing attacks and top companies lose $25 per minute to cybercrime.\n\nPhishing, also called email-scam, is a method of trying to gather personal information by sending deceptive e-mails to target recipients. Phishing is one of the oldest internet scams, dating back to the \u201890s, and perhaps remains one of the most prevalent cybercrimes.\n\nThe goal of phishing is to fool victims into believing that the message is something they want or need. For instance, the message can be an invoice from a vendor, payment or account update request from the victim\u2019s bank; it could even be a grant/scholarship offer. But one thing phishing emails have in common with other forms of cyberattack is that every phishing email comes with a call to action that prompts recipients to download a link or file.\n\nOnce the victims supply their personal data, the attackers have unfettered access to their identity and proceed to engage in malicious activities such as making purchases with the victim\u2019s credit card or cleaning out their accounts.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nPhishing is also widespread in Africa\n\nAcross the world, Nigerians are stereotyped as the highest perpetrators of internet scams \u2014especially email scams \u2014 and series of recent events and reports somewhat justify this stereotype. But this doesn\u2019t mean Africans aren\u2019t susceptible to phishing attacks.\n\nPhishing attacks are prevalent in the continents and individuals and businesses across Africa have fallen victims to phishing scams. Cybercriminals have become even smarter with their tactics, adapting to changing economic situations and embracing more sophisticated technology to lure people into clicking on things they should not.\n\nFor instance, the COVID-19 vaccine rollout throughout Africa has given rise to ample opportunity for cybercriminals to carry out several attacks that are hidden in what, at first glance, may appear to be relevant information.\n\nScammers, posing as WHO or other trusted health organizations, now send phishing emails to unsuspecting victims to offer things like a COVID-19 kit, Coronavirus relief package which include food and cash benefits, or Medicare benefits; then ask them to verify personal information like bank details. Google also said in April 2020 that scammers are sending 18 million hoax emails about Covid-19 to its 1.5 billion Gmail users every day.\n\nAn example of COVID-19 phishing email asking for a bitcoin donation\n\nAnother example of COVID-19 phishing email sent in disguise as the UK government\n\nAccording to Kaspersky, a global cybersecurity company using its deep threat intelligence and security expertise to protect over 400 million and 250,000 corporate clients against cyberattacks, spam constituted almost 30% of email traffic in South Africa and close to 35% in Kenya in H1 2021.\n\nOver a million phishing attacks were recorded in South Africa in the first half of 2021. In Kenya, over 600,000 phishing attacks were recorded, and its around 400,000 in Nigeria. That\u2019s a combination of over two million attacks in the first half of the year from the three biggest African markets.\n\nThis shows that phishing is also a significant threat in Africa. But the company said these numbers represent a reduction from the cyberattacks that were captured within the same period in 2020. South Africa witnessed a 17% decline; Kenya saw a 48% decline, and Nigeria recorded an 18% decline from over two million cases in 2020.\n\n\u201cThis decrease is in line with global trends and supports the decline that Kaspersky research identified happening through the course of last year already. Of course, this does not mean that organisations and consumers can ignore the risk of traditional cybercrime attacks or that phishing, as well as spam, are still not of significant concern across Africa,\u201d says Bethwel Opil, Enterprise Sales Manager at Kaspersky in Africa. \u201cInstead, people need to become even more aware of cybersecurity best practices and remain vigilant to protect their personal and business systems from the risk of compromise,\u201d\n\nHow businesses and individuals can protect themselves from phishing scams\n\nWhile there\u2019s no way to stop scammers from sending phishing emails, there are certain ways to prepare and make sure individuals and businesses stop falling victims.\n\nOnce the characteristics of dubious emails have been understood and there\u2019s a consistent effort in looking out for them before taking any action, there\u2019s a high chance of beating phishing activities.\n\nIndividuals and businesses are advised to install relevant cybersecurity solutions on their devices, and in addition to that, they should consider the following tips:\n\nReview the email address of senders and look out for impersonations of trusted brands or people.\n\nAlways inspect URLs in emails for legitimacy by hovering over them before clicking\n\nBeware of URL that redirects and pay attention to subtle differences in website content: make sure the URL starts with https:// and not http://.\n\nGenuine brands and professionals generally won\u2019t ask recipients to divulge sensitive personal information. If an email prompts for such, the next thing to do is to investigate and contact the brand or person directly, rather than hitting reply.\n\nUse multiple email addresses, one for personal use and another for online shopping or social media.\n\nDo not rush or panic-react, scammers use such tactics to pressure their victims into clicking links or opening attachments.\n\nEnsure browsers and operating system software are up to date with the latest patches.\n\nUse anti-spam filters in addition to antivirus and Internet security solutions.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "How edtech startup, Stranerd is connecting Nigerian students to tutors",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt all levels, education in Nigeria is in dire need of intervention. On the supply side, there are more students or prospective students than there are schools. According to the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), about 10.5 million children in Nigeria between the ages of 5-14 are out of school, and one in every five out-of-school children in the world is in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to a study of public and private schools in Lagos State by Elaine Unterhalter, a professor of education and international development at University College London, there are 1,200 primary school-aged children for every public school place available. With governments unable to provide adequate options for education in the country, individuals are picking up the slack.\n\nAccording to the National Universities Commission (NUC), there are more private universities (99) than state and federal universities (98) combined. However, with about 40% of the population living in poverty, the fees charged by these private schools are out of reach for many people.\n\nYet, not everyone who can afford to pay for a university education gets the opportunity. Between 2010 and 2015, only 26% of the ten million applicants to Nigerian universities gained admission.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis situation has made room for tutorial centres that prepare students for university entrance examinations like the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB).\n\nSowing the seeds\n\nIn 2015, Jeremiah Godwin took the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) examination but did not make the required score to get admitted into the university. Having failed to get into school, he spent the next year at home. He discovered online marketing and, together with a friend, started reading about the subject.\n\nTheir first thought was to create a blog with hopes of making money from it. That never happened, but they were not discouraged. They kept on learning, and in 2017, Godwin\u2019s family relocated to the US, but he stayed in touch with his friend.\n\nTheir next venture was Buzz Visuals, a digital agency that created logos for businesses while helping them market their products using social media. This time, they had some success making about $1,000 monthly.\n\nStarting Stranerd\n\nIn 2018, while hanging out with a friend at a coffee shop in Cyprus, Godwin talked with a girl. Only a few weeks earlier, he had moved to the European country to study at Near East University. During the conversation, he discovered that she had some difficulties with calculus, a subject that he had aced as a student in Nigeria. He gave her some pointers on how to solve some problems.\n\nA few days later, he got a call from her saying that she was willing to pay whatever he wanted if he could tutor her to pass the course. He agreed, and she sent him a bunch of past questions.\n\nRealising he needed some help, he enlisted his friend, Timmy Salami, to solve the questions. Together, they were able to tutor the girl and made some money in the process.\n\nAt about the same time, Salami was trying to decide what to do, so he spoke to Godwin about tutoring students online. With guidance from Godwin, he created an Instagram page and started posting content. They named the page \u201cStranerd,\u201d a combination of the Italian word for extra and nerd.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSoon, they were getting requests from students worldwide who needed help with their assignments, charging between $20 and $50 to solve problems. With time, requests started extending beyond math and calculus to subjects they had no expertise on, and so they hired more tutors, in the process becoming a bridge between the students and the tutors.\n\nThe most significant change would come in 2020, when they started receiving more requests from students in Nigeria. These students could not afford what they charged their clients studying in European and American schools. But they wanted to help.\n\nFirst, they researched available edtech solutions in Nigeria, but none of the options they saw was good enough. They were either unknown to the students who needed them or did not serve the demographic that reached out to the Stranerd team.\n\nDiscovering a need, they launched a web platform that caters to Nigerians at an affordable price. Currently, they serve students on both the website and social media. On social media, they charge about $5 for each question they solve, sell study materials, and connect students to tutors while taking a cut of the earnings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Stranerd website. Source: Supplied\n\nOn the website, which currently serves mainly Nigerian students, the startup employs a coin system to charge students. Coins sell from $0.99 (\u20a6408) for 300 bronze coins to $4.99 (\u20a62,056) for 50 gold coins.\n\nWith these coins, students can ask questions, access study tools and materials, or book sessions with tutors. In addition to using the coins to pay for services on the site, students can also redeem coins by answering questions.\n\nGodwin explains the reason for employing the coin system as opposed to a subscription model.\n\n\u201cThe idea is that the average Nigerian is not okay with paying a monthly subscription for a product or service, so we use the coin to make them pay for services as they use them.\u201d\n\nWhat does the future hold?\n\nThe startup has big plans to extend its offerings beyond tutorials. The goal, Godwin says, is to become a one-stop-shop for the Nigerian student\u2019s educational needs and possibly African students also. They also want to include connecting students to internships as well as providing study-abroad services to students. But first, the startup plans to build trust among the students before leveraging it to add more services.\n\n\u201cBy next year [2022], we\u2019re hoping to get a million users. Right now, on the platform, we have questions and tutors. We\u2019re hoping to bring in study groups and sessions.\n\n\u201cThe idea is that when the tutors come on the site, they create study materials that students can access whenever they like. The big vision is to become a company that the Nigerian student can trust with everything educational.\u201d\n\nStranerd also plans to add classes. Already the startup has partnered with two tutorial centres in Lagos with plans to add more in the future. For these tutorial centres whose reach is limited by physical classes, the value proposition is their ability to reach many more students than would typically walk in.\n\n\u201cWith classes, tutors can host their classes, maybe JAMB or JUPEB classes, and they can have students subscribe to the class, and they can teach them. We have already partnered with two in the Akoka area. And in the coming months, as we push more features to the site, we would partner with more people around Nigeria.\u201d\n\nSince launching in 2019, the startup has served almost 40,000 students in 11 countries, including Nigeria, United States, India, Pakistan, Cyprus, Germany, Indonesia, Brazil, France, Australia, and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe website, which has run solely on revenue, already has 500 students after its August 2021 launch.\n\nGodwin reveals that the startup made a little over $2,000 in revenue in 2019 after launching towards the end of the year.\n\nIn 2020, spurred by the coronavirus pandemic, the startup reportedly generated $30,000 in revenue and has already done over $40,000 so far in 2021. It also has plans to raise money from investors having already applied to Y Combinator. Users can also expect an app release soon.\n\nGodwin is studying Computer Information Systems at Near East University, Cyprus, while Salami is studying Electrical Engineering at the University of Lagos. As students, running a business has been a bit challenging, and Godwin reveals that the biggest test, so far, has been adequately understanding the Nigerian market. The second biggest challenge has been funding.\n\n\u201cMoney is an issue. We\u2019re not so much, and with money, you can hire more people to speed up the work. But if there\u2019s any challenge, it would be understanding the Nigerian market.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding the Nigerian market is not easy, and Nigerians relate differently with edtech startups. I think that\u2019s where most edtech people have it wrong, trying to replicate what people in America are using.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

And according to the United Nations, September 23 every year is an opportunity to support and protect the linguistic identity and cultural diversity of all deaf people and other sign language users.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe World Federation of the Deaf (WFD) estimates that there are more than 70 million deaf people worldwide and more than 80% of them are from developing countries.\n\nHow do people with hearing impairments communicate? Depending on the degree of severity, they use hearing aids, speech-to-text tools and sign languages to communicate.\n\nBefore yesterday, I thought there was just one universal sign language that every deaf person understood.\n\nHowever, studies show that there are over 300 sign languages in the world, and over 23 of them are used in Africa.\n\nInterestingly, technology is assisting people in Africa who have varying degrees of hearing loss.\n\nTo know how, please, read: What does communication in a techy world mean for Nigeria\u2019s deaf people?\n\nOr watch the video: What does communication in a techy world mean for Nigeria\u2019s deaf people?\n\nReelFruit raises $3 million Series A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigeria\u2019s dried fruit snack brand, ReelFruit, has announced a $3 million Series A round to expand production, increase product offerings, and double down on exports to the US and other international markets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlitheia IDF led the round with $2m. Samata Capital and Flying Doctor Healthcare Investment Company also participated in the round.\n\nFounded in 2012 by Affiong Williams (CEO), ReelFruit is an agritech company that processes and distributes locally grown fruits. It claims to help communities by empowering fruit farmers by purchasing their raw materials.\n\nMore on its expansion plans, ReelFruit plans to build a new factory in Ogun State, Nigeria, to increase its monthly dried fruit production from 6 to 30 tonnes.\n\nIn its first year, the factory will employ over 200 people. With a larger supply of dried fruit, ReelFruit will develop new products for domestic and international markets.\n\nBy December 2021, the company plans to launch an eCommerce channel for direct US sales and open up more B2B opportunities, such as white-labelling and co-packing, to support the national drive toward import substitution.\n\nThe company believes local buyers will purchase dried fruit locally, reducing their reliance on imports.\n\nPaystack launches Apple Pay to help Nigerian businesses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaystack, an African fintech company that powers and processes payments for businesses, announced yesterday that Pay with Apple Pay is now available on its platform.\n\nWhat does this mean? Nigerian businesses will have access to millions of Apple Pay users across more than 60 countries where the payments service is available. And according to Paystack, it is the \u201cfastest, secure way for Nigerian businesses to accept international payments.\u201d\n\nLaunched in 2014, Apple Pay, Apple\u2019s mobile payments and digital wallet service, allows users to pay securely and privately on their iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches, and Macbooks.\n\nHow will it work? When a customer with Apple Pay buys from a Paystack merchant, they will see the option to checkout using Pay with Apple Pay. They can then proceed to pay using Touch ID or Face ID.\n\nThey can accept payments made through any of the Paystack-hosted commerce tools \u2014 Paystack Storefronts or Invoices \u2014 and through a variety of payment channels such as cards, mobile money, USSD, QR codes, and EFT.\n\nIs this familiar?

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowing up, I never had much contact with deaf people. Of course, that is to be expected as I didn\u2019t know any deaf people.\n\nIn later years, I would come to \u2014 unconsciously \u2014 associate being deaf with being poor. Why? I only saw deaf people while travelling through Nigerian roads to or from school or during village visits to see my grandparents.\n\nThey had on old clothes and would constantly thrust or \u2014 if the paper was too big \u2014 display a note asking you to give some money to the deaf people or an orphanage or a motherless baby\u2019s home. Interestingly, they were always smiling, and I always wondered why.\n\nDuring the heat of the COVID-19 pandemic last year, I had to reconfigure my perceptions when I met a young girl who we will call Mary. Big brown eyes, small \u2014 at least for a five-year-old her \u2014 funny, smart, beautiful, silent \u2014 at first \u2014 deaf.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs I interacted with her, a lot of my misconceptions began to fall away. Poor? Nope. Beggar? Nope. Because she\u2019s hard of hearing, you have to speak really loud or use signs so she can understand.\n\nBut, I got really incensed after learning that her parents refused to acknowledge her deafness. They put her in a regular school with no access to sign language classes to help her communicate.\n\nFor people who aren\u2019t entirely deaf, like Mary, basic technology like a hearing aid or an implant would make it easier to communicate and understand people.\n\nIn celebration of the International Day of Sign Languages we talked to members of the deaf community. You can choose to watch the video or read down, or both. Happy International Day of Sign Language. #WeSignForHumanRights\n\nNigeria\u2019s deaf community\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe\n\nAccording to Oluwaseun Sosanya, a sign language interpreter, tutor, and deaf advocate, the deaf community \u201cis a collection of people that share the same idea, belief, and culture, and use sign language to communicate.\n\n\u201cThe community includes the two categories of deaf \u2014 pre-lingual and post-lingual deaf \u2014 parents of the deaf, sign language interpreters, and all users of sign language.\n\n\u201cPre-lingual deaf are people born naturally deaf, who\u2019ve spoken no language. And the post-lingual deaf are people who were once talking and hearing but later became deaf as a result of illness or accident.\u201d\n\nUsing Sosanya\u2019s explanation, Mary is a pre-lingual deaf person.\n\nBut beyond this is the rich history and culture of the deaf people and those who have accepted and are proud of this identity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOlaoluwa Bayonle, another sign language interpreter, says, \u201cIt is a community of people, I mean the deaf people and hard of hearing people, who have accepted their deafness, their inability to hear, and are proud of this identity. The community is established with a different culture from the hearing community.\n\n\u201cThe members of this community are the deaf people, the hard of hearing, the sign language users, and the friends of the deaf. The official language of this community is sign language.\u201d\n\nSign language is a huge part of the deaf community culture. It is the unique way in which the deaf and friends of the deaf communicate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign\n\nFor the African deaf community, the prevalent sign language is the American Sign Language (ASL) which Andrew Foster \u2014 regarded as the Father of Deaf Education in Africa \u2014 brought into the continent.\n\nHe would go on to found West Africa\u2019s first School for the Deaf in Ghana and Nigeria\u2019s first, the Ibadan Mission School for the Deaf, in Ibadan, Oyo State.\n\nHowever, many African countries like Ghana, Ivory Coast, and Mali have created their own sign languages. Nigeria does have a sign language, but it is not officially recognised and as widely used as the ASL.\n\nInterestingly, there are currently over 300 recognised variations of sign language.\n\nOne thing I noticed is how accommodating and welcoming members of the community are. A fact which Seun Dosunmu, a disability inclusion advocate, echoes when he says, \u201cThe deaf community, the deaf persons majorly, are very accommodating and always willing to engage and participate in activities, especially when they are invited.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, they face a lot of stigmatisation and rarely is provision made for their inclusion.\n\n\u201cMany people do not consider inclusion, so they don\u2019t make interpreters available. And this is the major reason why there is a gap, and there is marginalisation as we have it.\u201d\n\nA tale of signs and inclusion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor\n\nMary\u2019s parents believe her hearing issues stem from a spiritual problem and take her for deliverance sessions, hoping to drive away the demon of deafness.\n\nThis is very common in the African setting, where many people view deaf people as sick, retarded, or demon-possessed.\n\nAs Treasures Uchegbu, Convener and CEO SpeakingFingers, says while talking about the challenges deaf people face, \u201cCommunication/Information, attitudinal (words and behaviours) barriers which I refer to as the cancer of all challenges \u2014 referring to the deaf as dumb. Then that one about putting a leaf in the mouth which could be perceived as calling them goats.\n\n\u201cOr an average primary four child whom I asked \u2018Who are the users of sign language?\u2019 In response, he said, \u2018mumu people!!!\u2019 I\u2019m sure he got that from his immediate environment. So I ask if this young boy grows into a policymaker, will he make policies to cover \u2018mumu people?\u2019 Of course not.\u201d\n\nIn 2019, the Nigerian Federal Government passed the Discrimination against Persons with Disabilities (Prohibition) Act into law. The Act established the National Commission of Persons with Disabilities and includes several provisions such as accessibility aids in public places and better inclusion of the disabled in workplaces, among others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman\n\nHowever, the curve is pretty steep. According to a 2018 study by Emmanuel Ihenchi Asonye and two others, about 23% of Nigeria\u2019s population are deaf people. Most of that number live below the poverty line, with little to no access to healthcare, education, and employment.\n\nAnd as Douglas Izuchukwu, President of the National Association of Deaf Students, says, \u201cthe biggest challenge, communication barrier.\u201d\n\nDosunmu recalls having to intervene in the case of a deaf person who had been living with tuberculosis for a while. After taking him to a specialist hospital, they faced another challenge, none of the doctors or nurses understood sign language, and there was no interpreter.\n\nThis inability to communicate is a common occurrence, leading to either an untreated patient or a wrong diagnosis. Thankfully, they were able to get an interpreter in time.\n\nIn so many ways, the capacity to communicate is hindered, and a lot of the time, privacy is compromised on the hill of interpretation.\n\nFor the hearing community, technology enhances communication. Social media networks like WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, and Discord serve to bring people together.\n\nA lot of this tech is mainly geared towards what the hearing community needs, with little to no thought, if any, for the needs of deaf people. Some, like the live-audio craze which began with Clubhouse, do not even have any provisions for them.\n\nBut, in some ways, technology is trying to bridge the communication gap.\n\nCommunicating in a tech-enabled world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRights\n\nAccording to Izuchukwu, \u201cTechnology is now doing well, trying. On YouTube, we have automatic captions, time to control the captions, and time to control how the speakers speak. That is what technology is doing. And again, Google Meet too has automatic captioning.\u201d\n\nBut he wants technology to do more.\n\n\u201cFor example, on WhatsApp, when someone sends voice notes, there should be a place on WhatsApp where one can click to turn on automatic captions, for deaf people to read and benefit. Same way it is on YouTube, I wish WhatsApp too has the feature. And the feature applies to other applications like Zoom and others.\u201d\n\nIzuchuwku, speaking from the perspective of a deaf person, really just wants inclusion.\n\nAnd technology has already done so much.\n\n1. The use of social media to spread awareness and advocate for more inclusion.\n\n2. Assistive technology like Speech-to-Text, which helps translation from spoken words into text.\n\n3. Hearing aids and cochlear implants, which enable deaf or hard of hearing people retain some part of all parts of their hearing ability.\n\n4. Mobile apps that provide sign language tutoring for beginners, such as the ASL American Sign Language and the Ghanian Sign Language app.\n\n5. Automatic captions on YouTube and Google Meet, which use artificial intelligence to automatically transmit what is being said during webinars or in online videos.\n\nThere have also been technology mishaps, such as the sign language hand glove that translates sign language into words. The deaf community believed it to be more accommodating of the hearing community without regard to the deaf people \u2014 who it was purporting to help.\n\nAlso, assistive technology like Speech-to-Text and automatic captioning have limits as they do not always provide an accurate translation, which is doubly worse in the African scenario.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 lockdown, Funmi Ogunro, Head of School, Friends of the Deaf Academy, says they had to move the school online, using WhatsApp and Facebook groups. Eventually, they received support from Gradely, a personalised e-learning platform for 300 students.\n\nDosunmu suggests that more people learn sign language or at the very least make more interpreters available in public places such as banks, hospitals, courts, etc. Some apps help people learn sign language on both Android and iOS stores. Although, there seems to be a dearth of Nigerian made or focused apps.\n\nHowever, despite technological advancements, deaf people still face discrimination and exclusion, especially regarding information. Dosunmu says that most deaf persons have little to no access to computers and do not even have smartphones. How then do they access the technology?\n\nInternational Day of Sign Language\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe sign for human rights\n\nThe International Day of Sign Languages is observed annually on September 23 as part of the International Week of Deaf People.\n\nThis year, the World Federation of the Deaf has given daily themes for the Week \u2014 Monday, September 20 to Sunday, September 26.\n\nMonday: Cherishing Deaf History\n\nTuesday: Sustainable Deaf Leadership\n\nWednesday: Sign Languages for All Deaf Learners\n\nThursday: We Sign For Human Rights\n\nFriday: Intersectional Deaf Communities\n\nSaturday: Deaf Culture and Arts\n\nSunday: Human Rights in Times of Crisis\n\nEach theme represents an important topic in the deaf community, with inclusion as the central theme.\n\nBeyond their disabilities, deaf people are human beings who have rights \u2014 the right to fair treatment, employment, and the right to inclusion.\n\nWhat\u2019s common to Ludwig van Beethoven, Helen Keller, Thomas Edison, and Andrew Foster.\n\nDeafness and partial or complete hearing loss. But there\u2019s more. Despite their disability, considered a hindrance by many, they accomplished remarkable things.\n\nAnd Opeoluwa Sotonwa \u2014 a deaf Nigerian American attorney, disability rights advocate, and literary writer \u2014 has borrowed a leaf from these greats.\n\nBeing deaf is not a curse. The deaf should not be segregated. They shouldn\u2019t be made to feel stupid or unworthy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Speaking Fingers Network\n\nNGOs like Friends of the Deaf Foundation, Collaboration of Deaf and Hearing Adults (CODAH) Enterprise, and Speaking Fingers Network provide helpful resources like free hearing aids, including persons with disabilities in their programmes, build inclusive private schools, and provide life skills to support learning and development.\n\nHowever, in the search for inclusion, we all have a part to play. Among other things, we can design sign language learning apps, inclusive audio/video with subtitling and automatic captioning. It can, and should, be done.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Newly opened lawsuits in London and New York have shed light on how bribe that trading firms paid agents to win oil contracts from Nigeria\u2019s state oil company may have raised funds for the country\u2019s past two elections in 2015 and 2019.\n\nAn ex-British Petroleum Plc, BP oil trader alleged this week that cargo allocations by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. could have contributed to preparations for general elections in 2019, Bloomberg reported.\n\nAnd a former Glencore Plc employee in July admitted paying a middleman $300,000 to secure a crude shipment from the NNPC, understanding the money would be spent on the nationwide vote that took place four years earlier.\n\nA spokesman for the NNPC didn\u2019t respond to three calls and three text messages seeking comment.\n\nJonathan Zarembok, who left BP\u2019s West Africa desk last year, said in the suit he suspected that fees paid by the U.K. energy giant to obtain NNPC contracts would go toward the 2019 elections.\n\nHe filed an employment claim against BP, alleging he was fired for raising concerns about the large sums being transferred to intermediaries to win business in Nigeria.\n\nZarembok said in a witness statement made public this month that emails sent in 2017 by a BP executive in Nigeria were a \u201cclear red flag\u201d and implied \u201cthere would be pressure to pay bribes.\u201d\n\nThe emails discussed how preparations for elections would get under way in 2018. \u201cWe understand what that means,\u201d the executive wrote.\n\nThe company then wired $900,000 in fees to a local agent after securing two oil cargoes from NNPC, he said.\n\n\u201cBP is defending in full and denies all allegations made by the claimant,\u201d the company said in a statement. It declined further comment while Zarembok\u2019s case at a London employment tribunal continues.\n\nRead Also: Glencore bribed NNPC officials for crude lifting contracts under Madueke \u2013 ex-staff\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari and his ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) retained power in the 2019 election.\n\nPresidential spokesmen didn\u2019t respond to calls and emails seeking comment on Zarembok\u2019s allegations.\n\nSimilar details emerged two months ago, when Anthony Stimler, who left Glencore in 2019, pleaded guilty to corruption and money-laundering charges.\n\nStimler was notified in September 2014 that \u201cForeign Official 1\u201d was asking all NNPC clients to pay an advance on each cargo \u201cin connection with a then-upcoming political election in 2015,\u201d according to U.S. court filings. He then had Glencore wire $300,000 to an intermediary company, which prosecutors said was used \u201cto pay bribes to Nigerian government officials.\u201d\n\nRead also: How NNPC manicured its books to extract N287bn profit\n\nU.S. prosecutors outlined how Stimler and others paid bribes worth millions of dollars in several countries, including to NNPC officials, between 2007 and 2018. A Glencore spokesman didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\n\u201cThe conduct described in the plea is unacceptable and has no place in Glencore,\u201d the company said in a statement on July 26.\n\nBloomberg has previously reported that the unnamed \u201cForeign Official 1\u201d refers to Diezani Alison-Madueke, who served as Nigeria\u2019s oil minister and oversaw NNPC between 2010 and 2015. Her party, the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), lost the elections in March 2015 to Buhari\u2019s APC.\n\nThe Nigerian authorities are trying to extradite Alison-Madueke from the U.K. to face corruption charges.

          "title": "A new guide to smart investing",
          "text": "Women have from time past been directly or indirectly involved in supporting their families and communities through entrepreneurial activities especially through farming and the processing of farm products, fishing, textile production, and trading in markets, thereby contributing to household incomes and growth of national economies. Even with all the historical success, women still make the majority of players in the micro, small and quasi-micro business sectors. This is because adequate attention and the allocation of resources towards supporting women\u2019s entrepreneurship endeavors is still minimal when compared to their counterparts. The continuous failure to pay attention to women\u2019s economic activities is both a moral and economic injustice as improving access to entrepreneurial opportunities is a major requirement for any community to achieve greater levels of economic growth and development. Improving issues around gender equality will significantly improve the conditions of economic development.\n\nAccording to data from the Global Financial Inclusion (Global Findex \u2013 Klapper, L.2014) database, women represent the greatest portion of the population with marginal or without access to capital. If we are ever going to be able to attain gender equality, then the issues of equity of opportunities at all levels of society and the economy must be addressed. Nigeria has among the largest numbers of female entrepreneurs around the world, with a lot more expressing their desires to launch their businesses, yet they remain minimally funded in the entrepreneurship space which is a key driver of growth in our society.\n\nPublic and private investors around the world have recognized the value of investing in women. Investing in women is not just a moral and social decision but is simply smart investing. Every investor wants to invest their time and resources in a good investment, and that is exactly what most female entrepreneurs are. It, therefore, makes economic, financial, and business sense to ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to the same opportunities for success as their male counterparts.\n\nRead also: Lagos leveraging tech to transform businesses Sanwo-Olu\n\nIt has become important that gender requirements are mainstreamed into the design of policies and initiatives aimed at supporting women entrepreneurs, it is way more than creating random opportunities. Instruments aimed at improving the technical and financial capacities of women entrepreneurs must be designed through a gender lens to boost the development of female entrepreneurs while equipping them with tools and resources to grow their enterprises. The covid-19 pandemic has presented a unique opportunity in its recovery to redesign and restructure our economic transformation by promoting inclusive economies. Before the pandemic, women already had significantly fewer economic and entrepreneurship opportunities than men \u2013 research has shown that $1 trillion could be lost from global growth if women are not supported back into the workforce.\n\nWomen represent a growth market bigger than China and India combined, and the world must take advantage of it. With the growing population and increasing lack of jobs in Nigeria, we must put our full weight behind supporting female entrepreneurs. We therefore must continue to advocate for the allocation of more capital to initiatives that support female entrepreneurs and most especially the female entrepreneurs themselves who require capital to start, grow and scale their enterprises. This advocacy will also ensure that investors are aware of the numerous benefits of channeling funds into female-led businesses. Investors and funders must invest in the right projects and people that advance women\u2019s economic empowerment and that means that more deals and investments must meet as many of the 2x investment criteria as possible. These criteria are:\n\n\u2022 Whether a business is a majority-owned by women or founded by a woman\n\n\u2022 The share of women in senior management or on the board\n\n\u2022 The share of women in the workforce\n\n\u2022 Whether a product or service specifically or disproportionately benefits women\n\n\u2022 If a certain percent of loan proceeds in a deal through financial intermediaries supports women.\n\nWith this, more capital will shift towards investments that empower women in Africa to access entrepreneurship and leadership opportunities, as well as products and services that enhance their economic participation. scaling up the amount of financing available to support female entrepreneurs will not just improve overall profitability but will also help to overcome barriers, biases, and gaps that exist. Investors should begin to treat investment in female entrepreneurs and improvement of market opportunities for female investors as opportunities to be seized owing to their economic benefits.\n\nThe global community must renew its attention to women\u2019s economic empowerment in developing countries and increase investments in women, especially in Nigeria, because we have the numbers in terms of female entrepreneurs and the population of market reach. Improving financial support for female entrepreneurs would enable the expansion of old businesses and increase the number of new businesses, which in turn, would boost economic activities leading to increased innovation, productivity, and growth.\n\nLet\u2019s get smart with investing!\n\nWeyinmi Eribo is a trained geologist with Quality health safety and environment (QHSE) expertise, an enterprise development consultant, and a gender advisor with several years of experience across the oil and gas industry, extractive sector, health and safety, not-for-profit management, and the entrepreneurial ecosystem.\n\nWeyinmie is an entrepreneur and founder of Wevvo Nigeria, a resource and community-based platform that supports single female breadwinners by providing access to finance, enterprise development, mentoring and a community to thrive.\n\nWeyinmie is a StartingBloc social innovation fellow and Regional Chair, West Africa Alumni, a World Bank Scholar and a Cherie Blair Foundation Mentee Alumni.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nWarri \u2013 The Obi of Ogwashi-Uku Kingdom, HRM Obi Ifechukwude Aninshi Okonjo II, Aniocha South Local Government Area of Delta State, has sued for peace and neighborliness among Ogwashi-Uku Indigenes.\n\nThe Obi appealed to his neighbouring communities to eschew provocative utterances and misrepresentation of facts over which kingdom Otulu community belongs.\n\nIn a statement signed and made available to the Nigerian Observer on Friday by his media aide, Greg Okwumbu, the Obi of Ogwashi-Uku said his kingdom accords respect and desired to cohabit in peace with his neighbouring communities.\n\nThe monarch is the brother of Nigeria\u2019s former Minister of Finance and current Director-General of the World Trade Organisation (WTC), Dr Mrs Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala.\n\nObi of Issele-Azagba, HRM Agbogidi, Obi Francis Jideuwa, had on Thursday, granted a press briefing where he claimed Otulu community is not of Ogwashi-Uku kingdom.\n\nBut in what looks like a reaction to the said briefing, HRM Okonjo-Iweala II, urged neighboring commuties to respect historical, political and geographic a facts on boundaries.\n\n\u201cWe are a very respectful community and we desire to live in peace. We do not want any unnecessary provocation from our neighbours.\n\n\u201cWe wish to request that our neighbouring communities, who we have tried to live in peace with for decades, respect our boundaries,\u201d he admonished.\n\nThe Ogwashi-Uku monarch disclosed that from time immemorial, Otulu community, nay Issele-Azagba land, were part of his kingdom and as a fact, lent out lands to Issele-Azagba to farm at inception.\n\nHRM Okonjo II, who last weekend narrowly escaped attack by cultists while on a visit to Otulu where he offered prayers , cited gazetted references including court judgements to back his ownership claim, said \u201cOtulu Ogwashi-Uku historically is a farming settlement under our Agidiasei Quarters.\n\n\u201cOtulu Ogwashi-Uku was separated from its sister community Edo Ogwashi-Uku when the current Lagos-Benin Expressway was built, effectively putting both communities on either side of the expressway.\n\n\u201cOtulu has always been part of Ogwashi-Uku Kingdom and has always been managed by an Okwabani appointed by the Obi of Ogwashi-Uku.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cOtulu Ogwashi-Uku, politically, is Ward 1 in Aniocha South Local Government. A review of the geographical map of Delta State, drawn up by the Delta State Government, shows and establishes the local government boundaries which clearly puts Otulu Ogwashi-Uku inside Aniocha South Local Government.\n\n\u201cSo, from a historical, geographic and political point of view, Otulu Ogwashi-Uku is and will remain part of Ogwashi-Uku Kingdom.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that some communities are rushing to make claims about Otulu Ogwashi-Uku in light of the unfortunate incident which happened last week.\n\n\u201cWe are very prepared to defend our communal land to ensure that no outside community interferes with the land handed to us by our ancestors.\n\n\u201cWe will not permit any distortion of the facts or the truth\u2026we have relevant legal documents to back up our claims.\n\n\u201cLet us end by responding to a story we heard from HRM Agbogidi Obi Francis Jideuwa, the Obi of Issele-Azagba claiming ownership of Otulu.\n\n\u201cWe have a great deal of respect for His Majesty and we are sure he is misquoted and the stories supposedly from him about Otulu Ogwashi-Uku are false.\n\n\u201cWe know the history and relationship between our Azagba Ogwashi-Uku Community and Issele Azagba. We provided farm lands to them which metamorphosed to the present Issele Azagba community,\u201d he claimed.\n\n...",

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nNigeria\u2019s president, Muhammadu Buhari has appealed to the developed world and multinational institutions to consider debt restructuring and even outright cancellation for developing countries impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nBuhari who made the appeal while delivering his speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Friday, noted that developing countries have been faced with unsustainable debt burdens even before the pandemic.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risk of new wave of deepening debt, where vital public financial resources are allocated to external debt servicing and repayments at the expense of domestic health and financing for critical developmental needs.\n\n\u201c\u2026there is an urgent need to consider expansion and extension of the Debt Service Suspension Initiative to include all Developing, Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States facing fiscal and liquidity challenges. In addition, a review of the eligibility criteria for debt suspension, including outright cancellation, is needed for countries facing the most severe challenges.\u201d\n\nBelow is Buhari\u2019s\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s Speech at the General Debate of the 76th Session of United Nations General Assembly Friday, September 24, in New York, USA\n\nProtocols:\n\nMr. President,\n\nLet me, on behalf of the government and people of Nigeria, congratulate you on your well-deserved election as President of the 76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly. I would like to assure you of the full support and cooperation of the Nigerian delegation throughout your tenure.\n\n2. I would like to commend your predecessor, His Excellency, Mr. Volkan Boskir, for the many remarkable achievements recorded during his tenure, despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n3. Permit me to congratulate the Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, on his re-election and commend his strong commitment to making the UN more alive to its responsibilities.\n\n4. I also want to express my gratitude to him for re-appointing Ms. Amina Mohammed, as the Deputy Secretary General to assist him in discharging his heavy responsibilities.\n\nMr. President,\n\n5. The theme of this year\u2019s General Assembly \u2013 \u201cBuilding resilience through hope \u2013 to recover from COVID-19, rebuild sustainably, respond to the needs of the planet, respect the rights of the people, and revitalise the United Nations, sums up our common desire to rescue our planet, recover our economies, and restore hope to all the peoples of the world.\n\n6. In this regard, my delegation will continue to support the United Nations, as the indispensable forum for international cooperation and the cornerstone of the multilateral system, rooted in respect for international law, including international human rights law and predicated on a rules-based order.\n\nMr. President,\n\n7. I want to thank the international community for the concerted response to COVID-19. The solidarity and drive to contain the first truly global health emergency of our time is a pointer to the many things we can achieve if we work together.\n\n8. On our part, Nigeria has made strenuous efforts to contain the virus and halt its deadly onslaught on our people. Our efforts have been rewarded with moderate success.\n\n9. At the outset, we recognised detection and contact tracing to be important tools in combating the virus. In this connection, from a mere four laboratories with testing and detection capacities, we ramped up the facilities to over 140 centres today.\n\n10. Similarly, we built isolation centres and emergency hospitals wards in record time all over the country. We carry out genomic sequencing in designated laboratories across the country with a view to detecting variants in circulation.\n\n11. In addition, over 40,000 health care workers have recently been trained on Infection, Prevention and Control measures with the support of various partners. Through the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control, we have established 16 infectious disease treatment centres located within our Teaching Hospitals and Federal Medical Centres.\n\n12. Nigeria remains grateful for the assistance received from our partners and friends all over the world. Vaccination is the key to our safe emergence from the pandemic. We fully support the COVAX initiative from which we have benefitted. We also thank the United States of America, Turkey, India, China, European Union, and others for the vaccines provided.\n\n13. Despite the acknowledgement however, I would like to reiterate my call for a fairer and more equitable distribution of vaccines to all countries so that, together, we can fight and contain the pandemic. The rising wave of newer and more contagious strains, makes this even more urgent. No country can afford the socio-economic implications of prolonged shutdown. It is imperative to underscore that no one is safe until everyone is safe.\n\nMr President,\n\n14. Nigeria remains deeply concerned over the illicit trade, transfer, and circulation of small arms and light weapons. Their excessive accumulation and uncontrolled spread in many regions of the world are having devastating humanitarian and socio-economic consequences, especially on the continent of Africa.\n\n15. It is on this note that my delegation calls for the world wide application of the Arms Trade Treaty to codify accountability in conventional arms trade, which is critical to the security of nations. This is in recognition of the need for a broad-based global partnership in the on-going battle against trans-border crimes, including terrorism and piracy.\n\nMr. President,\n\n16. We must deal not only with the symptoms of conflict but also the immediate causes that fuel conflicts in the first place. These include poor and undemocratic governance, human rights abuses, poverty, ignorance, injustice and inequalities.\n\n17. There are no easy solutions to these conditions. They require long term investments and more effective international cooperation. In this connection, my delegation underscores the importance of promoting peaceful, unfettered, and inclusive participation of states in global actions towards conflict prevention. This will facilitate the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Union Agenda 2063.\n\n18 In West Africa especially, our democratic gains of the past decades are now being eroded. The recent trend of unconstitutional takeover of power, sometimes in reaction to unilateral changes of constitutions by some leaders, must not be tolerated by the international community. Nigeria fully supports the efforts by ECOWAS to address this growing challenge and appreciates the support of both the African Union and the United Nations. In this regard, I would like to reiterate that as leaders of our individual Member-States we need to adhere to the constitutional provisions of our countries, particularly on term limits. This is one area that generates crisis and political tension in our sub-region.\n\nMr President,\n\n19. Nigeria is fully committed to nuclear non-proliferation and has always supported the view that it should involve all States.\n\n20. Disarmament Conventions deserve the support of all states, small, large, nuclear or non-nuclear. Nuclear weapons remain the ultimate agents of mass destruction, and their total elimination should be the final objective of all disarmament processes within the broad spectrum of goals being pursued by the United Nations.\n\n21. In this regard, Nigeria would participate actively in the forthcoming Review Conference of the Nuclear Prohibition Treaty and also the First Meeting of States Parties to the landmark Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, scheduled to take place within the first quarter of 2022.\n\n22. Nigeria regards these upcoming events as important steps towards the realisation of a world free of nuclear weapons. We are, therefore, supportive of any diplomatic efforts in this direction. We hope that the upcoming NPT review conference would lead to a successful outcome that would facilitate the denuclearisation of the world. We would do our part to ensure such an outcome.\n\nMr. President,\n\n23. Terrorism continues to dominate security discourse worldwide. In Nigeria, Boko Haram terrorists group, though fragmented by internal strife and weakened by our defence forces, is still active and preying on soft targets. Nigeria will continue to work closely with UN Counter-Terrorism bodies and entities with a view to bringing this scourge to an end.\n\n24. Nigeria has spared no effort in addressing the challenges of terrorism posed by the activities of Boko Haram in North-East Nigeria and the Lake Chad region, as well as banditry in the North-West and North-Central Nigeria. The Nigerian Security Forces have recorded considerable success in the fight against terrorism. As a result of the renewed vigour of our military, many terrorist fighters are voluntarily surrendering to our security forces.\n\n25. I and three other Nigerian Heads of State served actively as peace keepers and Nigeria continues to support peacekeeping efforts. We know the sacrifice involved, we also know how important peace keeping is for those in vulnerable situations. Nigeria will continue to play its part fully in supporting United Nations peacekeeping operations within Africa and beyond.\n\nMr. President,\n\n26. The impact of climate change is already with us in Nigeria, manifesting in various ways: conflicts trigger; food insecurity, drying up of lakes; loss of livelihood, and youth migration, among others. The trend is the same in many other countries that are threatened by forest fires, rising sea levels, drought and desertification.\n\n27. In the circumstances, we intend to build a climate-resilient economy that effectively aligns with the SDGs and that has great potentials to unlocking the full opportunities in different sectors of the economy, while protecting the resources for present and future generations. I know, in several ways, this is also a familiar story in many countries.\n\n28. As leaders, we must create inclusive and gender-sensitive policies that address all issues connected to climate action, from mitigation to resilience.\n\n29. Nigeria believes that protecting our planet and its biodiversity and climate are important to our collective survival. That is why, we are working on a transition to low carbon economy, consistent with achieving the Paris Climate Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nMr. President,\n\n30. Combating illicit financial flows and ensuring the recovery and return of illicitly acquired assets have the potential to provide resources in the immediate term for financing development in this era of the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.\n\n31. Similarly, corruption across national borders has huge negative impact on the stability, peace, and economic prospects of millions, particularly in developing countries.\n\n32. It deprives national Governments of resources needed to provide adequate and meaningful sources of livelihood for their citizens. The latter gives rise to more irregular migration patterns, with unwholesome consequences for inter-state and human relations.\n\n33. I, therefore, call on all leaders to demonstrate the much-needed political will by supporting the recommendations for systemic reforms made by the FACTI Panel.\n\n34. We support establishing modalities for a global coordination mechanism at the United Nations Economic and Social Council to systematically monitor illicit financial flows and strengthen financial integrity for sustainable development, with the participation of all relevant stakeholders.\n\nMr. President,\n\n35. On the issue of debt, we have seen that developing countries have been faced with unsustainable debt burdens even before the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risk of new wave of deepening debt, where vital public financial resources are allocated to external debt servicing and repayments at the expense of domestic health and financing for critical developmental needs.\n\n36. I must commend the current initiatives by the international financial institutions and the G20 aimed at significantly mitigating the economic situation of the indebted countries and urge for more efforts in this regard.\n\n37. Therefore, there is an urgent need to consider expansion and extension of the Debt Service Suspension Initiative to include all Developing, Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States facing fiscal and liquidity challenges. In addition, a review of the eligibility criteria for debt suspension, including outright cancellation, is needed for countries facing the most severe challenges.\n\nMr. President,\n\n38. Nigeria reaffirms that international trade is an engine for development and sustained economic growth, as well as the global eradication of poverty.\n\n39. My delegation would like to reaffirm the critical role that a universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system can play in stimulating economic growth and development.\n\n40. Fair and equitable trade would eventually eliminate the need for aid. My country and indeed all African countries do not intend to stay indefinitely looking for aid. All we need is a fair and equitable system of international trade.\n\n41. We, therefore, call for a reform agenda that will engender better recovery from this crisis, build resilience to future shocks and pursue transformative development strategies that can deliver the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nMr. President,\n\n42. The global food system has, in recent times, been impacted by several factors such as population growth, availability and accessibility of arable land and water resources, climate change, and loss of biodiversity.\n\n43. Increased competition for resources such as land, water, and energy, has affected food access and supply, particularly in developing countries. Climate change and unpredictable shocks, such as the current global pandemic, further exacerbate vulnerabilities in the global food system, requiring the UN\u2019s urgent attention.\n\n44. The Government of Nigeria remains determined to improve the productivity and incomes of small-scale farmers by promoting equal access to land, technology and markets, sustainable food production systems and resilient agricultural practices.\n\n45. At the heart of Nigeria\u2019s post-COVID-19 response is the Economic Sustainability Plan, which has a major component, called the Agriculture for Food and Jobs Programme where we seek to leverage suitable technologies to build a resilient food system for the country.\n\n46. An integral part of our food systems\u2019 transformation strategy is to create an enabling and supportive environment to implement these policies in a participatory manner.\n\n47. Global efforts to mitigate and sustain food systems must involve key stakeholders, including Governments, farmers, investors, multilateral organizations, regional bodies, international financial institutions, private partners and civil society organizations.\n\nMr. President,\n\n48. Nigeria has been steadfast in safeguarding human rights, including the advancement of women, the protection of children, the protection of the rights of people living with disabilities, the treatment of migrants, refugees, returnees and displaced persons as well as, the promotion of fundamental freedoms through all legitimate means. In this regard, my delegation commends the positive example of leaders like Prime Minister Jacinda Arden of New Zealand.\n\n49. In this context Nigeria calls for collective global action through a Treaty to end all forms of violence against women and girls of all ages.\n\n50. Nigeria remains unwavering in its commitment to ensuring the advancement of human rights within its shores and beyond. This is so even in the context of a vicious decade-long onslaught by terrorists against Nigerians, quite contrary to unwholesome reports by some who hardly verify what they state against us.\n\n51. The recent rise in hate related crimes globally underscores the urgent need to continue our engagement about racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and other related intolerance. It is sad to note that the issue of racism remains alive globally.\n\n52. We are beginning to forget our affirmation of the inherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of every individual as enshrined in the UN Charter. No society can claim to be free or just if it deprives anyone of these rights.\n\n53. Nigeria has long been a principled fighter against racism and all forms of discrimination inspired by its African experience. In the past, racism oiled the machine of slavery and colonialism. Today, racism drives hate crimes and institutional discrimination. In all this, Africans and people of African descent are among the major victims.\n\n54. Cognizant of these, I commend Member States for adopting by consensus the resolution on the Establishment of the Permanent Forum of People of African Descent on 2nd August 2021. I am confident that this forum will make significant impact in the quest to end race-related vices and injustices.\n\nMr. President,\n\n55. No reform of the United Nations system is more urgent than that of the Security Council. Stakeholders around the world are asking how such power could be concentrated, with scant representation. The intergovernmental negotiations have taken too long, some 15 years. We must avoid going in cycles. Consensus has been achieved in some of the elements of this reform, especially that of the representation of Africa on the basis of the Elzuwini consensus and the Sirte Declaration. It is unreasonable to expect unanimity in this matter. The issue, indeed, is about justice, not unanimity. Without justice, the legitimacy (even efficacy) of our Organization is called to question. We can and must make substantial, irreversible progress on Security Council reform in the current session.\n\nMr. President,\n\n56. Connected to this, is the question of justice, fairness, and equity in respect of the Palestinian people. The situation in the Middle East is long-standing and gives cause for concern. Nigeria encourages Israel and Palestine to re-engage in dialogue based on relevant UN resolutions and Initiatives. The two-state solution has the support of the international community and is widely acknowledged as the path to lasting peace.\n\nMr President,\n\n57. Our organization is at the peak of the multilateral system. It is also the pre-eminent body for solving our current and emerging challenges, and for developing norms that are protective of us all. We need to re-commit to it, rejuvenate it to better serve us. Nigeria re-affirms its faith in the United Nations and is further resolved to continue to work with all Member-States for peace and security, development and the protection of human rights. In the current moment, hope for these, is dependent on how we assist each other to get COVID-19 out of all countries, regardless of their classification. We can and must do so.\n\n58. In this regard, let me close my statement by paying special tribute to a great and humane internationalist, and an exemplary practitioner of multilateral cooperation. I am speaking of Chancellor Angela Merkel of the Federal Republic of Germany. As she exits the stage, we wish her well.\n\nI thank you.",

          "text": "By Okey Onyenweaku\n\nAce banker and Group Managing Director of FBN Holdings, Urum Kalu Eke (UK Eke), has emerged winner of the prestigious Zik Prize in Professional Leadership Award for the year 2020 in recognition of his strides in the banking industry.\n\nAnnouncing the choice of Eke for the award at a virtual press conference yesterday, Prof Pat Utomi, chairman of the selection committee and member of the Board of Public Policy Research and Analysis Centre (PPRAC), organisers of the award scheme, said he was after a rigorous review process by the board.\n\nUtomi described Eke as a consummate banker with close to 4 decades experience in Financial Services, Audit and Capital Market operations across various financial institutions, who is credited with helping develop First Bank businesses within the Public Sector, Retail and Private Banking Groups.\n\n\u201cHe is being celebrated for his unblemished record of service and enormous contributions to the development and growth of the African Financial services industry,\u201d he said.\n\nAn honour to whom it is due\n\nUtomi said Eke, 56, who has had nearly four decades in the banking industry, and continues to make tremendous impact, especially in his capacity as Managing Director of FBN Holdings, where he has led the institution on the part of profitability, is one of Africa\u2019s finest bankers whose records speak for \u201cso eloquently.\u201d\n\nUtomi\u2019s views are shared by many industry players who told Business Hallmark that the honour to banker is most deserving.\n\n\u201cIt is a very good choice and an honour well deserved. It is a recognition of professional excellence,\u201d said Mazi Okechukwu Unaegbu, author and former president of Chattered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cU. K Eke has done well as a banker. And as GMD of FBN Holding\u2019s, he has made his mark. Those who made the choice did a very good job. Rather than look for politicians who carry money about, they decided to honour someone who has contributed meaningfully to the economy.\u201d\n\nFor Mr. David Adonri, Chief Executive Officer of Highcap Securities, no one else could have been more worthy of such recognition.\n\n\u201cUK Ekeh has done well. I remember at the time he took office, the bank faced very serious challenges, principal of which was the position of the non-performing loan which had set the bank on the part of losses,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs there were statutory provisions that had to be made, the losses that accompanied this were such that the bank could not pay dividends. In fact, within that season, the dividends that the FirstBankGroup was barely able to pay to shareholders were not coming from the bank but the subsidiaries.\n\n\u201cIt is to his credit that he has been able to complete the management of those provisions for the bad loans exposure due to the overexposure of the bank to, most notably the petroleum industry. He has successfully written off those bad debts.\u201d\n\nEke who spent about 19 years in the defunct Diamond Bank Plc where he rose to the position of Executive Director, seeing to the bank\u2019s rapid growth to emerge one of the leading banks in the country within the period, eventually left for First Bank to serve as Executive Director, Public Sector, South before moving up to become the Group Managing Director, FBN Holdings Plc in January 2016.\n\nAt FBN Holdings, he has continued to prove his mettle. While the holding company had ended 2015 with gross earnings of N503 billion, it moved to N583.006billion in 2016, his first year as MD.\n\nGoing further, it was N598.184billion in 2017, and by 2018, it was N587.406billion and then N590.4 in 2019. In 2020, however, the impact of the pandemic caused a marginal 1.9 percent drop in the earnings to N579.4 billion.\n\nIn terms of profit, Eke\u2019s reign has also coincided with a period of rapid growth. FBN Holdings profit grew from N12.24billion in 2016 to N37.7billion in 2017, N58.23billion in 2018, N73.66billion in 2019 and N89.7 billion in 2020.",

The sessions would be facilitated by leading faculty from LBS, Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC) staff as well as experts in financial management and exports.\n\nFidelity Bank has over the years demonstrated its resolve to grow the non-oil export side of the economy through strategic initiatives and partnerships. For instance, the bank provided over N32.7 billion in credits to businesses operating in strategic sectors including rice, dairy, poultry, oil palm and cocoa in 2019. The bank has also successfully leveraged strategic partnerships with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) under various industry targeted intervention funding programmes to enhance access to credit for eligible players in the agribusiness and non-oil exports space with the aim of addressing food security gaps and enhancing foreign exchange earnings.\n\n\u201cThe benefits of supporting the non-oil sector of the economy cannot be overemphasized given the immense benefits that it provides to the economy and the nation in terms of providing much needed foreign exchange investments, increasing our Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and employment generation.

The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US-CDC), the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), and Georgetown University collaborated to deliver the professional certification training.\n\nAbout 40 participants drawn from the NCDC, state-level ministries of health, Nigeria Port Health Services, and the Nigerian military were certified in the first cohort of the intermediate-level Public Health Emergency Management Professional Certification Program (PHEM PC) adapted from the US-CDC was delivered by Georgetown University, a leader in Public Health Emergency Management training.\n\nThe Consul General highlighted the strategic partnership between the U.S. and Nigeria in strengthening health security and response to disease threats. \u201cThe U.S. Government is committed to promoting the health and wellbeing of Nigerians through initiatives and training that increase disease prevention, detection, and response,\u201d she added.\n\nThe PHEM PC Program equipped emergency managers, incident managers, state epidemiologists, first responders, watch managers, and other public health experts with specialized training in crisis and emergency risk communication, public health emergency management functions, and operations. The knowledge, competencies, and skill set taught in the course will help officials coordinate public health emergencies.\n\nIn 2019, Nigeria became a GHSA partner country committed to achieving GHSA 2024 targets and IHR requirements. The PHEM training is part of the U.S. Government\u2019s efforts to support pandemic preparedness in Nigeria and globally.\n\nFull remarks by U.S. Consul General Claire Pierengelo During the Closing Ceremony and Certification of Participants of the USG-supported Public Health Emergency Management Professional Certificate Program Friday, September 24, 2021\n\nFour Point by Sheraton, Victoria Island, Lagos\n\nOn behalf of the U.S. Mission in Nigeria, I am delighted to join you this afternoon for the closing ceremony and certification of participants of the United States Government-supported Public Health Emergency Management Professional Certificate program, the first such training at the intermediate level.\n\nOver the last 14 days, our distinguished participants have gone through rigorous training leading to certification. The two-week course focused on core principles of an Incident Management System (IMS) as an efficient coordination mechanism for responding to small disease outbreaks as well as more significant public health emergencies like the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nEmergency Management is one of the 11 capacity building prioritized by the USG in its support of Nigeria. Our primary goal is to continue supporting Nigeria to achieve the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) 2024 targets and the International Health Regulations (IHR) requirements by strengthening workforce development, surveillance, emergency response, and laboratory capacity, among other areas.\n\nToday\u2019s event highlights our continued strategic partnership with Nigeria to support health security and response to disease threats. In the recent past, the USG had funded the participation of 4 Nigerians to attend the advanced Public Health Emergency Management (PHEM) Fellowship program at CDC headquarters in Atlanta.\n\nAs Nigeria consolidates country capacity for public health response by establishing State Public Health Emergency Operations Centers (PHEOC) across the country, we envision expanding PHEM capacity across Nigeria by training more stakeholders to ensure adequate knowledge, competencies, and skills to efficiently manage technical operations of the PHEOCs.\n\nEven as we continue to respond to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in our countries and many parts of the world, the need for all countries to continuously improve their response capacities cannot be overemphasized. We believe the PHEM professional certification program is one such training initiative that will adequately position Nigeria for epidemic and pandemic response now and into the future.\n\nLet me use this opportunity to thank Dr. Chikwe and the NCDC team for providing the opportunity for this transformative collaboration. In addition, I would like to thank the US-CDC for their leadership and Georgetown University for their efforts in working with the government and other partners to implement the PHEM program in Nigeria.\n\nFinally, following lessons learned from this pilot implementation, USG will continue to support NCDC to advance Public Health Emergency Management interventions in Nigeria at all levels. let me reiterate that the we remain committed and stand ready to continue our partnership with Nigeria in its response to public health disease threats and adopt strategies that will increase disease prevention, detection, and response. We are committed to promoting the health and wellbeing of Nigerians.\n\nThank you.",

          "text": "\u2026We\u2019ve changed the way we do business \u2013 GMD \u2026It\u2019ll boost investors\u2019 confidence \u2013 SAN \u2026Corporation\u2019s books manipulated \u2013 Obiaraeri \u2018\u2026NNPC still a loss-making entity\u2019 \u2018\u2026The agency showed positive results due to cash infusion\u2019\n\nMany Nigerians could not believe their ears when they heard that the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) recorded profit in 2020, as they are yet to come to terms with the figures presented. According to them, over the years, the Corporation seems to have been managed only to record losses; BENJAMIN UMUTEME reports.\n\nThe announcement that the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) recorded a N287 billion profit in 2020 jolted Nigerians that felt it was surreal, even as others took the announcement with a pinch of salt preferring to see the full report before they can speak.\n\n\n\nOver the years, Nigerians have seen the state-run Corporate as the epitome of wastefulness as its four refineries have refused to work due largely to corrupt handling of Turn Around Maintenance (TAM) that have been carried out. The implication was that staffers were being paid without doing any work. In the 2018 and 2019 audited reports, the Corporation recorded losses and it was on that basis that many are yet to come to terms with the \u2018profit\u2019 that was recorded. More still, is the fact that in 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic shut down global production thereby making it difficult for the crude oil sale which prices entered negative territories.\n\n\n\nAnnouncing the record profit, the first in 44 years of the Corporation\u2019s existence, President Muhammadu Buhari said the feat became possible through prudent management of resources and the need to maximise value for the Nigerian people from its natural resources.\n\n\u201cI am pleased to announce the declaration of profit after tax of N287 billion in 2020 by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation. This is sequel to the completion of the statutory annual audit exercise for year 2020.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe NNPC losses were reduced from N803 billion in 2018 to N1.7 billion in 2019 and the eventual declaration of net profit in 2020 for the first time in its 44-year history.\n\n\n\n\u201cI have further directed the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation to timely publish the audited financial statements in line with the requirements of the law and as a follow-up to our commitment to ensuring transparency and accountability by public institutions,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nNNPC GMD\u2019s explanations\n\n\n\nThrowing more like on the N287 billion profit recorded by the Corporation, NNPC GMD, Mele Kyari, said the turn-around from a loss position of N803 billion to a profit of N287 billion between 2018 to 2020 is an indication of the aggressive implementation of its cost-cutting measures, automation of business processes, emphasis on commercially-focused investments, and non-interference in the management of the Corporation from any quarters.\n\n\n\nHe said the Corporation saved a lot of cost through contract renegotiation by up to 30% on the heels of the Covid-19 pandemic, introduction of technology that drastically cut travel cost through reduction in in-person meetings and the general automation of processes that enhanced efficiency across the group\u2019s businesses.\n\nKyari said, \u201cWhat we did to arrive at this (N287 billion profit), I think it is a continuous process. Since this administration came into being in 2015, there was a very drastic change in the way we do our business.\n\n\u201cOne is to cut cost, to be more efficient and also to ensure that this company is transparent and accountable to Nigerians and therefore it is a process that started in 2015 on the commencement of the administration of president Muhammadu Buhari who has consistently being the Minister of Petroleum Resources in 2015 till this day and the end result is that, that piloting gave us the opportunity to do things differently.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd because it is a continuous process, when I came on board, I learnt from what was on ground and also brought a new perspective which is to ensure that I build on what I met and to collaborate and steer the direction of the board of directors of this company to ensure that cost is reduced.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe combination of all these is the result we posted. First is the reduction of the losses in 2019. It is a collective activity, collective action, but ultimately the things that we did made it possible.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nDoubts persist\n\n\n\nBefore the full audited report was released, a foremost economist and founder of Stanbic-IBTC Bank, Atedo Peterside, insisted that there was no way the NNPC, with the way it is presently run, can make profit. Peterside noted further that the Corporation dipped its fingers into the federation account to announce the N287 billion profits.\n\n\n\nIn a tweet, Peterside wrote, \u201cThere is an allegation that NNPC dipped their fingers in the Federation Cookie Jar in order to announce bumper 2020 profits; they should come clean and publish details of all dividends received by them and tell us which ones they recently diverted from the federation to themselves.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlso, the investment banker challenged the Corporation to publish details of all dividends received by it and tell Nigerians which ones it recently \u201cdiverted from the federation.\u201d\n\n\n\nLikewise, Dr. Nnaemeka Obiaraeri, a petroleum sector expert, queried how the Corporation will suddenly move from a loss position of N.7 billion in 2019 to a record profit of N287 billion in 2020?\n\n\n\nFor Obiaraeri, it was all about manipulative balance sheet engineering through consolidation of the corporate actions of independent entities set up by acts of parliament for the benefit of the federation saying it was a \u2018tad too deceitful.\u2019\n\n\n\nAccording to the petroleum expert, the dividends of the NLNG; The West African Gas Pipeline Company (Operated by Chevron); The Nigeria Gas Company (NGC); Duke Oil; NPDC; Bonny Transport Company, and Wheel Insurance were put together and declared as profit by the NNPC.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen you add up all of the dividends for the year ended 2019, which was declared, paid and transferred to the NNPC accounts in 2020 on behalf of the federation , you will get in excess of over $2.5bn/N1 trillion (using the CBN official rate),\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nIndustry experts have queried how the Corporation was able to re-value its N713 billion initially assumed to be doubtful receivables from the federation account. They are of the belief that \u201cit\u2019s just a one off thing that won\u2019t happen every year.\u201d There is also a widespread belief that the Corporation manicured its books to arrive at the profit.\n\n\n\n\n\nExperts on revenue shortfall\n\n\n\nA closer look at the financial statements revealed that the Corporation\u2019s revenue fell by 19.76 per cent in 2020 to N3.718 trillion from N4.634 trillion declared in 2019. Further highlights of the financial statements revealed that while the Corporation\u2019s group financial position increased in total current assets by 18.7 per cent compared to that of 2019, its total current liabilities increased by 11.4 per cent within the same period.\n\nAccording to the report, the group\u2019s working capital remained below the line at N4.56 trillion in 2020 as against N4.44 trillion in 2019. That is not all!\n\n\u201cAccumulated losses in recent years come to N1.5 trillion for the group and N395 billion for the Corporation,\u201d the Premium Times had indicated in a report.\n\n\n\nAs far as the head of finance at American International School of Lagos, Elochukwu Oguebue, is concerned, despite the media hype, NNPC is still a loss-making entity.\n\n\n\n\u201cOne assumption I can make from the disclosure on the impairment reversal and other notes to the accounts is that the Federal Government must have injected funds into NNPC in 2021. Or what else could have prompted the reversal. To reverse impairment on receivables, the auditors must have seen a document that convinced them that most of that amount is recoverable,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nOthers believe that backing out the N713 billion reversal of impairment and refunds showed that NNPC would have reported another year of loss. Going further into the report, the auditors explained how NNPC had been sustaining recurring losses over the years, culminating in N1.5 trillion as of December 2020.\n\n\n\n\u201cThese events or conditions along with other matters indicate that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubts on the group and Corporation\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern,\u201d PwC, SIAO Partners, and Muhtari Dangana & Co say in a joint statement.\n\n\n\n\n\nIncreased income\n\n\n\nIt is not really all gloomy as the audited report revealed a 153.95 per cent increase from the NNPC\u2019s Other Incomes from N266 billion in 2019 to N675.7 billion in 2020. The major components of the Other Incomes include a N110.6 billion refund from the federation, N157 billion from sundry incomes (amounts recovered from the federation relating to strategic alliance balances), and a N250 billion from variation in crude stocks, which represents movements in crude inventory, under-lift and over-lift positions.\n\nAs the director of finance and operations at a Washington-based Community Foundation of Snohomish County, Kalu Aja, put it \u201cthe Corporation was able to show positive results due to cash infusion from the federal government.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe cash infusion is more than cash generated from the operations of the Corporation. To be legal and clear, this is correct. The question is should a Corporation that has a negative short-term position post billions in accounting \u2018profits\u2019\u201d?\n\nMore questions\n\n\n\n\n\nThe shortfall of the value of the Corporation\u2019s assets over its liabilities is one area of contention, especially as this raises concerns on the going concern of the supposedly most prolific and strategic asset of Nigeria. The experts wondered how a Corporation like NNPC can perennially be loss-making, while companies operating in the sector, with very limited assets and resources, are consistently reporting operating profits, with strong cash flow.\n\n\n\nSpeaking with this reporter, a source who would not want his name in print said to record profit in a pandemic year when the majority of businesses were recording losses is no mean feat. He noted that if the Corporation records profit in 2020 of all years, \u201cit shows that they would have been recording profit in years past which has not been remitted.\u201d\n\n\n\nOther professionals wonder what could have eroded the assets of NNPC beyond its perennial losses, which have always been a subject of enquiry. While it\u2019s a myth yet to be unravelled, analysts wonder how NNPC spends N678 billion on general and administrative expenses, including some N65 billion staff cost of its refinery subsidiary, despite the public knowledge that the refineries are moribund. While some say petrol subsidy has been one of the major factors responsible for NNPC\u2019s poor performance, that argument seems weak given that NNPC usually passes the cost to the federation account.\n\n\n\nPositive devt\n\n\n\nSome experts have, however, commended the Corporation for the courage to make its financial statement public. According to them, the move is a positive development for the extractive industry.\n\n\n\nAn energy law expert, Damilola, Olawuyi (SAN), explained that international law emphasises the need for openness and transparency across all aspects of regulatory enforcement and supervision. NEITI has been particularly active in raising awareness of the need for proactive information disclosure as a tool for enhancing public confidence and eradicating corruption.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe publication of audited financial statements by the NNPC shows that such efforts are paying off and will significantly boost investors\u2019 confidence in the on-going efforts by the federal government to sanitise the extractive industry.\n\n\n\n\u201cReducing secrecy, through the publication of open and transparent data, allows stakeholders to monitor corruption risks across the entire oil and gas value-chain and to make sure they are properly addressed,\u201d Prof. Olawuyi said further.\n\n\n\nAn Abuja-based chartered accountant, Ifeanyi Onuba, in his reaction, expressed surprise that people question the report because they have not been following the Corporation\u2019s publications of its monthly financial and operational reports (MFORs).\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that despite NNPC\u2019s Monthly Financial and Operations Report including the published Audited Financial Statements for 2018 and 2019, Peterside could still claim that the Corporation took funds from the federation account in order to announce a profit of N287 billion,\u201d he said.",

Ortom said instead of bringing Nigeria together, the president had succeeded in dividing the country with intimidation and marginalization.\n\nThe governor, who said this yesterday in Enugu when he delivered a lecture at the Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria, organized by the NUJ Chapel titled \u2018Emerging Security Situation in the SouthEast: The Place of Good Governance,\u201d noted that Buhari has abused power by not giving equal appointments and recognizing federal character. He said he does not hate Buhari or the Fulani but must speak in the face of marginalisation, intimidation and selective injustice, pointing out that the constitution must be respected. Ortom said for Nigeria to move in the path of unity and oneness, the people of Eastern Nigeria should be provided with adequate infrastructure.\n\n\u201cEastern Nigeria deserves infrastructure and key appointments. Our founding fathers saw a vision of oneness and unity. \u201cThe present administration has instead employed intimidation. I, Ortom, will not keep quiet in the face of marginalisation,\u201d he said, adding that he wants peace anchored on justice to reign. Ortom said whereas former President Goodluck Jonathan never threatened or intimidated anybody, under President Buhari, intimidation of dissenting voices in a democracy has been the order of the day. He lamented that it was Buhari who pushed out Jonathan with intimidation that if he does not win in 2015 \u201cbaboons and monkeys will be soaked in blood.\n\n\u201cJonathan\u2019s government never intimidated anybody but today, never in the history of the country has Nigeria been divided as it is.\u201d Speaking on how bad things have degenerated under Buhari, Ortom said cost of goods and services had gone up to the extent that \u201cif nothing is done, a dollar will exchange for N1,000. Ortom, however, pleaded with Ndigbo not to destroy infrastructure in their place since what they are destroying belongs to them.",

It is imperative to underscore that no one is safe until everyone is safe.\u201d\n\nOn security, he raised concerns over illicit trade, transfer, and circulation of small arms and light weapons.\n\nTheir excessive accumulation and uncontrolled spread in many regions of the world, the President stated, were already having devastating humanitarian and socio-economic consequences, especially on the continent of Africa.\n\nHe, therefore, called for a worldwide application of the Arms Trade Treaty to codify accountability in conventional arms trade, saying it was critical to the security of nations.\n\nPresident Buhari explained that this was in recognition of the need for a broad-based global partnership in the ongoing battle against transborder crimes, including terrorism and piracy.\n\nHe stressed the need not to only deal with the symptoms of conflict but to tackle the immediate causes that fuel crisis, including poor and undemocratic governance, human rights abuses, poverty, ignorance, injustice and inequalities.\n\n\u201cThere are no easy solutions to these conditions,\u201d the Nigerian leader told the session. \u201cThey require long term investments and more effective international cooperation.\n\n\u201cIn this connection, my delegation underscores the importance of promoting peaceful, unfettered, and inclusive participation of states in global actions towards conflict prevention. This will facilitate the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Union Agenda 2063.\u201d\n\nThe President also drew the attention of the world leaders to the forceful takeover of government in some African countries, noting the events in Guinea and Sudan.\n\nHe lamented that such happenings were eroding the democratic gains of past decades, stressing that the recent trend which, sometimes were in reaction to unilateral changes of constitutions by some leaders, must not be tolerated by the international community.\n\nAccording to the Nigerian leader, Nigeria fully supports the efforts by ECOWAS to address the growing challenge and appreciates the support of both the African Union and the United Nations.\n\nHe reiterated that leaders of individual member-states must adhere to the constitutional provisions of their countries, particularly on term limits.\n\nOn the issue of extremism, he said, \u201cTerrorism continues to dominate security discourse worldwide. In Nigeria, Boko Haram terrorist group, though fragmented by internal strife and weakened by our defence forces, is still active and preying on soft targets.\n\n\u201cNigeria will continue to work closely with UN Counter-Terrorism bodies and entities with a view to bringing this scourge to an end, Nigeria has spared no effort in addressing the challenges of terrorism posed by the activities of Boko Haram in North-East Nigeria and the Lake Chad region, as well as banditry in the North-West and North-Central Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Security Forces have recorded considerable success in the fight against terrorism. As a result of the renewed vigour of our military, many terrorist fighters are voluntarily surrendering to our security forces,\u201d he added.\n\nPresident Buhari informed the session that Nigeria intended to build a climate-resilient economy that would effectively align with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), as well as with great potentials to unlocking the full opportunities in different sectors of the economy while protecting the resources for present and future generations.\n\nHe stated that as leaders, there was a need to create inclusive and gender-sensitive policies that would address all issues connected to climate action, from mitigation to resilience.\n\nAccording to the President, Nigeria believes that protecting the planet and its biodiversity and climate are important to the collective survival of the people.\n\nHe explained that this was why the government was working on a transition to a low carbon economy, consistent with achieving the Paris Climate Agreement and the SDGs.\n\nRead his full speech at the session below:\n\nADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY, MUHAMMADU BUHARI, PRESIDENT OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA AT THE GENERAL DEBATE OF THE 76TH SESSION OF UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY Friday, 24TH SEPTEMBER, 2021 NEW YORK, USA\n\nProtocols:\n\nMr. President,\n\nLet me, on behalf of the government and people of Nigeria, congratulate you on your well-deserved election as President of the 76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly. I would like to assure you of the full support and cooperation of the Nigerian delegation throughout your tenure.\n\n2 I would like to commend your predecessor, His Excellency, Mr. Volkan Boskir, for the many remarkable achievements recorded during his tenure, despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n3 Permit me to congratulate the Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, on his re-election and commend his strong commitment to making the UN more alive to its responsibilities.\n\n4 I also want to express my gratitude to him for re-appointing Ms. Amina Mohammed, as the Deputy Secretary General to assist him in discharging his heavy responsibilities.\n\nMr. President,\n\n5 The theme of this year\u2019s General Assembly \u2013 \u201cBuilding resilience through hope \u2013 to recover from COVID-19, rebuild sustainably, respond to the needs of the planet, respect the rights of the people, and revitalise the United Nations, sums up our common desire to rescue our planet, recover our economies, and restore hope to all the peoples of the world.\n\n6 In this regard, my delegation will continue to support the United Nations, as the indispensable forum for international cooperation and the cornerstone of the multilateral system, rooted in respect for international law, including international human rights law and predicated on a rules-based order.\n\nMr. President,\n\n7 I want to thank the international community for the concerted response to COVID-19. The solidarity and drive to contain the first truly global health emergency of our time is a pointer to the many things we can achieve if we work together.\n\n8 On our part, Nigeria has made strenuous efforts to contain the virus and halt its deadly onslaught on our people. Our efforts have been rewarded with moderate success.\n\n9 At the outset, we recognised detection and contact tracing to be important tools in combating the virus. In this connection, from a mere four laboratories with testing and detection capacities, we ramped up the facilities to over 140 centres today.\n\n10 Similarly, we built isolation centres and emergency hospitals wards in record time all over the country. We carry out genomic sequencing in designated laboratories across the country with a view to detecting variants in circulation.\n\n11 In addition, over 40,000 health care workers have recently been trained on Infection, Prevention and Control measures with the support of various partners. Through the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control, we have established 16 infectious disease treatment centres located within our Teaching Hospitals and Federal Medical Centres.\n\n12 Nigeria remains grateful for the assistance received from our partners and friends all over the world. Vaccination is the key to our safe emergence from the pandemic. We fully support the COVAX initiative from which we have benefitted. We also thank the United States of America, Turkey, India, China, European Union, and others for the vaccines provided.\n\n13 Despite the acknowledgement however, I would like to reiterate my call for a fairer and more equitable distribution of vaccines to all countries so that, together, we can fight and contain the pandemic. The rising wave of newer and more contagious strains, makes this even more urgent. No country can afford the socio-economic implications of prolonged shutdown. It is imperative to underscore that no one is safe until everyone is safe.\n\nMr President,\n\n14 Nigeria remains deeply concerned over the illicit trade, transfer, and circulation of small arms and light weapons. Their excessive accumulation and uncontrolled spread in many regions of the world are having devastating humanitarian and socio-economic consequences, especially on the continent of Africa.\n\n15 It is on this note that my delegation calls for the world wide application of the Arms Trade Treaty to codify accountability in conventional arms trade, which is critical to the security of nations. This is in recognition of the need for a broad-based global partnership in the on-going battle against trans-border crimes, including terrorism and piracy.\n\nMr. President,\n\n16 We must deal not only with the symptoms of conflict but also the immediate causes that fuel conflicts in the first place. These include poor and undemocratic governance, human rights abuses, poverty, ignorance, injustice and inequalities.\n\n17 There are no easy solutions to these conditions. They require long term investments and more effective international cooperation. In this connection, my delegation underscores the importance of promoting peaceful, unfettered, and inclusive participation of states in global actions towards conflict prevention. This will facilitate the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Union Agenda 2063.\n\n18 In West Africa especially, our democratic gains of the past decades are now being eroded. The recent trend of unconstitutional takeover of power, sometimes in reaction to unilateral changes of constitutions by some leaders, must not be tolerated by the international community. Nigeria fully supports the efforts by ECOWAS to address this growing challenge and appreciates the support of both the African Union and the United Nations. In this regard, I would like to reiterate that as leaders of our individual Member-States we need to adhere to the constitutional provisions of our countries, particularly on term limits. This is one area that generates crisis and political tension in our sub-region.\n\nMr President,\n\n19 Nigeria is fully committed to nuclear non-proliferation and has always supported the view that it should involve all States.\n\n20 Disarmament Conventions deserve the support of all states, small, large, nuclear or non-nuclear. Nuclear weapons remain the ultimate agents of mass destruction, and their total elimination should be the final objective of all disarmament processes within the broad spectrum of goals being pursued by the United Nations.\n\n21 In this regard, Nigeria would participate actively in the forthcoming Review Conference of the Nuclear Prohibition Treaty and also the First Meeting of States Parties to the landmark Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, scheduled to take place within the first quarter of 2022.\n\n22 Nigeria regards these upcoming events as important steps towards the realisation of a world free of nuclear weapons. We are, therefore, supportive of any diplomatic efforts in this direction. We hope that the upcoming NPT review conference would lead to a successful outcome that would facilitate the denuclearisation of the world. We would do our part to ensure such an outcome.\n\nMr. President,\n\n23 Terrorism continues to dominate security discourse worldwide. In Nigeria, Boko Haram terrorists group, though fragmented by internal strife and weakened by our defence forces, is still active and preying on soft targets. Nigeria will continue to work closely with UN Counter-Terrorism bodies and entities with a view to bringing this scourge to an end.\n\n24 Nigeria has spared no effort in addressing the challenges of terrorism posed by the activities of Boko Haram in North-East Nigeria and the Lake Chad region, as well as banditry in the North-West and North-Central Nigeria. The Nigerian Security Forces have recorded considerable success in the fight against terrorism. As a result of the renewed vigour of our military, many terrorist fighters are voluntarily surrendering to our security forces.\n\n25 I and three other Nigerian Heads of State served actively as peace keepers and Nigeria continues to support peacekeeping efforts. We know the sacrifice involved, we also know how important peace keeping is for those in vulnerable situations. Nigeria will continue to play its part fully in supporting United Nations peacekeeping operations within Africa and beyond.\n\nMr. President,\n\n26 The impact of climate change is already with us in Nigeria, manifesting in various ways: conflicts trigger; food insecurity, drying up of lakes; loss of livelihood, and youth migration, among others. The trend is the same in many other countries that are threatened by forest fires, rising sea levels, drought and desertification.\n\n27 In the circumstances, we intend to build a climate-resilient economy that effectively aligns with the SDGs and that has great potentials to unlocking the full opportunities in different sectors of the economy, while protecting the resources for present and future generations. I know, in several ways, this is also a familiar story in many countries.\n\n28 As leaders, we must create inclusive and gender-sensitive policies that address all issues connected to climate action, from mitigation to resilience.\n\n29 Nigeria believes that protecting our planet and its biodiversity and climate are important to our collective survival. That is why, we are working on a transition to low carbon economy, consistent with achieving the Paris Climate Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nMr. President,\n\n30 Combating illicit financial flows and ensuring the recovery and return of illicitly acquired assets have the potential to provide resources in the immediate term for financing development in this era of the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.\n\n31 Similarly, corruption across national borders has huge negative impact on the stability, peace, and economic prospects of millions, particularly in developing countries.\n\n32 It deprives national Governments of resources needed to provide adequate and meaningful sources of livelihood for their citizens. The latter gives rise to more irregular migration patterns, with unwholesome consequences for inter-state and human relations.\n\n33 I, therefore, call on all leaders to demonstrate the much-needed political will by supporting the recommendations for systemic reforms made by the FACTI Panel.\n\n34 We support establishing modalities for a global coordination mechanism at the United Nations Economic and Social Council to systematically monitor illicit financial flows and strengthen financial integrity for sustainable development, with the participation of all relevant stakeholders.\n\nMr. President,\n\n35 On the issue of debt, we have seen that developing countries have been faced with unsustainable debt burdens even before the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risk of new wave of deepening debt, where vital public financial resources are allocated to external debt servicing and repayments at the expense of domestic health and financing for critical developmental needs.\n\n36 I must commend the current initiatives by the international financial institutions and the G20 aimed at significantly mitigating the economic situation of the indebted countries and urge for more efforts in this regard.\n\n37 Therefore, there is an urgent need to consider expansion and extension of the Debt Service Suspension Initiative to include all Developing, Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States facing fiscal and liquidity challenges. In addition, a review of the eligibility criteria for debt suspension, including outright cancellation, is needed for countries facing the most severe challenges.\n\nMr. President,\n\n38 Nigeria reaffirms that international trade is an engine for development and sustained economic growth, as well as the global eradication of poverty.\n\n39 My delegation would like to reaffirm the critical role that a universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system can play in stimulating economic growth and development.\n\n40 Fair and equitable trade would eventually eliminate the need for aid. My country and indeed all African countries do not intend to stay indefinitely looking for aid. All we need is a fair and equitable system of international trade.\n\n41 We, therefore, call for a reform agenda that will engender better recovery from this crisis, build resilience to future shocks and pursue transformative development strategies that can deliver the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nMr. President,\n\n42 The global food system has, in recent times, been impacted by several factors such as population growth, availability and accessibility of arable land and water resources, climate change, and loss of biodiversity.\n\n43 Increased competition for resources such as land, water, and energy, has affected food access and supply, particularly in developing countries. Climate change and unpredictable shocks, such as the current global pandemic, further exacerbate vulnerabilities in the global food system, requiring the UN\u2019s urgent attention.\n\n44 The Government of Nigeria remains determined to improve the productivity and incomes of small-scale farmers by promoting equal access to land, technology and markets, sustainable food production systems and resilient agricultural practices.\n\n45 At the heart of Nigeria\u2019s post-COVID-19 response is the Economic Sustainability Plan, which has a major component, called the Agriculture for Food and Jobs Programme where we seek to leverage suitable technologies to build a resilient food system for the country.\n\n46 An integral part of our food systems\u2019 transformation strategy is to create an enabling and supportive environment to implement these policies in a participatory manner.\n\n47 Global efforts to mitigate and sustain food systems must involve key stakeholders, including Governments, farmers, investors, multilateral organizations, regional bodies, international financial institutions, private partners and civil society organizations.\n\nMr. President,\n\n48 Nigeria has been steadfast in safeguarding human rights, including the advancement of women, the protection of children, the protection of the rights of people living with disabilities, the treatment of migrants, refugees, returnees and displaced persons as well as, the promotion of fundamental freedoms through all legitimate means. In this regard, my delegation commends the positive example of leaders like Prime Minister Jacinda Arden of New Zealand.\n\n49 In this context Nigeria calls for collective global action through a Treaty to end all forms of violence against women and girls of all ages.\n\n50 Nigeria remains unwavering in its commitment to ensuring the advancement of human rights within its shores and beyond. This is so even in the context of a vicious decade-long onslaught by terrorists against Nigerians, quite contrary to unwholesome reports by some who hardly verify what they state against us.\n\n51 The recent rise in hate related crimes globally underscores the urgent need to continue our engagement about racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and other related intolerance. It is sad to note that the issue of racism remains alive globally.\n\n52 We are beginning to forget our affirmation of the inherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of every individual as enshrined in the UN Charter. No society can claim to be free or just if it deprives anyone of these rights.\n\n53 Nigeria has long been a principled fighter against racism and all forms of discrimination inspired by its African experience. In the past, racism oiled the machine of slavery and colonialism. Today, racism drives hate crimes and institutional discrimination. In all this, Africans and people of African descent are among the major victims.\n\n54 Cognizant of these, I commend Member States for adopting by consensus the resolution on the Establishment of the Permanent Forum of People of African Descent on 2nd August 2021. I am confident that this forum will make significant impact in the quest to end race-related vices and injustices.\n\nMr. President,\n\n55 No reform of the United Nations system is more urgent than that of the Security Council. Stakeholders around the world are asking how such power could be concentrated, with scant representation. The intergovernmental negotiations have taken too long, some 15 years. We must avoid going in cycles. Consensus has been achieved in some of the elements of this reform, especially that of the representation of Africa on the basis of the Elzuwini consensus and the Sirte Declaration. It is unreasonable to expect unanimity in this matter. The issue, indeed, is about justice, not unanimity. Without justice, the legitimacy (even efficacy) of our Organization is called to question. We can and must make substantial, irreversible progress on Security Council reform in the current session.\n\nMr. President,\n\n56 Connected to this, is the question of justice, fairness, and equity in respect of the Palestinian people. The situation in the Middle East is long-standing and gives cause for concern. Nigeria encourages Israel and Palestine to re-engage in dialogue based on relevant UN resolutions and Initiatives. The two-state solution has the support of the international community and is widely acknowledged as the path to lasting peace.\n\nMr President,\n\n57 Our organization is at the peak of the multilateral system. It is also the pre-eminent body for solving our current and emerging challenges, and for developing norms that are protective of us all. We need to re-commit to it, rejuvenate it to better serve us. Nigeria re-affirms its faith in the United Nations and is further resolved to continue to work with all Member-States for peace and security, development and the protection of human rights. In the current moment, hope for these, is dependent on how we assist each other to get COVID-19 out of all countries, regardless of their classification. We can and must do so.\n\n58 In this regard, let me close my statement by paying special tribute to a great and humane internationalist, and an exemplary practitioner of multilateral cooperation. I am speaking of Chancellor Angela Merkel of the Federal Republic of Germany. As she exits the stage, we wish her well.\n\nI thank you.",

          "text": "The Federal Government has clarified that the debts being taken are not for funding recurrent expenditures but for implementing capital projects which previous administrations failed to carry out.\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed stated this in Maiduguri, the Borno State capital on Thursday during a one-day town hall meeting on the power situation in the state.\n\nThe minister\u2019s explanation is coming on the heels of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s plea at the UNGA meeting, for \u201crich nations\u201d and international financial institutions for outright debt cancellation for countries facing the most severe challenges in the wake of the COVID-19\u201d.\n\nThe president\u2019s most recent request for an external loan was sent to the Senate on September 14.\n\nIn his letter transmitted to the Senate, he sought the approval of the lawmakers to borrow $4 billion and \u20ac710 million loans from bilateral and multilateral organisations to fund the deficit in the 2021 budget.\n\nThe National Assembly had approved one earlier in July where the President requested to borrow $8.3 billion and \u20ac490 million loans contained in the initial 2018-2020 borrowing plan.\n\nFurther defending the borrowings, Lai Mohammed said that the Federal Government has implemented a lot of projects in different parts of the country which, according to him, past administrations had used as a conduit pipe to squander public funds.\n\nThe minister argued that infrastructure is the engine of economic growth, hence, the premium it places on building and reconstruction.\n\n\u201cNaysayers have recently ramped up their criticism of the Buhari administration from borrowing. These critics are very insincere; we do not borrow for recurrent expenditure neither do we borrow to pay salaries. We are borrowing to build world-class infrastructures that will benefit generations of Nigerians and we have a lot to show from the loans we have taken.\u201d Mohammed stated.\n\nAccording to him, the Federal Government has over 13,000 kilometers of federal roads under repair, rehabilitation and reconstruction.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a road project in every state today. Today we have started the countdown to when the second Niger bridge which successive administrations have built only on paper will be completed.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is an irony that those who are criticizing us today performed very badly in terms of modernizing our infrastructure even when they served at a time when our earnings were multiples of what we get today. Have they embarked on the kind of infrastructure development we are currently engaged in perhaps there would have been no reason for us to borrow as much as we are doing today.\n\n\u201cFor example, in their time they claimed to have spent billions of naira in building infrastructure but as one can see their infrastructure projects are only on the pages of newspapers. Today we are still saddled with looking for resources to build the same infrastructure for which they claimed to have allocated huge resources. We\u2019ll however not be deterred by their antics, we\u2019ll continue to ignore those who have decided to play politics with everything,\u201d Mohammed added.",

          "title": "Sky Sports: In Usyk, Joshua Faces Toughest Opponent of His Career, Victory Would Be His Greatest Yet",
          "text": "There was a mischievous moment this week when Oleksandr Usyk\u2019s entourage found Anthony Joshua\u2019s car and, while laughing, they inscribed in dust the challenger\u2019s name onto the door. An unpleasant surprise for when the champion returned.\n\nIt was a reminder that beyond the prestige and mutual admiration of this magnificent world heavyweight championship fight there is also a healthy dose of disrespect.\n\nThe most difficult fight of Joshua\u2019s career is against Usyk Saturday night, from the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London in front of 70,000 passionate fans, live on Sky Sports Box Office.\n\nJoshua has been in compelling fights before but none quite like this \u2013 the Wladimir Klitschko fight may always define him and the Andy Ruiz Jr rematch genuinely divided predictions, but Usyk represents a unique and complex challenge.\n\nUndefeated and undisputed as a cruiserweight, there is a sprinkling of stardust over the enigmatic Usyk. He is a southpaw (Joshua has boxed just one-and-a-half rounds against a left-hander in his pro career) and he is vying to become only the third boxer ever to become world champion at cruiser and heavyweight.\n\nThe Ukrainian with the menacing smile arrived with a shaven head and a handlebar moustache \u2013 it is a throwback to his warrior ancestry, to the 17th Century Cossack people, who fought with swords on horseback. His change of look is a sign of intent.\n\nHe has worn colourful socks with aliens on them, then dressed as Batman\u2019s rival The Joker, but none of Usyk\u2019s idiosyncrasies are a laughing matter for Joshua.\n\nThe IBF, WBA and WBO champion has called this a fight \u201cfor the brain\u201d but there is clearly an intriguing physical element \u2013 after weeks of rumours suggesting Joshua would come in light to match Usyk\u2019s nimbleness, he weighed in as his usual rock-solid self.\n\nHis pre-fight work-out routine was a calculated attempt not to allow the juggling and entertaining Usyk to steal the limelight. Previously when he fought Kubrat Pulev, Joshua\u2019s public work-out consisted of merely wrapping his hands before he asked cameras to leave but, this time, he performed too.\n\nThis is surely a fight to be settled in the nerve-shredding final few rounds, perhaps even with an excruciating wait for the scorecards after Joshua and Usyk have duked out their best punches.\n\n\u201cI think, at first, it will be chess,\u201d Usyk said.\n\nJoshua must not be lured into Usyk\u2019s realm and has warned: \u201cI can out-box him, of course I can. And I can out-strength him.\n\n\u201cObviously we have our go-to \u2013 our strength. I will use my strengths.\u201d\n\nUsyk\u2019s strengths are his movement and his IQ, factors which mean he has not lost since he was an amateur a decade ago.\n\nHe has a stunning habit of upstaging the local favourite \u2013 in Russia, Latvia, the US, Poland and the UK he has won at least seven fights in his opponent\u2019s back yard. He will know that the council estate Joshua grew up in is just a few miles away and will relish spoiling the party.\n\nUsyk has long been an elite fighter but he is now at his absolute peak and that is what makes him the toughest rival of Joshua\u2019s career.\n\nBut he will meet Joshua 3.0 inside the ring tonight \u2013 not the talented and physical up-and-comer, not the fighter who survived a rollercoaster ride, but a reigning champion in his physical and mental pomp.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not an easy fight for anyone,\u201d Joshua has said and he\u2019s absolutely right.\n\nFor while Usyk may be a unique test for Joshua, Joshua is certainly the most perilous examination of Usyk\u2019s skills.\n\nTonight\u2019s fight represents the conclusion to a 10-year mission for Usyk, who first watched a 21-year-old Joshua lose an amateur fight but still predicted that he would become Olympic champion. A year later they both won gold at London 2012 and Usyk has kept an eye on Joshua ever since.\n\nWhat secrets Klitschko has whispered are also a mystery \u2013 Joshua\u2019s team said he \u201cdenounced any involvement\u201d but Usyk said \u201cI keep talking to him\u201d.\n\nThe biggest compliment that can be paid to this enthralling fight is that mentions of Tyson Fury have been kept to a bare minimum. The dream undisputed title fight will never become a reality unless Joshua can dispatch Usyk tonight, in the most difficult task of his career.\n\nSky Sports",

They would dilute the value and meaning of club and country competitions.\n\n\u201cThey would diminish and conflict with women\u2019s and youth football \u2013 being under-represented areas of the game where ECA and others are committing significant time, talent and resources \u2013 while also subordinating other sporting tournaments and interests at all levels worldwide.\n\n\u201cGiven the centrality of the IMC to club football, and of club football to the IMC, ECA reiterates in the most unambiguous terms that any decisions relating to its future can only come about with the consent of football clubs, with player welfare at their heart \u2013 and in keeping with legally binding obligations which ordinarily should not need restating.\u201d\n\nEverton boss Rafa Benitez said he was against the plans for a biennial World Cup.\n\n\u201cMy first impression with international football is that you have too many games,\u201d Benitez said. \u201cWe have to be careful because in the end, the clubs are paying the players and they have to perform in their league and compete at maximum level. It\u2019s not that you have to play more, it\u2019s you have to play less games, and more competitive games.\u201d",

          "text": "Brazil have selected eight Premier League players for October\u2019s World Cup qualifiers despite the country remaining on the UK\u2019s travel red list.\n\nLast month most English clubs refused to release players called up by South American countries.\n\nCurrently anyone travelling to Brazil from the UK must quarantine for 14 days when they arrive in the country and 10 days when they arrive back in the UK.\n\nBut the Brazil FA said \u201cpositive talks\u201d have been held over travel exemptions.\n\nLiverpool duo Alisson and Fabinho, Manchester City\u2019s Ederson and Gabriel Jesus, Chelsea defender Thiago Silva, Manchester United midfielder Fred, Leeds forward Raphinha and Tottenham defender Emerson Royal have all been called up for matches against Venezuela, Colombia and Uruguay.\n\nFormer Middlesbrough midfielder Juninho Paulista, the Brazil national team coordinator, said the eight England-based players had been called up with the belief an agreement would be made next week allowing players to avoid travel restrictions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had lots of positive meetings with Fifa, the Premier League and the British government, and we trust that there will be a positive solution next week,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why we have called them up.\u201d\n\nThe Brazilian football federation will have to reach a separate agreement with the country\u2019s health authority to exempt England-based players from quarantine on their arrival.\n\nIn August the Premier League released a statement saying its clubs had \u201creluctantly but unanimously\u201d decided not to release players for matches in red-list countries during September\u2019s international break.\n\nHowever, four players, Emiliano Buendia and Emiliano Martinez of Aston Villa, and Giovani lo Celso and Cristian Romero of Tottenham, travelled to Argentina to join up with their national side.\n\nBut that led to farcical scenes at Sao Paulo\u2019s Corinthians Arena when the Brazil v Argentina World Cup qualifier was abandoned after five minutes when Brazilian health officials came on to the pitch to stop the match, saying the four England-based players for Argentina had to quarantine.\n\nDespite complaints being made by the Brazilian football federation, as well as those from Mexico, Paraguay and Chile over the Premier League not releasing players for matches, all affected players were allowed to play their next matches for their clubs.\n\nFifa has the power to enforce five-day suspensions for players not released to play for their national sides.\n\nBrazil have won all eight of their qualifiers so far and are six points clear of Argentina at the top of the South American qualifying group for Qatar 2022.\n\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp has called on the UK government to find \u201csome kind of solution\u201d to prevent another club-versus-country row.\n\n\u201cThere must be a solution obviously, because we cannot just leave it like this and say it\u2019s not a problem. Yes, it is a problem,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure the relevant people are working on this. I know they\u2019re working on this, but there\u2019s nothing decided yet, at least as far as I\u2019m concerned.\n\n\u201cWe have a problem when the Brazilians are allowed, or when they go, to the next internationals.\u201d\n\nLiverpool are set to travel to Watford on 16 September without Alisson and Fabinho, as Brazil host Uruguay on 15 September.\n\nKlopp added: \u201cI know it\u2019s a Liverpool problem and nobody else\u2019s problem, and good for Watford.\n\n\u201cBut I just don\u2019t know how you can do these kind of things where nobody reacts on the schedule. We have two problems. One is the schedule, it was always a problem.\n\n\u201cTV and other guys, the Premier League, say, \u2018OK, that\u2019s how it is, they have to play, let\u2019s have a look how they can sort that\u2019.\n\n\u201cAnother thing, it\u2019s not good for the players or the clubs as well and I hope the government comes up with some kind of solution.\u201d",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday said Boko Haram terrorists, though weakened by the military, \u201care still active in the country, preying on soft targets,\u201d promising that the scourge would soon come to an end.\n\nBuhari, who spoke in New York, United States, while addressing world leaders, including the new President of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), Abdulla Shahid of Maldives, during the 76th session of the Assembly, called for the support of the world body to end the Boko Haram menace.\n\nPresident Buhari said: \u201cMr. President, terrorism continues to dominate security discourse worldwide. In Nigeria, Boko Haram terrorist group, though fragmented by internal strife and weakened by our defence forces, is still active and preying on soft targets.\n\n\u201cNigeria will continue to work closely with the UN Counter-Terrorism bodies and entities with a view to bringing this scourge to an end.\n\n\u201cNigeria has spared no efforts in addressing the challenges of terrorism posed by the activities of Boko Haram in North-East Nigeria, the Lake Chad region as well as banditry in the North-West and the North-Central. The Nigerian Security Forces have recorded considerable success in the fight against terrorism. As a result of the renewed vigour of our military, many terrorist fighters are voluntarily surrendering to our security forces.\u201d\n\nThe President lamented that Nigeria was concerned about illicit trading and movement of small arms, which he said had led to an increase in criminality and insurgency in the country.\n\nPresident Buhari also lamented that countries such as Nigeria spend the bulk of their revenues on debt servicing, leaving little for infrastructure development and other essential aspects of the economy such as healthcare and education.\n\nAs a result, he called for the extension of the debt repayment timeline for developing countries, especially those severely suffering the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBuhari said \u201cthere is an urgent need for debt repayment extension for developing countries that are still recovering from the pandemic and also struggling with liquidity challenges.\u201d\n\nHe also called for an inclusive agenda that would build resilience and stability against future shocks; to deliver on the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nHe said: \u201cDeveloping countries have been faced with unsustainable debt burdens even before the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risk of new wave of deepening debt, where vital public financial resources are allocated to external debt servicing and repayments at the expense of domestic health and financing for critical developmental needs.\n\n\u201cI must commend the current initiatives by the international financial institutions and the G20, aimed at significantly mitigating the economic situation of the indebted countries and urge for more efforts in this regard.\n\n\u201cTherefore, there is an urgent need to consider expansion and extension of the Debt Service Suspension Initiative to include all Developing, Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States facing fiscal and liquidity challenges.\n\n\u201cIn addition, a review of the eligibility criteria for debt suspension, including outright cancellation, is needed for countries facing the most severe challenges.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari also took a swipe at the recent coup detat in Mali and Guinea and canvassed the support of the international community to reject the unconstitutional governments in the two West African nations.\n\nHe declared that the recent trend of unconstitutional takeover of power must not be tolerated by the international community.\n\nThe President warned that democratic gains of the past decades in West Africa \u201care now being eroded\u201d due to these negative trends.\n\nHe affirmed Nigeria\u2019s support to efforts by Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), African Union (AU) and the United Nations (UN) to address this growing challenge, saying, \u201cAs leaders of our individual Member-States we need to adhere to the constitutional provisions of our countries, particularly on term limits. This is one area that generates crisis and political tension in our sub-region.\u201d\n\nThe President urged the international community not only to deal with the symptoms of conflict but also the immediate causes of conflicts in the first place.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThese include poor and undemocratic governance, human rights abuses, poverty, ignorance, injustice and inequalities.\u201d\n\nHe renewed his advocacy for equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, outlining steps Nigeria had taken to achieve \u201cmoderate success\u201d in containing the virus and halt its deadly onslaught in the country.\n\nBuhari said: \u201cNigeria remains grateful for the assistance received from our partners and friends all over the world. Vaccination is the key to our safe emergence from the pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe fully support the COVAX initiative from which we have benefitted. We also thank the United States of America, Turkey, India, China, European Union, and others for the vaccines provided.\n\n\u201cDespite the acknowledgement however, I would like to reiterate my call for a fairer and more equitable distribution of vaccines to all countries so that, together, we can fight and contain the pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe rising wave of newer and more contagious strains make this even more urgent. No country can afford the socio-economic implications of prolonged shutdown. It is imperative to underscore that no one is safe until everyone is safe.\u201d\n\nCommenting on international trade, the Nigerian leader canvassed for reforms that would engender recovery from the COVID-19 crisis, build resilience to future shocks and pursue transformative development strategies that can deliver the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nHe said: \u201cNigeria reaffirms that international trade is an engine for development and sustained economic growth, as well as the global eradication of poverty.\n\n\u201cMy delegation would like to reaffirm the critical role that a universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system can play in stimulating economic growth and development. Fair and equitable trade would eventually eliminate the need for aid.\n\n\u201cMy country and indeed all African countries do not intend to stay indefinitely looking for aid. All we need is a fair and equitable system of international trade.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari also reiterated his call for the reforms of the UN Security Council, stressing that inter-governmental negotiation on the issue, was taking too long.\n\n\u201cNo reform of the United Nations system is more urgent than that of the Security Council. Stakeholders around the world are asking how such power could be concentrated, with scant representation.\n\n\u201cWe must avoid going in circles. Consensus has been achieved in some of the elements of this reform, especially that of the representation of Africa on the basis of the Elzuwini consensus and the Sirte Declaration.\n\n\u201cIt is unreasonable to expect unanimity in this matter. The issue, indeed, is about justice, not unanimity. Without justice, the legitimacy (even efficacy) of our organisation is called to question.\n\n\u201cWe can and must make substantial, irreversible progress on Security Council reform in the current session,\u201d he said.\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja",
