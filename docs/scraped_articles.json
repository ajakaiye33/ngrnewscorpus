          "text": "*Notes, NBC now an instrument of attack on human rights\n\n*Say ban, stage rehearsal of plan to regulate social media\n\nAmnesty International and 69 civil society organisations, CSOs, in Nigeria have asked the Federal Government to immediately rescind the suspension of Twitter and withdraw the threat to prosecute anyone using it in the country.\n\nIn a statement jointly signed by the organisations Sunday, Amnesty International and the local CSOs also asked the government to withdraw the directive to broadcast stations to deactivate their Twitter accounts, while also calling for an end to widespread impunity for human rights violations, particularly the rights to freedom of expression, including online, access to information and media freedom.\n\nThey equally urged the international community, including the UN and African Union to publicly condemn the suspension of Twitter in Nigeria and put pressures on the Federal Government to reverse the decision.\n\nSome of the CSOs include Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre, CISLAC, Centre for Democracy and Development, CDD, Legal Defence and Assistance Project -LEDAP, CLEEN Foundation, African Centre for Media & Information Literacy, AFRICMIL, and Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project, SERAP, among others.\n\nThe statement read: \u2018\u2019We, the undersigned civil society organizations are concerned about the repression and escalating crackdown on human rights by the Nigerian government, particularly the rights to freedom of expression, access to information and media freedom.\n\n\u2018\u2019We strongly condemn the arbitrary and unlawful suspension of Twitter in Nigeria, by the authorities, and the resulting restrictions on the human rights of people, as well as the threat to prosecute anyone using Twitter in Nigeria.\n\n\u2018\u2019We also condemn the \u2018directive\u2019 issued by the Nigerian Broadcasting Commission, NBC, for all broadcast stations to deactivate their Twitter accounts.\n\n\u2018\u2019On Friday, 4 June, the authorities through the Ministry of Information and Culture, announced a ban on Twitter in Nigeria. The authorities also directed Internet Service Providers, ISPs, in Nigeria to block access to Twitter.\n\n\u2018\u2019Media houses in Nigeria were also directed by the Nigeria Broadcasting Commission to deactivate their Twitter accounts. The suspension of Twitter by the Nigerian authorities followed the deletion of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s controversial tweet by the microblogging app.\n\n\u2018\u2019The Nigerian authorities have also set plans in motion to force social media platforms to register in Nigeria and comply with local regulations before they are licensed to operate.\n\n\u2018\u2019Social media platforms have helped Nigerians to receive information, impart same, hold useful conversations, and hold the Nigerian authorities to account. A clear example is how social media was used to drive police accountability in the #EndSARs protests last year.\n\n\u2018\u2019We are concerned about an alarming backsliding on human rights across Nigeria as the Federal Government and State authorities continue to use the criminal justice system and repression to silence peaceful dissent, while failing to ensure accountability for violations of rights.\n\n\u2018\u2019The Nigerian authorities have continued to propose laws to regulate the social media, and restrict the rights to freedom of expression, access to information, and media freedom, including through legislative bills popularly known as the \u2018Hate Speech Bill\u2019 and \u2018The Social Media Bill\u2019 which both provide severe punitive sanctions such as the death penalty in some cases, for social media users convicted of \u201ccrimes\u201d provided under them.\n\n\u2018\u2019The suspension of Twitter in Nigeria is inconsistent and incompatible with the Nigerian Constitution of 1999 (as amended) and the country\u2019s international human rights obligations including under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights.\n\n\u2018\u2019We, therefore, call on the Nigerian authorities to immediately rescind the unlawful suspension of Twitter in Nigeria and withdraw the threat to prosecute anyone using Twitter in the country; immediately withdraw the directive to broadcast stations to deactivate their Twitter accounts; and end widespread impunity for human rights violations, in particular the rights to freedom of expression including online, access to information and media freedom.\n\n\u2018\u2019We also urge the international community, including the UN and the African Union to publicly condemn the suspension of Twitter in Nigeria, and to put pressure on the Nigerian authorities to reverse the decision.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Egbin was generating at 746MW, Omoku 37.20, Omotosho (NIPP) at 105MW while Afam was generating at 80MW.\n\nThe data showed that on the average power generation in the past seven days were 4,120.9MW on Sunday 6 June, 4,249.4 on Monday 7 June, 4,000.9MW on Tuesday 8 June, 3,720.7 on Wednesday 9 June, 3,517 on Thursday 10 June, 3,765MW on Friday 11 June and 4,115MW on Saturday 12 June.\n\nAlso Read: 2023: Tinubu\u2019s posters flood Abuja\n\nInternational Oil Companies, IOCs, had last warned that despite Nigeria\u2019s huge gas reserves a lot needs to be done to attract investment to the sector to develop gas reserves to boost power generation in the country.\n\nSpeaking at the just concluded Nigeria International Petroleum Summit, the Chair, Shell Companies in Nigeria/MD SPDC, Osagie Okunbor said with 203 Trillion Cubic Feet of gas reserves, what was needed in the country is to deliver projects that would produce the gas.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is not just growing the reserves but in producing these reserves for the benefits of our country.

          "title": "Why there is trouble in South- East \u2014 Ngige",
          "text": "By Victor Ahiuma-Young, Abuja\n\nMinister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige has called for an end to the propaganda orchestrated by the elites in the South-East zone against the Federal Government.\n\nThe former Anambra State Governor said the propaganda provoked the troubles being noticed in that part of the country.\n\nNgige spoke in Abuja at an Emergency Stakeholders meeting of the Association of Eze Ndigbo, 19 Northern States and Abuja.\n\nA statement from the minister\u2019s Media Office said the meeting was summoned to discuss the wanton destruction of lives and properties in the South-East zone and the insecurity bedevilling Ndigbo as a people.\n\nAlso Read: Democracy Day: Protests sponsored, uncalled for \u2014 Idahosa\n\nAddressing the participants, Ngige said Buhari has shown friendship to Ndigbo, maintaining that the South East has gotten a fair share of what is due to the zone, especially infrastructure wise.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere is no maltreatment there. We are in the Federal Executive Council (FEC), which is composed of a minister per state. But we have one extra ministerial slot. So, the South East is effectively represented to ensure justice is done to our people. We are there to talk when there is no justice.\n\n\u201cPeople can say that we are not honoured with appointments of Inspector General of Police, Chief of Army Staff and Secretary to the Federal Government (SGF). These are positions we have enjoyed before in the Nigerian Federation. We had two Inspectors General of Police (IGP), Ogbonnaya Onovo and Mike Okiro. We had an SGF, Senator Pius Anyim. We had four Senate Presidents. Twice we produced Deputy Senate President and Deputy Speaker, Ike Ekweremadu and Emeka Ihedioha. They were in charge of federal budgets for eight years from 2007 to 2015. That is the rule in the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cSo, if you now talk about appointments, it becomes a matter of perception. I won\u2019t blame them. Perception and reality are in the same line. A lot of them don\u2019t understand how government works. A lot of them don\u2019t understand that I a member of FEC can influence things that will come to my State, my zone or any other area and where we think things should be sited or done in Nigeria. For me, those people perceiving that are ignorant. I don\u2019t want to use the word mischievous.\n\n\u201cBut much, more importantly, propaganda against the government by the elites in the South-East should stop because it is that propaganda that provoked troubles that we are now noticing. People have been brainwashed and the separatists humped on that foundation to now shout from the rooftops that we will give you Biafra and when we give you Biafra, all these things will disappear.\n\n\u201cThere is no country that does not have its own problems. We have economic problems here and that is why we have unemployment and of course, we have a youth bulge in our population. About 60 per cent of them are youths and a lot of them are unemployed. So, the government is devising ways to tackle that. It is a work in progress.\u201d\n\nThe Minister recalled that the Buhari government had paid off all the gratuity and pensions of all the police pensioners in the South East that were neglected since after the war, which no government did before.\n\nHe said the Government assisted the 36 Governors with bailout funds to pay a shortfall in salaries in their respective states and went further to give them budget support to help them to execute budgetary projects and programmes and give life to their people.\n\nAccording to him, the Governors in the South-East zone received the support even though at the time, the zone was a PDP zone.\n\n\u201cInfrastructure wise, if you go to the South East, from Enugu-Okigwe and Umuahia-Aba-Port Harcourt expressways, three companies, the Chinese Company, the Arab Contractors and RCC are there. Some of them have completed their work. A journey that normally takes us five hours from Enugu-Aba is now about one hour, 15 minutes. When the Port Harcourt section is finished, a journey from Enugu to Port Harcourt will take two hours.\n\n\u201cComing to Enugu-Awka- Onitsha, two sections have been finished. RCC is working at the stretch from Awka to Onitsha now. The stretch from Ninth Mile to Oji River has been completed. We are now at the third Section which is being done by Niger-Cat from Amansea to Oji River. The Old Road from Ninth Mile to Awka has also been done by Arab contractors. If you go there now, you will see it is fully completed with drains on both sides.\u201d\n\nHe said the Owerri-Aba and Owerri-Umuahia roads are ongoing, just like the the international highway from Enugu to Abakiliki to Cameroun where the stretch from Enugu to Abakiliki is completed while the stretch from Abakiliki to Cameroun is ongoing.\n\n\u201cEnugu The airport used to be the worst airport in Nigeria. We had three Aviation Ministers, Fidelia Njeze, Stella Odua and Osita Chidoka and did nothing there. Buhari put N10 billion in Enugu Airport. He does not hate Ndigbo.\n\n\u201cThen, the Second Niger Bridge is the biggest of them all. President Buhari took it up from a Private Public Partnership (PPP) Project by which tolls were to be collected. By which foreign loan companies\u2019 financiers were relieved of doing what they wanted to do to stay there forever and ever and it is now a legacy project out of the five that is being done in the whole country.\n\n\u201cThe five legacy projects are Lagos-Ibadan highway, Mambilla project, East-West Road, Abuja-Kaduna-Kano and Second Niger Bridge and the Second Niger Bridge is gulping one of the biggest amounts of money; N386 billion and has undergone 55 per cent completion. Julius Berger said they will deliver in the middle of 2022 and we have no reason to doubt them.\u201d\n\nNgige stated that all these projects were being executed with Sukuk funds, loans and extra-budgetary provisions, since budgetary provisions were not enough.\n\nHe explained that the current administration has not earned enough revenue owing to crash in the price of oil and production level since it came to power, adding that \u201cwe are now getting about 50 per cent of what the previous the government got in terms of internally generated revenue.\u201d\n\nEarlier, in their separate speeches, Eze Ndigbo, Niger State and President of Ndieze Igbo 19 Northern states and FCT Abuja, Eze (Dr) Pampas Nwahiwe and Eze Ndigbo Kano, Boniface Ibekwe, condemned the violence by suspected agitators in the South East who were attacking police and military formations and killing our security personnel, warning that their actions were capable of endangering the lives of their brothers who are living in other parts of Nigeria.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Olorogun Tony Ofoni\n\nThe leadership of Urhobo Youth Leaders Association, UYLA has pleaded with President Buhari to hearken to the voice of the people of the Niger Delta yearning for the urgent inauguration of the members nominated for appointment by President Muhammadu Buhari, screened and confirmed by members of the National Assembly into the Board of Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC.\n\nThis decision was made at the end of an emergency meeting held weekend at Oghior in Udu Local Government Area of Delta State.\n\nIn a statement signed by the National President of the UYLA, Olorogun Tony Ofoni , the group noted that the delay in constituting the NDDC Board has generated too many issues in the region with the tendency to ignite ethnic crises within the region.\n\n\u201cMany issues in the social media are not pleasing, thank God everything is being handled maturely and we hope Mr President will do the needful by inaugurating the already screened and confirmed Board members,\u201d the group said.\n\nIn addition, they said that many ethnic groups are now laying claim to the title of highest producers of oil and gas in the region to drive home their selfish points.\n\n\u201cBe it noted that the good people of Urhobo have never tampered with Government oil and gas facilities but those who claim to be the highest producers of oil and gas have continuously sabotaged the economy of this nation.\n\n\u201cNigeria should reward peaceful citizens who are law abiding by encouraging them so as not to pick up arms to join those attacking oil installations.\n\n\u201cUrhobo youths have never destroyed oil and Gas facilities in our land despite the fact that we are the highest producers of oil and Gas right now.\n\n\u201cThe only Government agency that can contradict these claims because of records available to them is the Department of Petroleum Resources, DPR\u201d, the group said.\n\nThe Youth leaders therefore appealled to President Buhari to inaugurate the Board he nominated for appointment earlier which has been screened and confirmed.\n\n\u201cMr President, it will make mockery of your administration to shop for new hands when the ones already nominated are there.\n\n\u201cIt will appear you bow to pressure of some selfish individuals in the Niger Delta to ignore and go back to tinker with the Board that has been constituted, awaiting swearing-in.\n\n\u201cThis has never happened in the history of democracy in Nigeria. No President has had his screened and confirmed nominees replaced even before they were sworn in.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly has honoured you by carrying out their legitimate duties by screening and confirming those nominated earlier.\n\n\u201cIf you go ahead to make fresh appointments into the Board as being canvassed by enemies of the region, you would have thrown your integrity to the winds,\u201d they said.\n\nThe group added that it is within the purview of the office of the President to appoint, after which the National Assembly screens and confirms them.\n\n\u201cMr President should please conclude the process by inaugurating the Board already confirmed by NASS to diffuse the divide and rule process already being applied by some agents of your government whose intention is to cause chaos in the region,\u201d the group concluded.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

We, the people of Danbatta, are grateful to you and are also proud that we have Prof Danbatta making us proud with his outstanding performance at NCC, which has attracted us to global giants like Huawei.\u201d\n\nOnly recently, traditional rulers and concerned community leaders commended Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta for his role in boosting security and supporting other initiatives aimed at stepping up the tempo of development in Dambatta Local Government Area, Kano State and its environs vis-a-vis concerted effort towards national development.\n\nThe inauguration ceremony was organised by DCF in conjunction with four other organisations, namely Zauren Tuntuba, a non-for-profit organisation; Danbatta Academic Forum (DAF); Danbatta Reporters; and, Duniya Ba Hutu.\n\nAlso at the event, 10 (ten) female students from Muslim Community College of Health Sciences and Technology, Funtua, and another 20 (twenty) female beneficiaries of the vocational training empowerment programme with bias for tailoring and fashion designing, all under the sponsorship of Prof. Danbatta, celebrated their graduation.\n\nThe event, which featured the presentation of sewing machines and other fashion designing items to the two sets of qualified trainees, also saw Prof. Danbatta being conferred with a special recognition award for his immense contribution to the security of Danbatta community, among other community development initiatives.\n\nNCC boss Danbatta condoles with Emirs of Kano, Bichi over mother\u2019s death",

          "text": "Islamic human rights organisation, the Muslim Rights Concern, MURIC, has lambasted the South West for joining protests against the government of President Muhammadu Buhari on June 12.\n\nRecall that Nigerians in the Southern part of the country, particularly the South West, marked the June 12 Democracy Day on Saturday, with demonstrations.\n\nThe protesters clashed with men of the Police in different cities as they were bent on stopping the protests from happening.\n\nMURIC frowned at the protests, referring to the protesters as certificated ingrates, rebellious subjects and articulated enemies of peace.\n\nBoko Haram: Islamic group defends Pantami over alleged link with terrorists\n\nMURIC argued that the protesters have no moral ground to protest on June 12 since it was President Muhammadu Buhari alone who gave official recognition to that day when all past rulers had refused to do so.\n\nMURIC\u2019s position was contained in a statement signed by its director, Professor Ishaq Akintola and made available to DAILY POST on Monday.\n\nHe said, \u201cSome Nigerians in the Southern part of the country, particularly the South West marked Independence Day on Saturday, June 12, 2021 with demonstrations. Although in negligible numbers, the protests took place in Abuja, Lagos, Ibadan and a few other places.\n\n\u201cWe commend the police for handling the protests with maturity and professionalism as no casualties or brutalities were reported. However, the protesters exposed themselves as certificated ingrates, unrepentant rebellious subjects and articulated enemies of peace.\n\n\u201cJune 12 should be a day for all Nigerians to celebrate Chief M.K.O. Abiola for his sacrifices on the altar of democracy. He was the man who paid the supreme sacrifice after winning the presidential election held on June 12, 1993 which was criminally annulled by the military.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian civil society, including MURIC, had been clamouring for the official recognition of that day as Democracy Day but none of our past rulers listened, not even Chief Olusegun Obasanjo who hails from the same city of Abeokuta like M.K.O. The former had all the chance in the world to declare June 12 as Nigeria\u2019s Democracy Day having ruled for eight years (1999 \u2013 2007) but he bluntly refused to do so.\n\n\u201cIt was a northerner, a Fulani, President Muhammadu Buhari, who eventually proclaimed June 12 as Nigeria\u2019s Democracy Day. It is our contention that for that alone, the people of the South West should show gratitude to Buhari. But what do we see?\n\n\u201cIt was demonstrations galore. The most shameful, most reprehensible and most preposterous was the open participation of Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State who marched on the streets of Ibadan with protesters chanting \u2018Buhari Must Go\u2019.\n\n\u201cIt is most na\u00efve for a sitting executive governor who came into office riding on the back of democracy to join a group seeking the removal of a democratically elected president through undemocratic means. It was a great disservice to the memory of M.K.O. Abiola. Seyi Makinde is an ingrate nulli secundus. He should apologise to Nigerians for his immature behaviour.\n\n\u201cThose protesters definitely missed the point and lost their bearing because Nigerians, particularly people of the South West, should be showing gratitude to Buhari for declaring June 12 as Democracy Day instead of partaking in an unnecessary protest.\n\n\u201cThe Qur\u2019an gives immense honour to those who appreciate goodness. Allah says, \u2018If you are grateful, I will increase my favours on you. But if you disbelieve, certainly my punishment is indeed severe\u2019 (Glorious Qur\u2019an 14:7).\n\n\u201cOn his way to Jerusalem, while passing between Samaria and Galilee, Jesus (may peace be upon him) was met by ten lepers who begged him to heal them. Although he cured them all, only one of them, a Samaritan, a \u2018foreigner\u2019, came back to show gratitude and he was asked, \u2018Were not ten cleansed? Where are the nine?\u2019 (Luke 17:11-17).\n\n\u201cAs if in response to this rhetorical question, a larger group of demonstrators gathered in Abuja to show solidarity with Buhari. They drummed, sang and danced. These are \u2018the nine\u2019 and we commend them for their wisdom, boldness and patriotism.\n\n\u201cMURIC calls on President Muhammadu Buhari to ignore those who are ungrateful to him. He should continue his good work. We ask him to reflect on the words of Allah where He said, \u2018What does Allah stand to gain if you show gratitude and belief? Allah is the One who shows gratitude (i.e. Allah is the One who knows how to reward good deeds) and He knows everything\u2019 (Glorious Qur\u2019an 4:147).\n\n\u201cTherefore, our message to Mr. President is this: Just continue your good works. Expect no gratitude from some Nigerians. But many others appreciate you. Most importantly, Allah will definitely reward you here in this world and yaom al-Qiyamah (in the Hereafter).\u201d\n\nNigeria needs more policemen, soldiers \u2013 Islamic group, MURIC",

          "title": "Nigerian constitution is evil, greatest enemy of our democracy",
          "text": "A former Acting Governor of Kogi State, Chief Clarence Olafemi has described the 1999 Nigerian constitution as evil and the greatest enemy of the nation\u2019s democracy.\n\nOlafemi, in this exclusive interview with DAILY POST on Sunday speaks about June 12 and other burning issues in the country.\n\nExcerpts\n\nWhat is your perception about June 12?\n\nJune 12 was supposed to be the fairest and most credible election we have ever had in this country in which a sizable population of Nigeria registered for that election, participated in it and cast their votes without duress. They cast their votes willingly. It was supposed to be an election close to the people oriented democracy we have been looking for. Unfortunately, the votes were counted but the election was annulled by the military. As we were told, it was annulled under immense pressure by people who do not wish this country well.\n\nUnfortunately, they were never brought to book, except for one or two actors that later had their fair share of one or two punishments. Abiola was seen to be the winner of that election because that election was counted, and concluded. It was the announcement of the final result that was withheld. How I wish Abiola was alive today, he would have been a hero. We may not be able to ascertain the kind of president he would have become, but his courage, determination to govern this country was a symbol of the current day democracy we are witnessing in this country. Unfortunately, that was the only election that was not religious or tribal based. It was a reflection of the people\u2019s wish.\n\nJune 12 was a sad event for all Nigerians. June 12 was a day that people like us who cast our votes will never want to remember. I was in Lagos. I saw dead bodies on the road, burning of property, and the hostile nature where an average Nigerian is afraid of going out beyond the street.\n\nWhat is your take about our current democracy?\n\nToday, we have departed from the goal post of the June 12 election. Our politics has been polluted with thuggery, and killings. In fact, the people\u2019s votes no longer count. It is democracy with might. How much money can you put into the struggle? How many thugs can you recruit to fill in the result sheets? In fact, we are making mockery of the whole concept of June 12. Ordinary councilors election, you will see thugs snatching ballot boxes.\n\nA sitting Governor doesn\u2019t want to lose a single Local Government. He wins all the Local Government because he sits down in the comfort of his zone and gives instructions that, you must deliver all the Local Government in my State. He uses people\u2019s money to suppress people\u2019s will. He uses people\u2019s resources to suppress their will. You can imagine what it is today, Local Government as a third tier of Government is not working.\n\nThey are just figure heads. Resources meant for Local Governments are diverted by the States with impunity.\n\nWe are really miles away from the goal post of our founding father\u2019s concept of democracy. The people who designed democracy never thought that the human being that would manage it will be the type that we have now, where the spirit, the intent and the purpose will be defeated with impunity. We found ourselves where we are. It is not hopeless. I still believe that there are still some People who have conscience. I governed for three months in Kogi State. The legacies still reign up till today. Anywhere I go, people still speak of my achievement as an Acting Governor in Kogi State. It is better to rule and have honor, than to rule and people will be saying we regret having you.\n\nIf we have men of conscience to rule us, Nigeria will be good, because no matter what you do with people\u2019s money, whether you embezzle it, allow corruption to be the order of the day in your government, you will surely die someday. The day you die, you will leave every pin of it. Look at some former Governors that have died. Look at the affluence of life they left behind. I took a look at the edifice they put down, and today grasses are growing in their yards.\n\nEven in my own environment, people that their names ring bell, today after their death, their children don\u2019t come home. The buildings that they put together are forgotten. Trees are growing and I shake my head and say this is the vanity of life. It is better to serve and be remembered for your good service, than to serve and oppress the People. When you leave, what people say about you, your government becomes a permanent stain on you, your Children and your generations to come.\n\nHow do you see the 1999 constitution Nigeria has been using since we returned to democracy 22 years ago?\n\nOur greatest enemy today against the true democracy we are looking for is the 1999 Constitution. I met a former Speaker and the Current Deputy Clerk in the State House of Assembly and other notable Nigerians and we started debating on the issue of our Constitution. Even with this present amendment they are carrying out now, the publicity is very poor and below standard. People like me don\u2019t even know that the exercise was in progress. So, I couldn\u2019t have made my own contribution when the public debate for constitutional amendment was hosted in Kogi State.\n\nThe Nigerian Constitution was created as a trap by the military to punish Nigerians. They knew Nigerians were saying We don\u2019t want you, you must go. They now said we will deal with these People and they permanently enslaved us with that constitution. Now, how do we change the core area of the constitution that needs to free and liberate Nigerians? We cannot do it.\n\nMany sections of the country have been clamoring for restructuring, how realistic is this?\n\nThe President has come out to say restructuring is the duty of the National Assembly. How would the National Assembly restructure when the Constitution did not permit us to create one single Local Government. To get a Local Government created, that will be an addition to what was listed in the 1999 constitution. It has to pass through two-third of the National Assembly and two-third of the State Assemblies which can never be done. All attempts to do it will fail. If you cannot create a Local Government, you cannot create another State.\n\nHow do you regionalize Nigeria? How do you restructure Nigeria? It is still the same process. This is the literate part of it that Nigerians do not know. Rather than wasting our time fighting, we should first of all tackle the removal of all those clauses that enslave us in the Constitution. It is then that we can possibly think of how to restructure. You cannot restructure with the present constitution.\n\nIt has been enacted, we have accepted it. It has been documented to rule us. Anything done outside it is legitimately illegal. And that is the problem and nobody is looking at that. They will come with some amendments at the peripheral, but it has nothing to do with the core problem of Nigeria. There are only two ways of getting out of this quagmire done by the Military.\n\nThey are talking of referendums. Where is the provision of referendum in the 1999 Constitution? It is not there. What is the definition of referendum? Calling people to come and vote, when already the People have mortgaged that right to their representatives in the National Assembly? This is the conflict. The only way out is to have a situation where there is a dominant party that constitutes more than two-third of the National Assembly, more than two-third of the State Assemblies, and controls more than two-thirds of the Governors.\n\nWhere then, party supremacy will come and say this part of the Constitution, we want it changed. It becomes a party decision. But today, they don\u2019t have that structure, and the strength in the National and State Assemblies to meet up with the provision of the 1999 constitution. That is the only legalized process of changing the Constitution.\n\nThe other one is where you have the People pushed to the wall, and they protest and remove the Government. If they can escape the anarchy that will follow either through a military coup, because when a Government is toppled by the People, somebody must come in to breach a gap for another Government to come in. But a coup is not fashionable. As a matter of necessity, if the people are pushed to the wall, such informal operations will come in. It means many souls will be lost which is totally uncalled for. So when you look at the scenario as it is today politically and democratically, we are in trouble.\n\nAre you in support of Nigeria\u2019s disintegration in view of the prevailing situation in the country?\n\nWe must find a way of holding the country without disintegration. Disintegration of Nigeria will lead to a massive war that will take years for the country to recover. It shouldn\u2019t be an option in our table. I don\u2019t belong to those who want Nigeria to disintegrate. Disintegration will create anarchy, and lead the country to war. It deprives you as an individual including you that caused the war.\n\nIt is better to be in poverty and have your liberty than struggling for power that will lead your country to endless war like what we are seeing in Syria, Yemen and many more. We shouldn\u2019t forget, these are conflicting interests. These are countries that are not up to one quarter of Nigeria.\n\nImagine a country with over 200 million being at war. It is like imagining that America is at war, who is going to mediate. Before the United Nations will give attention to the country, devastation has started. It can\u2019t be an option in our table now. All I am asking in the name of June 12 when one man\u2019s life was sacrificed and it became a remembrance day is that let nobody put millions of lives in jeopardy.\n\nWhat is your take on the current Insecurity in Nigeria?\n\nOf course, we cannot be talking of any form of development under the current insecurity we are witnessing in Nigeria today. Almost all of our economy is collapsing. Farming is becoming a problem. In my area now, to farm, you grow your cassava, the herdsmen will move their cow, uproot your cassava and cut with their cutlasses for their cows to eat all in the name of freedom of movement within Nigeria and grazing.\n\nThis is absolute nonsense. My Son invested N30 million in sugarcane. He has already made a market for it. The herdsmen went inside the farm, put fire on it, so that it can start re-germinating, and then drove their cow inside to eat it. The atrocity of the herdsmen in Nigeria, is more than a civil war. Agriculture is killed. Some actions that can be taken, cannot be done until the constitution is amended. Every problem of the country when you intend to drive round it, ends up at the door of the Constitution. We should tell ourselves the truth. That constitution is a Devil and needs to be dismantled at all cost.\n\nIf Mr President who has the executive power is now saying that what can save Nigeria from war and anarchy is in the corridor of the National Assembly, if the National Assembly cannot do it, they should all resign and let us confirm that there is no National Assembly.

          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Enugu Noah Ebije, Kaduna and Paul Osuyi, Asaba\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s pronouncement last week that his administration would reinstate cattle routes and grazing areas across the country to ensure herders have free access for their animals have continued to generate flaks\n\nIn apparent response to the ban on open cattle grazing by the 17 Southern governors, the president said when the governors gave the directive that open grazing would be banned, he referred them to the gazette that makes provisions for cattle routes and open grazing areas. He then said he has resolved to revive those routes and grazing areas in the country to resolve the issue.\n\n\u201cWhat I told the governors was to ask them to go and dig up the gazette. There are certain routes and grazing areas so that when cattle rearers were moving from the north to the west, they were allowed to go through there. But if you allow your cattle to stray into any farmer\u2019s farm, you are arrested and the farmer is invited to submit his claims. Those who encroach on these cattle routes and grazing areas would be dispossessed.\u201d\n\nHowever, in separate reactions, Arewa, Igbo and Yoruba groups roundly condemned the statement saying the move rather than resolve the issue would exacerbate it.\n\nAs far as the Northern Elders Forum (NEF) is concerned, reactivating open grazing routes may cause legal and security problems.\n\nSpokesman forf the group, Dr. Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, in a telephone interview, reminded the president that the 1999 Constitution gives state governors powers cover land and to even revoke federal land.\n\n\u201cThe reactivation of open grazing routes in southern part or any other parts of the country is problematic both in legal terms and security. I would have said the best way to go is for us to seek legal interpretation beyond the Office of the Attorney General. The Federal Government can actually sue governors that ban open grazing and the court will rule whether they are right or wrong.\n\n\u201cI will reserve final judgment on the president\u2019s position. We caution that there is more to open grazing than availability of land and routes. It is not about opening the grazing routes, it is also about the security of the cattle and herders, and getting the support of communities that they will go through. Our open grazing requires political will. The Federal Government has already adopted the National Livestock Transformation programme to equip the Fulani. We, in the North, are in favour of ban of open grazing but we want it to be done in phases, in an orderly manner that does not harm the cattle and the Fulani. We also support the active intervention of the Federal Government, the northern governors and everybody to make sure that in the next one year or two, open grazing is abolished completely. I think this is the way to go.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Association of South East Town Unions (ASETU) in collaboration with other respected Igbo groups, including Nzuko Umunna, Aka Ikenga, Igbo World Assembly (IWA), World Igbo Congress (WIC), Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF), Ekwe Nche, European Igbo Communities, Igbo Board of Deputies, Council of Igbo States in America, Nkata Ndi Inyom Igbo and South East Community Youth Leaders, rose from a one-day emergency security meeting with a vow to resist open grazing in the region.\n\nThe coalition warned that governors in the zone who fail to implement the ban would be treated as foes.\n\nNational President, ASETU, Chief Emeka Diwe who made their position known, said the meeting totally condemned the continued attacks by killer herdsmen in Igbo communities and urged governors to rise to the occasion and protect their people.\n\nStressing that the primary purpose of political governance was the security of lives and property, the Igbo groups charged governors who had not kick-started the processes of enacting anti-open grazing laws, to as a matter of urgency, send Executive Bills to their respective Houses of Assembly.\n\n\u201cOur position is very clear, which is the stand of Ndigbo; we say no to open grazing and are not making any pretences about that. We insist that any cattle in the South East must be ranched. So, we urge all nomadic herders to leave our land. We also urge our governors to do everything possible to implement the ban on open grazing. In fact, Ndigbo will treat any governor who fails to carry out this heartfelt desire and demand as an enemy. We equally urge each state to have forest guards with legal backing to ensure that our forests do not harbour terrorists and criminals,\u201d Diwe said.\n\nThe groups regretted that President Muhammadu Buhari who had never spoken strongly against the atrocities of Fulani herdsmen and bandits was threatening to visit another festival of blood on the Igbo.\n\nADF recalled that it had been in the forefront of the agitation for the banning of open grazing in Igboland since 2015, hence its insistence on the enactment of anti-open grazing laws as the most potent strategy to prevent armed Fulani herdsmen from overrunning the Southern states.\n\nIts spokesman, Abia Onyike, said the law to be passed in the State Houses of Assembly should be accompanied by clear modalities, instrumentalities and machineries for their enforcement. He added that the effectiveness of this move depended on the synergy between the governors, the legislators and the people, including the civil society organisations.\n\nSimilarly, the pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Jare Ajayi, said the president\u2019s pronouncements fell far short of what was expectation.\n\n\u201cWe have some questions for Mr. President and the Attorney General in this respect. One, who created the so-called grazing routes? At what time in our history did our founding fathers gather to designate specific routes from the north to the south as \u2018grazing routes\u2019? Two, assuming without conceding, that there were so-called grazing routes, what would now happen to structures that have been built in areas where the so-called routes are to be re-opened? Would such structures, including residences and factories be pulled down so that cows would have places to graze? Compared to what would be lost economically, socially, politically and in security terms if these structures are to be pulled down, is it not better to encourage the building of ranches? We can go on and on.\u201d\n\nAfenifere claimed President\u2019s pronouncement on open grazing and his confession on how he determines who occupy positions at the national level seems to indicate that Buhari\u2019s government is operating a constitution that is different from the 1999 Constitution.\n\n\u201cFor instance, Section 2 of the Land Use Act, the law governing land matters in the country, vests the administration and control of lands in a given state in the hands of the governor of the state. It is such that even when the Federal Government wants to use a portion of land, it has to seek the consent of the governor of the state concerned. Since most governors in the country have outlawed open grazing in their respective states, on which land does the Federal Government want to \u2018open\u2019 or \u2018re-open\u2019 its vaunted grazing routes? Why talking of grazing routes in this age when ranching is the fad in all civilised climes?\u201d\n\nThe group claimed President Buhari seems to derive pleasure in shifting blames and responsibilities when pressed on what his government ought to do.\n\nUnknown persons threaten mayhem in Delta\n\nMeanwhile, unknown persons, yesterday, raised the tension in Delta State as they threatened to attack Asaba, the state capital, and Agbor, if Governor Ifeanyi Okowa does not withdraw his support for the ban on open grazing within 72 hours.\n\nAn unsigned letter containing the threat was pasted in strategic locations in Asaba including the fence of the Living Faith Church (Winners Chapel) at Infant Jesus Road.\n\nThe letter titled \u2018Fulani Jihadist Warning: An Open Message of 2 Paragraphs to Delta State\u2019 dated June 13, 2021 warned that \u201cfailure to adhere to this demand for been the host of the 17 governors, Delta State, most likely the city of Asaba and Agbor, shall encounter severe consequences than that of Bornu, Kebbi, Kastina, Kaduna, Enugu, Benue, Oyo and many more that will not respect the Fulani\u2019s heritage, as we take responsibility for the detonate explosive uncovered in the state capital secretariat, which should serve as warning to the Delta State Government for what is to come, should the governor fail to abide to our demand.\u201d",
          "summary": "As far as the Northern Elders Forum (NEF) is concerned, reactivating open grazing routes may cause legal and security problems.\n\u201cThe reactivation of open grazing routes in southern part or any other parts of the country is problematic both in legal terms and security.\nThe Federal Government can actually sue governors that ban open grazing and the court will rule whether they are right or wrong.\nAt what time in our history did our founding fathers gather to designate specific routes from the north to the south as \u2018grazing routes\u2019?\nSince most governors in the country have outlawed open grazing in their respective states, on which land does the Federal Government want to \u2018open\u2019 or \u2018re-open\u2019 its vaunted grazing routes?",

          "text": "From Agaju Madugba, Katsina\n\nKatsina Governor, Aminu Bello Masari, has faulted President Muhammadu Buhari on reasons for worsening insecurity in the country.\n\nThe president had during a television interview last week attributed the menace to failure of states and local governments across the country to manage security issues in their respective domains.\n\nBut citing Constitutional provisions, Masari said it was wrong for anybody to blame states and local governments.\n\n\u201cIt is the responsibility of the Federal Government to ensure protection of lives and property of citizens in all nooks and cranny of the country. When you look at the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the issue of security is under the Exclusive List. So, it is the responsibility of the Federal Government and states can only complement and that\u2019s what we have always done and are still doing.\n\n\u201cFrom the local governments, we assist the police, the DSS, the NSDC. There may be states that do not complement efforts of the security agencies and perhaps those are the states that the president was referring to.\n\n\u201cBut sincerely speaking, based on provisions of the Constitution, the blame should go to the Federal Government for the general state of insecurity in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nMasari said he was 100 per cent in support of the clamour for restructuring and devolution of more powers to states which should also entail enhanced revenue to the tiers of government to enable them adequately perform their constitutional roles.\n\nAccording to him, the establishment of a state police would enhance general security as the personnel will be expected to perform their defined roles without infringing on duties of the Nigerian police.\n\n\u201cThe issue of a state police is part of what we are talking about and I am for it. All we need to do is to formalise activities of the vigilance groups and community policing and give them clear definitions on their limits and those of the Nigerian police.\n\n\u201cWe have the Nigerian police and the NSDC that we currently support their operations and nothing stops a state police from coexisting side by side with the Nigerian police.\n\n\u201cThe issue of security is actually the responsibility of everybody as we all have roles to play. It\u2019s not about the president or the governor or local government chairman or a legislator or minister.\n\n\u201cThese bandits and their informants have addresses. They live within the communities and the people know them and security has no colorations in terms of political party affiliations or religion.\n\n\u201cI am also 100 per cent for restructuring and devolution of powers or whatever you call it. If you devolve, states and local governments will have more financial independence. We should earn resources according to the size and economy of our states.\n\n\u201cDuring the First Republic, Emir of Kano was the highest paid because of the state\u2019s revenue base. What we have today as Katsina State was a province made up of Katsina and Daura emirates. They ran their civil service and police and prisons and judiciary then were under the Native Authority and they did well.\n\n\u201cThey built and managed schools. If it was done successfully then, who says it cannot be done today? We ought to take another look at the Constitution. With the right leadership and proper arrangement, these things are still possible.\n\n\u201cThere are some federal ministries with so many parastatals under each one. How can one person as minister provide effective oversight for these parastatals?\n\n\u201cWe should devolve more power to the states but in such a way that we don\u2019t have to weaken the authority of the Federal Government in terms of performing its constitutional responsibilities.\u201d",

Lukman, in Abuja, yesterday.\n\nThe former Edo governor said the earlier the APC-led government addressed the escalating agitations, the better to diffuse the kind of stresses the nation is passing through.\n\n\u201cLet me refer to just one aspect of what Governor Atiku Bagudu said. That is the document on true federalism which the party put together that passed through all the organs of the party. The executive of the party, the NWC, the Caucus, the NEC which is the highest organ of the party.\n\n\u201cWhy did we do it at that time? We did it because like, it is happening today, there was this cacophony of voices. Two people in the party could not agree on what they meant by restructuring. So, the party needed to take control of the debate, define the issues, proffer solutions and went so far as to have some drafts legislation. It is not by any chance a perfect document.\n\n\u201cBut it reflects then the thinking and the desires of the Nigerian people. Everybody kept quiet after we brought that document out, publicised it, held press conferences over it and most Nigerians were very, very happy. But once again, we did not make the kind of progress that we could have made and it has become once more, the topical subject in the Nigerian polity.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, it has gone beyond us, we now have one or two things that did not happen before, people now wanting to disengage from the federation, which did not happen before and that is a warning sign. If a child ask for garri today you don\u2019t give him, tomorrow he may decide it\u2019s cake he wants and we must not, as political party, we must not as the government of the federation, give the impression that only military governments can fundamentally tamper with the basic structure of this nation.\u201d",

Sheriff Oborevwori, also said at the weekend that the two arms of government in the state were no longer dependent on the executive arm as \u201cthey are already enjoying financial autonomy in the state.\u201d\n\nHe said the state had concluded plans to ensure the take-off of the Delta State Accounts Allocation Committee (DSAAC) and State Assembly Service Commission (DSASC), adding that the enabling legislation was delayed by the PASAN strike.\n\nEbonyi State Chairman of PASAN, Mrs. Uche Edene, told THISDAY that the state had gradually started the implementation of the financial autonomy even before the strike started.\n\nShe stated that the state had enacted Fund Management Law in 2016 which gave birth to the State House of Assembly Commission.\n\nIn Oyo State, the Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Prof. Oyelowo Oyewo, told THISDAY that the state has already established the Assembly Service Commission while that of the State Accounts Allocation Committee (SAAC) was ongoing.\n\nHe said before the strike by JUSUN, the state already had a committee involving all stakeholders working towards funds management for the judiciary and legislative arms.\n\nChairman of JUSUN in Taraba State, Mr. Muhammed Usman, told THISDAY that the House of Assembly has to pass the Taraba State Legislative Management Bill and Judiciary Management Bill into law before the setting up SAAC.\n\nIn addition, Sokoto State Attorney-General and Commissioner of Justice, Mr. Suleiman Usman (SAN), told THISDAY that by principle, the state had granted autonomy to the judiciary and legislature since 2017, adding that Governor Aminu Tambuwal would soon send a bill to the House of Assembly for passage into law.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with THISDAY the Special Adviser on Media and Public Enlightenment to Governor Bello Mutawalle of Zamfara State, Mr Zailani Bappa, said the governor was determined to implement the agreement reached with JUSUN and PASAN.\n\nNasarawa State Commissioner for Information, Mr. Dogo Shama, also told THISDAY that the state was gearing up for the setting up of SAAC.\n\nNational Treasurer of Parliamentary Association of Nigeria, Mr. Umar Azara, also confirmed that both the State Assembly Service Commission and Fund Management bills have been put in place in Nasarawa State and are awaiting passage.\n\nKano State Commissioner for Information, Malam Muhammad Garba, said the state government was ready to set up SAAC and the State Assembly Service Commission to enable it to disburse revenue directly to the two other arms of government in the state.\n\nThe Chairman of Akwa Ibom State chapter of JUSUN, Mr. Oku Umoh, also told THISDAY that the state legislature has to put in place the Legislative Service Commission and the Fund Management Law, while the three arms of government will meet to set up SAAC.\n\nChairman of JUSUN in Cross River State, Mr. Asang Ebong, told THISDAY that the three arms of government were already working on a draft bill for the setting up of SAAC.\n\nJUSUN Chairman, Ondo State, Mr. Femi Afolabi, said the SAAC would be set up after the Fund Management Committee Law, had been passed by the Ondo State House of Assembly and assented to by the Governor, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu.\n\nIn Katsina State, the Governor, Hon. Aminu Masari, said the state government had concluded plans to inaugurate SAAC and State Assembly Service Commission in order to enable the two arms of government to receive their statutory allocations directly from the federal government.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have no problem with the independence of the judiciary and legislature. What we get from the Federation Account is what they are going to get. Isn\u2019t it? In Katsina, we don\u2019t have any problem. We can only share what we have. We cannot share what we don\u2019t have.\u201d\n\nChairman of PASAN in Ekiti State, Mr. Gbenga Oluwajuyigbe, told THISDAY that the State House of Assembly has begun the process for the passage of the Fund Management Bill, to give legal backing to the direct payment of funds to the legislative arm.\n\nCommissioner for Information, Hon Akin Omole, also stated that the state would fully implement whatever agreement reached at the national level.\n\nSpokesman of the Speaker of the Kaduna State House of Assembly, Mr. Ibrahim Danfulani, said the lawmakers would debate the issue this week.\n\nSecretary of JUSUN in Niger State, Mr. Bala Mohammed, stated that PASAN and JUSUN have completed arrangement to submit bills for the establishment of the Assembly Service and Judicial Service Commissions and the State Accounts Allocation Committee anytime next week.\n\nIn Anambra State, the Clerk of the State House of Assembly, Mr. Pius Udoh, told THISDAY that the assembly has passed the fund management bill to manage the expected funds.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Report: $15bn Investments Lost Annually to Non-passage of PIB",
          "text": "\u2022OPEC: Nigeria\u2019s oil production hit record low in May\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nA new report by Financial Derivatives Company Limited (FDC) has indicated that Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas industry loses as much as $15 billion in investments annually due to the delayed passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), currently before the National Assembly.\n\nThe bill, which seeks to overhaul the oil and gas industry and offer new fiscal incentives to investors, according to the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Mr. Timipre Sylva, and Senate President, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, is set to be passed this month.\n\nHowever, FDC in its latest bi-monthly publication stated that even if the PIB is passed today, the country has already lost investment opportunities due to the lack of urgency attached to the passage of the legislation which was first transmitted to the lawmakers over 14 years ago.\n\n\u201cIts delay has sparked a great deal of uncertainty and led to an estimated loss of over $15 billion annually in lost investments to Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas industry. With the global shift from fossil fuels to renewable forms of energy picking up pace, the passage of the PIB may just be too little, too late,\u201d the FDC report added.\n\nIt said it was unlikely that Nigeria would be able to make up for either the lost time or the lost investment, adding that information available to it suggests that the bill is currently undergoing last-minute modifications in three key areas to enhance its effectiveness.\n\nIt listed the areas as the deregulation of the price of gas supplied to power plants, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation\u2019s (NNPC\u2019s) public offer and the adoption of a single regulator for the industry.\n\nAccording to the report, price deregulation of gas supplied to power plants is a key ingredient in incentivising power output in Nigeria.\n\nHe added that while this is likely to translate to increased tariffs for electricity, it is needed to attract investment in both the gas and electricity generating industry.\n\nOn the NNPC\u2019s public offer, it stated that selling shares to the public will mean that the corporation will be able to source its own funding and come under a higher level of corporate governance and scrutiny.\n\nBesides, it said while the adoption of a single regulator would ensure more efficiency and allow for enhanced cohesion in regulating the entire industry value chain, the PIB as currently constructed, recommended two regulators-one for the upstream and another for the midstream and downstream sectors.\n\nFDC said it envisaged a situation where the PIB could also become a source of acrimony as it gives legal backing to the complete price deregulation of the downstream segment of the oil and gas industry.\n\nIt said: \u201cThe Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), made up of the governors of the 36 states, has proposed the implementation of the full deregulation of the downstream oil industry and determined that the pump price of petrol will be somewhere around N385/litre (137.65 per cent above the current fuel pump price of N165/litre).\n\n\u201cWhile this will bring relief to the state governments that have been grappling with lower revenues, the chance of the federal government allowing such a spike in the near term is slim because of the negative impact on the poor.\n\n\u201cThe subsidy will cripple the government\u2019s finances if sustained, but deregulation is the only way to unlock domestic refining. There is simply no easy way around or through the dilemma. Something is going to have to give.\u201d\n\nThe report said the International Oil Companies (IOCs) were already squarely in the thick of the energy transition, while some were on well laid-out paths that would see them fully evolve to clean-energy companies.\n\nFor instance, it stated that Royal Dutch Shell is in talks with the federal government to divest from its onshore oil fields and focus on its offshore and gas operations citing recurring incidents of theft, sabotage, and oil spillage.\n\n\u201cThe IOCs have stated that Nigerian onshore business is incompatible with their long-term strategy, which focuses on climate change and net-zero carbon emissions by 2050,\u201d the FDC document said.\n\nFDC added that foreign oil companies have been gradually disposing of their onshore assets over the last decade, emphasising that beyond the obvious reasons of insecurity and unrest in the Niger Delta stated by Shell, the protracted stalemate in passing the PIB remains a major factor in the oil giant\u2019s decision to exit its onshore operations in Nigeria.\n\nWith slightly under 40 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s crude and condensate production capacity, FDC stated that while Shell\u2019s move to offload its onshore oil fields could have implications on Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas output, it could also send wrong signals to international investors considering doing business in Nigeria.\n\nIt added: \u201cOther IOCs, Chevron and Mobil, have also begun to gradually dispose of their Nigerian assets in response to their changing goals and strategies, which have been influenced by climate change and the need to go green. A number of questions arise.\n\n\u201cWhat will happen to Shell\u2019s onshore assets? Are they going to be acquired by the NNPC through its upstream arm, Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC) or does the government invite bids from indigenous and foreign producers?\n\n\u201cDo the indigenous producers have the capacity to acquire these assets even as we expect more divestments in the future across the continent? Does this create an opportunity for indigenous players in the oil and gas sector to grow the continental footprint?\u201d\n\nThe report noted that it remains uncertain how the events will play out, adding that what is certain is that the passage of the PIB should have happened at least a decade ago and would have been crucial in the federal government\u2019s drive to achieve production of 4mbpd and domestic oil refining for regional exports.\n\nOPEC: Nigeria\u2019s Oil Production Hit Record Low in May\n\nMeanwhile, Nigeria\u2019s crude oil production output hit record low levels in May, the June Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR) of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), has shown.\n\nThe monthly report indicated that in the first quarter of 2021, Nigeria\u2019s average production was 1.410 million barrels per day.\n\nApril production stood at 1.460mbpd and it was 1.388 barrels per day in May, leading to the loss of 72,000 daily barrels during the month.\n\nBut based on direct communication with OPEC, the cartel put the figure at 1.429 million barrels per day in March, 1.372 barrels per day in April and 1.344 mbpd in May, resulting in a shortage of 28,000 barrels between April and May.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear why production has remained low even after the country announced earlier in the year that it had fully complied with the OPEC cuts after defaulting initially and the cartel\u2019s decision to gradually open the taps since April.\n\nThe country\u2019s average crude oil production based on secondary sources was 1.78 Mbpd in 2019 and 1.57mbpd in 2020, while total OPEC 13-member crude oil production averaged 25.46 mb/d during May.\n\n\u201cIn May 2021, production was up by 0.39 mb/d m-o-m. Crude oil output increased mainly in Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Iran, while production decreased primarily in Nigeria and Angola,\u201d OPEC said.\n\nIn terms of oil rig count, Nigeria\u2019s total was 13 in 2018, 16 in 2019 and 11 in 2020, according to the report, but the number of operational rigs fell to five in April and rose by one to six rigs last month.\n\nThe OPEC report showed that Africa\u2019s demand for crude oil was 3.43 million bpd in 2019, which fell to a 4.37million bpd in Q1, 2020. It further fell to 3.76 million bpd in Q2,2020, was 3.94 mbpd in Q3,2020 and 4.27 mbpd in Q4, 2020.\n\nThe MOMR indicated that Nigeria\u2019s real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) advanced 0.5 per cent y-o-y in Q1, 2021, following a 0.1 per cent y-o-y rise in the last quarter of 2021.\n\nIt said the country registered the second consecutive quarterly growth since Nigeria\u2019s economy faced recession in the third quarter of 2020, amid the easing of COVID-19 restrictions and an improvement in oil prices.\n\nOPEC added: \u201cNon-oil sector expanded 0.8 per cent y-o-y in 1Q21 following a 1.7 per cent y-o-y growth in 4Q20. The current growth was powered by the agriculture sector, which expanded by 2.3 per cent y-o-y.\n\n\u201cIndustrial activity moved back into the growth of 0.9 per cent y-o-y, after dropping by 5.6 per cent on average in 2020. Moreover, the annual inflation rate declined to 18.12 per cent in April 2021, from a four-year high of 18.17 per cent in March, but producer inflation accelerated to a significantly high level, amid raw material shortages and unfavourable exchange rate depreciation.\u201d\n\nThe report said Nigeria\u2019s business sentiment remained optimistic, driven by the current expansion in manufacturing operations as well as higher oil prices.\n\nBut OPEC stuck to its prediction of a strong world oil demand recovery in 2021 led by the United States and China despite uncertainties stemming from the pandemic, pointing to a need for more oil from the producer group.\n\nThe cartel said demand would rise by 6.6 per cent or 5.95 million barrels per day this year, remaining unchanged for a second consecutive month, despite a slower-than-expected recovery in the first half of this year.\n\n\u201cGlobal economic recovery has been delayed due to the resurgence of COVID-19 infections and renewed lockdowns in key economies, including the Eurozone, Japan and India.\n\n\u201cOverall, the recovery in global economic growth, and hence oil demand is expected to gain momentum in the second half,\u201d OPEC said in the monthly report.\n\nThe cartel stated that it sees 2021 world economic growth at 5.5 per cent, unchanged from last month, assuming the impact of the pandemic will have been \u201clargely contained\u201d by the beginning of the second half.\n\n\u201cThe ongoing vaccination efforts, a growing share of recovered cases leading to increasing herd immunity, and the easing of lockdown restrictions lend optimism that the pandemic could be contained in the few months to come,\u201d OPEC said.\n\nIn April, OPEC and its allies, known as OPEC+, had agreed to gradually ease oil output cuts from May to July and confirmed the decision at a meeting on June 1.\n\nThe report showed higher OPEC oil output, reflecting the decision to pump more and gains from Iran, which is exempted from making voluntary cuts due to U.S. sanctions, increasing May output to 390,000 bpd to hit 25.46 million daily production from the oil cartel.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Public perception of Buhari changed after ARISE Television interview, says Tinubu\n\nAdedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nA former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, has said that the federal government must restructure the country in the interest and the survival of the nation.\n\nOyegun spoke in Abuja on Saturday night at the public presentation of a book titled, \u2018APC\u2019s Litmus Tests\u2019 written by the Director-General of Progressives Governors Forum (PGF), Dr. Salihu Lukman.\n\nThe former Edo State governor said it was vital that these issues should be addressed as the country cannot continue to allow the subject to become a recurring threat.\n\nAlso, National Leader of APC, Senator Bola Tinubu, said the public perception of President Muhammadu Buhari had changed after his interview with ARISE NEWS Channel. He added that the face-off between Odigie-Oyegun\u2019s successor, Mr. Adams Oshiomhole, and Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, was a collateral damage for the party.\n\nOdigie-Oyegun stated that there was no question that the nation and its political parties were going through difficult times, adding that all those at the formation of the APC knew the uniqueness of the party\u2019s constitution and its manifesto that promised change.\n\nAccording to him, the forces of economics have made things, not quite the way the party wanted them to be.\n\nHe said the document the APC produced on true federalism, which passed through all the organs of the party was produced because there was a cacophony of voices over the issue of restructuring.\n\nHe said at that time, just as it is happening now, two people could not agree on what they meant by restructuring and the party needed to take control of the debate, define the issues, proffer solutions and went as far as having some drafts legislation.\n\nOdigie-Oyegun said it was not by any chance a perfect document, but it reflected the thinking and the desires of Nigerians.\n\nHe stated: \u201cUnfortunately, it has gone beyond that. We now have one or two things that did not happen before. People now want to disengage from the federation, which did not happen before and that is a warning sign. If a child asks for garri today you don\u2019t give him, tomorrow he may decide it is cake he wants and we must not as a political party, we must not as the government of the federation give the impression that only military governments can fundamentally tamper with the basic structure of this nation.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cAs a progressive government, it is proper that we show the nation that when the people want some degree of change, the party should be responsive to it and should address it.\u201d\n\nOdigie-Oyegun added: \u201cCompromises have to be made, there\u2019s no question about that. The report itself is not final. It still has to go through the litmus test of compromises. The ideas of people from different parts of the country will be different up to the extent they want to go with the proposals in the document, but it is necessary. It must be mandatory in the interest of the survival of our nation, that these issues be addressed. We cannot continue to allow the subject to become something that threatens our nation at any turn.\u201d\n\nChairman of PGF and Governor of Kebbi State, Senator Atiku Bagudu, said the party was not shy to acknowledge that the country\u2019s constitution was not perfect hence the setting up of Governor Nasir el-Rufai Committee on true federalism.\n\nHe said: \u201cAPC believes in letting us amend the constitution because society is dynamic not because somebody has been wronged and cheated. If that is the basis for correction, then the agitation will never stop but if it\u2019s based on let us make it better.\u201d\n\nBagudu stated that there are fundamental challenges to be addressed, stressing that the ruling party will not shy away from acknowledging them and providing transparent leadership.\n\nHe said there was a need to increase Nigeria\u2019s budget to $300 billion or $500 billion to be able to fix the nation\u2019s challenges in the various sectors.\n\nComparing Nigeria\u2019s budget with the United States, a country with 331 million people, Bagudu said you would find that in 2019, the US budget was over $3.5 trillion and one per cent of $3.5 trillion is $35 billion.\n\nAccording to him, that means Nigeria\u2019s budget is less than one per cent of the US\u2019 budget despite having a population that is about 70 per cent of the United States population.\n\nThe governor added: \u201cIf one considers the actual distribution of revenue, it even reflects the truth. For example, from January to May, the Federation Allocation Account Committee meetings, there is no month yet, where the equivalent of $2 billion has been distributed. So, if things go this way that means $24 billion will be distributed by the three tiers of government.\n\n\u201cBut our quest includes expanding our horizon so that we can see how we will move the $35 billion federal budget to $300 billion or $500 billion federal budget because only then, can we meet some of our expectations, some of our aspirations in all sectors.\u201d\n\nThe governor said that before then, the country would continue to struggle to find enough money for security, health, education, stressing that part of APC\u2019s litmus test was to communicate this properly to Nigerians so that in making choices, they would not be blinded by promises.\n\nRepresented by former National Legal Adviser of APC, Mr. Babatunde Ogala (SAN), Tinubu said the public perception of the president had changed since last Thursday\u2019s interview aired by ARISE NEWS CHANNEL, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers.\n\nHe stated: \u201cAfter the interview of the president with ARISE NEWS, the perception of the public has changed. Yet those who will not see good will never see it.\n\n\u201cHave we sold our party and the achievements of this government enough \u2013 I think not.\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 devastated the whole world. It\u2019s even a bigger form of insecurity than even the banditry that we have made a big issue of. We all saw India, we saw Ecuador where people were counting corpses of their relatives as their own luggage. We all knew their predictions for Africa, how well have we sold these achievements to the public.\u201d\n\nOn the clash between Oshiomhole and Obaseki that cost APC Edo State in the last governorship election in the state, Tinubu said he was one of those who facilitated behind-the-scene visits to Lagos \u2013 by Obaseki and by APC governors \u201cbecause we knew the consequences for our party. Whether you like it or not, it was collateral damage for all of us.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWhatever our party has gone through in the last eight years, we are still facing a lot of challenges. They\u2019ve called our party different names, some even predicted that we are not going to have 12 months or 24 months.\n\n\u201cAnd if I must say, a party that has gone through eight years, it\u2019s still an infant. There will still be more of these tests \u2013 disagreement, misunderstanding, realignment but one thing is that you are part of the intellectual content of our party.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",
          "summary": "The former Edo State governor said it was vital that these issues should be addressed as the country cannot continue to allow the subject to become a recurring threat.\nAlso, National Leader of APC, Senator Bola Tinubu, said the public perception of President Muhammadu Buhari had changed after his interview with ARISE NEWS Channel.\nHe added that the face-off between Odigie-Oyegun\u2019s successor, Mr. Adams Oshiomhole, and Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, was a collateral damage for the party.\nAccording to him, the forces of economics have made things, not quite the way the party wanted them to be.\nIt must be mandatory in the interest of the survival of our nation, that these issues be addressed.",

          "text": "Alex Enumah in Abuja\n\nHuman rights lawyer, Mr. Femi Falana (SAN), has asked the Nigeria Police Force to apologise for violating the fundamental right of protesters to freedom of expression.\n\nAs Nigeria celebrated Democracy Day on Saturday, protesters stormed major cities nationwide to demand better governance and improved living conditions for citizens.\n\nBut the police fired tear gas at some of those protesting in Lagos, Abuja and Cross River State while others were arrested and later released.\n\nFalana said in a statement yesterday that peaceful protests are fundamental rights of Nigerians as provided for in the 1999 constitution.\n\nHe, however, noted that the constitution was violated by the police who \u201cbanned rallies and protests throughout the country on June 12, 2021\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cFor having the audacity to insist on their fundamental right to protest against unpopular policies of governments, teams of armed police personnel fired teargas to disperse the peaceful rallies. As if the unprovoked attack was not enough the Police brutalised and arrested scores of protesters in Lagos, Abuja and Calabar.\n\n\u201cSince the protesters who were arrested during the peaceful rallies did not commit any offence, they have since regained their liberty. But the Police Authorities ought to apologise for violating the fundamental right of the protesters to freedom of expression.\n\n\u201cMore so that the police had deliberately contravened Section 83 (4) of the Police Establishment Act 2020 which provides that \u2018Where a person or organization notifies the police of his or its intention to hold a public meeting, rally or procession on a public highway or such meetings in a place where the public has access to, the police officer responsible for the area where the meeting rally or procession will take place shall mobilize personnel to provide security cover for the meeting, rally or the procession.\u201d\n\nThe senior lawyer commended the protesters for \u201cconducting themselves in a peaceful manner\u201d and condemned \u201cthe official lie that the protesters were teargassed to prevent hoodlums and miscreants from hijacking the peaceful rallies.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy were the scanty pro-government protesters who were reported to have fought openly in Abuja over their booty not arrested for breach of the peace in the Federal Capital Territory?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cThe lessons of the unfortunate event of yesterday should be learnt by all sides of the debate on human freedom.

          "text": "A Nigerian minister and a governor of a northern state recently visited Egypt to get security platforms to monitor people's calls, text messages and other forms of communication.\n\nAccording to a security source who spoke with SaharaReporters, the minister and governor made a quick trip to the North African in a bid to find technological ways to trample on people's freedom of speech.\n\nFile photo used to illustrate story.\n\nThe governor and the minister are both controversial and have also been in the news lately for the wrong reasons.\n\n\"A minister and a governor went to Egypt this week to get a security platform for monitoring calls of citizens. It was a really quick trip,\" the source told SaharaReporters.\n\nThe clampdown on free speech in Nigeria has become heightened under the President Muhammadu Buhari administration.\n\nTowards the end of 2015, a Petition Bill targeting online and print media as well as regulating social media posts was sponsored in the Senate but it was followed by a public backlash.\n\nIn 2019, lawmakers introduced the National Commission for the Prohibition of Hate Speech bill and the Protection from Internet Falsehood and Manipulation and other Related Offences bill.\n\nThese bills also attracted public critism.\n\nSimilarly, conversations about a Nigerian firewall were started during EndSARS protests last year. It was gathered that the EndSARS protests in 2020 made the government more desperate to control the cyberspace.\n\nIn a December 2020 report, University of Toronto\u2019s Citizen Lab, noted that the Nigeria\u2019s Defence Intelligence Agency had acquired equipment that it can use to spy on its citizens\u2019 calls and text messages.\n\nUniversity of Toronto\u2019s Citizen Lab researches on digital surveillance, security, privacy and accountability.\n\nThe report, titled Running in Circles: Uncovering the Clients of Cyber-espionage Firm Circles, said a telecom surveillance company by the name of Circles has been helping state security apparatuses across 25 countries, including Nigeria, to spy on the communications of opposition figures, journalists, and protesters.\n\nThe Citizen Lab report also said Circles was affiliated with Tel Aviv-based NSO Group, an Israeli hacker-for-hire company, whose software, Pegasus, has allegedly been used by several governments to spy on dissidents by taking control of their smartphone, its cameras and microphones, and mining the user\u2019s personal data.\n\nCircles, on the other hand, is known for selling systems to exploit Signalling System 7 (SS7) vulnerabilities and claims to have sold the technology to several countries, according to the report. SS7 is a system that allows one mobile network to connect with another.\n\n\u201cUnlike NSO Group\u2019s Pegasus spyware, the SS7 mechanism by which Circles\u2019 product reportedly operates does not have an obvious signature on a target\u2019s phone,\u201d explained the report.\n\nThe report indicated that Pegasus and Circles products could possibly be integrated.\n\nBut there is limited information on how the Circles system integrates with NSO Group\u2019s flagship Pegasus spyware, though a former NSO Group employee told Motherboard that Pegasus had an \u201cawful integration with Circles\u201d and that Circles had \u201cexaggerated their system\u2019s abilities,\u201d according to the report.\n\nAccording to the report, at least two entities in Nigeria have deployed Circles\u2019 product.\n\nThe report stated, \u201cOne system may be operated by the same entity as one of the Nigerian customers of the FinFisher spyware that we detected in December 2014.\n\n\u201cThe other client appears to be the Nigerian Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA), as its firewall IPs are in AS37258, a block of IP addresses registered to \u201cHQ Defence Intelligence Agency Asokoro, Nigeria, Abuja.\n\n\u201c...In Bayelsa State, the governor reportedly used the Circles system to spy on his opponent in an election, as well as his opponent\u2019s wife and aides.\n\n\u201cThe investigation also found that the two Circles systems were imported without the proper authorisations from Nigeria\u2019s Office of the National Security Adviser.\"\n\nHowever, a 2016 investigation showed that in 2010, Rotimi Amaechi, the former Governor of Rivers State, was the first government official to make contact with Circles to deliver internet surveillance equipment.

          "text": "Seven months after taking up an initial 20% stake in BetKing, South African pay TV operator MultiChoice plans to increase its shareholding in the online gambling company to 49% in a $281.5 million deal.\n\nBetKing is the trading name of Blue Lake Ventures Limited, a pan-African sports betting and entertainment business with major operations in Nigeria. The value of MultiChoice\u2019s initial investment in BetKing was said to be worth more than $100 million.\n\nThe decision to double down on the gambling company, approved by the MultiChoice board on Thursday, is in line with the company\u2019s strategy to expand its entertainment ecosystem and develop meaningful drivers of future value, a statement from the South African entertainment giant reads.\n\n\u201cConsumers have a growing abundance of entertainment options available to them. It is therefore important for MultiChoice to maintain its relevance and grow its share of engagement time and consumer spend by expanding its entertainment platform with a more comprehensive offering and a greater number of products and services,\u201d the company said, explaining the rationale behind its increased investment in BetKing.\n\nAccording to MultiChoice, pursuing an adjacency such as sports betting creates a \u201cnatural extension\u201d to its video entertainment platform to further enhance its product offerings. In other words, sport betting augments the company\u2019s business given sports is a major revenue source.\n\nWidely known as one of the leading sports betting sites in Nigeria, BetKing was founded by CEO Byron Petzer and Adekunle Adeniji, who once served as Bet9ja\u2019s virtual product manager.\n\nBetKing\u2019s annual statement for the financial year ended December 2020 shows a growth in revenue to $77.9 million, from $54.7 million in the previous year. Meanwhile, net asset value stood at $100.2 million.\n\nIt is thus not hard to see the appeal in investing in the major sports betting company also considering that the market is growing significantly globally. Between 2020 and 2024, the industry is expected to grow by more than $134 billion, a Compound Annual Growth Rate of 10%, according to Technavio.\n\nSeveral sports betting companies currently operate in this part of the world too. In Nigeria, some popular names apart from BetKing include Bet9ja, Nairabet, Naijabet, Sporting Bet, Surebet24, etc.\n\nIn 2018, it was reported that an estimated 60 million Nigerians between the ages of 18 and 40 were involved in active sports betting. Also, almost \u20a62 billion was spent on sports betting daily in Nigeria, equivalent to nearly \u20a6730 billion in a year. Yet, Africa accounts for only 2% of global sports betting revenue. As the regional market begins to play catch up, it is poised for significant growth.",

          "text": "With decentralised digital currencies like bitcoin becoming increasingly popular, the world\u2019s central banks have \u2013 in the past two years at least \u2013 been working towards developing government-backed digital currencies.\n\nNigeria may pilot an official digital currency in 2021, going by the words of Rakiyat Mohammed, a Central Bank Director in charge of the Information Technology Department, who revealed on Thursday that the banking regulator will soon launch a digital currency.\n\nA Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) represents a country\u2019s official currency in digital form. As against printing money, the apex bank issues electronic coins and notes that are backed by the government, unlike existing cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria has made \u201ctremendous progress\u201d exploring the technology for digital currency for over two years now, Mohammed revealed at a press briefing after a meeting of the Bankers\u2019 Committee. \u201cBefore the end of the year, the Central Bank will be making a special announcement and possibly launching a pilot scheme in order to be able to provide this kind of currency to its populace.\u201d\n\nThe announcement comes on the back of efforts by Nigerian authorities targeted at regulating the use of decentralised cryptocurrencies in the country. The apex bank in February directed all local banks to close accounts linked to crypto platforms.\n\nDespite the clampdown, Nigerians continue to use digital currencies as a store of value and remittance tool and in a change of tone, the CBN governor later clarified that crypto trading is not banned in the country.\n\nWhy would the CBN get into virtual currencies?\n\nAccording to the CBN director, about 80% of central banks in the world are currently exploring the possibility of issuing central bank digital currency and Nigeria could not be left behind.\n\nChina in April 2020 became the first major economy to pilot a digital currency and is working towards achieving a wide, domestic use of the digital yuan by the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.\n\nLast year, the Bahamas launched the world\u2019s first central bank digital currency. Other countries where national digital currency trials are ongoing include Indonesia, Norway, Japan, Sweden and South Korea and in Africa, Egypt, South Africa, Ghana, Morocco and Kenya are exploring the technology\u2019s feasibility.\n\nBeyond just following the global trend, there are lots of potential reasons for the planned rollout of an official digital currency in Nigeria later this year.\n\nThe CBN director particularly cited the need to make remittances travel easier from abroad to Nigeria as one motivation. \u201cWe all know how money has to travel for someone to send money from Nigeria to abroad and it is a huge money in Africa,\u201d Mohammed said.\n\nWhen it eventually becomes operational, the digital currency will complement the existing forms of currency in the country and could help reduce the high cost of managing and transferring cash.\n\nDigital currency could also boost financial inclusion as those unbanked can get easier and safer access to money through their phone. A recent report by the Enhancing Financial Innovation and Access (EFiNA) shows that Nigeria did not meet its financial inclusion targets for 2020 and at the current rate, they might not be achieved anytime soon.\n\n\u201cWe know that the recent report by EFiNA was that our target was to achieve 80% financial inclusion. We are about 60% and at the rate at which we are going, we are not going to meet this target,\u201d Mohammed said, adding that the Central Bank digital currency could \u201caccelerate\u201d the CBN\u2019s ability to meet this target.\n\nAfter the announcement, the apex bank will now explore technological options and engage various industry players, as well as move to the next stage of proof of concept to pilot the scheme, according to the CBN director.",

          "title": "What is a VPN and how does it work in Nigeria?",
          "text": "Virtual Private Networks (VPN) are all the rage right now in Nigeria since the government banned Twitter. The rise in popularity of VPNs has brought up questions about how exactly they work.\n\nSo let\u2019s talk about how VPNs work.\n\nOn the internet, different computers send and receive information between Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Think of it as sending items between two or more physical addresses. When we surf the internet with our IP address, different websites will know specific information about us such as our location, device type, browser and operating system.\n\nWhat does a VPN do?\n\nWith VPNs, our IP addresses change and online activities are hidden.\n\nBefore turning on my VPN, my device was in Lagos, Nigeria\n\nAfter turning on my VPN, my device is in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic\n\nThe images above show how my location changed from Nigeria to Dominican Republic after turning on my VPN.\n\nThink about it this way: The internet is like a highway that connects different cities across different countries. These highways are mostly public roads that many people use. If you drive on a public road anyone can follow you and track where you go, how long you spend at your destination, and when you return. They might even be able to spy inside your car and learn more about you.\n\nWith a VPN, you have your own private tunnel/road. A tunnel where no one can see what you\u2019re doing or where you\u2019re going.\n\nWhat can a VPN do for you?\n\nNo monitoring: As we mentioned earlier, your internet service provider (ISP) can see your internet traffic and probably log your browsing history. With a VPN, information about your activities online are scrambled in an encrypted tunnel so that external parties, your ISP included, can\u2019t read it.\n\nAccess any site: Every now and then, websites or services you want to use may be inaccessible from your location. VPN enables access to these sites or services from anywhere. If a website isn\u2019t available to devices located in Nigeria, VPNs can change your device location to a different country which has access to this website.\n\nProtection: Free public Wi-Fi might make you forget all your life\u2019s problems but it can also be the beginning of a new set of problems. Public Wi-Fi can easily be accessed by hackers on the same network, who can read your personal data. A VPN encrypts your entire internet connection to protect all your communications, even over unsecured networks.\n\nWhat is the difference between a VPN app, a VPN plugin, and a VPN browser?\n\nCurious about which you should use? VPN browsers or browser plugins only protect your web browser traffic. Note, however, that the rest of the network traffic from your device is still exposed to internet service providers and potential hackers. A VPN app encrypts and protects all network traffic from your device.\n\nIs it safe to use a VPN for online banking?\n\nYes\u2013 but ensure you are using a reputable VPN service. VPNs help protect your privacy while you perform online banking transactions. But remember, a VPN is a tunnel that encrypts your data. It cannot protect you from viruses or guarantee that you won\u2019t be hacked. Remember to create a strong password and adhere to online safety measures.\n\nWhat else should I know about VPNs?\n\nVPNs aren\u2019t without flaws. They have their fair share of practical drawbacks. Internet speed can be slower because VPNs have to reroute and encrypt your data while sending and receiving information between your device and a website.\n\nAlso, some sites and services look at VPN traffic as suspicious and won\u2019t let you connect. It becomes suspicious when a device is in different locations within a short time \u2014 in New York, Lagos and Tokyo within an hour. This could become a real problem, especially when it\u2019s your bank that blocks you.",

          "title": "TECNO CAMON 17 Pro: A Creative Nod to the Selfie and the Selfie Culture",
          "text": "A few weeks back, TECNO launched the TECNO CAMON 17 Pro smartphone, focusing on the selfie with a 48MP AI selfie camera and 90 Hz super-high refreshing rate at 6.8-inch FHD Screen. The brand showed sincerity in understanding their consumers\u2019 needs, seeing as the pandemic era amplified people\u2019s need for documenting personal memories.\n\nIt really is no surprise that the social phenomenon of selfies has gained momentum and has become central to how people express themselves and keep in touch with the world. Personally, I have taken more pictures, recorded more videos this past year than I have in years.\n\nI guess that is why TECNO\u2019s Camon 17 Pro stood out to me. It seemed to me like they were the first brand to put this behavioural shift into focus and offer a solution backed by the brand\u2019s usual innovation and sweet price range.\n\nSo, today, I am going to be sharing the things I love about the Camon 17 Pro.\n\n48MP AI Selfie Camera\n\nLike I already stated. The selfie camera of the Camon 17 Pro is one of the highlights of the phone. The 48 MP selfie camera captures the beautiful details in an elegant way even adding a professional finish. The embedded artificial intelligence (AI) technology\u2019s algorithms elevate the pictures by identifying features based on gender. The algorithms also adjust the surrounding light to make me the focal point of the shot. The wide selection tools helped me personalize the images just as I wanted them portrayed. I was able to conceal blemishes on my face. There is also a tool that helped hide the dark circles around my face.\n\nCamera LAB \u2013 The TAIVOS\u2122 Imaging Laboratory\n\nThe TECNO CAMON 17 Pro comes with trademarked TAIVOS technology. TAIVOS, which stands for TECNO AI Vision Optimization Solution provides users with an unprecedented visual experience, especially in low-light environments. TAIVOS filtered out the image noise of my pictures quite nicely and optimized the images\u2019 clarity. The end result of that were photos with enhanced night photography effects.\n\nOne of my favourite things about TECNO\u2019s TAIVOS\u2122 is how it lets in more light and optimizes details against a low-light background, adding clarity to the photos. The camera literally found light for my pictures despite how dark the night was. The super night mode of the device delivered impressively.\n\nApparently, TECNO has carried out much research to incorporate better technology on the Camon 17 Pro. And it shows in how grand the camera solutions are on the device.\n\nOf course, the camera features of the Camon 17 Pro aren\u2019t all there is about the device. Here are some of the other features that ticks the boxes for me.\n\nElegant Appearance with both Aesthetics and Functionality\n\nThe 6.8-inch 1080\u00d72460 FHD display of the Camon 17 pro provides incomparable clarity and is a feast for the eyes. Every edge feels sharper and every colour is brighter. These worked together to get me truly immersed in the high-definition video and intense games. The 90 Hz super-high refreshing rate offered me a smooth, snappy and refreshing experience.\n\nIt is obvious that the appearance of the device was constructed with ample consideration of both practicality and aesthetics. TECNO made use of light and shadow, as well as accurately crafted nanoscale textures. I should also state how the optical coating incorporated makes the device fingerprint resistant.\n\nThe device comes in distinct California dream silver and Malibu blue colours. Its ergonomic design for easy hold, slim body and adjusted edges gives it a great look.\n\nLong Lasting Battery and Peak Performance\n\nCamon 17 Pro offers users the performance they deserve. Animations are smoother, games are more immersive, and networking is faster. The Media Helio G95 Processor contains an 8-core CPU with Hyper Engine game optimization, making it TECNO\u2019s fastest chip yet, and at the same time still providing exceptional performance. Network optimization with the prediction engine allows for WIFI/LTE concurrence so my connection remained uninterrupted while gaming.\n\nWith an enormous 5000mAh battery you do not have to worry about your phone dying during crucial moments. Furthermore, the TECNO CAMON 17 Pro comes with fast charging so, the TECNO CAMON 17 Pro will be ready to leave when you are.\n\nUser Focused OS 7.6 System\n\nI specifically like how TECNO prioritised privacy with the Camon 17 Pro. The device allows users to use fingerprints to lock apps away and keep data as secure as possible. The phone also comes with a privacy film that ensures only the user looking directly at the screen can see what is being shown.\n\nIt\u2019s One-click blockbuster feature allows the users to pick from professional templates to create dynamic and exciting albums to be played back for friends and family. The device makes sharing precious and fun moments a lot easier.\n\nThe Camon 17 Pro sells for N125,000 and is available in authorized stores nationwide. Good thing about buying the Camon 17 Pro as soon as you can is that you will be given the TECNO Buds 1 for free.\n\nHere\u2019s what you will be getting from the buds;\n\nSmooth Connectivity\n\nI went through a seamless process of pairing the TECNO buds 1 to the Camon 17 Pro over a Bluetooth v5.0 connection. With your phone\u2019s Bluetooth on, the earbuds are automatically seen and asks that you pair both devices.\n\nWireless Stereo Sound and Deep Bass\n\nThe TECNO Buds 1 has a deep bass effect that locks out noise and allows you enjoy every single sound be it music or movie.\n\nEasy User Experience with the Smart Switching Function\n\nLet me say first that the buds fit perfectly into the ears and wouldn\u2019t fall out easily. I especially love that I didn\u2019t have to bring out my phone each time I had to do basic things like answer phone calls, or move a song to the next one. All I had to do was tap the touch sensitive buttons on the buds.\n\nBattery\n\nThe TECNO Buds 1 comes with an interesting battery capacity. Each earbud has a 40mAh battery capacity that lasts over 4 hours. The charging case itself is 300mAh and delivers over 12 hours of charge to the earbuds\n\nEach earbud has a 40mAh battery capacity that lasts over 4 hours. The charging case itself is 300mAh\u2026",

          "title": "Fostering Gender Inclusion in Technology with the Bolt Drive4WITech Initiative",
          "text": "The journey into tech for women in Africa is an ongoing discussion largely influenced by cultural norms and societal expectations concerning gender. Bolt, an inclusive mobility company, recognises this and as part of efforts to drive participation and inclusion for women in technology, launched the #Drive4WITech (Drive for Women in Tech) initiative to support young women in Africa. The initiative is an immersive internship programme for young women to challenge the status quo and kickstart a career in the tech space. The goal for Bolt is to equip the interns with preliminary knowledge and hands-on tools required to expand their career paths into areas in technology.\n\nFrom the vast number of applicants across Africa, nine interns were selected with three from Nigeria. Two of them \u2013 Onyekachukwu Orji and Oluwakorede Oseni spoke about their experience. The interns chosen are made up of undergraduate and post-graduates across different interests.\n\nQ: Among the many applications received, you were selected to intern with Bolt in the #Drive4WITech initiative. How did you feel when you were selected?\n\nOluwakorede: I was excited when I was notified that I had been selected. I saw this as an opportunity to work with a global and inclusive brand that is committed to solving the mobility challenge in Africa. It is an opportunity I have been waiting.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I felt elated to have been selected. I have always been curious about what it would feel like working at Bolt. I am happy and satisfied with the knowledge I have gained during my time as an intern.\n\nQ: What area did you specialise in during the programme?\n\nOluwakorede: I supported the marketing team at Bolt Nigeria. This provided me with a basic understanding of the necessary skills needed to supervise teams, programmes, and strategically plan for maximum impact.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I specialised in City Operations. I worked closely with Heads of Departments to build strategic solutions to issues as they arose, and it has helped me develop core competence in identifying and resolving issues.\n\nQ: Tell us about the experience and the new skills you learnt during the programme?\n\nOluwakorede: I had a great experience working at Bolt. In the marketing department, I discovered that marketing plays in promoting business goals and driving sales of products or services. Some of the skills I learnt include creative writing and how to structure the language of blogs and messages, using Emails and push notifications to pass across a clear message. I also learnt how to research and identify the organisation\u2019s target audience which helps in crafting content.\n\nOnyekachukwu: My experience was very exciting. I learnt the importance of teamwork, communication, staying up to date on issues that concern the company, professionalism, time management and discipline. The most important thing I have learnt is the ownership mentality. I must act like I own the business, that way, I would be at my best to ensure that everything runs smoothly and the business stays functional. To observe and think of ways to improve the business, it is paramount to communicate doubts and concerns where necessary. In addition, ask for clarity when in doubt and always being courageous enough to say when or where I lack knowledge. I have also developed analytical skills.\n\nQ: What impact has Drive4WITech had on you and how will it enhance your career?\n\nOluwakorede: The programme was very impactful. It exposed me to the importance of marketing and the role it plays in the business world. I am more confident, and I believe I more versatile and can provide useful insights. With all these learnings, I am positive of adding immense value in my future roles.\n\nOnyekachukwu: The skills I learnt will play an instrumental role in helping me to build a successful career. I am more equipped to confidently make significant contributions to my future work team.\n\nQ: How do you plan to use the knowledge gained to your advantage in the tech industry?\n\nOluwakorede: I aspire to own a tech company and to run the company successfully. I have learnt that it is important to manage the brand\u2019s image and proper representation of the brand. I want to use the knowledge gained to build my brand having realised that there is a misconception by tech enthusiasts about other fields. So, the knowledge will be very instrumental to my success in the industry.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I plan to pursue a career in data analytics. With the knowledge gained, I will be able to help businesses optimise their performances and make better consumer decisions, while leveraging on trends and insights for a better customer experience.\n\nQ: Did you have any challenges interning at Bolt?\n\nOluwakorede: A major challenge was writing and developing content because I initially had little knowledge about how to structure and develop detailed content with accurate language to pass across the right message. However, with the support of my team members who constantly provided guidance, I was able to overcome the challenge and I can boldly say that I am better off than I joined.\n\nOnyekachukwu: No, the company made my internship as accommodating as possible. Whenever I felt overwhelmed, I reached out to my team for support. This has also helped me develop strong organisational skills, where I am more focused on important things.\n\nQ: The Drive4WITech initiative positions Bolt as an inclusive and diverse organization. How immersing was it for you?\n\nOluwakorede: It was very immersing and educating beyond a regular internship. The programme provided an effective vehicle for me to learn and grow. It also helped me develop strong work ethics that enhance productivity while building expertise working with a diverse team.\n\nOnyekachukwu: It was very engaging. Every team did their best to take us through their task and how they work. The operations team taught us several new processes in data analytics. From what was taught, I now understand more about data, how it is stored, and how to use it better. I also learnt how data can be used to tell a story and find useful insights.\n\nQ: Did the programme meet your expectations?\n\nOluwakorede: My experience during the programme exceeded my expectations as I did not expect to learn a lot from marketing. It was fun and challenging because there is always a new technique to learn, a case to study, and strategies to research which is very interesting.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I came in with a curious mind and some expectation to learn and practice analytical skills. Even so, the internship curriculum covered more than I expected. It was highly satisfactory.\n\nQ: What is that one thing you will miss about interning at Bolt?\n\nOluwakorede: I will miss the friendly environment and meetings where I am encouraged to share ideas and ask questions, motivating me.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I will miss the work culture and healthy workspace that encourages growth, as well as my team; especially Onyinye, Bimbo and Miracle.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "title": "From ballot paper to blockchain ledger, can the tech behind Bitcoin heal Nigeria\u2019s democracy?",
          "text": "Elections are perhaps the core of democracy, a process where people have a say in who leads and how they are led. It\u2019s the point where citizens exercise their power.\n\nIn Nigeria, however, rather than exercise their power during the democratic process, Nigerians have to exhibit courage and bravery. The annulled presidential election of June 12, 1993, is widely regarded as a constant reminder of how democratic power was, and perhaps still is, stripped from the people.\n\nFor Jerry Ojumah, a blockchain developer and designer, election season in Nigeria is a time of anxiety; the focus is on surviving the process and not on the election outcome.\n\n\u201cHow can performing your civic right be an endangerment to your life?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis was a recurring question as Ojumah narrated how he lost his friend, a National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) member, during the 2011 Nigerian presidential election.\n\nThe country\u2019s 2019 general election claimed 626 lives, according to a Premium Times report.\n\nGiven the violence and conflict that characterise Nigerian elections, questioning election results isn\u2019t out of place. Unfortunately, election violence isn\u2019t the only problem plaguing Nigeria\u2019s democracy.\n\nAccording to a report by the Law Library of Congress Global Research Center, the 2007 elections observed by the National Democratic Institute reported an obscene amount of irregularities such as underage voting, ballots without names of some candidates, errors in voter registration, and inadequate polling stations.\n\nThe report also highlighted the observations of the European Union Election Observation Mission (EU EOM), which found out that the election did not meet basic regional and international standards.\n\nIt cited lack of organisation, absence of basic transparency, \u201cwidespread procedural irregularities and significant evidence of fraud.\u201d\n\nTo bring transparency and safety back to elections, perhaps a technological intervention, a process that is immutable and free of external influence, should be considered.\n\nBlockchain technology is often tied to the flagship cryptocurrency \u2014 Bitcoin. But in truth, cryptocurrencies are only an application of blockchain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlockchain is to Bitcoin what the Internet is to email. It is just the technology upon which cryptocurrencies work.\n\nAlso known as distributed ledger technology (DLT), blockchain has been considered an answer to election problems.\n\nIn a Forbes article, Frank Palermo advocated blockchain voting in the US after an alleged hack of the current voting system in 2016. He says with blockchain, hackers will need to do the impossible \u2014 hack through a network of computers.\n\nFrom ballot paper to blockchain ledger\n\nBlockchain has been used for elections in some countries, but the technology is very far from mainstream adoption.\n\nPer tech publication Hacker Noon, blockchain was used for voting in Sierra Leone, Japan, and Russia.\n\nIn Sierra Leone, the exercise was controversial as it turns out the blockchain company contracted for the job might not have used blockchain at all.\n\nThe tech was also introduced in Tsukuba City, Japan. However, it has only been used to vote for social development proposals.\n\nIt was in the US, however, that the use of blockchain began to look like a real replacement for the current system of elections.\n\nIn May 2018, according to NBC News, West Virginians living abroad were able to send their votes in for a primary election with a blockchain voting system. The news says it was a success as over 140 people voted.\n\nBlockchain is a relatively new technology. This raises the question of how people who are not familiar with the technology will use it during the elections.\n\ni-Elect is a blockchain voting platform with a use case in Nigeria created by blockchain developer and designer Jerry Ojumah. It was made for the Covenant University Alumni Association (CUALA) election.\n\nAccording to Ojumah, the platform will be easier to access than traditional voting methods, with people voting from the comfort of their homes.\n\nVoters can access the platform with a computer or Internet-enabled mobile device. All they have to do is click on their preferred candidate, and the information goes into the blockchain network.\n\nInterestingly, Ojumah adds that blockchain-powered voting will reduce the cost of running elections tremendously. The Guardian reports that \u20a6245 billion was budgeted for elections in 2019.\n\nA large portion of the budget went to logistics and security. Ojumah believes that without the need for logistics and security costs, less than a fraction of that budget would be required to conduct a blockchain-powered election.\n\nNevertheless, usability and scalability remain crucial considerations. Ojumah\u2019s response to this is; a simple user interface, available in most Nigerian languages combined with text to speech features for those who cannot read or are visually impaired.\n\n\u201cThanks to new generation blockchain networks, the platform will be able to process large amounts of data simultaneously,\u201d Ojumah says.\n\nIn cases of poor Internet coverage or lack of smartphones, Ojumah submits that Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) can be integrated.\n\nCan it work in Nigeria\u2019s political space?\n\nSegun Amure, a one-time aspirant for councilorship in one of the local governments in Osun State, believes that the government should consider anything that will keep elections free and fair.\n\n\u201cIf blockchain technology can guarantee ease of voting in elections, the safety and will of the people I think is good,\u201d Amure says.\n\nOrowale Triumph, a young politician with dreams of one day becoming president, says, \u201cIt sounds like a process that is not faulted by humans; the creator of the platform or the government cannot influence the data. I think the credibility and transparency of the technology can be vouched for, so why not?\u201d\n\nThough Triumph is sure that blockchain will change Nigeria\u2019s current political climate, he doesn\u2019t think Nigerian politicians will adopt such technology.\n\n\u201cThe entire system needs a change\u2026most politicians will stop at nothing to make sure elections go their way. In such a political situation, they will not succumb to a technology that assures free and fair elections.\u201d\n\nClamouring for electoral reform, Triumph says, \u201cThe power again lies with the masses. If they push for the electoral reform act, then there is a possibility that such a technology will be adopted to foster free and fair elections.\u201d\n\nArguments against blockchain elections\n\nA report by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), published November 2020, sees blockchain elections as a threat to democracy.\n\nClaiming that online voting would increase cybersecurity concerns, the MIT says \u201cVoatz\u201d \u2014 the platform used for elections in the 2018 West Virginia in the US \u2014 suffers from security vulnerabilities.\n\nIt also says the growing proposals for blockchain elections is borne out of the enthusiasm to improve and modernise elections.\n\nThe report also cites crypto investors\u2019 losses over the years as a reason to distrust blockchain.\n\nAccording to the report, voter verifiability and contestability are some problems blockchain cannot solve. It, therefore, called for a return to the paper balloting system as it is safer than online voting.\n\nConsidering that money can be stolen online and physically, MIT\u2019s report somewhat strangely predicts that the vulnerabilities associated with online shopping and banking will affect voting with blockchain.\n\nCould these positions and submissions result from a misunderstanding of how a blockchain-powered election works?\n\nHow a blockchain powered-election works\n\nAdedayo Adebajo is the Managing Director of Jelurida Africa, the African arm of Jelurida, the Swiss company behind the creation of Ardor, a blockchain network with smart contracts capability.\n\nAccording to Adebajo, creating a poll on the Ardor network requires all voters to have a funded Ardor account. This new generation of blockchain gives the option of KYC for users. So, various conditions can be set before a person is allowed to vote. However, voting is not free.\n\n\u201cEvery single vote is a transaction,\u201d he says.\n\nA transaction needs to be made to vote, and a voter needs at least one Ignis \u2014 a child chain of Ardor and a cryptocurrency \u2014 to vote.\n\nAlternatively, the creator of the polls could pay for everyone\u2019s vote. This means that if the federal government creates polls on the Ignis network, they could pay for everyone to vote.\n\nResponding to whether Jelurida will make money if Nigeria holds elections on its platform, Adebajo says, \u201cWe can not really say they make profit from this because it is still made free and the amount paid is merely for usability purposes.\u201d\n\nAt the time of writing this piece, one Ignis was approximately 30 cents. Voting for a population of say 150 million people will cost approximately $45 million, which translates to \u20a621.5 billion \u2014 a fraction of the \u20a6245 billion budgeted for the 2019 election.\n\nWhen it comes to the safety of this data, he reveals that in a scenario where 51% of the nodes running Ardor suffer an attack, data could be compromised.\n\nHowever, there are 2,000 Ardor nodes spread across different parts of the world, making the possibility of an attack very slim.\n\nAs a Nigerian, Adebajo feels Nigeria should adopt blockchain voting but he believes it will not happen anytime soon because \u201cthere are a lot of people who benefit from the lack of transparency and lack of digital trails\u201d in elections.\n\nAdebajo suggests that a way to adopt this system of voting is to start small. From voting within associations to voting in local government elections before getting to the national level.\n\nFor Nigerians, adopting a technological solution to solve election problems transcends a desire for ease and convenience during voting. It is perhaps the only alternative to reviving a dying democracy.\n\nNews reports give statistics of lives lost during elections in Nigeria; the pain, however, is inestimable.",

          "text": "In Africa, mental health resources are scarce, reflecting the weakness of mental health services on the continent. Also, it mirrors how governments and citizens turn a blind eye to the problem.\n\nPerhaps, that\u2019s why Ted Malanda, a Kenyan humour writer, couldn\u2019t comprehend why American actor Robin Williams \u2014 who suffered from depression \u2014 committed suicide in 2014.\n\nWriting via The Standard, Malanda describes how depression \u2014 a mental health disorder \u2014 is such a non-issue on the continent that African languages do not have a word for it.\n\nImpact of mental health disorders\n\nPhoto by Sam Moqadam on Unsplash\n\nA study shows that 13% of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) is primarily due to mental health disorders. Almost three-quarters of this burden lies in low and middle-income countries due to extremely scarce health resources and investment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMental health is an integral aspect of wellness because it reflects in daily living, relationships, physical health, work, and school productivity.\n\nA World Health Organization (WHO) fact sheet reveals that mental health disorders, otherwise known as mental health illnesses, vary and come with different presentations.\n\nThese disorders include depression, anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and other psychoses, dementia, and developmental disorders.\n\nThey are characterised by a combination of abnormal thoughts, perceptions, emotions, behaviours, and relationships with others. Therefore, mental wellness should receive as much care as physical health.\n\nGlobally, the impact of mental health illnesses on the economy is significant. The cost of productivity lost annually is approximately $1.15 trillion, while almost 4.7 billion days of productivity are lost.\n\nMayo Clinic \u2014 a US-based non-profit hospital \u2014 mentions that people will always have mental health concerns from time to time. Nonetheless, a mental health concern becomes a mental health disorder when signs and symptoms cause recurring stress and affect the ability to function.\n\nHence, protecting your mental health is essential.\n\nProtecting your mental health with technology\n\nImage by Firmbee from Pixabay\n\nThere are effective strategies to prevent and alleviate the suffering caused by mental health disorders, and technology is one of them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe use of social media can be a cause of mental health disorders like depression and anxiety. However, technology can be advantageous to someone with mental health disorders.\n\nIt has opened a new frontier of mental health support and data collection. Research shows that mobile phones and Internet-connected devices provide an opportunity to collect objective information on individuals\u2019 behaviour.\n\nThis information helps generate a data set that provides insight into an individual\u2019s mental health needs.\n\nThe University of Illinois, Chicago, encourages Internet-based support groups, telehealth, and mobile apps to protect one\u2019s mental health.\n\nMobile mental health support can be simple and effective. Globally, about 800 mobile apps help users cope with symptoms, share their stories, and meet with psychiatrists and psychotherapists.\n\nFurthermore, they provide valuable data to physicians, therapists, and health care informatics experts.\n\nInternet-based support groups help people with mental health disorders, guiding them while they reveal their struggles anonymously. And telehealth provides consultation with a health care provider via phone or video conference.\n\nHow technology is protecting mental health in Africa\n\nA study by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) shows that doctors, researchers, and the public can access help, monitor progress, and increase understanding of mental wellbeing with mobile devices like phones and tablets. In Africa, some startups and non-profit organisations already do this.\n\nWe examine two startups and one user-led community helping people with mental health disorders in Africa.\n\nShezlong\n\nFounded in 2015 by Ahmed Abu ElHaz, an Egyptian software engineer, Shezlong is a healthtech startup that offers people in the Middle East and Africa (MENA) region on-demand mental health care.\n\nIt is the first online psychotherapy clinic in the region.\n\nShezlong has a mobile app that aims to help people with mental health disorders become more confident and make better life decisions. They also offer relationship counselling.\n\nShezlong homepage\n\nThe app is used in more than 60 countries. Over 300 certified and trusted therapists and psychiatrists are conveniently, privately, and anonymously connected with people with mental disorders in MENA.\n\nTruthshare\n\nTruthshare is an online mental health application that helps people get counselling. It was co-founded in 2019 by two Nigerians: Kuro Briggs and Fortune Bekee.\n\nTruthshare homepage\n\nThe online app aims to improve the mental health of Nigerians. It leverages the Internet to provide a safe place where people can express themselves anonymously, get access to certified counsellors, and feel better.\n\nMoreover, the public can offer advice to people struggling with their mental health.\n\nMentally Aware Nigeria Initiative (MANI)\n\nMANI is a user-led community that uses social media platforms to reach its audience.\n\nFounded in 2016 by Victor Ugo, MANI is based on two core beliefs: to alleviate the stigma and suffering which arises from mental disorders and to know that people who have mental health disorders have a right to life and assistance.\n\nMANI attempts to fight stigma, improve mental health literacy, and drive policies that benefit mental health service users and those at risk.\n\nIt also engages in activities and services that promote and prevent mental health issues.\n\nWhen asked how MANI has helped people with mental health disorders, Max, a writer, told Techpoint Africa, \u201cWhen I was depressed last year, Mentally Aware Nigeria helped me get better. They assigned someone \u2014 who should be a counsellor \u2014 to me. They followed me up on WhatsApp until I started feeling better. That worked for me.\u201d\n\nTechnology has made mental health care affordable and convenient. And anyone with a mental illness can get care anywhere. The use of mobile apps and online platforms offer users the option of anonymity, helping them avoid stigmatisation as they share their stories.\n\nIn recognition of Global Wellness Day, we want you to take care of your mental health as much as you do your physical health. If social media is a source of depression or anxiety for you, you could take a break and take advantage of the Internet.\n\nWe care about your mental health and hope you get the help you need.\n\nHappy Global Wellness Day.",

          "text": "Good day,\n\nVictoria here.\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing\n\nIncrease in fintech app installations\n\nApple Health features for the elderly\n\nPlentywaka partners with GUO\n\nIncrease in fintech app installations in Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya\n\nThe global fintech industry recorded impressive growth in 2020. This is according to the State of Finance App Marketing 2021 report by US-based mobile marketing analytics company, AppsFlyer. The report reveals that beyond funding, fintech app installations grew by160% in the last quarter of 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Nigeria alone, loan app installations grew by 43.3%; financial services grew by 34.6%, and investment apps by 20.3%.\n\nSimilarly, Kenya saw 100% growth, and South Africa 52% growth, in fintech app installations.\n\nWhy this growth? The economic effects of COVID-19 led to the rise in fintech app installations.\n\nBesides, in Nigeria, about 56% of the population is unbanked. Also, the unfavourable regulatory conditions could have prompted some of them to make use of loan apps while they explored other financial services.\n\nInterestingly, the fintech space recorded a significant boom in marketing investment. Over 150 Nigerian fintech startups reportedly generate annual revenues of over $5 million.\n\nTo read more on the state of fintech apps, click here.\n\nApple introduces new iPhone features for the elderly\n\nApple, at its World wide developer conference (WWDC) event, announced new features for iOS 15 on the iPhone. The event which started on Monday, June 7 will end today, Friday, June 11.\n\nThoughtfully, among the new features, Apple introduced two health-focused ones \u2014 Walking Steadiness and ability to share health data with family members \u2014 for the elderly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy these features? Older people are prone to falling, and it is the major cause of accidents, injury, and death for older people.\n\nHow does it work? The feature intends to track people as they move through their daily lives.\n\nNot to be confused with fall detection on the Apple Watch, which prompts users to call emergency services, Apple says Walking Steadiness is different, as it focuses on prediction rather than response.\n\nThat is, it is able to predict your risk of falling, using metrics like walking speed, step length, and the time both feet are in contact with the ground.\n\nWhile this may seem exciting, I doubt its ability to help everyone, as walking patterns differ. Moreover, it is only effective if users carry their phones around at all times; some don\u2019t.\n\nStill, it\u2019s good to know Apple does not just target only the young, but the elderly too.\n\nWalking Steadiness will be available for everyone who has an iPhone 6s and above.\n\nPlentywaka partners GUO to expand inter-state\n\nPlentyWaka bus. Source: PlentyWaka Twitter\n\nPlentywaka, a Nigerian bus-hailing tech company, has announced its partnership with interstate bus company, GUO Transport, to expand its reach.\n\nThis will lead to the opening of new routes on Plentywaka\u2019s inter-state offshoot, Travelwaka. About 200 routes are expected to be launched. Plentywaka will onboard 600 new buses from GUO, bringing total buses on the platform to 850.\n\nThis partnership is mutually beneficial because GUO doesn\u2019t have to build and maintain proprietary tech for commuters to find them online. Plentywaka, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t need to buy buses to expand inter-state.\n\nThe end goal of PlentyWaka is to give its users an easy way to compare their choices from a range of travel companies. So perhaps we can expect it to onboard more inter-state bus companies in the near future.\n\nSounds familiar? You might remember Oya.com.ng, the bus ticketing website that was acquired by Wakanow in 2015, barely 2 years into operation.

We want to see that the right things are done in the league. This is the third time I understand Bendel Insurance players have been injured.\u201d\n\nThe governor said his administration will take legal action against Remo Football Club for the dastardly act, adding, \u201cWe have to take legal action against those that perpetrated this act.

          "title": "Inside Story: How gunmen attacked Igangan, killed many",
          "text": "Lateef Adeniyi was sleeping in his room late on Saturday night, June 5, when he heard the sound of gunshots.\n\nAs the head of the Vigilante Group in Igangan community, he hurriedly stood from his bed and fetched his gun.\n\nHis family members wished him well as he stepped out of the house.\n\nIt was the last time they saw him.\n\n\u201cMy husband went out, as usual, to protect the community from external attack when the Fulani\u2019s invaded Igangan late Saturday night. By Sunday morning, we woke up to receive his remains,\u201d Fatima Adeniyi, wife of the deceased, told our correspondent.\n\nMr Adeniyi left behind two wives and eight children.\n\nThe immediate elder brother of the deceased, Waheed Adeniyi, said: \u201cmy sibling spent his life defending the community from attack. He died because he didn\u2019t have enough bullets to defend himself when the invaders came on Saturday night.\n\n\u201cHe was shot repeatedly before he was later hacked to death by Fulani herdsmen. I was called by community leaders on Sunday morning to receive his remains.\u201d\n\nMr Adeniyi\u2019s first child, Nureni, urged the government and other well-meaning Nigerians to support him and his siblings in order not to allow their father to die in vain.\n\nThe bloody attack\n\nResidents said the attack on Igangan community in Ibarapa area of Oyo State commenced at about midnight, leaving several persons dead and properties razed.\n\nResidents who survived the attack told PREMIUM TIMES the assailants were Fulani herders, believed to be carrying out a reprisal.\n\nThis newspaper reported how Fulani families and their leader, Abdulkadir Salihu, were forcefully evicted from the town in January by a mob led by a self-styled warlord, Sunday Adeyemo, popularly known as Sunday Igboho.\n\nMr Salihu, the Sarkin Fulani, was accused of masterminding Fulani attacks such as rape, murder, destruction of farms, and abductions in Igangan.\n\nAlthough Mr Salihu denied the allegations, that didn\u2019t save him from being ejected from a community he had lived in for decades.\n\nThe federal and Oyo State governments frowned at the development, saying no citizen has the right to evict other citizens from wherever they wished to reside in the country.\n\nA resident and youth leader in the community, Oladiran Oladokun, told PREMIUM TIMES that a son of Mr Salihu, Umar, had repeatedly sent him messages threatening that the Fulani would retaliate for how they were attacked and forced out of Igangan.\n\nMany residents also told PREMIUM TIMES on Monday that Mr Salihu\u2019s son was seen among those who attacked the community last weekend. Our correspondent could not independently verify this claim.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMr Salihu did not also respond to PREMIUM TIMES calls and text messages asking if he had knowledge about the weekend incident.\n\nWhile the police said 11 people died in the attack, residents told our correspondent that over 20 people were killed.\n\nSad tales\n\nOur correspondent visited Igangan last Monday to capture the sorrowful tales of the attack. This newspaper also met with families of some persons who died in the attack.\n\nPREMIUM TIMES also visited some of their burial grounds.\n\nFindings revealed that most of the people killed were either vigilante group members or Oodua Peoples Congress (OPC) who went out to defend the community after hearing gunshots.\n\nJimoh Ogunlana, a school security guard, was said to be sleeping in the veranda of his house when he heard gunshots and observed looting of some nearby shops.\n\n\u201cHe tried confronting them but all he got in response was a gunshot to his chest. He ran immediately for survival but he was caught halfway and hacked to death,\u201d Oyebisi Bowonle, a cousin of the deceased, said.\n\nMr Ogunlana\u2019s daughter, Nafisat, told PREMIUM TIMES that \u201cher father was not a troublemaker. He only attempted to save the shops that were being attacked by Fulani when he was killed.\u201d\n\nBashiru Makinde, an senior citizen in the community, told PREMIUM TIMES that he lost two individuals who were very close to him in the \u2018reprisal attack.\u2019\n\n\u201cAfter hearing a series of gunshots repeatedly, we observed flame in different places and at that point, we became scared knowing fully well that some houses were being burnt.\n\n\u201cWe heard people wailing and the Fulani guys were shooting sporadically. My sister, Rabi Raji was scared because she was not sure of her son\u2019s whereabouts. Immediately she stepped out of the house to look for her gun, she was hit by a stray bullet and that ended her journey on earth.\u201d\n\nMr Makinde told this newspaper that he also lost the son of a family friend called Ibrahim Adeagbo to the attack.\n\nHe said Mr Adeagbo was a member of the Amotekun Corps in the community. He joined his other colleagues to combat the invaders but died in the process.\n\n\u201cIbrahim Adeagbo was hacked on his head and his stomach,\u201d Mr Makinde said.\n\nAnother resident, Wale Ayoola, also told PREMIUM TIMES that he lost his father to the attack. The deceased was shot repeatedly and also hacked.\n\nMr Ayoola said his father attempted to run for survival but the attackers overpowered him. He said he found his father\u2019s body parts scattered at different locations. He picked them up and buried him on Sunday morning\n\nResidents told PREMIUM TIMES that the late arrival of the police made the community record a high number of casualties. The state police spokesperson, Adewale Osifeso, did not respond to inquiries when our correspondent tried to confront him with this.\n\nHe did not respond to calls and text messages sent to him on the topic.\n\nAttack on king\u2019s palace\n\nPREMIUM TIMES also visited the palace of the monarch set ablaze by the attackers. The Asigangan of Igangan land, Lasisi Adeoye, was moved to tears when our correspondent asked him questions about the incident.\n\nHe directed this newspaper to his wife, Sinat Adeoye, who explained that \u201cthey (Fulanis) targeted the palace because they claimed Sunday Igboho and boys razed Sarkin Fulani palace earlier this year. They stole people\u2019s belongings and burnt different shops and houses during the raid.\n\n\u201cSome of the shop owners that were affected are now in the hospital because they are already in debt. They killed no fewer than eight vigilantes who tried to confront them during the attack.\n\n\u201cTwo of my brothers who were vigilante members were among those that died in the incident. Some of our people confirmed that they saw Sarkin Fulani\u2019s son among those who came to attack us in the midnight\n\n\u201cBut the truth was that we never evicted these people if not for the criminalities they were perpetrating. They were kidnapping our people and asking for ransom not affordable. We need the government to help us. We are dying.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, Kamarudeen Omoloye, the spokesperson of the monarch, told PREMIUM TIMES that upon their arrival, the attackers \u201cdared them to call Sunday Igboho for rescue if they were bold enough.\n\n\u201cThey carried out the deadly operations for more than four hours but security operatives didn\u2019t come enough. It took the effort of local vigilantes in the community and some OPC members who confronted them to rescue the community from being ruined.\n\n\u201cThe police are claiming 11 deaths but truth be told, over 20 people were killed in the midnight attack. We plead with authorities to help us with security operatives who aren\u2019t biased to any tribe so that peace would reign.\u201d\n\nResidents of the community told PREMIUM TIMES that at least six of the attackers were also killed during the attack.\n\nThe attack has been condemned by many Nigerians including Yoruba leaders like the Alaafin of Oyo, Lamidi Adeyemi and the Ooni of Ife, Adeyeye Ogunwusi.\n\nMakinde, APC spar over attack\n\nReacting to the killing, the main opposition party in Oyo State, APC, called on Governor Seyi Makinde to convene a security summit promptly to address security challenges in the state.\n\nThis was contained in a statement signed by its spokesman, AbdulAzeez Olatunde.\n\n\u201cObviously and certainly, the current situation of Oyo State was not what Makinde and PDP took over from the immediate past APC government in the state under Governor Abiola Ajimobi in 2019.\n\n\u201cThe excuse of general security issues has been with us in Nigeria since 2009 even before Ajimobi took over the mantle of governance in 2011. In spite of the issues, Ajimobi secured Oyo state,\u201d it said.\n\nIn response to this, Mr Makinde in a statement by his spokesperson, Taiwo Adisa, accused APC of attempting to politicise the killings in Igangan.\n\n\u201cWe all know the state of security of Nigeria when the APC took over in 2015. We knew that the much-talked-about insurgency was restricted to three states of the North East, while kidnapping was wiped out from the South East.\n\n\u201cEven though the leadership of APC complained loudest against the government of President Goodluck Jonathan at the time, the situation Nigeria found itself under President Buhari\u2019s APC is nothing comparable to the sanity we all enjoyed under Jonathan.\n\n\u201cIt is obvious the APC was merely in a power grab mission, without a clue of what is needed to fix Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, insecurity has been weaponized and decentralised, while all parts of the country have become endangered. Even the President\u2019s own state of Katsina is not spared as the sad incidents of kidnapping and killings continue to happen even during his official visits to the state.\n\n\u201cIf the APC leaders want to be patriotic, they will call on the leader of their party, President Buhari, to wake up and stop the unwarranted killings across the land: the kidnapping of school children and other innocent Nigerians and fix the economy,\u201d Mr Makinde\u2019s spokesperson said.\n\nSouthwest governors move to prevent recurrence\n\nThe governors of the six South-west states of Nigeria condemned the killings in Igangan community and also said a joint security meeting will be held to review the security situation in the South-west.\n\n\u201cIt is horrendous, callous, and highly provocative. All well-meaning Nigerians must condemn, in the strongest term possible, this latest assault on decency and communal harmony,\u201d Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State said on behalf of his colleagues.\n\n\u201cWhile we will encourage the security agencies to get to the root of this latest act of provocation, we have directed the Commanders of the South West Security Network, Amotekun, to convene a joint security meeting of all Commanders in the South West with a view to commencing joint operations in the region immediately.\u201d\n\nHe said \u201ccertain elements are bent on causing friction among the peoples of this country with the sole aim of achieving a pernicious end. They will stop at nothing until their set goal is realized. It is, therefore, incumbent on all lovers of peace and freedom to rise against this current regression into savagery.\n\n\u201cWe on our part are resolved to defend our people, their property, and all legitimate means of livelihood against both internal and external aggression. On this, there will be no compromise. We call on our people to remain vigilant and report any suspicious movement in their communities. In addition, they must be united in the task of defending our lives and properties. We cannot afford to fail,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "BY EMEKA EJERE\n\nIn furtherance of its commitment to promoting gender equality and women empowerment, leading financial services provider, Access Bank Plc is empowering women in the workplace through the Access Women Network (AWN).\n\nAWN, one of the largest female networks in Nigeria with members across 12 African countries, is one of the three-pronged approaches the lender is using to promote gender equality and women\u2019s economic empowerment.\n\nWomen empowerment is a key component of Nigeria\u2019s socio-economic growth. Little wonder the government and many other agencies are undertaking measures to further improve the situation through various policies focused on social reforms and generating employment opportunities.\n\nWith a history of taking gender equality and women empowerment seriously, Access Bank goes beyond just celebrating women on International Women\u2019s Day, to empowering them through three-pronged approach: \u2013 Women in the workplace, Women in the marketplace, and Women in the community.\n\nAccording to the bank, the network was established to support, develop, empower, promote and retain female employees in Access Bank. Among other things, AWN provides an avenue for women to network and build relationships for career advancement. It also fosters collaborative thinking for the Access woman alongside colleagues across the industry and other sectors.\n\nIn addition, it provides a platform for women to gain inspiration and learning from role models via mentorship programmes and deal well with job stressors.\n\nAccess Bank in a document said, \u201cThe product provides women with learning and development tools and techniques, insight and advice for personal development and leadership roles, recognizes amazing talents, achievements, diversity and contribution of women in business and strengthens gender diversity across sectors.\u201d\n\nThe bank said AWN has increased its efforts to ensure that women across the Access Bank Group are actively engaged in community focused programmes, lending their skills and resources to support the less privileged over the years.\n\n\u201cFor instance, AWN has implemented various initiatives including project \u2018Make a Family Happy\u2019, which raised funds to feed 500 families in the face of COVID-19 pandemic and Free Breast Cancer Screening for AWN Members at selected locations.\n\n\u201cAnother initiative implemented through AWN is Zaron Virtual Experience with AWN, free online makeup training, and the ongoing partnership with Genesis House to support vulnerable young women who have been sexually abused, exploited and trafficked.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, AWN has organised various webinars, seminars and workshops aimed at empowering women and also has the very active AWN Toastmasters Club.\u201d\n\n\u2018W\u2019 Initiative\n\nIn 2006, Access Bank began a journey into the world of women and Banking on Women, pioneering women banking in Nigeria with the establishment of its Gender Empowerment Movement (GEM). It has since then continued to demonstrate its commitment to gender empowerment, receiving $15 million credit line from International Finance Corporation (IFC) for its Gender Empowerment Programme.\n\nAfter working through the GEM to invest in women for eight years, the programme evolved into a robust plan to provide women with banking solutions that meet their diverse career and lifestyle requirements in 2014 and was named the \u2018W\u2019 Initiative.\n\nThe \u2018W\u2019 initiative remains the home of everything Access Bank has to offer women. It has also helped to solidify Access Bank\u2019s position as the bank of choice for women in the markets and communities. In furtherance of its commitment to women economic empowerment through the \u2018W\u2019 initiative, it deployed programmes such as: W Academy, \u2018W\u2019 Community (The W Community is made up of the Young Professional, \u2018W\u2019 in Business and W & Family).\n\n\u201cAccess Bank has been a leading advocate for women\u2019s economic empowerment in Nigeria and this is the key motivation for the \u2018W\u2019 Initiative which caters to the women economy particularly in the areas of capacity building and creating networking opportunities for women\u201d. Ayona Trimnell, Group Head, \u2018W\u2019 Initiative, said,\n\nFor its series of empowerment initiatives for women and the considerable impact, the bank has won numerous awards which include: Africa CEO Forum \u2013 Gender Leader Award (2019), FAW \u2013 Women Market Champion Award (2019), Women\u2019s Choice Africa \u2013 Bank of the Year Award (2019), Nigeria Finance Innovation \u2013 Best Bank in Women Empowerment Award (2019), and Women in Marketing and Communications \u2013 Female Friendly Bank of the Year Award (2018&2019).\n\nOther notable awards are: National Council for Women Society Nigeria \u2013 Dedication to Women Entrepreneurship Award (2018 &2019), National Women in Finance Magazine \u2013 Outstanding Banking Initiative Awards (2018), Global Banking Alliance (GBA) \u2013 Women\u2019s Market Champion Award (2018), and CBN \u2013 Excellence in Women Economic Empowerment Award (2017, 2018& 2019).",

          "text": "BEDC Electricity Plc (BEDC) has urged relevant state ministries for Lands, Surveys, Environment and Public Utilities to identify, mark and demolish illegal structures/shops/buildings that violate the Right of Way (RoW) of power lines in public interest.\n\nBEDC Safety Manager, Mr. Gilbert Nweke, made this known recently in Benin, Edo State while presenting a paper on: \u201cViolation of Right of Way of Power Lines and Vandalism of Power Infrastructure\u201d at the World Environment Day organised by Independent Radio and Television (ITV), Benin, in partnership with Frontline Energy and Environmental Consultancy Services (FEECS).\n\nThe company also affirmed its readiness to partner with the four state governments under its franchise, namely: Delta, Edo, Ekiti and Ondo, and appealed to them to ensure that all relevant laws in respect of the RoW of power lines are activated by their law enforcement agents to tackle the menace.\n\n\u2018In line with NEMSA directive, customers that violate the right of way of power lines can be disconnected while distribution companies should not extend electricity supply to prospective customers whose buildings/structures/businesses violate the right of way of power lines,\u201d Nweke said.\n\nAccording to him, issuing letters of notifications of violation of RoW of power lines to identified defaulters and following up with the disconnection of supply would serve as a deterrent to others. He added that deployment of social media platforms, use of print and electronic media to create widespread public safety awareness against trading or building illegal structures under power lines could also be helpful.\n\nSpeaking on measures to curb vandalism of power infrastructure, Nweke called for the arrest and prosecution of all vandals and those who receive stolen items from them.\n\nHe advised that vandals of cable and other electrical accessories arrested by the Police should be paraded on television and other means of communications to also serve as a deterrent to others. He said BEDC has commenced fencing of its distribution substations with see-through materials for easy sighting of any suspicious movement around its installations.\n\nHe listed challenges confronting BEDC on the RoW of power lines to include illegal connections and reconnections, vandalism of power infrastructure, meter by-pass/energy theft, illegal activities of roadside electricians on the network and hanging of wires.\n\nOthers are unprofessional electrical wiring of houses, no earthing, trespass/illegal tampering with power equipment/installation, stringing of wires on top of iron roofing sheets of neighbours, hanging of clothes on electric wire/cable and use of aluminium ladder for illegal connections and reconnections.\n\nSome of the actions taken by BEDC according to Nweke to address RoW issues include mounting signages to warn people and advertising agents to desist from building/trading under power lines, disconnection of customers who violate the RoW of power lines in line with the Nigeria Electricity Management Services (NEMSA) directive and partnering with state governments of Delta, Edo, Ekiti and Ondo on identifying and demolishing of illegal structures under power lines.\n\nThe Safety Manager said BEDC has commenced the fencing of its distribution substations and outdoor installations with transparent wire gauze fences that can hinder easy access to vandals. The company is also partnering with safety institutions such as World Safety Organisation (WSO) and Institute of Safety Professionals of Nigeria (ISPON) to sensitise the public against vandalism of power infrastructure.\n\nAt the event, BEDC was honoured with a Merit Award of Excellence for its valuable contribution to environmental safety by the organisers.",

          "text": "Israel\u2019s Parliament, the Knesset, on Sunday, approved its new government and a new prime minister for the first time in 12 years, in a razor-thin 60-59 vote.\n\nThe vote, ringing in the leadership of a very diverse and cobbled-together coalition of right-wing, left-wing, centrist and Islamist parties, ousted Israel\u2019s longest-serving leader Benjamin Netanyahu. It also spared Israel from the prospect of a fifth election in less than two years, according CNBC.\n\nNow, after putting up a fight and trying several political options to remain in power, Netanyahu will move aside and Israeli tech millionaire and lawmaker Naftali Bennett, who many describe as more right-wing than his predecessor, will take the premiership.\n\nSunday\u2019s Knesset vote was marred by chaos and jeering, as some right-wing lawmakers including those from Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party hurled insults at Bennett, calling him a \u201ctraitor\u201d and a \u201cliar\u201d for allying with leftist and Arab parties. At least four politicians were kicked out of the session by the speaker, Yariv Levin.\n\nBennett, formerly an aide to Netanyahu, continued his pre-vote speech amid the heckling, praising Netanyahu as having \u201cworked hard and faithfully for the state of Israel.\u201d But he also pressed on the need for new leadership.\n\n\u201cWe stopped the train before the abyss,\u201d Mr. Bennett said. \u201cThe time has come for different leaders, from all parts of the people, to stop, to stop this madness.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, U.S. President Joe Biden congratulated Bennett and other leaders of the new government and cabinet.\n\n\u201cI look forward to working with Prime Minister Bennett to strengthen all aspects of the close and enduring relationship between our two nations. Israel has no better friend than the United States. The bond that unites our people is evidence of our shared values and decades of close cooperation and as we continue to strengthen our partnership, the United States remains unwavering in its support for Israel\u2019s security.\u201d\n\n\u2018We\u2019ll be back soon\u2019\n\nThe right-wing 71-year-old\u2019s leadership, in its 12th year, has been a lightning rod and a longtime dividing line in Israeli society. One Israel expert told CNBC that the country\u2019s last election in March \u2014 its fourth in less than two years due to the complex and polarized nature of Israeli politics \u2014 really came down to whether the country wanted \u201cBibi or no Bibi,\u201d using the outgoing prime minister\u2019s popular nickname.\n\nAddressing the Knesset in English, acknowledging his party\u2019s shift into the opposition, Netanyahu said: \u201cWe\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we have to be in opposition, we will do this standing tall \u2014 until we bring down this dangerous government and return to lead the state,\u201d he said in a defiant address, saying that he spoke for millions of Israelis who voted for him.\n\nHe also slammed legislation proposed by the new government that would limit a prime minister\u2019s term to eight years, four years less than his reign.\n\nNetanyahu himself is facing several charges of corruption, which he denies. He had been examining ways to avoid prosecution, which would have been much easier had he remained in power. Meanwhile, he can still remain the leader of the Likud party.\n\nThe outgoing prime minister drew international criticism and attention for his heavy-handed military action against Gaza in May, during which Israeli airstrikes killed more than 250 Palestinians, including 66 children, in response to rocket volleys from Hamas that killed 12 in Israel over the course of the fighting.\n\nChallenges ahead\n\nThe new coalition now taking power has been led by the centrist lawmaker Yair Lapid, a former TV anchor and one-time finance minister and head of the Yesh Atid party, and his unlikely governing partner Naftali Bennett, who leads the minority party Yamina.\n\nIt\u2019s highly unusual for the leader of a minority party to become prime minister, but that\u2019s what was necessary for Bennett to join Lapid\u2019s coalition \u2014 and his alliance with Lapid was the only way the coalition would gain enough party seats in the Knesset to have a majority.\n\nSo the arrangement for Lapid and Bennett rests on the agreement that Bennett becomes prime minister, with the centrist Lapid as foreign minister, until 2023. At that point, if the alliance of parties survives, Lapid will take over the premiership.\n\nIt\u2019s also the first time in Israeli history that its government includes an Arab party, which will aim to represent the country\u2019s 21% Arab minority.\n\nThe government is expected to focus on social and economic issues that are more likely to foster consensus among its varied members than divisive ones like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and Palestinian statehood.\n\nBut serious challenges lie ahead. The fragile coalition between Lapid and Bennett, and the parties whose support they had to secure to achieve the magic number of a 61-seat majority in the Knesset is a risk to itself, analysts say. The only thing seemingly holding it together is a common desire to unseat Netanyahu. But because of its incredibly slim majority of 61 seats in the 120-person parliament, all it would take is one defection for the government to collapse.\n\nAnd given the sometimes extreme divergence in views among the parties within it, particularly between Israel\u2019s right-wing and Islamist politicians, this risk of gridlock and collapse remains a constant threat.\n\nCNBC",
          "summary": "Israel\u2019s Parliament, the Knesset, on Sunday, approved its new government and a new prime minister for the first time in 12 years, in a razor-thin 60-59 vote.\nIt also spared Israel from the prospect of a fifth election in less than two years, according CNBC.\n\u201cI look forward to working with Prime Minister Bennett to strengthen all aspects of the close and enduring relationship between our two nations.\nSo the arrangement for Lapid and Bennett rests on the agreement that Bennett becomes prime minister, with the centrist Lapid as foreign minister, until 2023.\nAt that point, if the alliance of parties survives, Lapid will take over the premiership.",

          "title": "Fees Hike: No Student Will Drop Out Of KASU \u2013 VC",
          "text": "Last Tuesday, the Registrar of Kaduna State University issued a special notice, saying that the school has been closed for undergraduate studies but that post graduate students are excluded from the directive. What is the reason for the closure?\n\nAdvertisements\n\n\n\n\n\nActually, you know that we have been having challenges with a group of students who have been protesting the increase in school fees of the institution and we have met severally with them to find a common ground to avoid confrontation. But unfortunately, some of the students went on rampage and the situation was about to escalate. That is why we issued the memo for the closure of the university for undergraduate students.\n\nBut are you not concerned that this may disrupt academic activities, seeing that we are just recovering from Covid-19 pandemic which resulted in the closure of schools last year?\n\nActually, it is of great concern to us; however, security of property of the university and the safety of the citizens of Kaduna state are of greater concern to us than the academic calendar. Some hoodlums have apparently infiltrated the protest and they are trying to hijack the peaceful protest that students have been staging over the increase in tuition fees. They wanted to escalate it. We have had so many instances where the students saw strange faces amongst them during the protests. Even this morning (Wednesday, 9th June), we saw some people throwing stones into the university. My students won\u2019t do that. I\u2019m assuring you, students cannot throw stones into the university. So, definitely some people are out there, trying to hijack the situation for their own selfish interests and that is what we tried to avoid, by closing the university indefinitely for now.\n\nBut as a school management, have you sat down with the representatives of the students to explain to them how they can access scholarship through the state government?\n\nYes, we have met with representatives of students at various levels. Apart from the window of funding that is available at the Kaduna State Scholarship and Loans Board, we are exploring other avenues. As I\u2019m talking to you, there are donations that have been given to the university and students can just apply. We will screen them and give funds to successful candidates to fund their education. Apart from that, there are some Local Government Councils that have indicated interest to support the students and we have also sat with representatives of students at various levels. Political office holders like senators, House of Representatives members and members of the House of Assembly are willing to also support the students that cannot meet up with the new fees. There are associations even within the university that are willing to help indigent students. Majilis Cooperative Society and KASU Sports Development are some of the associations within the university that have indicated interest to help needy students. Major Hamza Youth Empowerment Foundation has also shown interest. Alhaji Adamu Foundation wants to sponsor female students. All these are avenues that we will continue to explore, to support the students to meet up with the new fees regime.\n\nWhat I assure the students is that, we will not expel any student for his or her inability to pay the school fees. Payment of school fees is not the problem of the students, it is now our problem and we are willing to support any student that cannot afford the fees, by creating avenues for support. I\u2019m appealing to the students not to let other people to hijack their protests, or engage in actions that will further disrupt the academic calendar. If the university is closed, it is to their disadvantage. Let them come, so that we can work together to find a lasting solution to the issue.\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that since the establishment of the university in 2005 till date, there hasn\u2019t been any increase in school fees and that has created a funding gap. The usual support that the university has been receiving, is being hindered because of the current economic situation of the country. In fact, the overhead that we have been receiving has been decreasing by the year. For example, KASU got N520 million in 2019. Last year, we got N420 million and this year, only N40 million has been ear marked for us. So, even with the increase in school fees, the university will still barely meet its financial requirements. Running a university is very expensive.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut if the school fees had been gradually increased over the years, I think the resistance and protest wouldn\u2019t have occurred. So, I\u2019m appealing to the students to please take things calmly and let us sit down and reach a common ground. Those that cannot afford the new fees, let us know them and then let us see how we can create funding avenues for them.\n\nLet\u2019s get this clear. You said students will not drop out of school because of their inability to pay the new fees. Is this window strictly for continuing students or are new students also included in the arrangement?\n\nYes, all the arrangements are actually for students who are already on campus. We have not made arrangement for the new students because we don\u2019t even know them because they have not even reported. The students population we are talking about are those that are already on campus.\n\nAre the senators, House Representatives Members, House of Assembly Members and the Local Government Councils that have indicated interest in supporting students, thinking of supporting students of their various constituencies or indigent students generally?\n\nLike I said earlier, we have different groups that are indicating interest to support the students. The arrangement from the various local governments chairmen and the legislators is actually to support students from their constituencies but on the other hand, we also have Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) that have indicated interest to help students who cannot meet up with the payment of the new tuition fees. And we have cooperatives within the university that have also indicated interest to support. But their own support will not be limited to students from a particular local government but for all the students. However, benefitting students will have to meet certain criteria, like being the best student in certain courses. Some have indicated desire to support female students so as to encourage girl-child education. Others want to support vulnerable students that cannot afford the fees. So, we have different groups with different reasons for wanting to sponsor different categories of students.\n\nTo what extent have you reached out to the Organized Private Sector for funding certain courses or programmes in the university generally?\n\nWhat we have done is actually to set up a committee. Right now, we have a challenge and our concern is how to solve this challenge. Unfortunately, the students have not cooperated to enable us know who and who have the challenge of payment of the new fees, so that we can even know our target population and the quantum of what they need in financial terms. Certainly, if we know that, we will approach various organizations, both private and public, to get the problem partly solved.\n\nThe increase in school fees was done across board in all the state-owned tertiary institutions, but it is rather curious that KASU is the only school that is leading the protest against fees hike. Will you say that the protest is as a result of failure of communication?\n\nNo not at all. We have a student population of about 20,000 and our school is a city campus. Kafanchan is far away, Zaria is also far away; so with the population and the seat of power within Kaduna, the students will think that they can easily reach government to influence the decision. So, maybe the protest has to do with the closeness to the seat of power\n\nNow that undergraduate students are at home, is there any platform for continuous engagements with them in order to reach a consensus on the increase in tuition fees?\n\nWe have just concluded arrangements to have a zoom meeting with all the students. All the students and not their representatives this time around; anyone can log in and join the meeting. Some of the students\u2019 leaders said they don\u2019t have control over the entire students, so we are extending the coverage to include all the students, most especially those that are protesting in the streets, who are just about 200. So, we are trying to see that we engage them and also hear from them to know what their challenges are.\n\nThe Executive Secretary of Kaduna State Scholarship and Loans Board had indicated interest to meet the students, in order to sell some of the board\u2019s packages to them; the options available for funding student education. Are you thinking of having a platform where the students will engage with him?\n\nYes, we have already arranged a meeting with the representative of Association of Local Governments of Nigeria (ALGON), the Executive Secretary of the Scholarship and Loans Board and the representatives of the NGOs. The platform will enable us sit together and explain to the students what and what we have as an arrangement to pay the school fees for those who will not be able to pay.\n\nKAD Facts:\n\n-No student of Kaduna State University (KASU) will drop out of school because of non payment of school fees;\n\n-The school authorities are working with several organisations to devise a funding arrangement for indigent students;\n\n-Already, Kaduna State Scholarship and Loans Board offers scholarship to students whose parents cannot afford school fees, and outstanding students, under the Need-based and Merit-based scholarship schemes respectively;\n\n-In addition, students can take out loans to fund their education but will repay later. There is a N2 billion fund at FCMB to fund this scheme;\n\n-NGOs and KASU-based Cooperative Societies have indicated interest to fund some category of students, using their own criteria;\n\n-Political office holders and Local Government Councils intend to sponsor their constituents who are students of KASU;\n\n-KASU will convene a meeting will all stakeholders, including students, NGOs, Cooperative Societies and representatives of Kaduna State Scholarship and Loans Board, to iron out all contending issues;\n\n-The management of the school intends to reach out to the Organised Private Sector with a view to funding certain courses and programmes;\n\n-Even with the increase in school fees, the state government cannot solely fund the university because of dwindling resources;\n\n-In 2019, KASU got N520 million as overhead cost but last year, N420 million was given to it. This year, only N40 million was earmarked for the school.",

          "text": "Governor Nasir El-Rufai has said that tackling insecurity requires cooperation of the various states and security managers as well as intelligence agencies sharing information.\n\nAdvertisements\n\n\n\n\n\nEl-Rufai further noted that any plan that seeks to address the problem only in one state will at best yield a temporary respite as the criminals will retreat to safe havens.\n\nThe governor made this known at the second quarter 2021 meeting of the Directors of the State Commands of the Directorate of State Security (DSS) in the North West.\n\n\u2018\u2019The security agencies need to strengthen intelligence gathering, to establish not just the identities, plans and locations of these criminals, but to actively disrupt their capacity to organise and mount attacks on our citizens.\n\n\u2018\u2019But it is also very important to ensure that prompt and coordinated action become the default response of the Armed Forces and the Police to the profusion of actionable intelligence that is already available,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nEl-Rufai said that the governors of the North west states and Niger state appreciated the salient importance of inter-state cooperation as far back as 2015.\n\n\u2018\u2019They came together to fund simultaneous operations by the federal military and security agencies across the largely ungoverned Kamuku-Kuyambana forest swathes that straddle about seven of our states up to Dajin Rugu.\n\n\u2018\u2019These operations disrupted the cattle rustling gangs, but were unfortunately not sustained as a continuous exercise to dominate these spaces and assert within them the authority of the Nigerian state,\u2019\u2019 he recalled.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to the governor, the criminal gangs have become more daring and dangerous since recovering from their near defeat in 2015 is obvious across the country.\n\n\u2018\u2019As the lead agency for domestic intelligence and counter-intelligence, the DSS has a vital role to play in providing the reliable information needed by the Police and Armed Forces for the total defeat of these dangerous insurgents,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nEl-Rufai warned that there is a looming food crisis in the country because \u2018\u2019farmers in various communities are unable to go to their farms, that is when they are lucky not to have fled their remote villages under pressure from the criminals.\u2019\u2019\n\nEarlier, the Kaduna State Director of State Security Service, Mr Idris Ahmed Koya, commended the state government for \u2018\u2019 its untiring and unwavering support to this command in various ways.\u2019\u2019\n\nAccording to him, the relocation to their new office complex could not have been possible but for the support of the state government that provided the furniture and other accessories.\n\n\u2018\u2019Similarly, all our successful operations are made possible and easy through the requisite working tools provided by the state government. The IMSI Grabber is one of such tools,\u2019\u2019 he disclosed.\n\nMr Koya pleaded with Governor El-Rufai to help the service with operational vehicles to enable DSS personnel in carrying out operations outside the command\u2019s immediate environment.\n\nThe state Director noted that \u2018\u2019the current efforts by the state government to establish a drone centre for intelligence gathering and support of other security operations is highly commendable.\u2019\u2019\n\nKoya expressed optimism that the centre will be a game changer in tackling insecurity not only in Kaduna state but the North-west and even North-central zones when it becomes operational.\n\nSpeaking at the event, the Commissioner of Internal Security and Home Affairs, Mr Samuel Aruwan noted that \u2018\u2019developing a cohesive security management system rests largely on the effective collaboration between the individual elements.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe commissioner added that \u2018\u2019the different constitutional mandates of security agencies and the immense strain on their numerical strength demand that they must be on the same page, especially in terms of intelligence gathering and sharing.\u2019\u2019\n\nAruwan pointed out that \u2018\u2019several serious attacks could have been prevented if there was more robust collaboration within and amongst security agencies.\n\n\u2018\u2019There have been instances where available intelligence indicated a high likelihood of attacks by armed bandits, but due to lapses in collaboration, sadly the responses by security agencies fell through the gaps, leading to needless loss of lives and property,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nThe commissioner noted that \u2018\u2019we are seeing some significant improvement in this regard\u2019\u2019, appealing that security agencies should imbibe sharing intelligence and teamwork.",

          "text": "*Four policemen killed in A\u2019Ibom, Imo * 14 abducted\n\n*Kidnappers demand N30m for farmer *Police recover 138 rounds of AK47 ammunition\n\nAyodele Adesanmi (Ado Ekiti), VAL OKARA (OWERRI), Nosa Akenzua, (Asaba), ISAAC JOB (UYO)\n\nIt was a weekend of bloodletting in many communities of the country as gunmen went on the rampage, killing, maiming and kidnapping numerous people.\n\nIn Akwa Ibom State, gunmen on Sunday attacked a police station in Ini Local Government Area and shot dead a Mobile police officer.\n\nA source who pleaded not to be mentioned told our correspondent that one of the gang members identified as was arrested while others escaped with bullet wounds.\n\nThe source added that the armed men stormed the area with motorcycles and immediately opened fire directly at the police officers who replied, but one of them fell by the bandits bullets.\n\nAccording to the source, many of the hoodlums abandoned their motorcycles and charms and fled the scene.\n\n\u201cThis morning we got information that police station was being attacked in Ini, so we went.\n\nThe men came here on motorcycles and started shooting at the police and they (Police) also started shooting, but one of the police officers was gunned down.\n\nThe bandits escaped into the bush leaving their motorcycles and charms,\u201d the source said.\n\nThe Police Public Relations Officer, Odiko Macdon, confirmed the report.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe got report of the incident in Ini LGA this morning. We arrested one of the criminals while others escaped with bullets wounds. We recovered three motorcycles and charms.\n\nBut unfortunately, one of our men who participated in the operation was hit. He was taken to the hospital at Ikot Ekpene, but unfortunately, he gave up the ghost.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, the Commissioner of Police Andrew Amiengheme, has ordered men of the Operation Restore Peace, who are now in the bush for possible arrest of those who escaped with bullets wounds.\u201d\n\nIn Kaduna, the State Police Command confirmed the kidnapping of 12 persons in a new residential area of Kofar Gayan/Kofar Kona axis of Zaria.\n\nThe incident, according to information, took place between Saturday night and early hours of Sunday, barely three days after the kidnapping of 10 students and lecturers of Nuhu Bamalli Polytechnic, Zaria that left one dead.\n\nKaduna State Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Mohammed Jalige, in a telephone interview said: \u201cYes, there was an incident in Zaira and some of the victims were rescued.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether the kidnappers have reached out for ransom, Jalige said in most cases, the families of the victims usually choose not to disclose the dealings between them and the bandits.\n\nHe however said efforts were on to secure the release of the remaining people.\n\nIt was gathered that eight people were kidnapped from one house, who are mostly males.\n\nAn eyewitness and a daughter of one of the abductees, Hafsat Habib Kusfa, said the bandits broke into their home around midnight and went from room to room bringing out all the occupants and thereafter assembled them in the compound of the house.\n\nShe explained that the gunmen spoke Fulani among themselves and Hausa when they wanted to talk to their captives.\n\nAccording to her, after some arguments, the gunmen told her to go back into the house to take care of the children along with a nursing mother, who is her stepmother.\n\n\u201cThereafter, they took away my father, mother, sister, and my brothers. All in all they took eight people from our residence. We also saw some of their colleagues bringing out other people mostly males from our neighbourhood and later went away with them.\n\n\u201cAbout seven gunmen stormed our residence, those that I saw with my eyes and two of them outside were about 30 years of age, while those that came to pick us from our rooms were between ages 15 and 20,\u201d Hafsat said.\n\nKusfa confirmed the release of her father and mother, whom she said were immediately hospitalised because none of them could speak.\n\n\u201cFrom their condition, it is evident that they received severe beating from their abductors which made them ill,\u201d she said.\n\nUnconfirmed report, however, has it that a former bank manager was also abducted at his residence at Graceland area of Kwangila, Zaria, at about 9.00 pm Friday night.\n\nIn Imo, two women, including a Reverend sister, were kidnapped at various points in the state on Sunday morning.\n\nIn the first incident, a reverend sister was abducted at Dim na Nume, Isu in Nwangele Council Area, a few minutes after a kidnapping took place at Ohii.\n\nIt was gathered that the Reverend Sister, whose identity is not known, was driving when the\n\nkidnappers crossed and forced her to stop.\n\nAn eyewitness said the kidnappers forced her into their get-away car while one entered and drove her car behind.\n\nIn the second incident, worshippers at St Philip\u2019s Anglican Church, Ohii Parish in Owerri West Local Government Area were stunned when some men stormed it at about 7:45 am and kidnapped one Mrs. lkenna Onwusoroaka.\n\nThe kidnappers were said to have driven out with her in their car leaving the woman\u2019s vehicle behind.\n\nYouths of Orogwe Archdeaconry who were holding their camp/conference at the church premises had to scamper for safety.\n\nThe two incidents came at a time relatives of one Chimezie Okpara, who was kidnapped on Friday at his Umudurunna home, are in quandary over his continued abduction.\n\nOkpara was kidnapped while returning to his house from the market where he had gone to buy things for the burial ceremony of his brother\u2019s father-in-law.\n\nSources in the family told our correspondent more than 48 hours after the incident, the kidnappers are yet to make contact with the family.\n\nPolice Public Relations Officer in the state, SP Bala Elkana, could not be reached as his phone was switched off.\n\nMeanwhile, a herbalist identified as Chief Azu from Amaohuru Nguru in Aboh Mbaise Local Government Area has been murdered along with his nephew, whose wife is heavily pregnant.\n\nThe widow, Mrs. Azu said she heard noises in the middle of the night and came out, only to see her compound surrounded by hefty men with torches flashing everywhere.\n\nShe said: \u201cI also heard my husband open his door and came out before I heard gun shots and I hid myself.\n\nI don\u2019t know what must have transpired, but I heard them ask him about how he acquired his car and he told them it was a gift from a Reverend Father.\u201d\n\nShe added that her husband\u2019s assailants also indicated that they were policemen.\n\nShe wondered why they murdered him and his nephew since they claimed to be policemen, because her husband is a herbalist that used traditional medicine to assist people with all kinds of problems.\n\nHowever, a member of the family who did not want his name mentioned recalled that his deceased father was in court with some members of Amaohuru Community, and wondered why anybody should descend so low as to murder him in cold blood.\n\nMeanwhile, kidnappers of a farmer at Iyemero Ekiti in Ikole Local Government area, Alhaji Jimoh Olodan, have demanded a sum of N30 million for the victim.\n\nHe was kidnapped at a farmstead named Elegure about 11pm, on Friday.\n\nThe about 18 abductors were said to have invaded the farmstead, which is about three kilometres to Iyemero Ekiti and about 15 minutes drive to the community.\n\nIn the process of shooting sporadically into the air to scare residents, the bandits besieged Olodan\u2019s home and whisked him away to an unknown destination.\n\nA source in the town confided in newsmen on Sunday that the kidnappers contacted Olodan\u2019s family around 7.38pm on Saturday and made the demand.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe people who kidnapped Alhaji Olodan have contacted the family asking for money that has caused serious problem for the victim\u2019s relations.They were asking for a sum of N30m, which the family found to be too outrageous.\n\n\u201cThe family and the entire town are very cautious of the safety of the man, because of his role in the community. He is a successful farmer and one of those people we are looking up to.\n\n\u201cThey are running around to be able to raise the money, so that the man can be freed. The negotiation is still on with the abductors.\u201d\n\nPolice Public Relations Officer, Ekiti State Command, ASP Sunday Abutu, said: \u201cWe are not aware that they had contacted the family and asked for ransom.\n\nBut I know that our men are combing the surrounding bushes in collaboration with local hunters and Amotekun Corps.\u201d\n\nIn Delta, the State Police Command at the weekend confirmed the recovery of 138 rounds of ammunition, disclosing that it also made arrest of suspected cultists, among others.\n\nDSP Edafe Bright, Police Public Relations Officer in a statement, said that while Team Eagle-net special squad were on routine patrol/stop and search along Ughelli-Port Hacourt road, it intercepted a Mazda 626 saloon car dark green colour with Reg. No. UGH 722 AA with six occupants, two male and four female.\n\nAll occupants were asked to come down from the vehicle for search, in the process of searching, a sack containing rice was discovered, a man whose name is not yet known among the occupants jumped into a nearby stream running while a hot chase ensued.\n\n\u201cBut all efforts to catch up with him proved abortive as he escaped into the forest. While the rice bag was identified by other passengers as his own.\n\nWhen search was conducted on the bag, one hundred and thirty-eight (138) rounds of AK47 live ammunition, one AK47 magazine, one Baretta pistol magazine and a knife were recovered.\n\nHe added that preliminary investigation was on to ascertain if the occupants were all passengers that boarded the cab from Eleyele PHC heading to Ughelli while effort is being made to arrest the fleeing suspect.\n\nThe statement further said that as a follow-up to the directive issued to the state anti-cult unit by the Commissioner of Police, CP Ari Muhammed Ali, on the clash in Ogwashi-uku where three suspects were arrested at the weekend, the Commander, SACU acting on a credible intelligence, that another group will be converging in Ogwashi-Uku, detailed and led operatives who raided their hideout and arrested nine suspected cultists.\n\nExhibits recovered from them include: one English pump action gun, one double barrel cut to size gun, one battle axe and two live cartridges. Investigation is ongoing.",

          "text": "In July 2019, former President Olusegun Obasanjo wrote an open letter to President Muhammadu Buhari in which he expressed anxieties about the state of the nation and the general insecurity.\n\nHe dwells on the lingering Boko Haram crises, the wave of kidnappings and the herdsmen crisis.\n\nThe letter carried a tone of urgency on Buhari needs to do as \u2018captain of the ship\u2019.\n\n\u201cNigeria is on the precipice and dangerously reaching a tipping point where it may no longer be possible to hold danger at bay,\u201d\n\nObasanjo warned in the letter.\n\nRead again afresh, the letter remains poignantly germane, as the problems he highlighted two years ago have worsened.\n\nWe reproduce the letter in full:\n\n\n\nDear President and General Buhari,\n\nI am constrained to write to you this open letter. I decided to make it an open letter because the issue is very weighty and must be greatly worrisome to all concerned Nigerians and that means all right-thinking Nigerians and those resident in Nigeria. Since the issue is of momentous concern to all well-meaning and all right-thinking Nigerians, it must be of great concern to you, and collective thinking and dialoguing is the best way of finding an appropriate and adequate solution to the problem. The contents of this letter, therefore, should be available to all those who can help in proffering effective solutions for the problem of insecurity in the land.\n\nOne of the spinoffs and accelerants is the misinformation and disinformation through the use of fake news. A number of articles, in recent days, have been attributed to me by some people who I believe may be seeking added credence and an attentive audience for their opinions and view-points. As you know very well, I will always boldly own what I say and disown what is put into my mouth. But the issue I am addressing here is very serious; it is the issue of life and death for all of us and for our dear country, Nigeria. This issue can no longer be ignored, treated with nonchalance, swept under the carpet or treated with cuddling glove. The issue is hitting at the foundation of our existence as Nigerians and fast eroding the root of our Nigerian community. I am very much worried and afraid that we are on the precipice and dangerously reaching a tipping point where it may no longer be possible to hold danger at bay. Without being immodest, as a Nigerian who still bears the scar of the Nigerian civil war on my body and with a son who bears the scar of fighting Boko Haram on his body, you can understand, I hope, why I am so concerned. When people are desperate and feel that they cannot have confidence in the ability of government to provide security for their lives and properties, they will take recourse to anything and everything that can guarantee their security individually and collectively.\n\nFor over ten years, for four of which you have been the captain of the ship, Boko Haram has menacingly ravaged the land and in spite of government\u2019s claim of victory over Boko Haram, the potency and the activities of Boko Haram, where they are active, remain undiminished, putting lie to government\u2019s claim. The recent explanation of the Chief of Army Staff for non-victory due to lack of commitment and lack of motivation on the part of troops bordering on sabotage speaks for itself. Say what you will, Boko Haram is still a daily issue of insecurity for those who are victimised, killed, maimed, kidnapped, raped, sold into slavery and forced into marriage and for children forcibly recruited into carrying bombs on them to detonate among crowds of people to cause maximum destructions and damage. And Boko Haram will not go away on the basis of sticks alone, carrots must overweigh sticks. How else do you deal with issues such as only about 50% literacy in North-East with over 70% unemployment?\n\nHerdsmen/farmers crises and menace started with government treating the issue with cuddling glove instead of hammer. It has festered and spread. Today, it has developed into banditry, kidnapping, armed robbery and killings all over the country. The unfortunate situation is that the criminality is being perceived as a \u2018Fulani\u2019 menace unleashed by Fulani elite in the different parts of the country for a number of reasons but even more unfortunately, many Nigerians and non-Nigerians who are friends of Nigeria attach vicarious responsibility to you as a Fulani elite and the current captain of the Nigeria ship. Perception may be as potent as reality at times. Whatever may be the grievances of Fulanis, if any, they need to be put out in the open and their grievances, if legitimate, be addressed; and if other ethnic groups have grievances, let them also be brought out in the open and addressed through debate and dialogue.\n\nHerdsmen/farmers crises and menace started with government treating the issue with cuddling glove instead of hammer. It has festered and spread. Today, it has developed into banditry, kidnapping, armed robbery and killings all over the country. The unfortunate situation is that the criminality is being perceived as a \u2018Fulani\u2019 menace unleashed by Fulani elite in the different parts of the country\n\nThe main issue, if I may dare say, is poor management or mismanagement of diversity which, on the other hand, is one of our greatest and most important assets. As a result, very onerous cloud is gathering. And rain of destruction, violence, disaster and disunity can only be the outcome. Nothing should be taken for granted, the clock is ticking with the cacophony of dissatisfaction and disaffection everywhere in and outside the country. The Presidency and the Congress in the US have signalled to us to put our house in order. The House of Lords in the UK had debated the Nigerian security situation. We must understand and appreciate the significance, implication and likely consequences of such concerns and deliberations.\n\nNo one can stop hate speech, violent agitation and smouldering violent agitation if he fans the embers of hatred, disaffection and violence. It will continue to snowball until it is out of control. A stitch in time saves nine, goes the old wise saying. With the death of Funke, Chief Fasoranti\u2019s daughter, some sympathetic Nigerian groups are saying \u201cenough is enough\u201d. Prof. Anya, a distinguished Nigerian merit Laureate, has this to say \u201cWe can no longer say with certainty that we have a nation\u201d. Niger-Delta leaders, South-Eastern leaders, Middle-Belt leaders and Northern Elders Forum have not remained quiet. Different ordinary Nigerians at home and abroad are calling for different measures to address or ameliorate the situation. All the calls and cries can only continue to be ignored at the expense of Nigerian unity, if not its continued existence.\n\nTo be explicit and without equivocation, Mr. President and General, I am deeply worried about four avoidable calamities:\n\n1. abandoning Nigeria into the hands of criminals who are all being suspected, rightly or wrongly, as Fulanis and terrorists of Boko Haram type.\n\n2. spontaneous or planned reprisal attacks against Fulanis which may inadvertently or advertently mushroom into pogrom or Rwanda-type genocide that we did not believe could happen and yet it happened.\n\n3. similar attacks against any other tribe or ethnic group anywhere in the country initiated by rumours, fears, intimidation and revenge capable of leading to pogrom.\n\n4. violent uprising beginning from one section of the country and spreading quickly to other areas and leading to dismemberment of the country.\n\nIt happened to Yugoslavia not too long ago. If we do not act now, one or all of these scenarios may happen. We must pray and take effective actions at the same time. The initiative is in the hands of the President of the nation, but he cannot do it alone. In my part of the world, if you are sharpening your cutlass and a mad man comes from behind to take the cutlass from you, you need other people\u2019s assistance to have your cutlass back without being harmed. The mad men with serious criminal intent and terrorism as core value have taken cutlass of security. The need for assistance to regain control is obviously compelling and must be embraced now.\n\nA couple of weeks ago at a public lecture, I had said, among other things, that:\n\n\u201cIn all these issues of mobilisation for national unity, stability, security, cooperation, development, growth and progress, there is no consensus. Like in the issue of security, government should open up discussion, debate and dialogue as part of consultation at different levels and the outcome of such deliberations should be collated to form inputs into a national conference to come up with the solution that will effectively deal with the issues and lead to rapid development, growth and progress which will give us a wholesome society and enhanced living standard and livelihood in an inclusive and shared society. It will be a national programme. We need unity of purpose and a nationally accepted strategic roadmap that will not change with the whims and caprices of any government. It must be owned by the citizens, people\u2019s policy and strategy implemented by the government no matter its colour and leaning.\n\nThe President must be seen to be addressing this issue with utmost seriousness and with maximum dispatch and getting all hands on deck to help. If there is a failure, the principal responsibility will be that of the President and no one else.\n\nSome of the groups that I will suggest being contacted are traditional rulers, past heads of service (no matter how competent or incompetent they have been and how much they have contributed to the mess we are in), past heads of paramilitary organizations, private sector, civil society, community leaders particularly in the most affected areas, present and past governors, present and past local government leaders, religious leaders, past Heads of State, past intelligence chiefs, past Heads of Civil Service and relevant current and retired diplomats, members of the opposition and any groups that may be deemed relevant.\u201d\n\nThe President must be seen to be addressing this issue with utmost seriousness and with maximum dispatch and getting all hands on deck to help. If there is a failure, the principal responsibility will be that of the President and no one else. We need cohesion and concentration of effort and maximum force \u2013 political, economic, social, psychological, and military \u2013 to deal successfully with the menace of criminality and terrorism separately and together. Blame game among own forces must be avoided. It is debilitating and only helpful to our adversary. We cannot dither anymore. It is time to confront this threat headlong and in a manner that is holistic, inclusive, and purposeful.\n\nFor the sake of Nigeria and Nigerians, I pray that God may grant you, as our President, the wisdom, the understanding, the political will, and the courage to do what is right when it is right and without fear or favor. May God save, secure, protect and bless Nigeria. May He open to us a window of opportunity that we can still use to prevent the worst from happening. As we say in my village, \u201cMay God forbid bad thing\u201d.\n\nsigned\n\nOLUSEGUN OBASANJO",

          "title": "Yet Again! Obasanjo Writes Letter To Buhari, Lists 4 Avoidable Calamities",
          "text": "Former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo has sent another open letter to President Muhammadu Buhari regarding the country\u2019s current predicament.\n\nObasanjo urged Buhari\u2019s administration to confront the country\u2019s degree of insecurity and herdsmen crisis and take immediate action before it\u2019s too late.\n\nIf Buhari\u2019s government does not act quickly, four disasters will occur, according to the former President.\n\nAllowing Nigeria to fall into the hands of suspected criminals, retaliatory attacks on Fulanis, attacks on other ethnic groups, and a series of uprisings in various parts of the country are among them.\n\nHe bemoaned the fact that Boko Haram has continued to terrorize Nigeria for more than a decade, including the six years Buhari has been in charge, and said it was a mistake to believe the insurgency battle had been won.\n\nFormer President Olusegun Obasanjo warned that if quick action is not done, a repeat of the Rwandan genocide might occur in Nigeria.\n\nObasanjo stated that Nigeria\u2019s fundamental problem is corruption, which if not addressed properly will result in a deluge of destruction, violence, calamity, and division.\n\nFull letter to President Buhari\n\nDear President and General Buhari,\n\nI am constrained to write to you this open letter. I decided to make it an open letter because the issue is very weighty and must be greatly worrisome to all concerned Nigerians and that means all right-thinking Nigerians and those resident in Nigeria. Since the issue is of momentous concern to all well-meaning and all right-thinking Nigerians, it must be of great concern to you, and collective thinking and dialoguing is the best way of finding an appropriate and adequate solution to the problem. The contents of this letter, therefore, should be available to all those who can help in proffering effective solutions for the problem of insecurity in the land.\n\nOne of the spinoffs and accelerants is the misinformation and disinformation through the use of fake news. A number of articles, in recent days, have been attributed to me by some people who I believe may be seeking added credence and an attentive audience for their opinions and view-points. As you know very well, I will always boldly own what I say and disown what is put into my mouth. But the issue I am addressing here is very serious; it is the issue of life and death for all of us and for our dear country, Nigeria. This issue can no longer be ignored, treated with nonchalance, swept under the carpet or treated with cuddling glove. The issue is hitting at the foundation of our existence as Nigerians and fast eroding the root of our Nigerian community. I am very much worried and afraid that we are on the precipice and dangerously reaching a tipping point where it may no longer be possible to hold danger at bay. Without being immodest, as a Nigerian who still bears the scar of the Nigerian civil war on my body and with a son who bears the scar of fighting Boko Haram on his body, you can understand, I hope, why I am so concerned. When people are desperate and feel that they cannot have confidence in the ability of government to provide security for their lives and properties, they will take recourse to anything and everything that can guarantee their security individually and collectively.\n\nFor over ten years, for four of which you have been the captain of the ship, Boko Haram has menacingly ravaged the land and in spite of government\u2019s claim of victory over Boko Haram, the potency and the activities of Boko Haram, where they are active, remain undiminished, putting lie to government\u2019s claim. The recent explanation of the Chief of Army Staff for non-victory due to lack of commitment and lack of motivation on the part of troops bordering on sabotage speaks for itself. Say what you will, Boko Haram is still a daily issue of insecurity for those who are victimised, killed, maimed, kidnapped, raped, sold into slavery and forced into marriage and for children forcibly recruited into carrying bombs on them to detonate among crowds of people to cause maximum destructions and damage. And Boko Haram will not go away on the basis of sticks alone, carrots must overweigh sticks. How else do you deal with issues such as only about 50% literacy in North-East with over 70% unemployment?\n\nHerdsmen/farmers crises and menace started with government treating the issue with cuddling glove instead of hammer. It has festered and spread. Today, it has developed into banditry, kidnapping, armed robbery and killings all over the country. The unfortunate situation is that the criminality is being perceived as a \u2018Fulani\u2019 menace unleashed by Fulani elite in the different parts of the country for a number of reasons but even more unfortunately, many Nigerians and non-Nigerians who are friends of Nigeria attach vicarious responsibility to you as a Fulani elite and the current captain of the Nigeria ship. Perception may be as potent as reality at times. Whatever may be the grievances of Fulanis, if any, they need to be put out in the open and their grievances, if legitimate, be addressed; and if other ethnic groups have grievances, let them also be brought out in the open and addressed through debate and dialogue.\n\nThe main issue, if I may dare say, is poor management or mismanagement of diversity which, on the other hand, is one of our greatest and most important assets. As a result, very onerous cloud is gathering. And rain of destruction, violence, disaster and disunity can only be the outcome. Nothing should be taken for granted, the clock is ticking with the cacophony of dissatisfaction and disaffection everywhere in and outside the country. The Presidency and the Congress in the US have signalled to us to put our house in order. The House of Lords in the UK had debated the Nigerian security situation. We must understand and appreciate the significance, implication and likely consequences of such concerns and deliberations.\n\nNo one can stop hate speech, violent agitation and smouldering violent agitation if he fans the embers of hatred, disaffection and violence. It will continue to snowball until it is out of control. A stitch in time saves nine, goes the old wise saying. With the death of Funke, Chief Fasoranti\u2019s daughter, some sympathetic Nigerian groups are saying \u201cenough is enough\u201d. Prof. Anya, a distinguished Nigerian merit Laureate, has this to say \u201cWe can no longer say with certainty that we have a nation\u201d. Niger-Delta leaders, South-Eastern leaders, Middle-Belt leaders and Northern Elders Forum have not remained quiet. Different ordinary Nigerians at home and abroad are calling for different measures to address or ameliorate the situation. All the calls and cries can only continue to be ignored at the expense of Nigerian unity, if not its continued existence.\n\nTo be explicit and without equivocation, Mr. President and General, I am deeply worried about four avoidable calamities:\n\n1. abandoning Nigeria into the hands of criminals who are all being suspected, rightly or wrongly, as Fulanis and terrorists of Boko Haram type.\n\n2. spontaneous or planned reprisal attacks against Fulanis which may inadvertently or advertently mushroom into pogrom or Rwanda-type genocide that we did not believe could happen and yet it happened.\n\n3. similar attacks against any other tribe or ethnic group anywhere in the country initiated by rumours, fears, intimidation and revenge capable of leading to pogrom.\n\n4. violent uprising beginning from one section of the country and spreading quickly to other areas and leading to dismemberment of the country.\n\nIt happened to Yugoslavia not too long ago. If we do not act now, one or all of these scenarios may happen. We must pray and take effective actions at the same time. The initiative is in the hands of the President of the nation, but he cannot do it alone. In my part of the world, if you are sharpening your cutlass and a mad man comes from behind to take the cutlass from you, you need other people\u2019s assistance to have your cutlass back without being harmed. The mad men with serious criminal intent and terrorism as core value have taken cutlass of security. The need for assistance to regain control is obviously compelling and must be embraced now.\n\nA couple of weeks ago at a public lecture, I had said, among other things, that:\n\n\u201cIn all these issues of mobilisation for national unity, stability, security, cooperation, development, growth and progress, there is no consensus. Like in the issue of security, government should open up discussion, debate and dialogue as part of consultation at different levels and the outcome of such deliberations should be collated to form inputs into a national conference to come up with the solution that will effectively deal with the issues and lead to rapid development, growth and progress which will give us a wholesome society and enhanced living standard and livelihood in an inclusive and shared society. It will be a national programme. We need unity of purpose and a nationally accepted strategic roadmap that will not change with the whims and caprices of any government. It must be owned by the citizens, people\u2019s policy and strategy implemented by the government no matter it\u2019s color and leaning.\n\nSome of the groups that I will suggest being contacted are traditional rulers, past heads of service (no matter how competent or incompetent they have been and how much they have contributed to the mess we are in), past heads of paramilitary organizations, private sector, civil society, community leaders particularly in the most affected areas, present and past governors, present and past local government leaders, religious leaders, past Heads of State, past intelligence chiefs, past Heads of Civil Service and relevant current and retired diplomats, members of the opposition and any groups that may be deemed relevant.\u201d\n\nThe President must be seen to be addressing this issue with utmost seriousness and with maximum dispatch and getting all hands on deck to help. If there is a failure, the principal responsibility will be that of the President and no one else. We need cohesion and concentration of effort and maximum force \u2013 political, economic, social, psychological, and military \u2013 to deal successfully with the menace of criminality and terrorism separately and together. Blame game among own forces must be avoided. It is debilitating and only helpful to our adversary. We cannot dither anymore. It is time to confront this threat headlong and in a manner that is holistic, inclusive, and purposeful.\n\nFor the sake of Nigeria and Nigerians, I pray that God may grant you, as our President, the wisdom, the understanding, the political will, and the courage to do what is right when it is right and without fear or favor. May God save, secure, protect and bless Nigeria. May He open to us a window of opportunity that we can still use to prevent the worst from happening. As we say in my village, \u201cMay God forbid bad thing\u201d.\n\nsigned\n\nOLUSEGUN OBASANJO",

          "text": "The spate of insecurity in Imo state worsened at the weekend when two women, including a Reverend Sister, were Sunday morning kidnapped at various points across the state.\n\nAt one of the scenes, a reverend sister was abducted at Dim na Nume, Isu in Nwangele local government area of the state, just moments after a kidnap incident took place at Ohii.\n\nThe yet-to-be identified Reverend Sister; Blueprint gathered, was driving when her captors dashed into the middle of the road and halted her car.\n\nIt was further learnt that the captors pulled her out of the car and bundled her into theirs, with one of them boarding hers and driving same from behind.\n\nIn yet another scene, worshippers at St Philip\u2019s Anglican Church, Ohii Parish in Owerri West local government area of the state were thrown into fear as some hoodlums hit the church at about 7:45 am, kidnapping one Mrs. lkenna Onwusoroaka.\n\nUnlike the previous scenario, the abductors drove her out in their car leaving hers behind.\n\nThere was some level of confusion as Orogwe Archdeaconry youth holding their camp/conference at the church premises, ran in different directions for safety.\n\nThe twin events happened as the whereabouts of one Chimezie Okpara, kidnapped Friday at his Umudurunna home, continued to remain a source of worry to his relations.\n\nThe abductee was picked up by his captors on his way from the market where he was reported to have gone to buy things for the burial ceremony of his brother\u2019s father in-law.\n\nSpokesman of the state police command, SP Bala Elkana, could not be reached for comment as at the time of this report.\n\nPolice confirm Zaria kidnap\n\nIn a related development, Kaduna state Police Command has confirmed the kidnap of 12 persons in a new residential area of Kofar Gayan/Kofar Kona axis of Zaria of the state.\n\nThe incident, according to information available to Blueprint, took place between Saturday night and early hours of Sunday, barely three days after the killing of a student and kidnap of 10 students and lecturers of Nuhu Bamalli Polytechnic in the same Zaria.\n\nPolice Public Relations Officer in the state, ASP Mohammed Jalige, who confirmed the development in a telephone interview said: \u201cYes, there was an incident in Zaira and some of the victims were rescued.\u201d\n\nAsked whether the kidnappers had reached out for ransom, Jalige said, in most cases the families of the victims usually choose not to disclose the dealings between them and the kidnappers.\n\nHe, however, said efforts were on to secure the release of the remaining people in captivity.\n\nIt was gathered that eight people, mostly males, were kidnapped from one house.\n\nHow it happened\n\nAn eyewitness and a daughter of one of the abductees, Hafsat Habib Kusfa, said the bandits broke into their home around 12am and went from room to room bringing out all the occupants and thereafter assembled them in the compound of the house.\n\nShe explained that the gunmen, who invaded their house carrying guns and machetes, spoke Fulani language among themselves and Hausa language when they wanted to talk to their captives.\n\nShe further said, after some arguments, the gunmen told her to go back into the house to take care of the children along with a nursing mother, who is her step mother.\n\n\u201cThereafter, they took away my father, mother, sister, and my brothers. In all, they took eight people from our residence. We also saw some of their colleagues bringing out other people mostly males from our neighbourhood and later went away with them.\n\n\u201cAbout seven gunmen stormed our residence, those that I saw with my eyes and two of them outside were about 30-year of age while those that came to pick us from our rooms were between ages 15 and 20,\u201d Hafsat said.\n\nSpeaking further on Sunday morning, Hafsat Kusfa confirmed the release of her father and mother, whom she said were immediately hospitalised because none of them could speak.\n\n\u201cFrom their condition, it is evident that they received severe beating from their abductors which made them ill,\u201d she said.\n\nUnconfirmed report, however, has it that a former bank manager was also abducted at his residence at Graceland area of Kwangila, Zaria, at about 9pm Friday night.\n\nN30m ransom on Ekiti farmer\n\nAlso, kidnappers of a successful farmer at Iyemero Ekiti in Ikole local government area of Ekiti state, Alhaji Jimoh Olodan, have demanded N30 million ransom for his release.\n\nOlodan was abducted Friday night when suspected herders invaded Elegure farm settlement, some few kilometres to Iyemero-Ekiti.\n\nIt was gathered that his captors, who wielded guns, had contacted the Olodan family and demanded a N30million ransom.\n\n\u201cThe people who kidnapped Alhaji Olodan had contacted the family asking for money that has caused a serious problem for the victim\u2019s relations.\n\n\u201cThey were asking for a sum of N30 million, which the family found to be too outrageous and they were not comfortable with such demand.\n\n\u201cThe family and the entire town are very cautious of the safety of the man, because of his role in the community. He is a successful farmer and one of those people looked up to in the community.\n\n\u201cThey are running around to be able to raise some money so that the man can be freed. The negotiation is still on with the abductors,\u201d said a source.\n\nBut spokesman of the state police command, Sunday Abutu, said the police were not aware of any negotiation.\n\n\u201cWe are not aware that they had contacted the family and asked for ransom. But I know that our men are combing the surrounding bushes in collaboration with local hunters and Amotekun corps,\u201d Abutu said.\n\nNiger on education\n\nMeanwhile, the Niger state government has said it would continue to give priority to the provision of high quality education and motivation of teachers despite the insecurity and attacks on educational institutions by bandits.\n\nThe state\u2019s Deputy Governor, Mohammed Ahmed Ketso stated this at the weekend in Minna.\n\nSpeaking at the Teachers Award Day ceremony organised by the State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB), the deputy governor said such situation won\u2019t deter the administration from sustainable development of the education system in the state.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe empowerment of teachers is a priority to us because we cannot raise the quality of students without first standardising the quality of those to impart knowledge and character on them.\u201d\n\nHe explained that government had taken adequate measures to provide security in schools and also secure lives and property, adding that teaching and learning can only flourish in peaceful atmosphere.\n\nSpeaking with journalists, chairman of the board, Dr. Isa Adamu, said pupils displaced by bandits have been placed under special learning arrangements whereby they receive lessons from teachers.\n\nUnder the arrangement, he said, pupils have contacts with teachers and \u201cthis is made possible by the fact that most of them are in the IDPs located in other school.\u201d\n\nHe said the board decided to honour some of the teachers with excellent records of performance as motivation, adding that some head teachers, principal and education secretaries were also honoured.",

          "text": "Chairman Senate Committee on Army Ali Ndume has counselled the Muhammadu Buhari-led administration against using foreign loans to finance recurrent expenditure like salaries and overhead.\n\nThe lawmaker, who represents Borno South Senatorial District in the National Assembly, stated this Sunday in a statement, to commemorate June 12 as the nation\u2019s Democracy Day.\n\nAs at the end of the first quarter of 2021, the nation\u2019s debt profile stands N33.10 trillion, a development that has remained a source of worry for Nigerians at both the high and low places.\n\nThe figure is an increase of N191billion, thus shooting it up from the N32.91trillion as at December 2020.\n\nJust last Wednesday, the Debt Management Office (DMO), said the figures include the debt stock of the federal, state governments and that of the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA).\n\nNdume warns\n\nSounding some warning, however, the former Senate Leader, Senator Ndume said, there was absolutely nothing wrong with a country taking foreign loans but that such should be spent to boost agriculture and the revival o moribund industries.\n\nNdume also said the loans meant to provide infrastructure should be obtained from international lending agencies with favourable terms.\n\nThe lawmaker further advised government to ensure that roads infrastructure were made to generate revenue by erecting toll plazas on them.\n\n\u201cConcerning the issue of foreign loan borrowings, the problem is not about borrowing because the idea is not bad. Even developed nations also do the same thing. It is what the government do with the money that is important.\n\n\u201cThe concentration on infrastructural development by the Buhari administration, especially in the area of railway and road infrastructure is commendable.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government should look at the possibility of borrowing for agricultural development so that our people will move from subsistence farming to a mechanised one.\n\n\u201cIf that is achieved, it will generate employment and guarantee food security. Also, there would be no need for Nigeria to spend foreign exchange on food importation. We can produce all types of food in Nigeria only if the farmers are well funded.\n\n\u201cThe borrowings should be spent on purchase of farm implements and other farming machinery and make it available to farmers.\n\n\u201cThe external loans should also be used to fund moribund industries, especially textile and spare part manufacturing among others. It is only through that the government can guarantee borrowings because the manufacturing industries will come up again through the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe government can serve as a guarantee for the loans so that MAN would coordinate the process of resuscitating the moribund industries that had been closed down.\n\n\u201cThe loans should be borrowed from the international lending agencies whose terms are very good in order to develop our road infrastructure and mount toll plazas in order to generate revenue to pay back the loans.\n\n\u201cBorrowings should not be made to defray recurrent expenditure like payment of salaries and overhead costs. Funding for such purposes should be sourced locally from taxes and other internally generated revenues,\u201d he said.\n\nThe lawmaker commended the Buhari administration for the move to fund the nation\u2019s security and military services for the purpose of tackling insecurity.\n\nNdume said: \u201cOn the issue of insecurity, I have been advocating an increase in the military funding but that has now been done by the recent submission of the supplementary budget of over N800bn by the executive arm of government to the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cMajority of the money is meant to address the security challenges in the country. This is a commendable effort by President Buhari.\n\n\u201cWith this now, there is light at the end of the tunnel because if the materials and necessary military hardware and equipment are immediately purchased, and handed over to the military, I am sure that the Nigerian Army who are known for their gallantry in international assignments will be able to do more to defend the internal security challenges confronting Nigeria.\u201d\n\nWhile congratulating Nigerians on the commemoration of the June 12 as Democracy Day, the lawmaker \u201ccommend the President, Muhammadu Buhari, for his decision to be speaking out to Nigerians because the people have been eager and worried over his continued silence on critical national issues in recent times.\n\n\u201cMany Nigerians are now happy that their President has started talking to them once again. I therefore encourage him to be doing that intermittently, if possible, on quarterly basis.\u201d",

          "text": "Benjamin Netanyahu has lost his 12-year hold on power in Israel after its parliament voted in a new coalition government.\n\nRight-wing nationalist Naftali Bennett has been sworn in as prime minister, leading a \u201cgovernment of change\u201d.\n\nHe will lead an unprecedented coalition of parties which was approved with a razor-thin majority of 60-59.\n\nMr Bennett will be prime minister until September 2023 as part of a power-sharing deal.\n\nHe will then hand power over to Yair Lapid, leader of the centrist Yesh Atid, for a further two years.\n\nMr Netanyahu \u2013 Israel\u2019s longest-serving leader who has dominated its political landscape for years \u2013 will remain head of the right-wing Likud party and become leader of the opposition.\n\nDuring the debate in the Knesset (parliament), a defiant Mr Netanyahu promised: \u201cWe\u2019ll be back.\u201d\n\nAfter the vote, Mr Netanyahu walked over to Mr Bennett and shook his hand.\n\nHowever, representatives of the Palestinians have reacted dismissively to Israel\u2019s new government.\n\n\u201cThis is an internal Israeli affair. Our position has always been clear, what we want is a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders with Jerusalem as its capital,\u201d a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said.\n\n\u201cIt is an occupation and a colonial entity, which we should resist by force to get our rights back,\u201d said a spokesman for Hamas, the Islamist group that controls Gaza.\n\nUS President Joe Biden has already sent his congratulations to Mr Bennett, saying he looks forward to working with him.\n\nWhy has this happened?\n\nMr Netanyahu served five terms, first from 1996 to 1999, then continuously from 2009 to 2021.\n\nHe called an election in April 2019 but failed to win enough support to form a new coalition government. Two more inconclusive elections followed.\n\nAfter the third, he formed a government of national unity with then-opposition leader Benny Gantz, but the deal collapsed and Israel went back to the polls in March.\n\nLikud emerged as the largest party, but after Mr Netanyahu was again unable to form a government, the task passed to Mr Lapid, whose party came second.\n\nOpposition to Mr Netanyahu staying in power had grown, not just among the left and centre but also among right-wing parties that are ordinarily ideologically aligned to Likud, including Yamina.\n\nAlthough Yamina came joint fifth in the election with only seven seats, its support was critical. After weeks of negotiations, Mr Lapid brought Yamina on board as part of a constellation of parties whose only common goal was to remove Mr Netanyahu from office.\n\nThe agreement involving eight factions with the 61 seats required for a majority was signed on 2 June, just half an hour before a deadline was due to expire, effectively sealing Mr Netanyahu\u2019s fate.\n\nWhat will the new government be like?\n\nIn appearance, Mr Bennett\u2019s government will be unlike any which has preceded it in Israel\u2019s 73-year history.\n\nThe alliance contains parties which have vast ideological differences, and perhaps most significantly includes the first independent Arab party to be part of a potential ruling coalition, Raam. It is also expected to have a record number of nine female ministers.\n\nThe inclusion of Raam and left-wing non-Arab Israeli parties means there could be friction on issues such as Israeli policies towards Palestinians \u2013 Yamina and another right-wing party, New Hope, are staunch supporters of Jewish settlement in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, for instance.\n\nThere could also be difficulties over social policies \u2013 while some parties want to advance gay rights, such as recognising same-sex marriages, Raam, an Islamist party, is against this.\n\nIn addition, some parties want to relax religious restrictions more extensively than Yamina \u2013 a national-religious party \u2013 will likely allow.\n\nMr Bennett has indicated his government would focus on areas where agreement was possible, like economic issues or the coronavirus pandemic, while avoiding more contentious matters.\n\n\u201cNobody will have to give up their ideology,\u201d he recently said, \u201cbut all will have to postpone the realisation of some of their dreams\u2026 We\u2019ll focus on what can be achieved, rather than arguing about what cannot.\u201d",

          "text": "Former governor of Edo State and One-time National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, APC, John Odigie Oyegun, has warned President Muhammadu Buhari and the leadership of the ruling party not to wait till agitations from different sections of the country on restructuring snowball into a threat to national unity before addressing them.\n\nThe party chieftain said the earlier those issues are addressed the easier it is to diffuse the tensions currently building across the country.\n\nOyegun, who stated this at the public presentation of a book titled \u201cAPC\u2019s Litmus Tests\u201d written by the director-general of the Progressive Governors Forum (PGD) Mallam Salihu Moh. Lukman, stressed that the APC as the government of the federation, \u201cmust not give the impression that only military governments can fundamentally tamper with the basic structure of this nation.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cThe ideas of people from different parts of the country will be different up to the extent they want to go with the proposals in the document, but it is necessary.\n\n\u201cIt is vital that it is in fact, mandatory in the interest of the survival of our nation, that these issues be addressed. We cannot continue to allow the subjectto become something that threatens our nation at any turn.\n\n\u201cSo, the earlier we address it, the earlier we show that as a party we are responsive to the feelings of the people, the desires of the people and the wants of the people. \u201d It becomes easier then to diffuse the kind of stresses that the nation is passing through today. Look at what is happening. Well, it is recommended there should be State Police.\u201d\n\nOn the need to rebuild the APC from bottom to the top approach, Chief Oyegun warned against bending the party\u2019s rules.\n\n\u201cYou can stretch the rule. Never break it. Secondly, it is very fundamental that in all we do, the ranks-and-file members of the party and of parties generally, are able to see that even when they lose, they have been treated fairly, they have been treated decently because what I observed, I was made the Chairman of the reconciliation group in the South-south and in every single case, you have a situation where during elections, the civil war within the party alone, makes it impossible to think of it. Why is it civil war? Civil war because critical stakeholders in the party see that they have not been fairly, justly treated.\u201d\n\nFor the chairman of the Progressive Governors Forum and Kebbi state governor, Atiku Bagudu, said the APC is awared that there are fundamental challenges to be addressed and it will not shy away from acknowledging them and providing transparent leadership.\n\nBagudu said: \u201cThe party is not shy to acknowledge that our constitution is not perfect and again under John Oyegun, the El-Rufai Committee on True Federalism was created to look at those issues that we should do better about. APC believe is let us amend constitution because society is dynamic not because somebody has been wronged and cheated. If that is the basis for correction, then the agitation will never stop but if it\u2019s based on let us make it better, I believe the proposal which have been submitted to the National Assembly will help to produce amended Constitution that will meet most of the aspirations.\n\nIn her goodwill message, the mother of day and a former Nigerian envoy, Fatima Balla Abubakar, who said APC\u2019s popularity can be attributed, significantly, to President Muhammadu Buhari, called on the government to quickly address the growing social unrest for the party to regain confidence.\n\n\u201cAs the party in power which also has control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate, the APC must redouble its efforts to regain public confidence and trust which have been eroded in these deeply trying times. We cannot regain public confidence in our party as well as the government if we do not seriously address the growing social unrest due to growing mistrust between citizens main|y induced by poverty, lack ofjobs and livelihood. It is only when trust is rebuilt that we can restore peace.\n\n\u201cAs a government in power, APC needs to start thinking and doing things differently so that it can begin to deploy more people oriented policies to boost socio-economic growth and development and to provide more relief to the people.\n\n\u201cThe present situation in the country calls for more robust intellectual and policy oriented discussions and engagements by our party. We must engage with a spirit of transparency and inclusiveness. We must create a big tent where different views and positions are discussed without bitterness.\u201d\n\nWhile appreciating the APC government for his opportunity to serve, the author of the book, Salihu Moh. Lukman, said APC leaders have been working to address some of the foundational issues of democracy and that the book \u201cis a contribution to support initiatives of our leaders. All leaders and members of APC are therefore invited to engage challenges facing the party, government and the nation with every confidence and belief in the capacity of Nigerians to support every patriotic and nationalistic initiative. We much never allow the loud noise of selfish political entrepreneurs to hoodwink Nigerians into believing that our party and governments produced by our party have failed.\n\n\u201cIt will be a mockery of our political history to allow any narrative in the public space, which suggest that comparative to previous administrations since 1999, APC controlled administration led by President Muhammadu Buhari has failed. Like President Muhammadu Buhari himself has acknowledged, there are no doubt challenges facing the country, but no administration since 1999 has succeeded in completing projects, whether initiated by previous or current governments.\n\n\u201cJust on Thursday, June 10, 2021, President Buhari commissioned the Lagos \u2013 Ibadan railway, a project started and completed by his administration. And because leaders of PDP are shameless, they had the temerity to make a public statement calling on President Muhammadu Buhari to \u2018stop taking credit for projects not initiated by him.\u2019 May be they also want President Buhari and APC to acquire all their scandalous records, which include abandoning the construction of the PDP National Secretariat after mobilising billions on Naira.\u201d",

          "title": "Netanyahu Ousted As Israel Approves New Govt",
          "text": "A motley alliance of Israeli parties on Sunday ousted Benjamin Netanyahu, the country\u2019s longest-serving prime minister, and formed a new government in a seismic shift in the country\u2019s turbulent politics.\n\nNaftali Bennett, a right-wing Jewish nationalist and former tech millionaire, was to take over at the helm of the eight-party bloc, united only by their shared disdain for the hawkish right-wing leader known as Bibi.\n\nNetanyahu, 71, in typically combative style, vowed shortly before his defeat that \u201cif it\u2019s our destiny to be in the opposition, we\u2019ll do so with our heads high until we take down this bad government and return to lead the country our way\u201d.\n\nBeloved as \u201cKing Bibi\u201d by his right-wing supporters and condemned as the \u201ccrime minister\u201d by his critics, Netanyahu has long been the dominant, and increasingly divisive, figure in Israeli politics.\n\nBut on Sunday, a vote in the Knesset legislature following weeks of intense political drama ended his government with a razor-thin majority of 60 to 59 in the 120-seat chamber.\n\nIn Tel Aviv\u2019s Rabin Square, Netanyahu\u2019s opponents broke out in cheers and launched into an evening of joyous celebrations, having rallied in recent days with \u201cBye bye Bibi\u201d placards.\n\nOne of the demonstrators, Tal Surkis, 19, confessed to \u201cmixed feelings\u201d about the incoming change coalition, but said \u201cit\u2019s something Israel needs\u201d.\n\nBennett, 49, in a Knesset speech before the vote, promised the new government, a coalition of ideologically divergent parties, \u201crepresents all of Israel\u201d.\n\nHe said the country, after four inconclusive elections in under two years, had been thrown \u201cinto a maelstrom of hatred and in-fighting\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe time has come for different leaders, from all parts of the population, to stop, to stop this madness\u201d, he said, to angry shouts of \u201cliar\u201d and \u201ccriminal\u201d from right-wing opponents.\n\nFragile Coalition\n\nNetanyahu, who is battling corruption charges in an ongoing trial he dismisses as a conspiracy, has been the dominant Israeli politician of his generation, having also served a previous three-year term in the 1990s.\n\nHis supporters have hailed him as a strong defender of Israel who has been tough on arch foe Iran, but also struck a series of historic normalisation deals with several Arab nations last year.\n\nBeing ousted from the top job will leave Netanyahu more exposed to his legal woes, because it denies him the chance to push through parliament changes to basic laws that could give him immunity.\n\nBennett, a former defence minister under Netanyahu, vowed to keep Israel safe from Iran, promising that \u201cIsrael won\u2019t let Iran have nuclear weapons\u201d \u2014 a goal the Islamic republic denies pursuing.\n\nNetanyahu, true to his reputation as Israel\u2019s \u201cMr Security\u201d, charged that \u201cIran is celebrating\u201d the launch of what he charged would be a \u201cdangerous\u201d and weak left-wing government.\n\nThe diverse anti-Netanyahu bloc was cobbled together by the secular centrist Yair Lapid, a former TV presenter.\n\nIt spans the political spectrum, including three right-wing, two centrist and two left-wing parties, along with an Arab Islamic conservative party.\n\nLapid, 57, is to serve as foreign minister for the next two years before taking over from Bennett.\n\n\u2018Scorched earth\u2019\n\nThe improbable alliance emerged weeks after an 11-day war between Israel and Hamas, the Islamist group that rules the Palestinian enclave of Gaza, and following inter-communal violence in Israeli cities with significant Arab populations.\n\nNetanyahu, who long ago earned a reputation as Israel\u2019s ultimate political survivor, in his final days in office tried to peel off defectors, hoping to deprive the nascent coalition of its wafer-thin legislative majority, to no avail.\n\nHe accused Bennett of \u201cfraud\u201d for siding with rivals, and angry rallies by the premier\u2019s Likud party supporters resulted in security being bolstered for some lawmakers.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s opponents accused him and his allies of stoking tensions in a \u201cscorched-earth\u201d campaign.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s bombastic remarks as he saw his grip on power slip drew parallels at home and abroad to former US president Donald Trump, who described his election loss last year as the result of a rigged vote.\n\nSunday\u2019s vote came at a time of heightened tensions in the Israel-Palestinian conflict, which has grown more bitter in the Netanyahu years, in part due to the expansion of settlements considered illegal under international law in the occupied West Bank.\n\nMeanwhile, right-wing anger has grown in Israel over last week\u2019s postponement of a controversial Jewish nationalist march through flashpoint areas of east Jerusalem.\n\nThe \u201cMarch of the Flags\u201d is now slated for Tuesday, and the agitation surrounding it could represent a key initial test for a new coalition government.\n\nGaza\u2019s rulers Hamas said that the political developments in Jerusalem wouldn\u2019t change its relationship with Israel.\n\n\u201cThe form the Israeli government takes doesn\u2019t change the nature of our relationship,\u201d said the group\u2019s spokesman Fawzi Barhoum.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still a colonising and occupying power that we must resist.\u201d\n\nAFP",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nAn armed robbery attack has been foiled by operatives of the Nigeria Police Force in Zamfara State.\n\nThe standoff which took place on Sunday along Gusau-Sokoto Road, near Dogon Karfe in Bakura LGA, led to the killing of many bandits who engaged the police for about four hours.\n\nAccording to a communique by state police spokesman SP Mohammed Shehu, the robbers planned to rob innocent commuters of their valuables but were valiantly repelled by police tactical operatives deployed to safeguard the road against any invasion by criminal elements.\n\nShehu disclosed that many bandits were fatally injured with some of them believed to have escaped with gun injuries. He further noted that the corpses of those killed have been properly taken care of.\n\nThe spokesman said the road is now cleared for motorists and other road users with rigorous confidence-building patrol being intensified to avert hitches.\n\nTactical operatives including special forces personnel are, however, still combing the surrounding forest to ensure that the fleeing assailants are either apprehended or neutralized.\n\nREAD ALSO: Democracy Day: Use Of Teargas Was In Line With Global Standards \u2013 Police\n\nAt least 53 killed\n\nSunday\u2019s foiled attack comes barely two days after at least 53 persons were killed in an attack by bandits on some villages in Zamfara State leading to the cancellation of activities lined up for the Democracy Day celebration in the state.\n\nScores of motorcycle-riding gunmen called bandits earlier on Thursday through Friday, invaded the villages of Kadawa, Kwata, Maduba, Ganda Samu, Saulawa and Askawa in the Zurmi district, shooting residents.\n\nThe gang attacked farmers in their fields and pursued others who fled to escape the assaults.\n\nZamfara police spokesman Mohammed Shehu said 14 bodies had been taken to the state capital Gusau on Friday, and added that \u201cpolicemen deployed in the area following the attacks.\u201d\n\nLocal residents said 39 more bodies had been recovered and buried in the neighbouring town of Dauran.\n\n\u201cWe recovered 28 bodies yesterday and 11 more this morning from the villages and buried them here,\u201d said Dauran resident Haruna Abdulkarim.\n\n\u201cIt was dangerous to conduct the funeral there because the bandits are harbouring in the Zurmi forest and could return to attack the funeral,\u201d said another resident, Musa Arzika who reported the same death toll.\n\nVillages in the Zurmi district have been repeatedly raided by bandits, and local residents blocked a major highway last week, calling on the authorities to end the attacks.\n\nIn reaction to this, Governor Bello Matawalle suspended the Emir of Zurmi, Atiku Abubakar Muhammad.\n\nThe governor also cancelled all activities line up for the Democracy Day celebration and condemned the attack.\n\n\u201cPeople should remain calm and gentle, as well as go about their normal businesses. Security agents have been mobilised to the affected communities and directed to deal ruthlessly with anyone found disrupting the peace being enjoyed by our people.\n\n\u201cThe government deemed it necessary to suspend all the activities lined up for the democracy day for now, until further notice,\u201d the statement read in part.\n\nThe governor asked residents to use Democracy Day to reflect and continue to pray for the intervention of God Almighty, to restore lasting peace in our state, region, and the country in general.\n\nThings Are Getting Worse By The Day\n\nIn his reaction to the tragic incident within Zurmi District, Governor Bello Matawalle on Saturday said the state of insecurity in the state is worsening at an alarming rate.\n\n\u201cI feel saddened by this unfortunate and barbaric act of cowardice,\u201d he said. \u201cWith a heavy heart, I convey my condolences on behalf of my family and the entire people of the State over this massacre.\n\n\u201cIn recent weeks, the act of banditry has reverted to the ugly dimensions it had prior to the coming of my administration. The marauders kill without regard for any rules of sanity. Women, the elderly, and children are not spared. As a result, a large number of people have been displaced in nearly every town in the State.\n\n\u201cMy dear people of Zamfara people, you are witnesses to what we have accomplished from the beginning of our administration, particularly the peace and reconciliation efforts that we initiated and achieved. As a result, we have been able to shift our violent narratives to ones of optimism and peaceful coexistence.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, things suddenly took a dramatic turn, and things are getting worse by the day. It is clear that some invincible hands are plotting evil against our people with the goal of making our State as terrifying as it were in the years gone by. My constant prayer is for Allah to reveal those who are perpetrating these cruel atrocities against our people,\u201d Matawalle stated.\n\nThe Governor urged communities to defend themselves against the bandits while pledging his administration\u2019s commitment to securing the state.",

          "title": "NPFL 21: Nasarawa Utd Creates Goal-scoring Record, Fans Trouble Halt Play in Kaduna",
          "text": "Nasarawa United have continued their fine goal-scoring run in the Nigeria Professional Football League with a 2-0 victory over Plateau United on matchday 27 in Lafia.\n\nThe Solid Miners have scored 37 goals this season, the highest recorded by a team this season. Today in Lafia they made it back-to-back league wins, consolidating on the 3-1 win they achieved over Warri Wolves.\n\nThe game against Plateau United was tight at the start and failed to produce goals at half-time. In the second half, coach Bala Nikyu\u2019s team turned up and heat and took the lead in the 51st minute through Chinedu Ohanachom\u2019s goal. It was Ohanachom\u2019s fifth goal of the season.\n\nThe home side weren\u2019t done. They upped the game and pressurized the visitors till they were awarded a penalty in the 58th minute. The in-form Silas Nwankwo took the responsibility and scored to seal victory for the hosts. That was Nwankwo\u2019s 11th goal of the season.\n\nFans Trouble In Kaduna Again\n\nNasarawa United will have to wait to confirm their position on the league table because of the game at the Ahmadu Bello Stadium between Kano Pillars and Akwa United wasn\u2019t concluded due to crowd trouble. Match proceedings were going on fine until the 84th minute when Nyima Nwagua scored a goal that was ruled offside. The centre referee was trying to clarify the decision with his assistant when fans encroached the pitch and the match was abandoned.\n\nThe match was goalless at the time it was halted and will be concluded tomorrow morning. If it ends goalless, Nasarawa United will move to second on the log with 48 points while Akwa United will top the table with 49 points.\n\nA similar incident happened at the Ahmadu Bello Stadium. Precisely on matchday 25. Kano Pillars beat 2-1 and the moment Ifeanyi Eze scored the winner, the fans took over the pitch. The fans\u2019 presence was also felt on the pitch when the final whistle went off. This is a breach of the Nigeria Football Federation directive that fans should not be allowed into match venues in order to respect safety rules and protocols and limiting the spread of the Coronavirus.\n\nThe League Management Company and the Nigeria Football Federation are yet to make an official statement on the fans\u2019 trouble that happened in Kaduna on matchday 25 and today\u2019s incident.\n\nFestival Of Goals\n\nKatsina United produced arguably the most shocking result of the matchday beating Enyimba FC 3-1 at the Muhammadu Dikko Stadium. Before half-time, the hosts were leading 3-0. Samuel Kalu opened scoring in the 19th minute while Rasheed Ahmed doubled the lead in the 38th minute. Just before half-time Mahmud Abdulwasiu scored to give the Changi Boys a comfortable lead into the break.\n\nAnayo Iwuala pulled one back for the People\u2019s Elephant but the damage was already done. This is their 7th defeat of the season and the first time Enyimba will be conceding 3 goals in the league since January 2020 when they lost 4-0 to Plateau United.\n\nIndeed, matchday 27 produced a festival of goals. In Enugu, Rangers International Football Club got their league campaign back on track with a 4-1 spanking of Sunshine Stars. Ifeanyi Nweke, Israel Abia , Godspower Aniefiok and Ibrahim Olawoyin scored goals for the Flying Antelopes to record the 12th win of the season.\n\nIn Bauchi, Wikki Tourists and FC Ifeanyi Ubah produced a 7-goal thriller. The goals kept pouring in. Nafizi Yahaya scored hat-trick to give the hosts victory. But when they were getting complacent at 4-0, the visitors started a late fight. Under 12 minutes, Ekene Awazie scored a brace while Nonso Nzediegwu scored one in the 90th minute. They would have gotten something out of the match if there was more time but they started the comeback fight too late. It\u2019s just the 7th win of the season for Wikki Tourists but it\u2019s huge relief for a team hoping to avoid the drop.\n\nThe Giant Killers\n\nDakkada FC and Adamawa United earned the giant killers tag with their impressive performances.\n\nAfter losing 1-0 to Sunshine Stars on matchday 26, Dakkada was hoping to avoid back-to-back defeats when they filed out to take on struggling Warri Wolves in Ozoro. Warri Wolves also lost their match, a 3-1 defeat at Nasarawa United. Due to inconsistent league results, the Warri based are also battling to keep top flight status. Pre-match analysis favoured Warri Wolves to beat Dakkada.\n\nBut beating big teams is not new to the \u2018small\u2019 team from Uyo. Last season, they beat Rangers 2-0 at the Cathedral in Enugu. This season, they\u2019ve beaten FC Ifeanyi Ubah in an away fixture and were seeking a second away win.\n\nThe game in Ozoro witnessed both sides creating chances but the no goal was scored until the 61st minute when Kareem Abdoulaye scored for the visitors. Warri Wolve pushed and searched for the equaliser but it didn\u2019t come. Dakkada won 1-0 to add to the woes of the home side that have lost 14 games this season and not battling relegation.\n\nAdamawa United confirmed they will not go down without a fight. Coach Justin Magudu\u2019s team sits comfortably at the bottom of the league table with just 16 points from 26 matches. They lost their last match 2-1 to Enyimba but today, against Rivers United, they were ready to prove a point. And they did!\n\nAn early goal scored by Hassan Surajo gave the \u2018small\u2019 team the lead and just before half-time, Fabian Nworie\u2019s own-goal gave Adamawa United a 2-0 lead into the break. When play resumed, Rivers United couldn\u2019t do much to get back into the game. It finished 2-0. Shocking!\n\nIt\u2019s just a 4th win of the season for Adamawa United and doesn\u2019t make much difference to their survival fight but it\u2019s a victory for the records and seals bragging rights over a big team as Rivers United.\n\nHome Invincibility\n\nA late goal scored by Christopher Nwanze gave Kwara United a crucial 1-0 win over MFM Football Club of Lagos. The win also means the Harmony are still unbeaten at home this season. With Rivers United losing to Adamawa United, the win takes coach Abdullahi Biffo\u2019s team back into the top four. A position they have maintained since the start of the campaign and such consistency confirms their zeal to compete for the league title.\n\nSince losing 1-2 to Nasarawa United on Sunday, 3rd January, Heartland FC have not lost a game at the Dan Anyiam Stadium in Owerri. Today, they held on to a hard fought 2-1 victory over Jigawa Golden Stars.\n\nTwo minutes into the match, Nwaodu Chukwudi scored the first goal for the hosts. With the constant forward play, Coach Fidelis Ilechukwu\u2019s team showed that they wanted the win and moments later, Emeka Atuloma scored the second that sealed the victory. It\u2019s the 10th win of the season for the Naze Millionaires and shoots them into the top ten.\n\nAnother them with home invincibility is Abia Warriors. Since the team moved to Okigwe from matchday 6, the Warriors have won 8 matches out of 11 and drawn 3.

          "text": "Denmark midfielder Christian Eriksen was \u201cgone\u201d before he was resuscitated after suffering a cardiac arrest, the team\u2019s doctor, Morten Boesen, said in a news conference Sunday.\n\nEriksen is in a stable condition after he was taken to a hospital in Copenhagen on Saturday after he collapsed on the pitch during Denmark\u2019s Euro 2020 opener against Finland.\n\n\u201cHe was gone, and we did cardiac resuscitation. It was a cardiac arrest,\u201d Boesen said. \u201cHow close were we [to losing Eriksen]? I don\u2019t know.\n\n\u201cWe got him back after one defibrillator, so that\u2019s quite fast. I\u2019m not a cardiologist, so the details I will leave to the experts at the hospital.\u201d\n\nThe game between Denmark and Finland was halted in the 43rd minute following the incident and was resumed later Saturday, resulting in a 1-0 victory for the Fins with Eriksen being named star of the match.\n\nDenmark boss Kasper Hjulmand said he thought it was wrong for players to be asked if they wanted to continue the match following the incident.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s very difficult,\u201d Hjulmand said. \u201cBut looking back it was the wrong thing to make the decision between the two scenarios to the players in this case.\n\n\u201cPlayers were in a shock condition. Players who didn\u2019t really know yet if they had lost their best friend. And they have to decide between these two things. And I have a sense that we shouldn\u2019t have played.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s difficult. It\u2019s just a feeling I have. Maybe we should have just gone on to the bus and gone home and let\u2019s see what the next days would have brought.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just my feeling now, but I think it was a very, very tough decision that the players had to try to make a decision. I know it\u2019s difficult, but I have a sense that it was wrong for the players to be given this situation.\u201d\n\nEriksen had just played a short pass when he fell facedown onto the ground and was given urgent medical attention for around 10 minutes. UEFA announced shortly after that the game had been suspended.\n\nThe midfielder was eventually carried off to a loud ovation, with his teammates walking next to the stretcher.\n\nUEFA said both teams had held an emergency meeting before deciding to continue playing, with Mathias Jensen replacing Eriksen in the lineup for the resumption of the fixture.\n\nHjulmand said the team spoke to Eriksen before resuming the game, adding that the Inter Milan midfielder was more focused on his teammates.\n\n\u201cTypically, Christian he was concerned about us and, of course, his family. He said \u2018I don\u2019t remember much\u2019 and \u2018I\u2019m more concerned about you guys, how are you doing?\u2019 That\u2019s typical Christian. That just shows that these big players and their generosity. He\u2019s a hell of a player, but what a person he is as well.\u201d\n\nUEFA president Aleksander Ceferin said in a statement on Saturday: \u201cMoments like this put everything in life into perspective. I wish Christian a full and speedy recovery and pray his family has strength and faith.\u201d\n\nHjulmand said he will assess his players\u2019 readiness to play again before their Group B game against Belgium on Thursday. \u201cWe will try tomorrow to establish normality as much as is possible,\u201d Hjulmand added. \u201cPlayers have different kinds of shocks and traumas and emotions.\n\n\u201cWe will try to use the next couple of days as good as possible. I will try to get a feeling of the players. Maybe for some, the time is too short to be able to play football again.\n\n\u201cWe will try to use it as a force to get even closer together and do our best in the next match. And I have a sense that we will be able to really get together and do our best. So try to reach normality in the training and do our best against Belgium.\u201d",

          "text": "Israel\u2019s parliament has put an end to Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s 12-year-long tenure as prime minister in a vote on Sunday, approving in his stead an administration that has pledged to heal a nation bitterly divided over the departure of the country\u2019s longest-serving leader.\n\nNaftali Bennett was sworn in as Israel\u2019s new prime minister after winning a confidence vote with the narrowest of margins, just 60 votes to 59.\n\nAfter four elections in two years, Bennett\u2019s incoming government breaks a long political deadlock and ushers in the most diverse coalition Israel has ever seen, including the first Arab party to serve in the government. In his speech before the Knesset confidence vote, Bennett celebrated the diversity and warned of polarization within the country.\n\n\u201cTwice in history, we have lost our national home precisely because the leaders of the generation were not able to sit with one and another and compromise.

Once again, however, Netanyahu could not cobble together a governing coalition with a majority of the 120 members of Knesset.\n\nUS President Joe Biden on Sunday congratulated Bennett in his first statement about the political situation in Israel, saying he looked forward to working with the new prime minister.\n\n\u201cIsrael has no better friend than the United States,\u201d Biden also wrote in his statement.\n\n\u201cThe bond that unites our people is evidence of our shared values and decades of close cooperation and as we continue to strengthen our partnership, the United States remains unwavering in its support for Israel\u2019s security.\n\n\u201cMy administration is fully committed to working with the new Israeli government to advance security, stability, and peace for Israelis, Palestinians, and people throughout the broader region.\u201d",

          "text": "Israel Adesanya got back to his winning ways on Sunday with an outstanding five-round showing in the UFC 263 main event\n\nMarvin Vettori believed he won his 2018 clash with Adesanya and never stopped calling for a rematch with the man who would go on to become UFC middleweight champion. Vettori got his rematch on Saturday night in the main event of UFC 263 and came up empty, with Adesanya taking a clear decision victory at Gila River Arena in Glendale, Arizona.\n\nVettori had only a few successful moments in the fight, scoring with a handful of takedowns, but Adesanya showcased improved grappling skills as he escaped back to his feet every time, including spinning out of a rear-naked choke attempt to end up in top position. Outside of those fleeting moments for Vettori, the fight was all Adesanya as he worked Vettori over with a steady diet of leg kicks.\n\nThose leg kicks took the explosiveness out of Vettori\u2019s takedown attempts, leaving him to spend much of the championship rounds leaning forward, clinging to Adesanya\u2019s legs while not being able to put the fight back on the ground. This drew taunts from Adesanya and boos from the crowd.\n\nEven with the fight clearly having gone Adesanya\u2019s way, after the final horn, the two briefly exchanged words, with Vettori claiming to have done enough to win the fight.\n\nIn the end, Adesanya took every round on all three official scorecards, winning by scores of 50-45 across the board. Adesanya has now successfully defended the 185-pound championship three times and rebounded from a loss in his previous fight, an attempt to become a two-division champion when he went to light heavyweight to face 205-pound champion Jan Blachowicz.\n\nAfter his victory, Adesanya called for a rematch with Robert Whittaker, the man he defeated to become champion.\n\n\u201cWhittaker, my arch-nemesis, Bobby,\u201d Adesanya said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the f\u2014 is gonna happen with COVID. We need to run that back in Auckland, in my territory this time. I\u2019ll tell you what it is, I get to decide, you don\u2019t get to decide, because why?

          "title": "Despite Cryptocurrency Ban, Twitter CEO Dorsey Says Nigerians Will Lead Bitcoin Charge",
          "text": "According to Mr Okung owing to the unstable current global economic environment, the fate of the Nigerian economy lies in the hands of global central bankers who do not represent the best interests of the Nigerian people.\n\nThe NFL star had asked the Nigerian government to adopt a national bitcoin standard or risk falling behind and its citizens excluded from the possibility of significant wealth creation and preservation.\n\nTwitter CEO and billionaire co-founder Jack Dorsey, is extremely bullish on the future of bitcoin in Nigeria. He says Nigerians will lead bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value. \u201cThe people of Nigeria will lead #bitcoin \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddec,\u201d he said in a tweet on Sunday.\n\nThe letter reads: \u201cThe hope of Nigeria lies within this generation. I am proudly a Nigerian descendant living in America and am a proponent of Bitcoin. I write to urge the Nigerian government to pursue economic independence and financial sovereignty by pursuing a national Bitcoin standard. Soon every nation will be faced with this decision, but those who seize the present moment proactively as we have just witnessed in El Salvador, will enjoy significant advantages globally for generations to come.\n\n\u201cIt is no secret that the current global economic environment is worrisome and unsustainable. Sadly, the fate of the Nigerian economy is in the hands of global central bankers who do not represent the best interests of the Nigerian people. Despite the challenges we face, the resilience of Nigerians continues to inspire. The Nigerian society enjoys more favorable conditions than many of its neighbors. However, even greater opportunity awaits with the adoption of national action in favor of a Bitcoin standard.\n\n\u201cThe tone of this letter is meant to convey urgency both in terms of the forthcoming economic despair and the limited window to act on this opportunity with fierce boldness and strong leadership. While the challenges of COVID-19 and increased global unrest continue to instill fear in the hearts and minds of citizens everywhere, Nigerians can claim international greatness by rising to the occasion that our unique times require.\n\n\u201cNations such as Iran, Russia, China and Kenya have been reportedly mining or otherwise utilizing bitcoin, often as a means to circumvent U.S. sanctions which prevent them from full participation in the global financial system. Other nations like Barbados, Singapore and Malta have moved to become \u201cbitcoin friendly\u201d in an effort to attract wealth and human capital through migration. And this week, El Salvador became the world\u2019s first nation to require merchants to accept bitcoin as legal tender. I\u2019m proposing an equally aggressive approach to national Bitcoin adoption which would significantly bolster every sector of the Nigerian economy and revitalize the spirit of every Nigerian domestically and abroad.\u201d\n\nIn the letter the NFL star says what\u2019s needed for the Nigerian economy to be reshaped is bold leadership with clear vision for a new future as the country does not need to ask for permission from any other nation nor acquire a license nor secure a trade agreement from any corporation to reshape its economy with Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is not controlled, managed or operated by any single entity. It is an innovation that will surpass the automobile or the internet in terms of its impact on humanity. Nigeria does not need to ask for permission from any other nation nor acquire a license nor secure a trade agreement from any corporation to reshape its economy with Bitcoin. All that is required is a vision for a new future and an allocation of its own national resources to pursue a Bitcoin standard,\u201d Mr Okung told the Nigerian government.\n\n\u201cThe primary reason for urgently pursuing and executing a national plan for adoption is the finite supply of bitcoin. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin in circulation. This hard cap on the supply makes bitcoin even more verifiably finite than gold. As this simple yet unique property of scarcity becomes more widely understood, the economic laws of supply and demand will create a global frenzy to acquire as much bitcoin as possible, before it\u2019s too late. This momentum for acquiring bitcoin is already underway throughout the world and it is rapidly accelerating. In recent months, continued economic turmoil and uncertainty has created increased curiosity in bitcoin.\n\n\u201cMultiple institutional investors have announced sizable bitcoin allocations in their portfolios, some citing it as a hedge against a weakening U.S. dollar.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian government, along with every other government in the world, has a once in a generation opportunity to claim global prominence by rising to the occasion. Many other politicians in Latin America have signalled their intention to pursue similar moves as El Salvador.\n\n\u201cIn leading the next global financial shift, Nigeria can create prosperity for its citizens in a manner that requires no bloodshed, no election and no resistance. Such a proposition may seem too good to be true, and these ambitions certainly require thorough investigation, scrutiny and debate. Conversely, a delay in pursuing a national plan for bitcoin adoption will risk a scenario where Nigeria is left behind and its citizens excluded from the possibility of significant wealth creation and preservation.\n\n\u201cAs world leaders become more aware of the chance to make history, pursuit of bitcoin will be widespread. We offer our full support, a willingness to voluntarily consult and commitment to activate every resource available to us in order to see Nigeria pursue a Bitcoin standard.\n\n\u201cNigeria must never carry last.\u201d\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",
