          "text": "The Authority of the Heads of State and Government of the Economic Community of West African States will convene an emergency meeting to find a solution to the worsening political situation in Mali, following the overthrow of the interim President and Prime Minister of the country by the military.\n\nThe Chairman of the Authority and President of Ghana, Nana Akufo-Addo, said this during the opening of the 2021 First Extra Ordinary Session of the ECOWAS Parliament in Abuja on Thursday.\n\nHe condemned the military coup in Mali led by Col. Asimi Goita on Monday.\n\nMali\u2019s Interim President Bah Ndaw and Prime Minister Moctar Ouane were overthrown and taken to a military base outside the capital on Monday after a cabinet reshuffle in which two officers lost their posts.\n\nThis development that sparked international condemnation comes nine months after former President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita was overthrown in a coup amid a worsening crisis in the beleaguered West African country.\n\nThe deposed President and Prime Minister were reported to have resigned on Wednesday and released on Thursday.\n\nSpeaking further on the incident, the Ghanaian President said, \u201cMy take is that we should call on the immediate Extraordinary Summit of the Authority of ECOWAS Heads of State and Governments which is responsible for ironing out the transitional arrangement to decide on the way forward for ECOWAS and Mali.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Community will be kept fully abreast on development on the situation\u201d, Akufo-Addo added.\n\nHe, however, noted that as Chair of the Authority, he already sent a high-level mediation team led by former President Goodluck Jonathan to look into the crisis but was yet to receive reports on the situation.\n\nSpeaker of the ECOWAS Parliament Hon. Sidie Mohammed Tunis, who also condemned the coup, said that the recurring junta in the country was a threat to democracy in the region. He added that the Parliament, like other ECOWAS Institutions, has taken several steps to restore democratic rule in Mali.\n\n\u201cWe have made many efforts in securing a peaceful and stable ECOWAS and it is about time we take firm and decisive actions against forces that tend to reverse this trend.\n\n\u201cThe ECOWAS Parliament stands ready to support all efforts aimed at putting Mali on the right trajectory of peace and democracy,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\n\u2026Says 2023 polls threatened\n\n\u2026As Olanipekun advocates true federalism, judicial reform\n\n\u2026Constitution Review waste of public funds \u2014Afenifere\n\nBy Dayo Johnson & Olasunkanmi Akoni\n\nHUMAN rights lawyer, Femi Falana, SAN, yesterday, expressed worry that the 2023 general elections could be jeopardised because some parts of the country are experiencing what he described as a civil war.\n\nAlso, former president of the Nigeria Bar Association, NBA, Wole Olanipekun, SAN, has advocated true federalism and immediate reform in the judicial system, among others.\n\nThe duo said this at the final sitting of the Senate Committee on the review of the 1999 Constitution South-West Zonal Public Hearing, Lagos Center, held in Ikeja.\n\nIn his presentation, Falana condemned the rate of impunity in the country.\n\nThis, however, came on a day the pan-Yoruba socio-political organization, Afenifere, described the ongoing process of amending the 1999 Constitution as an exercise in futility that cannot achieve any meaningful result.\n\nBut Falana, in his presentation, said: \u201cOur country is ruled by the rule of the rulers, and not rule of law. People commit all manner of crime and get away with it because there are no sanctions. This must change. The Social Security Bill must also work, so that jobless people can get stipends, pending when they get full employment.\n\n\u201cWhat can we do very quickly to save this country which is on the verge of collapse? If you don\u2019t want people to break away from Nigeria, we must give them confidence and a sense of belonging, don\u2019t declare war.\n\n\u201cTherefore, for the constitutional amendment to be fruitful, for us to have genuine outputs from this meeting, peace must reign. We must address Nigeria\u2019s problem frontally. We must also give people the confidence of peace and inclusion if we must kill the cries for secession. Don\u2019t declare war.\n\n\u201cIn fact, in some parts of the country, the 2023 elections are already threatened.\n\n\u201cINEC offices are being burnt, police stations are being burnt. In that kind of atmosphere, we cannot pretend that there is political stability in our country.\n\n\u201cEssentially, I am making a case for the poor, the masses of our people who are generally not represented in fora of this nature which are most times for the elites and privileged among our people.\n\n\u201cUnless we are prepared to make these provisions justiciable and enforceable, this country will know no peace.\n\n\u201cWhatever constitution will come forth after now must make justiciable the fundamental objectives and directive principles of state without which there will be no political stability in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, Mr. Olanipekun, represented by his son, Oladapo, said the Electoral Act should be amended to allow governorship election cases to terminate at the Supreme Court.\n\nThis, he said, is important to stem the tide of conflicting judgments arising from Appeal Courts.\n\nConstitution Review waste of public funds \u2014Afenifere\n\nMeanwhile, Afenifere\u2019s Secretary-General, Mr. Sola Ebiseni, who addressed newsmen in Akure, said an amendment of the constitution will not cure the anomalies in the country.\n\nEbiseni said: \u201cAfenifere believes in and advocates fundamental restructuring of Nigeria for the reinvention of a constitution as the agreed principles of governing Nigeria and its diverse ethnic nationalities by our founding fathers, which will ultimately replace the imposed 1999 unitary constitution.\n\n\u201cAmending the constitution is an exercise in futility and a waste of time and public fund.\u201d\n\nBesides, he said: \u201cWe cannot claim to be the Federal Republic and be governed by a unitary constitution. We cannot claim to be in a democracy and be governed by a constitution that does not emanate from the people.\n\n\u201cAmendment will not cure the anomalies. You cannot put something on anything and expect it to stand.\n\n\u201cEvery session of the two arms of the National Assembly, since 2007, has embarked on the same jamboree of constitutional amendment spending public funds on public hearings, without any result.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly is part of the issue to be determined in the process of restructuring and cannot legitimately be the judge in such exercise.\u201d\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\n\u2026Allegation is false \u2014APC Chairman, Ebonyi\n\n\u2026People should stop dragging govt into every issue \u2014 Commissioner\n\n\u2026Activist declared missing in Ebonyi\n\nBy Peter Okutu & Dirisu Yakubu\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, yesterday, raised the alarm over alleged killings of its members in Ebonyi state.\n\nThe main opposition party also said some of its members and leaders in the state were being harassed and accused of phoney criminal acts by the All Progressives Congress, APC-led government in the state.\n\nAddressing newsmen at the party\u2019s secretariat, Abuja, national publicity secretary of the party, Kola Ologbondiyan said Governor Dave Umahi has been firm in his consistent intimidation of PDP leaders in Ebonyi for simply refusing to defect with him to the APC.\n\n\u201cOn the 30th of November 2020, one of our members, Mr. Shedrack Nwode, a native of Umuezoka, along with his fianc\u00e9e were shot dead by thugs suspected to be working for the APC, for refusing to chant \u2018APC, Change\u2019 at a traditional wedding ceremony.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, on Friday, 4th of December 2020, three prominent supporters of PDP from Ugwulangwu in Governor Umahi\u2019s own Local Government Area, were arrested on trump-up charges of being cultists.\n\n\u201cDuring a recent courtesy call on the governor of Ebonyi State, Engr. Dave Umahi in Abakaliki by the Police Assistant Inspector General (AIG) Zone 9, Mr. Okon, the governor openly and without any investigation, criminally accused prominent leaders of our party, including, Sen. Anyim Pius Anyim, Senator Sam Egwu, Chief Ali Odefa, Hon. Linus Okorie among others as sponsors of banditry and violence in the state.\n\n\u201cIt is already common knowledge that agents of the Governor Umahi-led administration had gathered known cultists and thugs and armed them with dangerous weapons including pump action riffles to be unleashed on innocent citizens, particularly members of the opposition.\n\n\u201cThese agents of APC government in Ebonyi State have also resorted to using the thugs to disrupt the meetings of our party as well as foist a reign of terror in the state, wherein thugs have taken over the streets and openly extort money from helpless motorists.\n\n\u201cOnly recently, a member of our party, Barr. Amos Ogbonnaya, who refused to join Governor Umahi to the APC was abducted and later released with life threatening injuries after much public outcry. He is still in the intensive care unit of a hospital.\n\n\u201cThough Ogbonnaya recognized his abductors as state government agents and reported to the Police and the Department of State Services, DSS, no arrests have been made to bring the perpetrators to book,\u201d Ologbondiyan said.\n\nAccording to the publicity scribe, Chief Henry C. Udeh (Ajim Best), from Okposi in Ohaozara Local Government Area \u201cwas brutally attacked for daring to hold PDP meeting in his own house and many valuables, including vehicles were destroyed.\u201d\n\nHe also said the party was in receipt of a report that a PDP member, Prince Anyigor Methuselah of Ezza North \u201chas been abducted and is reportedly being kept at the Cabinet Office of the old Government House in Ebonyi State.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cOur party further alerts Nigerians of Governor Umahi\u2019s resort to labelling opposition voices in the state as cultists and terrorist elements as a ploy to victimize members of our party as well as incite federal security agencies against our leaders.\n\n\u201cGovernor Umahi\u2019s suppressive government is now sealing off homes and businesses of PDP members all in a bid to cow and silence them.\n\n\u201cA hotel belonging to former governor Sam Egwu has been sealed up while a private school belonging to another member of the PDP, Barr. Friday Agbom was also sealed on trumped up charges.\n\n\u201cAs a party, we are worried over the vexatious disposition of Governor Umahi towards the opposition, dissenting voices and other innocent citizens in the state; a development that has heightened security concerns and capable of triggering a huge crisis that can destabilize the state.\n\n\u201cThe action of the APC-led government has also foisted a reign of terror in the state, crippled economic activities and brought untold hardship to the people.\n\n\u201cSince Governor Umahi realized that he is alone in his political voyage in the APC, he has been in distress, having been left in the cold and as such, seeks to decimate the opposition and disrupt peaceful coexistence in the state.\n\n\u201cOur party counsels Governor Umahi to have only himself to blame for his self-inflicted political woes, instead of seeking to drag down and destroy the entire state because of his botched political ambition.\n\n\u201cThe PDP also cautions Governor Umahi to note that the people of Ebonyi State can never be intimidated or cowed by the APC and its external backers, who are looking for every means to cause mayhem and ruin the state for their political gains.\n\n\u201cOur party calls on all our members in Ebonyi to remain calm even as we caution Governor Umahi to note that human history has always shown that there is a limit to which a people can bear in the face of open aggression and intimidation.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore imperative for the Inspector General of Police as well as the military high command to note the antics of the Umahi-led administration in the state and take urgent steps to protect the innocent citizens so as to save the state from imminent collapse.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, PDP national vice chairman (South-East), Ali Odefa said Governor Umahi, having realized that highly-placed party members failed to defect with him, has resorted to cheap blackmail and intimidating tactics.\n\nHe challenged the governor to test his popularity on the ballot after his second term in office on the platform of the APC to prove to Nigerians his electoral mileage.\n\nPolitical affiliation, he noted, is a matter of choice, stressing that the people of Ebonyi State do not deserve to be punished for electing to remain in the PDP when the governor left for the ruling party.\u201c\n\nAllegation is false \u2014Ebonyi APC Chairman\n\nBut reacting to the allegation, the state Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in Ebonyi State, Chief Stanley Okoro Emegha described the allegation by the PDP as false.\n\nThe APC chieftain who doubles as the Commissioner for Internal Security and Border Peace requested that the PDP should give details of their allegation instead of looking for cheap blackmail against the administration of Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf there any clear details of where somebody was killed, then we can respond to it. It is not only APC people that my office is to protect; the state government is protecting every citizen of Nigeria in Ebonyi State.\n\n\u201cThe government is to protect all the citizens of the state and so, if we have details of such killing, then we can now follow it up. When you don\u2019t have details, how do you brief? Where did they kill the person, you can\u2019t say?\n\n\u201cTell them that the chairman of APC who doubles as the Commissioner for Internal Security said that the information is false. They should give details of how the persons and where the persons were killed.\n\n\u201cThere should be details. What is the person\u2019s name? Who was the person that was killed? Where was the person killed? Which local government was the person killed? Who is the person reporting to them that their people are being killed?\n\n\u201cIs it not when they want to talk, so that the PDP at the national will know that they are existing that they will start making up such falsehood.\u201d\n\nActivist declared missing in Ebonyi\n\nMeantime, the activist, Anyigor Methuselah Maduabuchi from Ugalaba in Umuogharu, Ezza North Local Government Area of Ebonyi State, was yesterday declared missing.\n\nHis younger brother, Anyigor Ifesinachi Daniel, who spoke to Journalists in Abakaliki on Wednesday evening, said he was last seen last Saturday, after he left home for a burial in Afikpo North LGA of the state.\n\nThe victim\u2019s younger brother said he dialed his mobile number on Saturday after he waited for his return to no avail, but an unknown person picked the call and warned him never to call the line again.\n\nThe victim, according to the younger brother, is a popular social media activist and crusader. He said he had reported the matter to the Police and the Department of State Services. Maduabuchi, according to the brother, is about 28 years old.\n\n\u201cMy brother, Anyigor Methuselah Maduabuchi last Saturday told me he was going to a burial at Afikpo North LGA and we scheduled to go somewhere by 12 o\u2019clock when he returns from the burial and by the time I called him to know if we would still go to the place, his phone was ringing but he was not picking. I kept on calling to no avail.\n\n\u201cIn the evening of that day, I called again and somebody picked the call and I asked the person to give the phone to the owner but he shunned me and threatened me not to call the number again. I hung the call.\n\n\u201cI have dialed his number several times since then and it has not been going through. Apart from that, I have not got any other useful information about his abduction.\n\n\u201cHe used to post a lot about bad governance on Facebook and had been getting attacks and threats from people believed to be supporters of government. That\u2019s why I decided to report to the media to help me. I have also reported the matter to the police and the Department of State Services.\n\nHowever, the state Commissioner for Internal Security, Mr Stanley Okoro Emegha denied knowledge of the alleged abduction, warning that people should stop dragging government into every issue.\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\n\u2026Says some suspected IPOB/ESN\u2019s sponsors in custody\n\n\u2026Adds: We\u2019ve arrested 1,166 high-profile persons, attackers of Ortom\n\nBy Johnbosco Agbakwuru\n\nActing Inspector-General of Police, IGP, Alkali Usman Baba, yesterday, said the disbandment of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, SARS, has created a vacuum in the efforts of the Nigeria Police to tackle insecurity in the country.\n\nLamenting that the aftermath of the #EndSARS protest has dampened the morale of personnel, he said the regular policemen and women have not been able to immediately fill the vacuum created by the disbanded SARS, even though he said efforts are ongoing to train them for the new role.\n\nFinanciers of IPoB, ESN, nabbed \u2014 IGP\n\nSpeaking at the briefing organized by the Presidential Communications Team at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, the Police boss also said some alleged sponsors/financiers of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB and the Eastern Security Network, ESN, had been arrested.\n\nBesides, the IGP said no fewer than 1,166 high-profile suspects were arrested nationwide between April and May, 2021, as well as those who attacked Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State, recently.\n\nThe IGP said the police are looking at the involvement of suspected IPOB/ESN sponsors in their custody and those outside the country, adding that after a thorough investigation, they would be arraigned in court.\n\nHe also said the police had recorded successes against secessionists and suspected criminals in the South-East, adding that suspects in the police custody couldn\u2019t be prosecuted because of the ongoing strike by judiciary workers.\n\nRecruitment of new cops going on\n\nOn the plan to recruit 10,000 new police personnel, he revealed that the process had reached 70 per cent, assuring that the exercise would be in line with the Federal Character principle. The Police boss said that parading of suspects was a way of updating the public on their efforts to curb criminality.\n\nSpeaking on why the police were going after the financiers of IPOB/ESN and not only the boys, he said: \u201cIn any kind of coordinated, targeted and organised crime such as this,you will get leaders behind it, it can be done within or outside the country. \u201cWe in the enforcement of law and order and those in the intelligence community \u2014 that is DMI (Department of Military Intelligence), the DSS (Department of State Service) are all collaborating to make sure that this issue is nipped in the bud.\n\n\u201cSome of them are known, but they\u2019re not within reach to bring them to book. Some are here. We have many in our custody and we are looking into their level of involvement with a view to arraigning them before competent law courts. And the issue of looking for others will continue.\u201d\n\nFielding question on the alleged request of Police officers in South-East seeking redeployment to other zones as a result of incessant attacks on them, he said the police was still studying the narratives.\n\nHe said: \u201c There are two narratives to that. One of the narratives is that there are complaints that the police in the South-East particularly those from that geopolitical zone, are by way of either intimidation from the secessionists, whether they are afraid to work or they have soft spot for what is happening there.\n\n\u201cThese are allegations. And if we have a reasonable belief that there are those who need to be relocated we will do that. But like I told you, if we had removed 10, we must have reinforced with more than 100.\n\n\u201cSo the issue of redeploying them from that place, normally what we do, if place A or B is very hot, and we have D, E and F that are cool, we will take some officers from the cool place and post them to the hot place. That is what we are doing in the South-East and South-Ssouth. That is why if you look at a place like Maiduguri, we have two sets of officers.\n\nThere are those that are fighting along with the military, and there are those that are taken there to maintain civil authority in conditioned or liberated areas.\n\n\u201cSo transfer, postings are normal things in the police but sometimes you will see enmass and sometimes in tranches, there are reasons for it. If you don\u2019t ask, we don\u2019t need to explain it to you.\u201d\n\n\u2018Secessionists, major challenge in S-East\u2019\n\nSpeaking on the security situation in the various parts of the country, the Acting IGP said in the South-East, the major challenges are activities of secessionist groups, the IPOB and the militant group of the IPOB, ESN coordinating violent attacks on security personnel, formations, critical national infrastructure such as INEC facilities and offices.\n\n\u201cThe herders/farmers problem is also in the South-East.\n\nThen the proliferation of weapons and other related violent crimes such as cultism, armed robbery and so on. \u201cWhen you talk about the South-West, we have the same problem of kidnapping, bank robbery, farmers/herders clashes, activities of secessionist groups and cultism.\n\n\u201cIn the North-East, we are facing the problem of banditry, attacks on schools, and abduction of students. It has been kidnapping, highway robbery activities of Boko Haram and ISWAP. While in the North-West it is also almost the same banditry, activities of Boko Haram, kidnapping and proliferation of arms.\n\nIn the North-Central it\u2019s almost the same thing.\n\nOn what the police are doing to check these, he said: \u201cThe security situation of the country has been significantly stabilized from time to time, but you see, if it is stabilised for a week, then there are isolated disturbances coming from this zone in terms of either attack on police facilities or police personnel or even all law enforcement agencies including the military.\n\n\u201cAnd therefore, we decided to rejig the morale of our personnel, which has been a little bit dampened since the EndSARS came and went away.\n\nWith the proscription of SARS and the establishment of SWAT which has not been able to take off fully, we had a vacuum in tackling most of the violent crimes from a position of strength in terms of having a strike force that is dedicated for that, rather than having our conventional police doing the policing in conventional way.\n\n\u201cSo, we try to marshal back this courage of our personnel who have been involved in violent crime and then lectured them and posted them to the anti-robbery sections, for anti robbery patrols and the investigation of violent crimes which involved of course robbery, kidnapping, banditry, cultism and so forth.\n\n\u201cSecondly, we decided to launch an operation which is tagged Operation Restore Peace and we targeted the South-East and South-Ssouth for the first phase of our operation. We are reinforcing these two zones with about 3,700 policemen drawn from our various units which include, police mobile force, the strike force, counter terrorism, the STS, IRT.\n\nThe first operation in the South-East was done on the 18th of this month (May) in Enugu. In the South-South, the operation was launched on the 19th, in Port Harcourt \u2018\u2019He said since the launch of the operations, \u2018\u2019we had respite of policemen defending themselves and also repelling most of these attacks in the South-East and South-South. \u201cWe have had successful repels of attacks, we have had successful arrest, we have had successful recoveries.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cFor record purpose, I can briefly mention our recoveries and the successes after the lunching of this operation, we have been able to recover the following weapons and arms from secessionist and armed insurgents. \u201cOne general purpose machine gun, 10 AK 47 rifles, nine locally made fabricated rifles, four locally fabricated pistols in 19 AK 49 magazines.\n\nWe have recovered over 5,419 live ammunition with 10 improvised explosive devices.\n\n\u201c In terms of arrest, we have 398 armed robbery suspects in our custody, 258 cult related offenders, 222 murder suspects, 202 bandits related matters and the 86 suspects involved in case of kidnapping. \u201cThis statistic I\u2019m giving you is from 7th of April to date. 434 firearms of various descriptions were also recovered.\n\nOn state Police\n\nAsked when state police will start, he said: \u201cIf you look at it technically, I doubt if there is any state that does not have state police even now. What do I mean?\n\nThere are creations that are done by state governments to assist law enforcement agencies in trying to maintain law and order, or enforce regulations or laws that are created by state governments. We have vigilante everywhere in this country. We have various types of organisations that have been created by state governments to assist in policing.\n\n\u201cSome of them had even House of Assembly laws that guide their operations.\n\nThe space is open to everybody. We even always say, policing is not a matter of the Nigerian police, or the Nigerian law enforcement agents, everybody can be involved in policing.\n\n\u201cBut I want to know, the shape that the advocates of state police want it to take and it is an issue that is left for lawmakers and government.\n\nWe\u2019ve arrested Ortom\u2019s attackers\n\nFielding questions on the position of the attack on Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue states, the IGP said that some arrests have been made, adding that the situation wasn\u2019t as the governor presented it.\n\n\u201cWe have been able to uncover the assailants and establish what actually happened contrary to what he said, and we have been able to get these people and know where they came from, how they came but the case is still under investigation. There are some vital things that we have not been able to complete but as for those who would pull the trigger and those who organised the crime, they are with us, they have been arrested.\u201d\n\nWithdrawing police men from politicians\n\nThe IGP said that since he assumed office, he has not ordered for the withdrawal of police officers from political office holders or individuals that have police officers attached to them.\n\nHe said because of the nature of job or responsibility some people carry out, the state is supposed to provide security for them; and the state is supposed to protect citizens, particularly citizens that are vulnerable to attacks or assault because of the nature of their duty.\n\nWhy we parade suspects\n\nWhen asked why police would arrest and parade suspects before trial, he said,\u201d You see, we do this media trial because we have to blow our trumpet. If we don\u2019t blow it, nobody will blow it for us.\u201d\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\n\u2026His appointment as Regular Course 37 officer wipes out Course 35, 36 intakes\n\nBy Kingsley Omonobi\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday appointed Major-General Farouk Yahaya as the new Chief of Army Staff, with about 20 Generals of Regular Course 35 and 36 expected to proceed on retirement.\n\nThe new Army chief, who was appointed to replace late Lt. General Ibrahim Attahiru who died in a place crash in Kaduna last Friday, alongside 10 other military officers, is of Regular Course 37.\n\n\u2018Tradition in the military\u2019\n\nA source said it is the tradition in the military for senior officers to take a bow whenever a junior officer is appointed a COAS, as they cannot be saluting their junior officer.\n\nMajor-General Yahaya\u2019s appointment, right from the position of Brigade Commander to that of Theatre Commander, Operation Hadin Kai, were made by the former Chief of Army Staff, Lt. General Tukur Yusuf Buratai (retd).\n\nWith the Chief of Defence Staff, General Lucky Irabor, being a Regular Course 34 intake, Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Awwal Zubairu Gambo and Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Oladayo Amao both being Regular Course 35 intakes, Major General Yahaya becomes the most junior service chief as Course 37.\n\n20 Course 35, 36 generals face instant retirement\n\nThe implication is that about 20 Major-Generals and Brigadier-Generals made up of five remaining Regular Course 35 intakes and 15 Regular Course 36 intakes would have to give way (proceed on retirement).\n\nThe appointment of Yahaya as Attahiru\u2019s successor, according to sources, was delayed due to search for a competent officer.\n\nA lot of the Generals in Regular Courses 35 and 36 were found to be from the same tribe or state with other security chiefs in the Ministry of Defence, National Security Adviser\u2019s office, the Navy and the Air Force.\n\nFor instance, one of them, Major-General Jamil Sarham, of Regular Course 36, former Commandant Nigerian Defence Academy, NDA, is from Kano, where the Minister of Defence, Major-General Bashir Magashi (retd), and the Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Awwal Gambo, hail from.\n\nSources said the appointment of General Lucky Irabor as Chief of Defence Staff, CDS, from Delta State, took care of South-East and South-South slot, the reason the Chief of Policy and Plans, Major-General Benjamin Ahanotu of Regular Course 35 from Anambra State was not considered for the position of COAS.\n\nArmy Chief of Operations, Major General Ibrahim Manu Yusuf, from Yobe State, was also not considered because he is from the same state as Acting Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, according to sources.\n\nThe man, Farouk Yahaya\n\nPrior to his appointment, Major General Yahaya was the incumbent Theatre Commander of the Counter-Terrorism/Counter-Insurgency military outfit in the North East, code named Operation Hadin Kai.\n\nHe took over from Major-General Olusegun Adeniyi as Theatre Commander, Operation Lafiya Dole on March 31, 2020, before it was renamed Operation Hadin Kai by late Ibrahim Attahiru last month.\n\nHe was General Officer Commanding 1 Division of the Nigerian Army, Kaduna, before his deployment to Operation Hadin Kai.\n\nAt several times, he was Military Secretary, (MS) Army at Army headquarters and Brigade Commander, 4 Brigade, Benin, as a Brigadier-General.\n\nThe new Chief of Army Staff was born on January 5, 1966, in Sifawa, Bodinga Local Government Area of Sokoto State.\n\nHe started his cadet training at NDA on September 27, 1985, and was commissioned into the Nigerian Army Infantry Corps on September 22,1990.\n\nMajor General Yahaya has held several appointments, including Staff, Instructional and Command.\n\nNotable among the appointments held by the new COAS are Garrison Commander Headquarters Guards Brigade, Directing Staff at the Armed Forces Command and Staff College, AFCSC, Deputy Director, Army Headquarters; Department of Military Secretary, Deputy Director, Army Research and Development and the Chief of Staff, Headquarters, Joint Task Force Operation Pulo Shield.\n\nHe also served as the Principal General Staff Officer (PGSO) to the Minister of Defence, the Commander, Headquarters 4 Brigade and 29 Task Force Brigade (Operation Zaman Lafiya).\n\nHe was Director, Manpower at Army Headquarters, Military Secretary, Army Headquarters and General Officer Commanding (GOC) 1 Division of the Nigerian Army.\n\nThe new COAS is a holder of several honours and awards, some of which include Forces Service Star, Meritorious Service Star, Distinguished Service Star, Grand Service Star, Passed Staff Course (Dagger), National Defence Course (Chile), Economic Community of West Africa State Monitoring Group Medal, Command Medal, Field Command Medal, General Operations Medal, Silver Jubilee Medal and Golden Jubilee Medal.\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "The deteriorating security situation in the Federal Capital Territory, particularly the satellite towns may not be unconnected to poor infrastructure in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nAside from the city centre that is well developed and the Area Council headquarters which had acquired the distinction of being tagged glorified villages, satellite towns in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) occupy an unenviable position of housing a high preponderance of FCT population.\n\nThese satellite towns and some parts of the \u2018developed\u2019 areas lack basic technologies such as Closed-circuit Television, CCTV, also known as video surveillance which could aid in tracking criminal activities in the city.\n\nThrough surveillance cameras, the police can both prevent crimes from happening and can quickly solve criminal cases with material evidence.\n\nMany countries in the world now employ public video surveillance as a primary tool to monitor population movements and to prevent crime and terrorism, both in the private and public sectors.\n\nHowever, the situation in Nigeria is totally different as only a few government and private facilities have been able to install the surveillance video.\n\nAnother essential amenity lacking in the city that could also help in tracking criminal activities is the solar street lights.\n\nThe criminal elements usually invade communities and unleash terrors on innocent residents during the dark period.\n\nDAILY POST observed that most deadly attacks that have been carried out in the city recently happened in the dark when the identities of the assailants can hardly be ascertained.\n\nSome of the satellite towns where insecurity is currently ravaging include, Bwari; Kubwa; Karshi; Kuje; Kusaki\u2013Yanga; Dobi; Anagada and Gosa.\n\nSome residents who spoke with DAILY POST correspondent identified lack of CCTV as part of the factors fueling insecurity in the FCT, Abuja.\n\nA trader at the Bwari market, Ngozi A. Johnson lamented the level of criminality in the area, particularly in the market.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cImagine we have CCTV mounted in some strategic areas in the market, we wouldn\u2019t be losing our goods to these mischievous persons who only believe in making themselves rich by stealing what belongs to others.\n\n\u201cI know very well that with the sophisticated technology being employed in other parts of the world, the kind of security situation we experience here in Nigeria wouldn\u2019t have been.\n\n\u201cIt is time for the government to spend more on developing the nation as that will in turn help curtail the security challenges.\u201d\n\nAnother concerned resident, Ahmed Tana, a resident of Kuje told our correspondent that underdevelopment has contributed to the security crisis rocking the nation\u2019s capital.\n\n\u201cIn other countries, whether day or night, everywhere is illuminated and that helps in curtailing crimes in such places.\n\n\u201cEven when crime occurs in those places, investigation is always easy for the security personnel due to technology.\n\n\u201cThere was a robbery somewhere here recently at the main road and no one could identify even the plate-number of the vehicle the armed robbers used because everywhere was dark.\n\n\u201cNigeria needs to wake up and follow other nations as the entire world goes digital\u201d, he said.\n\nEfforts to get comments from the Federal Capital Administration and the FCT Police Command proved abortive as both persons contacted declined speaking with our correspondent.\n\nHowever, the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) in collaboration with the African Development Bank (AfDB) had recently said it was set to urbanise eight FCT satellite towns which includes, Jikwoyi, Gwagwalada, Kuje, Dutsen-Alhaji, Abaji, Orozo, Zuba, and Kwali.\n\nAccording to the FCT Minister of State Dr Ramatu Tijjani Aliyu, the Administration is planning to provide increased budgetary allocation to support critical infrastructure development outside the city centre, notably roads and bridges, water supply and sanitation, primary healthcare and renewable energy solutions, amongst others.\n\n\u201cThe onus is on us to continue to find solutions to the attendant multi-dimensional consequences of rapid urbanisation as we strive to provide liveable spaces both within and outside urban centres,\u201d she said.\n\nBut DAILY POST findings have revealed some of the street lights installed on major highways in the city are mostly not functional, putting the nation\u2019s capital at a high risk of insecurity.\n\nA commercial driver, Ali Yusifu told DAILY POST that most of the street lights don\u2019t work at night, especially at the dead of the night while returning from business.\n\nHe said, \u201d I work mostly at night, but around the dead hour of the night, your heart is in your mouth because everywhere is dark. Is this supposed to be the capital city of a country?\u201d\n\nDAILY POST observes that among the satellite towns in the nation\u2019s capital, only a few streets in Kubwa have solar lights with very weak illuminating capacity. The rest satellite towns always struggle with criminals at night.",

J. Esuene\u2019s stadium, venue of the celebration observed that thousands of school children from various schools across the state were at the stadium.\n\nThe students, some of whom were with their school uniform, came in from Akpabuyo Local Government Area, Calabar South, Calabar Municipal, Odukpani Local Government Area, Akamkpa, Biase and other local government areas of the State were seen roaming the stadium.\n\nOur findings further revealed that no government officials were at the stadium to receive the children as most of them entered some security areas and were driven out by stadium security officials and other staffers working in the stadium.\n\nIt took officials of the stadium several hours to have sent the children out of the stadium as most of them became aggressive and hostile, noting that their day was not celebrated in the State\n\nSeveral efforts to speak with the commissioner for education, Dr Godwin Amanke Ebunshua proved abortive as he was not taking his calls neither did he respond to text messages forwarded to him.\n\nSome of the parents who brought their children to the stadium regretted the action of the state government, noting that they have never witnessed such a situation and blamed it on the movement of Governor Ayade to APC.\n\nBut the Commissioner for Information, Asu Okang lamented the inability of the state ministry of education, \u201cWell, I am not currently in Calabar. I am in Abuja, may be you will direct your question to the Commissioner for Education or Commissioner for Women Affairs. T hey are the people responsible for such engagement.\n\nWhen he was told that some students came in from other local governments such as Akpabuyo, Akamkpa\u2026etc, Okang said he was surprised and shocked that there was no government officials to receive them.\n\n\u201cIt would be an act of falsehood for me to sit down here and tell you that if Children\u2019s Day is not holding in Calabar, I will be happy.\n\n\u201cThese are veritable ingredients that hold us to what we have become today, the only day set out for children, 27 May out of 365 days to celebrate the African child.\n\n\u201cThis is for me one day that is very remarkable. We all participated in it when we were young amd we have no reason as a government to deny our children of this.\n\n\u201cHowever, we also understand the political temperature in the state, a lot is going on and some of these indices may generally play out.\n\n\u201cThe last few days, we have concentrated ourselves on politics politics and politics. I do not expect that, it will continue in the coming days because we still have two years as an administration.\n\n\u201cBut it is expected that within the last five days, one week since the governor defected to the All Progressives Congress, we have concentrated ourselves into politics.\n\n\u201cIt may not be unconnected with the fact that budgetary provision perhaps, proposals that were made by these ministries may not have been approved by the governor, the governor may not have had time to look at some of those proposals.\n\n\u201dAs always the case, there would be memos for the governor to have a look. He may not have looked at the memos in the last days, especially with the uprising.\n\n\u201cI am not holding briefs but I think this inadequacy, perhaps may have given room for what we have seen today. The ministries involved may not have discussed these memo with the governor.",

          "text": "By Taofik Salako, Deputy Group Business Editor\n\nChairman, Dangote Sugar Refinery (DSR) Plc, Alhaji Aliko Dangote, yesterday urged government to faithfully implement the national backward integration policy in the sugar industry as the implementation will bring foreign exchange of up to $700 millon yearly from sugar production self-sufficiency.\n\nSpeaking yesterday at the 15th annual general meeting (AGM) of the company in Lagos, Dangote said that allowing for distortions in the sugar masterplan framework will adversely affect the target of the nation attaining self-sufficiency as projected.\n\nHe described the backward integration policy (BIP) as a commendable policy which will not only reduce imports of raw sugar but save the nation\u2019s enormous foreign exchange used for importation.\n\nHe expressed delight that the BIP in the sugar industry is going on well, noting that if the National Sugar Master Plan is followed strictly and the players follow the rules, the country will be better for it as Nigeria will save between $600 million and $700 million annually in foreign exchange.\n\nHe stated that the backward integration policy of DSR is recording appreciable progress even as he declared the company\u2019s irrevocable commitment to the policy.\n\nAddressing the shareholders, Dangote said that despite the disruptions in the economy occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic, Dangote Sugar Refinery has announced an increase in production volume which rose by 13.7 per cent to 743,858 tonnes in the financial year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 654,071 tonnes in 2019.\n\nHe stated that the company posted a group turnover of N214.3 billion a 33 per cent increase over the N161.1 billion in 2019, while in the same period the sugar group also posted a 6.9 percent increase in sales volume from 684,487 tonnes in 2019 to 731,701 tonnes in 2020. Gross profit increased by 40.4 per cent to N53.75 billion, compared to N38.29 billion in 2019 while Group profit after taxation for the year increased by 33.2 percent to N26.70 billion as against N22.36 billion in 2019, reflecting management\u2019s unrelenting goal to deliver consistent shareholder value.\n\nTherefore, the board of the company declared a dividend payment of N18.22 billion to the shareholders, amounting to N1.50 kobo per ordinary share of 50k each.\n\nAccording to him, the improvements were attributable to operations optimization strategy despite disruption caused by civil unrest in last quarter of the year.\n\n\u201cOur growth continued to benefit from the sustained efforts to drive customer base expansion and several trade initiatives and investments,\u201d Dangote said.\n\nHe said the company has revised its sugar production target to 550,000 metric tonnes achievable by 2024 in line with the revised plan on the BIP by the federal government.\n\nGroup Managing Director, Dangote Sugar Refinery (DSR) Plc, Mr. Ravindra Singhvi, said the sugar group continued on the growth path with commitments to improve performance and generate value for all stakeholders.\n\nHe explained that this was reflected in the sales volume delivery of 731,701 tonnes, and production of 743,858 tonnes being 6.9% and 13.7% increase in volumes over the comparative year 2019.\n\nHe said the company would ensure all hands are on deck to meet the targeted 550,000tonnes projected to be achieved by 2024.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cOur Backward Integration goal is to become a global force in sugar production, by producing 1.5M MT/PA of refined sugar from locally grown sugar cane for the domestic and export markets.\n\n\u201cOur focus on the implementation of our key strategies in the face of the several challenges posed by the COVID-19 Pandemic, the peculiarities of the Apapa traffic situation amongst others we achieved a topline growth in revenue of N214.30 billion, a 33.0 per cent increase over 2019; a 53 per cent increase in profit before tax, and 33.2 per cent increase in profit after tax.\n\n\u201c2020 was indeed very eventful for our company ranging from the weak macroeconomic fundamentals caused by the underlying impact of COVID-19 pandemic which saw to the steady rise in forex rate, high inflation and the significant rise in our cost of production, to the worsening traffic gridlock on the Apapa Wharf Road which led to delays and at times disruption of the distribution and deliveries to customers,\u201d Singhvi said.\n\nHe noted that one of the key highlights of during the year was the successful completion of the Scheme of Arrangement for the merger between Dangote Sugar Refinery Plc (DSR) and Savannah Sugar Company Limited (SSCL) with effect from September 1, 2020, to operate under one unified entity.\n\n\u201cWe are confident the merger will enable us to achieve operational, administrative and governance efficiencies resulting in increased shareholder value. We will continue to pursue our Backward Integration Projects, and other key initiatives to grow our sales volumes, market share, optimize cost and operational efficiencies,\u201d Singhvi said..\n\nPresident, Association for the Advancement of the Rights of Nigerian Shareholders (AARNS), Dr. Farouk Umar commended the management of DSR for the impressive performance of the company despite the hiccups in the year 2020.\n\nHe said the shareholders expected more robust results next year since the economy is already picking up, noting that for the company to have performed excellently under pandemic, then next year will be greater for all.\n\nFounder, Independent Shareholders Association, Sir Sunny Nwosu said the management of DSR led by Dangote has never let the shareholders down for once pointing out that the management style is second to none, which has made the company to be growing steadily.\n\nAccording to him, the way the company has been executing its BIP projects was also commendable as this will afford the company opportunity to meet target within it projected timelines.\n\nDangote Sugar Refinery is Nigeria\u2019s largest producer of household and commercial sugar with 1.44M MT refining capacity at the same location. Its refinery located at Apapa Wharf Ports Complex, refines raw sugar imported from Brazil to white, Vitamin A fortified refined granulated white sugar suitable for household and industrial uses.\n\nDangote Sugar Refinery Plc acquired Savannah Sugar Company Limited, located in Numan, Adamawa State in December 2012, and embarked on the ongoing rehabilitation of its facilities and expansion of its 32,000 hectares\u2019 sugarcane estate. In September 2020, the scheme of merger between DSR and Savannah Sugar estate was completed which gave birth to a bigger and stronger business with considerable opportunity for growth and delivery of superior benefits to all stakeholders. The expansion and rehabilitation of the sugar estate is still ongoing as well as the development of the greenfield site acquired at Tunga, Nasarawa State for the achievement of DSR\u2019s sugar for Nigeria development master plan.\n\nThe Nasarawa Sugar Company Limited, is the registered subsidiary of Dangote Sugar Refinery Plc. The 78,136 hectares Sugar Project Site is located at Tunga, Awe Local Government Area, of Nasarawa State. Massive developments in agriculture, irrigation infrastructure amongst others is ongoing at the site. Unfortunately, Lau/Tau project is still on hold following the lingering compensation issue between the communities and Taraba state government.",

Yahaya, until his appointment was Theatre Commander, Operation HADIN KAI, and replaces Lt. Gen Ibrahim Attahiru who died in a NAF plane crash in Kaduna State along with 10 senior officers and crew members last Friday.\n\nActing director, Defence Tnformation, Brig Genl Onyema Nwachukwu who made this known in a statement.\n\nYahaya was born on January 5y 1966 in Sifawa and hails from Bodinga Local Government Area of Sokoto State. He was granted regular combatant commission as a member of 37 regular course on 22 September 1990 in the rank of Second Lieutenant with seniority in the same rank effective September 27, 1985.

The affected officers Daily Sun gathered are mostly officers of 35 Regular Course, 36 Regular Course and 37 Regular Course who incidentally are Course-mates of the new army chief.\n\nHowever, not all members of 37 Regular Course would be going on retirement as the new service chief has the powers to retain two of his course mates and appoint them Chief Of Policy and Plans and Commander Training and Doctrine Command(TRADOC), respectively.\n\nDaily Sun gathered that already most of the affected officers are beginning to put in their retirement letters notifying the authorities of their decision to retire voluntarily from the army. It was also gathered that beginning today, Friday May, 28, all the affected officers would stop going to work.\n\nIt was learnt that those who do not send in their retirement letters, would be issued with a notice of retirement from service. This decision sources told Daily Sun, is sequel to a memo from the minister of Defence Major General BASHIR Magashi, to the deceased COAS, directing that all his course mates proceed on retirement.\n\nIt was gathered that the former chief pleaded with the minister to retain two of his course mates and appointed them COPP and commander TRADOC.\n\nThe directive Daily Sun gathered has not changed, thus meaning more officers would retire with the naming of a new service chief.",

          "text": "From Gyang Bere, Jos; Kenneth Udeh, Owerri and Lukman Olabiyi\n\nChairman of the Northern Governors Forum and Governor of Plateau State, Simon Lalong, said the region has set up a committee on restructuring and the role of traditional rulers towards resolving the insecurity challenges in the country.\n\nHe advised that discussion on the review of the 1999 Constitution should be within the context of unity, stability, peace and progress of Nigeria.\n\nLalong made the remarks at the North Central Senate Committee\u2019s public hearing on the review of the 1999 constitution review, in Jos, Plateau State.\n\nHe said: \u201dOf course, the much talked about issue of restructuring is also very much canvassed by different interests. This is the time to thoroughly deal with the matter and ensure that the agitations and anxieties being expressed are addressed.\n\n\u201cAs Chairman of the Northern Governors Forum, to say that we have since set up committees on restructuring, role of traditional rulers, engagement with the youths and even economic reforms of the region. The reports of these committees will also be submitted to the Constitutional Review Committee for consideration.\n\n\u201cWe have to conduct the discussion on the review of the 1999 constitution within the context of the unity, stability, peace and progress of the country. We should have an open mind to every submission, we should also not be ignorant of the desire by some internal or external forces to destabilise our nation by pushing their interests, under the guise of promoting constitutional review.\n\n\u201cWe have to realise that there is no constitution that will ever resolve all our challenges as a people who are diverse in ethnic, religious, political and tribal affiliations.\u201d\n\nLalong said issues of state police should be given top priority in view of the insecurity in the country, adding that his administration has gone far with the implementation of autonomy for the Judiciary, Legislature, and the Local Governments, even before the commencement of the strike by judiciary and legislative workers.\n\nMeanwhile, a group of women from Plateau, Nasarawa and Benue States, under the umbrella of Women Political Participation Technical Working Group (WPP-TWG), have advocated for the creation of 37 more Senatorial seats in the country, that would be exclusively be occupied by women.\n\nThe group, which submitted a memorandum to the Senate Committee for the review of the 1999 constitution at the North Central public hearing in Jos, supported the proposed amendment of the constitution and called for a special consideration for women in governance.\n\nSpokesperson of the group, Mrs Jiritmwa Morgak Goyit, who addressed journalists in Jos, after the submission, yesterday, said Nigerian women should also be honoured with the 35 percent affirmative action.\n\nShe appealed that the Constitution should kick against same sex running for a position that has deputy so that a man should either be Chairman and a woman serve as Deputy or vice versa, to promote gender equality.\n\nShe believed that the temporary but necessary positive measures would enhance inclusive governance that women earnestly yearn for.\n\nMeanwhile, the leadership of Ohaneze Ndigbo worldwide, led by its President General, Ambassador Professor George A. Obiozor, yesterday, renewed the demands for restructuring, devolution of power and true federalism as panacea for the crisis bedevilling the nation.\n\nHe made the submission in Owerri at the Abia/Imo public hearing for the amendment of the 1999 constitution chaired by the former governor of Abia State and Chief Whip of the Senate, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu.\n\nHe said: \u201cFundamentally, what Ndigbo really want is some form of internal autonomy, based on a Restructured Nigeria,\n\n\u201cWe (Ndigbo) are of the view that the federation of Nigeria must be a union of equals and the composite units must have the ability to stand without begging the centre for survival.\n\n\u201cThat is a federal system of government with its characteristics of decentralisation and devolution of power among the federating units.\n\n\u201cIn the context of the imperatives and urgency of restructuring Nigeria, we should focus on getting the right things done for the right reasons, and at the right levels of government.\n\n\u201cIndeed, what must be done and no longer what to do, is to recognise that history has an iron law of seriality of which no country, including Nigeria, can ask for exemption or exceptionalism.\n\n\u201cAll signs of national tragedies foretold are present, today, in full force in Nigeria. In fact, it would require a restructured Nigeria to contain the present forces and tendencies towards a synchronised national crisis and even a possibility of national disintegration.\n\nUrging leaders in the country to confront the nation\u2019s realities and challenges, Obiozor said the nation\u2019s political crisis stemed from injustice, inequity and lack of fairness.\n\nHe said: \u201cTherefore, as national leaders, we must learn the lessons of history that in societies here, truth comes last, tragedy comes first. And that the perennial problem or continuous dilemma in Nigerian politics always evolve around the issues of justice, equity and fairness. As has been said several times, throughout history, those denied justice have had no interest in peace.\n\n\u201cWe would expect you at the end of this exercise, and in the interest of the nation, its unity and progress, to conclude with decisions guided by love and not by hatred; and guided by our collective hope and not by our fears.\n\nIn his concluding remark the Southest Zonal Chairman of the public hearing, Senator Orji Kalu, reiterated the commitment of the Senate to address the submissions made by various groups at the two-day exercise. He appealed for calm among from various agitating groups, saying that the National Assembly would expedite action on their demands for befitting amended constitution.\n\n\u2022 How Nigeria can enact new Constitution- Ekweremadu\n\nFormer Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, said while a new constitution is possible and would become ultimately inevitable, the nation needs to amend the 1999 Constitution to create a provision for achieving that.\n\nEkweremadu, while fielding questions from reporters in Enugu on the sidelines of the ongoing zonal hearing on constitution review exercise of the 9th National Assembly said:\n\n\u201cI have heard the suggestions for a new constitution over and over again. Some say, bring back the 1960 Constitution; some say bring back the 1963 Constitution. Some others say, okay, why don\u2019t we just throw away this constitution and bring a new one.\n\n\u201cHowever, there is no such provision to do so under our present Constitution, unless you are calling for anarchy. If you say we need a new constitution, the answer is simple. When other countries like Kenya and Brazil had a similar challenge, what they simply did was to amend the original constitution, in order to make a provision for how a new constitution can be enacted. We (the National Assembly) did it the last time, specifically in the 7th Assembly, including making a provision for a referendum, but it was not accepted.\n\n\u201cSo, we need to amend Section 9 on how we can create a new Constitution, including the issue of referendum, to be able to do that.\u201d\n\nThe lawmaker, who chairs the Enugu centre of the South East zonal hearing, also explained that creating an avenue for a new constitution would also help make the constitution more organised.\n\n\u201cWe have done a whole of amendments, which many Nigerians don\u2019t even know about. So, there is confusion already in differentiating what has been amended and what has not been amend. And it will only increase as we make more amendments. Even with ordinary Acts of the National Assembly, after several amendments or a far-reaching amendment, the usual and proper thing we do is to repeal and reenact the law.\n\n\u201cWhether we are doing a new constitution today, tomorrow or next year, we need to take advantage of this constitution amendment exercise to provide for and spell out how a new constitution can come into being.\n\nThat way, at the appropriate time, we can now trigger that provision and be able to have a conversation, draft a new constitution, and go through the constitutional provision and have it approved at the requisite levels and with the requisite numbers, so that we can have a new constitution that will encompass all these amendments.\u201d\n\nOn the calls for a national dialogue by ethnic nationalities, he said: \u201cOnce any nation runs into a problem like we do now, the usual thing to do is to say, okay, let us come together and talk. But in our case, there is nothing really new, say in this constitution amendment exercise from the past ones.\n\n\u201cLikewise, if you bring together all the ethnic nationalities, they are not going to say anything new. We have had conversions. We have had the national confab.\n\n\u201cJust as someone suggested, why don\u2019t we just dust up all of the constitution amendments we have done before or simply improve on them and get the reasonable and required number to approve it and send it to the president? That is my opinion too.\n\n\u201cIn the same manner, if we say let us look at those issues and resolutions we have had in the past confabs, nothing is new, and nothing has changed. But if we look at the recommendations and set up a committee to look at it in one week, we can now find a way to legislate on it.\n\n\u201cIt is not enough to talk, we have to agree on how do we operationalise what we discussed. That is the issue. Unless we address this, it will be like every other talks or confabs.\u201d\n\nOn the position of the constitution on grazing, Ekweremadu said: \u201cThe laws are straightforward and it was better for the states and federal officials to meet on the matter to resolve the impasse.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the Constitution, the issue of grazing, essentially, should be a matter for the states because it has to do with land. Under the Land Use Act, which is part of our Constitution, the lands belong to the States and not to the Federal Government. So, when the states met and said, look, we don\u2019t want open grazing, it was within the purview of their powers.\n\n\u201cI think we need to have a meeting between the state officials and federal officials at some point, instead of talking as if they don\u2019t read anything in the constitution. We can\u2019t be insulting ourselves on the pages of newspapers.\u201d\n\n\u2022Falana makes case for secessionists, change of name for police\n\nRights activist and Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Femi Falana, yesterday, made case for secession agitators across the country before the Senate zonal public hearing on the review of the 1999 Constitution in Lagos.\n\nFalana, while giving insight on the memoranda he submitted before the committee, insisted that it was important to give secession agitators the confidence of peace and inclusion, if they must remain as Nigerians.\n\nThe lawyer also advocated that the Child Rights Act enacted in 2003, and the Disability Act, be domesticated and implemented in states if the constitution review must make meaning to the common man.\n\nFalana also proposed a change of name from the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) to the Nigerian Police Service (NPS). To him, there must be sanctions for impunity.\n\n\u201cOur country is ruled by rule of the rulers and not rule of law. People commit all manner of crime and get away with it because there are no sanctions. This must change. The Social Security Bill must also work, so that jobless people can get stipends pending when they will get full employment.\n\n\u201cWhat can we do very quickly to save this country which is on the verge of collapse? If you don\u2019t want people to break away from Nigeria, we must give them confidence, don\u2019t declare a war.\n\n\u201cTherefore, for the constitutional amendment to be fruitful, for us to have genuine outputs from this meeting, peace must reign. We must address Nigeria\u2019s problem frontally.\u201d",

          "title": "Jubilations in Maiduguri as Yahaya Emerges New Army Chief",
          "text": "\u2022Several generals may retire\n\nKingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nThe announcement of Maj. Gen. Faruk Yahaya as the new chief of army staff (COAS) yesterday drew pulsating jubilations at the headquarters of Operations Hadin Kai in Maiduguri, the Borno State capital.\n\nTroops of the theatre command of the war against the insurgency in the North-east jumped for joy as they were told of the rise of their commander to the top job of the service.\n\n\u201cThe excitement is not surprising,\u201d a top military officer told THISDAY last night, explaining: \u201cYahaya has a reputation for taking care of his troops.\u201d\n\nBut for several senior officers, particularly Yahaya\u2019s superiors, they have approached the end of the road; and it\u2019s not a laughing matter as they might have to abruptly retire.\n\nThe Defence Headquarters (DHQ), had in a statement by its spokesman, Brig. Gen. Onyema Nwachukwu, said: \u201cThe Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, President Muhammadu Buhari, has appointed Maj. Gen. Farouk Yahaya as the new Chief of Army Staff.\n\n\u201cPrior to his appointment, Maj. Gen. Yahaya was the General Officer Commanding 1 Division of the Nigerian Army and the incumbent Theatre Commander of the Counter-Terrorism Counter Insurgency military outfit in the North-east, code-named Operation Hadin Kai.\u201d\n\nThe appointment THISDAY gathered has left several senior officers facing an imminent retirement from service.\n\nYahaya, a member of the 37th Regular Course of the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA), succeeded Lt. Gen, Ibrahim Attahiru of Course 35, who died along with 10 other military officers and personnel in a plane crash in Kaduna last Friday.\n\nSources told THISDAY yesterday that should Yahaya decide to strictly follow military tradition, members of Course 35 and Course 36, who are his senior by date of commission, would have to go.\n\nInvestigation revealed that the army\u2019s Chief of Policy and Plans, Maj. Gen. Ben Ahanotu, and Commander Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), Minna, Maj. Gen. Abubakar Maikobi, who were course mates of the late army chief, are certain to go.\n\nThere is also the possibility that some members of Course 36, who are also senior to Yahaya, may be retired.\n\nBut sources said that their career could be saved through redeployment to the tri-service section of the military or to the Defence Headquarters, under the Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Lucky Irabor, who is of Course 34.\n\nHowever, their possible redeployment depends on the decision of the Minister of Defence, Maj. Gen Bashir Salihi Magashi (rtd), who chairs the Armed Forces Council, and Yahaya.\n\nAccording to military officers, familiar with the tradition of the armed forces, they may also be posted to the Armed Forces Resettlement Centre in Oshodi, Lagos, the Command and Staff College, Jaji and other such military formations.\n\nA top military officer who spoke to THISDAY said: \u201cThere are three ways to look at it. The officers at the same level with the current army chief that has just been appointed can be posted to tri-service institutions with those that are ahead of him.\n\n\u201cThe Chief of Defence Staff is in 34th Course. You can get members of the 36 course to go and work there. It does not affect anything. \u201cThere is only one member of the 35 Course in the army (Maj. Gen. Ahanotu). He can go home.\n\n\u201cThe ones that you should be worried about are members of the 36 Course but you can take them to head military formations in Jaji, Oshodi; you can bring them to Defence Headquarters or Defence Research and Development Bureau.\n\n\u201cHe (new Army Chief) can also decide to retire them. He can retire them; they have spent about 35 years in service. No big deal about that. He can work with his course mates (37). The late army chief worked with his course mates. He was the one that insisted that they should not retire.\u201d\n\nOn how some of the top contenders were eliminated and the considerations that led to the emergence of the Yahaya, another senior officer, who spoke anonymously, said the elimination of Ahanotu, the second-in-command to the late Attahiru, was hinged on the fact that he was due for retirement. He was supposed to retire when Attahiru was appointed.\n\n\u201cMaj. Gen. Maikobi, from Kano, is of Course 36; defence minister and chief of naval staff are from Kano. I. M. Yusuf is also of 37. Yusuf has operational experience. The problem Yusuf had is that he is from Yobe State where the IG of Police hails from.\n\n\u201cFarouk Yahaya is from Sokoto and has no contender in that area or any inhibiting factor, no service chief is from there.\n\n\u201cMaj. Gen. M.S. Ahmed was disqualified because he is from Kano where the naval chief and the defence minister are from,\u201d he stated.\n\nOn the number of generals that may be retired, he said: \u201cOnly the military secretary can say that because it depends on many factors.\n\n\u201cWhen Attahiru came on board, the minister of defence insisted that all members of 35 course must go but he pleaded that two of them remain to help him, Ahanotu and the TRADOC commander. From today, the two of them will not bother to come to the office.\n\n\u201cThe same thing with the 36 course that is his (Yahaya\u2019s) senior may not even remain. The same minister of defence may say that all members of Course 37 should go. He did that in the navy when the present naval chief was appointed. He said that all Course 36 must go so that he should have command and control.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cHe can say all members of 37 Course should go; it depends on the decision at the strategic level. The decision will come from the Chairman of Armed Forces Council, who is the Minister of Defence, and who will also decide on how to streamline the army.\n\n\u201cIt is not easy to say who will go or not. It\u2019s only when you check the seniority role that you can say so \u2013 if you check from the first 30, less CDS.\n\n\u201cThe new army chief is in 37 Course. Even in the 37, he is number 27. If he is no 27 on the seniority roll; let\u2019s say 23 are going from 36. But if you add his course mates more will go. If you also add the two from 35, you can arrive at 30.\u201d\n\nTHISDAY further gathered that the expected retirement of the senior officers in the army may also affect their colleagues in the navy and the air force.\n\n\u201cWhen the present service chiefs were appointed, their course mates in the three services were advised to leave the service and they all left except for those who were moved to the defence headquarters.\n\n\u201cIf you ask the opinion of other younger officers, those who are due for retirement should go,\u201d the source said.\n\nHe described the new army chief as a man known to have the welfare of the army at heart.\n\n\u201cIn terms of welfare, duties, he is even better than Buratai. He does not listen to gossip,\u201d the source added.\n\nProfile of New Army Chief, Yahaya\n\nYahaya was born on January 5, 1966, in Sifawa, Bodinga Local Government Area of Sokoto State. A member of the 37 Regular Course of the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA), he started his cadet training on September 27, 1985, and was commissioned into the Nigerian Army Infantry Corps on September 22, 1990.\n\nYahaya has held many appointments, including staff, instructional and command.\n\nNotable among the appointments he held are Garrison Commander, Headquarters Guards Brigade, Directing Staff at the Armed Forces Command and Staff College (AFCSC), Deputy Director, Army Headquarters Department of Military Secretary, Deputy Director, Army Research and Development and the Chief of Staff, Headquarters Joint Task Force Operation Polo Shield.\n\nHe also served as the Principal General Staff Officer (PGSO) to the Minister of Defence, the Commander, Headquarters 4 Brigade and 29 Task Force Brigade (Operation Zaman Lafiya). He was also Director, Manpower at the Army Headquarters, Military Secretary, Army Headquarters and General Officer Commanding (GOC) 1 Division of the Nigerian Army.\n\nThe new COAS is a recipient of many honours and awards, including Forces Service Star, Meritorious Service Star, Distinguished Service Star, Grand Service Star, Passed Staff Course (Dagger), National Defence Course (Chile), Economic Community of West Africa State Monitoring Group Medal, Command Medal, Field Command Medal, General Operations Medal, Silver Jubilee Medal and Golden Jubilee Medal.\n\nHe is married with children.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "IG: Agitation for State Police Unnecessary",
          "text": "\u2022Says 1,166 suspects arrested in South-east, South-south\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nThe Acting Inspector-General of Police (IG), Mr. Usman Alkali, yesterday described the clamour for state police, which topped demands at zonal public hearings on constitution review held by the Senate on Tuesday as unnecessary.\n\nBaba, who featured at the weekly media briefing organised by the Presidential Communications Team at the Presidential Villa in Abuja, said state police, as being canvassed by different interest groups nationwide, already existed in different forms in many states of the federation.\n\nHe also said the police commands in both the South-east and the South-south had been reinforced with the posting of additional 3,700 officers and men there since the establishment of Operation Restore Peace in the area in April. He added that the new security strategy has resulted in the arrest of 1,166 high-profile suspects.\n\nAlkali wondered what the demand was all about again when most states already run structures regarded as their own local police.\n\nApart from the local police structures, like the various vigilante groups supported by state governments, he stated that the police supported states in preventing and fighting crimes by training more than 70,000 citizens nationwide.\n\nHe, however, said the National Assembly was in a better position to look into the demand for state police.\n\nHe said: \u201cState policing is an issue. I remember, as far back as 1998, I think I had a project in one of our courses, writing on the desirability of state policing and the issue has been reoccurring, but now I think it is more.\n\n\u201cIf you look at it technically, I doubt if there is any state that does not have state police even now. What do I mean? There are creations that are done by state governments to assist law enforcement agencies in trying to maintain law and order, or enforce regulations or laws that are created by state governments.\n\n\u201cWe have vigilante everywhere in this country. We have various types of organisations that have been created by state governments to assist in policing. Some of them had even House of Assembly laws that guide their operations.\n\n\u201cThe space is open to everybody. We even always say policing is not a matter of the Nigerian police or the Nigerian law enforcement agents; everybody can be involved in policing.\n\n\u201cBut I want to know the shape that the advocates of state police want it to take and it is an issue that is left for lawmakers and the government.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to work with anybody. We are ready to collaborate and synergise with anybody to make sure that Nigerian citizens enjoy the best of protection.\n\n\u201cIf you look at it, the community policing aspect, we have trained over 70,000 Nigerians from all states of the federation to assist in crime prevention and control.\n\n\u201cIn fact, we have even gone to the extent of using the Police Act to kit them with police uniform that will give them identification as a spy. That is to say, all those who are trained are to go back and assist in policing within their own locality. You have policing capability and powers ends within your community and it is the community that we suggest who and who will be involved in such a business and we are working with them.\n\n\u201cState governments or state governors are chief security officers of their states. As far as I\u2019m concerned, they are and remain one and my commissioners of police are ready to take all local instructions from them.\n\n\u201cAs for agitation, it is there but everybody is already involved in creating one agency or the other to complement the efforts of the Nigerian security agencies. The National Assembly can look into the agitation which is their own responsibility.\u201d\n\nAlkali also said the new strategy launched by the police in the South, tagged \u201cOperation Restore Peace\u201d was aimed at restoring law and order in the affected areas.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe decided to launch an operation, which is tagged \u2018Operation Restore Peace,\u2019 and we targeted the South-east and South-south for the first phase of the operation. We reinforced these two zones with a total of 3, 700 policemen drawn from our various units, including the Police Mobile Force, the Strike Force, Counter-Terrorism, Special Protection Unit, etc. These commands were reinforced with this personnel with specific instructions with an operation order targeted at stabilising the incessant attacks on police facilities.\n\n\u201cThe first operation in the South-east was launched on 18th May in Enugu and we clearly stated our mission and vision. All the states in that zone were in Enugu. We also had meetings with stakeholders to look at the non-kinetic way of addressing the issue. We also advised them that whatever agitation they have, could be done peacefully without targeting the police or other security agents.\n\n\u201cWe did the same thing in the South-south and all the states in the zone actively participated. I assured them that since the time we launched these operations, we have had a recipe of policemen coming to defend themselves and repel most of these attacks. We had successful repels and arrests as well as recoveries in great numbers.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, a total of 1,166 high-profile suspects have been arrested and weapons and arms recovered in the two zones in less than two months\n\nHe said: \u201cFor record purposes, following the launch of Operation Restore Peace, we have so far recovered the following weapons and arms from secessionists and insurgents: one general-purpose machine gun, 10 AK-47 rifles, nine locally fabricated rifles, four locally fabricated pistols, 19 AK-47 magazines, 5,419 live ammunition with 10 improvised explosive devices.\n\n\u201cIn terms of arrests, we have 398 armed robbery suspects, 258 cult-related offenders, 222 murder suspects, 202 bandit-related suspects and 86 suspects involved in cases of kidnapping. Four hundred and thirty-four firearms of various descriptions were also recovered. These statistics are from April 7 till date.\u201d\n\nThe IG stated that after analysing the security situation in the six geo-political zones of the country, he realised that the morale of police personnel was dampened due to the EndSARS protests, which led to the scrapping of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) last year.\n\nHe said he had to move fast to boost their morale upon assumption of office last month.\n\n\u201cThe security situation in the country has been significantly stabilised from time to time, but you see occasional disruptions coming from these zones, in the form of either attack on police personnel or facilities or even all law enforcement agencies, including the military.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we decided to rejig the morale of our personnel, which had been a little bit dampened since the EndSARS came and went away. With the proscription of SARS, we have been able to marshal up the courage of our personnel who have been involved in handling violent crimes and post them for anti-robbery patrols and the investigation of violent crimes, which include robbery, kidnapping, cultism and banditry among others,\u201d he said.\n\nResponding to a question on the recent attack on Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State, the IG said those involved had been arrested.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been able to uncover the assailants and we\u2019ve been able to establish what actually happened contrary to what he said, and we\u2019ve been able to get these people and know where they came from; how they came. But the case is still under investigation and that is why\u2026there are some vital things that we have not been able to complete.\n\n\u201cBut as for those who would pull the trigger and those who organised the crime, they are with us; they have been arrested,\u201d he added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Urges govs to make states economically viable\n\n\u2022FG to screen projects for PPP suitability\n\nNdubuisi Francis and James Emejo in Abuja\n\nThe Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, has said Nigeria requires about N35 trillion investments in infrastructure for the economy to post a double-digit growth.\n\nBut Emefiele, in a goodwill message he delivered yesterday at a webinar on \u201cFinancing Public-Private Partnership to Boost Infrastructure Delivery in Nigeria,\u201d organised by the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) in Abuja, added that given the paucity of government revenues, it will be difficult to support such investments using government funds alone.\n\nThe Nigerian economy, which is just crawling out of recession, recorded a 0.51 per cent growth in the first quarter of 2021 after a 0.11 per cent growth in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nBesides, Emefiele, at another forum yesterday, also called on governors to make their states economically viable in order to reduce their dependence on allocations from the Federation Account.\n\nEmefiele, whose message to the webinar was delivered by the Deputy Governor of the bank on Economic Policy, Dr. Kingsley Obiora, stated that the theme of the webinar was topical as a critical part of efforts to drive sustainable growth of the economy.\n\nHe said the COVID-19 pandemic had exerted unprecedented impacts on the economy, adding that interventions by the monetary and fiscal authorities had led to Nigeria exiting recession with muted growth.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhile this news is positive, growth is still well below our population growth of 2.7 per cent. It is therefore imperative that we all work together to harness the growth potential of the Nigerian economy.\n\n\u201cIf we take into account Nigeria\u2019s Infrastructure Masterplan, we require close to N35 trillion worth of investment in order to attain double-digit growth. But given the paucity of government revenue, which the BPE director-general mentioned earlier, it will be difficult to support these investments using government funds alone.\n\n\u201cSo, finding ways to harness public-private partnerships have become very important and we are happy to acknowledge that these partnerships have started in earnest and the Central Bank of Nigeria looks forward to continuing collaboration with the BPE to harness these partnerships to ensure that we significantly scale up investment in our infrastructure.\u201d\n\nIn her keynote address, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Dr. Zainab Ahmed, said from the 2021/2022 budget cycle, all infrastructure projects in Nigeria must be screened for Public-Private Partnership (PPP) suitability and compliance with the National Integrated Infrastructure Master plan by her ministry and the BPE before inclusion in national budgets and subsequent procurement.\n\nThe minister, who is also the Vice-Chairman of the National Council on Privatisation (NCP), said: \u201cAll these efforts are to ensure that PPP takes a center stage in the procurement of infrastructure in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAccording to her, the federal government is willing to discuss and incorporate suggestions from stakeholders with a view to strengthening Nigeria\u2019s PPP framework.\n\nShe stated that the webinar was an opportunity to hear from participants on the concerns and areas they want the government to address to make investment beneficial and deliver value to the country.\n\nShe solicited the support and cooperation of the public and private sectors partners, local and foreign partners, financial institutions and other important key stakeholders towards the successful implementation of the new PPP policy directive.\n\nShe added that the present administration is committed to the development of infrastructure through PPP arrangements.\n\nThe BPE Director-General, Mr. Alex Okoh, also said in line with its new role in the administration of concession programmes of the federal government, the bureau, in collaboration with the Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning had developed a PPP project information tool, which has been forwarded to all ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs), to capture all current and proposed infrastructure projects in the country.\n\n\u201cThis will help document a pipeline of PPP projects across various sectors of the economy,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that some MDAs have submitted their PPP Project Information Data ahead of the final submission date of May 31.\n\nAccording to him, the bureau will partner the United Kingdom Nigeria Infrastructure Advisory Facility (UKNIAF) to screen projects to ensure that only those that are financially as well as economically viable are included in the \u2018National Pipeline of PPP Projects\u2019.\n\nHe stated that the BPE will also establish a revolving Project Development Fund (PDF) for PPP transactions, while funds realised from the pool will be used to facilitate the proper structuring of PPP transactions.\n\nHe expressed hope that financial institutions will support the initiative to increase the number of viable projects that could be successfully brought to commercial and financial close in the infrastructure space through PPPs.\n\nEmefiele Urges Govs to Make States Economically Viable\n\nAlso yesterday, Emefiele called on governors to make their states economically viable in order to reduce their dependence on allocations from the Federation Account.\n\nEmefiele, at the inauguration of the Rivers State Cassava Processing Plant in Oyigbo Local Government Area of the state, also told reporters that there was no devaluation of the naira, contrary to speculations.\n\nHe, however, lamented that notwithstanding the country\u2019s position as the largest producer of cassava in the world, it spends over $580 million to import its by-products, adding that the country can no longer afford to support continued importation of items that can be produced locally.\n\nEmefiele said the CBN had set aside N1.5 billion for land clearing and urged the states, particularly those in the southern region, to take advantage of the facility to open up their respective economies.\n\nHe also advised the governors to woo private investors to help resuscitate their economies to generate employment through agriculture, adding that this will help the states boost internally generated revenue.\n\nWhile commending the Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, for the cassava project, he encouraged other governors to emulate the gesture to empower the citizens.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe seize this opportunity to encourage our states, particularly the southern states, that there are facilities available for you to draw to involve in land clearing.\n\n\u201cAt least, N1.5 billion is available for land clearing. It may seem small but it\u2019s a seed that we can start with.\n\n\u201cWe need to see to how we can open up our states for the good of our people and also for the economic viability of out states.\n\n\u201cPlease, help to make your states economically viable so you can depend less on revenues from FAAC so that you can grow your economy.\n\n\u201cYou can encourage private sector who need these processed materials for their final produce.\u201d\n\nOn the rumoured devaluation of the naira, he said: \u201cNaira was not devalued, it\u2019s just the handiwork of mischief-makers.\n\n\u201cPeople just go about, do your business. Naira was not devalued, we will continue to do our business and Nigeria will continue to prosper.\u201d\n\nHowever, Emefiele stated that the cassava project is designed to support improved production and processing of the commodity into high-quality flour.\n\nAccording to him, such investments could help drive economic growth, reduce unemployment as well as induce other wealth-creating activities in the state.\n\nHe added that it also helps support the CBN\u2019s mandate of promoting economic growth for the country.\n\nThe CBN governor expressed delight that the project would improve livelihoods, as well as enhance the sustainability of farming for over 3,000 farmers by guaranteeing the offtake of their farm produce.\n\nHe said this guaranteed off-take would encourage participating farmers to improve their output per hectare in order to earn additional income.\n\nHe also said the project provided them with a verifiable platform to access finance from the CBN and other financial institutions through the Anchor Borrowers Programme (ABP) among other benefits.\n\nHe said with the ability to process over 45,000 tonnes of cassava, the facility would provide high-quality cassava flour for households, industries and bakeries.\n\nEmefiele added that about N7.43 billion had been accessed by four out of the six states in the South-south region to open up more land for cultivation, create access roads to agricultural lands and provide infrastructure among other support services in the region.\n\nAccording to him, these measures are helping to induce greater activity in the agricultural sector and are enabling the movement of goods from farm to factories, and to the markets.\n\nEmefiele said the current situation had made it imperative for the central bank to work towards supporting programmes to enable greater cultivation and processing of key agricultural commodities.\n\nHe said so far, the apex bank\u2019s developmental finance initiatives had been focused on creating an enabling environment to drive both public and private sectors\u2019 participation in the real sector with strategic deliverables around price stability, job creation, financial inclusion, import substitution and accretion to foreign reserves, among others.\n\nHe added that the bank\u2019s interventions seek to improve access to credit for households and businesses, which will enhance productivity and create value across a wide range of economic activities.\n\nEmefiele said so far, the Rivers State Government had accessed over N13 billion from the CBN\u2019s various intervention programmes.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs I said earlier, we have given them over N10 billion which have been fully repaid. And anytime they ask for money because he (Wike) is a very good debtor, we will always give them the facility.\n\n\u201cYou heard him say that around May next year, even a year before he hands over, that he would have no debt. So he can come and take the money and pay back next year.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Alhaji Sabo Nanono, said the country must strive to grow its food despite the current security challenges facing it.\n\n\u201cObviously, we cannot succumb to our security challenges, we have to eat, we have to farm whether there is security or not and that is absolutely necessary.\n\n\u201cThe security matter is not affecting agriculture alone but the entire country, and I think in spite of all the security issues people have been raising, agriculture has been growing in this country even last year.\n\nThis season\u2019s dry farming will multiply what we have done last year,\u201d Nanono told reporters.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Between then and now, you can see the number of days and weeks that has passed, the government never said anything, we the parents have tried to reach out, we have not got any response from the government. That's why you see us organising press conferences to remind the government that the students are still in captivity, but till this moment, we have not got any response from any tier of government, both federal and state, not even the local government.\n\n\u201cThe bandits call us and we plead that they should have mercy on us, that we cannot afford the amount they are demanding.

Many parents have been laid off from their jobs and their allowances have not yet been paid. How can you expect them to produce such an amount for kidnappers?\n\n\u201dMany people are afraid to speak about the kidnapped children so that they may not get into the Governor's bad book but keeping silent is not good and will not help to resolve the problem.\u201d",

Up till now, nothing has been done on the part of the government. It has always been the parents talking and begging the bandits, the government has not said anything about it.\n\n\u201cGovernment has always kept quiet, they have always been quiet. If you recall, when the Afaka incident happened, there was nothing from the government. The parents of Afaka went to the Government House in Kaduna and there was no response. After 56 days, they went to the National Assembly in Abuja, that was when some notable Nigerians intervened and within 48 hours, the Afaka students were released.\n\n\u201cImmediately, there was a statement that since Afaka students have been released, the next will be the Greenfield University students.

In some countries, these attacks come at a very high cost.\n\nThis reduces the level of trust people have in the internet or systems that use the internet. For instance, when it comes to savings, some people prefer not to save their money in traditional banks; and trusting their savings with a fintech company would probably be their last option.\n\nAnd that\u2019s only one example\u2013 there\u2019s a lot of customer data scattered across other tech-enabled services. Losing your money is perhaps the least harmful way cyber fraud can harm you.\n\nFirstly, your data could be used to carry out illegal activities which could put you in even more trouble. Secondly, your company\u2019s trade secrets or other sensitive business data could be leaked to the public. You could lose your good reputation in a blink.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of work to be done to improve cybersecurity measures, and the work of improving these measures isn\u2019t the sole responsibility of tech companies. In our present digital age, traditional sectors like oil and gas need new and more effective ways to protect their customers from cyber fraud, too.\n\nAn estimated $103.1bn was spent on security-related software, hardware and services in 2019 and this spending is expected to increase to $133.8bn by 2022. However, improving cybersecurity measures will not only involve spending more on security but also making it a part of the company culture. Every employee should have a role to play in keeping the organization safe.\n\nTomorrow at 11 am on TechCabal Live, we will be discussing with Adeoluwa, Daniel, Joseph, Sophina and Nick about some of the best practices they\u2019ve picked up in the course of their careers.\n\nRegister here to join the event.\n\nAdeoluwa is a skilled Information Security Professional. He has built a career spanning about 20 years in the field and has honed his expertise in some of the world\u2019s leading organizations, including Barclays, Brown Shipley and the British Council.\n\nDaniel is the co-founder and Chief Technology Officer at Evolve Credit, a loan and financial products marketplace. He is responsible for building the backend infrastructure, driving product roadmap, leading the technical team and driving company strategy.\n\nOver the past year, Joseph led the United Capital Group of companies to transition to a 100% remote work structure due to the COVID limitation while improving services and automation, leading to a 61% growth in revenue for the year ended 2020, with customers transacting seamlessly and securely.\n\nSophina is a cybersecurity professional currently working with a leading financial services firm. She has in previous years worked on providing digital and holistic security support to various marginalized communities and NGOs across Nigeria and Africa at large. She also collaborated on creating digital security guides to such organisations and communities to stay safe.\n\nNick Maxwell is a cybersecurity and networking industry professional with a passion for learning, working and creating a better understanding of the concerns and needs of clients and partners, across several regions in a variety of verticals. He has over 13 years experience in the technology industry and has worked for multinational, leading technology companies.\n\nAttendees will be able to ask the speakers questions in an interactive session.\n\nRegister here to join the event.",

          "text": "Nigerian public procurement and regulation can be labyrinthine, but recent policy reforms and the model of good practice provided by Kaduna State hint at opportunities for public-purpose innovation to flourish in the country. The result could be more accountable and effective governance institutions.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic found Nigeria\u2019s health system largely unprepared. When the Federal Government first announced a lockdown in March 2020, the country only had 6 testing centres. With a population of 200 million across 36 states, it needed to expand its ability to test quickly. One of the government\u2019s readiest supporters in this situation, the genomics research startup 54gene, had only been on the scene for a year. 54gene studies the African genome in order to personalise medication for Africans. It put these research capabilities to use establishing its DNA biobank lab as Nigeria\u2019s first accredited private testing centre and\u2013strikingly\u2013converting shipping containers into mobile testing laboratories, helping to augment testing capacity.\n\n\n\n54gene is one of many high-quality startups driving large investments into the Nigerian ecosystem and earning its position alongside Kenya, South Africa and Egypt as Africa\u2019s top four VC funding destinations\u2013Africa\u2019s \u201cbig four\u201d. The government partnered with 54gene out of necessity, but broader gains await should it systematically seek out such partnerships as a means to achieving its service delivery and administrative rationalisation goals. Its capacity to deliver on plans to digitise all government operations is questionable\u2013the 2020 UN e-government survey revealed that Nigeria\u2019s online service quality declined from already low levels in 20181. Accountable and well-managed partnerships with innovative startups can tip the scales in its favour, here and in other areas: improving education, promoting sustainable forms of energy and tackling healthcare challenges from both the most served verticals and some of the most pressing governance challenges.\n\n1 According to the UN e-government survey, Nigeria\u2019s online service index declined from 0.5278 in 2018 to 0.5176 in 2020. Scores range from 0 (worst) to 1 (best).\n\n\n\nPolicy progress?\n\nThe Federal Government looks to be aware of this opportunity. Its recently released National Digital Innovation and Entrepreneurship Policy aims to prioritise the use of tools developed by Nigerian startups to automate public processes and services, including modifying the Procurement Act to better allow for the procurement of innovation. It has also mandated Nigerian companies with large public sector IT contracts to engage Nigerian startups as R&D partners on the projects. Ideally, a more immediate intervention to consider is introducing the Nigeria Sustainable Development Goals Fintech Hackathon. In its first iteration, the hackathon will allow FinTech startups with innovative approaches to agricultural credit schemes, cash transfers to the financially vulnerable and clean energy to partner with relevant public sector bodies.\n\nThese are all steps that, on their surface, should enable more startups to work with it. However, to truly capitalise on potential gains, the government must focus on unravelling deep-seated behavioural barriers to access. The strength of these biases\u2013such as a preference for partnering with large, established companies and a tendency for harsh regulation of innovation\u2013will determine how well the above-mentioned initiatives play out.\n\nLabyrinths of Procurement and Regulation\n\nThere is plenty of evidence of these biases\u2019 detrimental impact on the potential for partnerships. When the Nigeria Railway Commission (NRC) started the train line between Kaduna State and the Federal Capital Territory, a payments startup called Payant Technologies sent in an unsolicited proposal to handle the digital booking and payments infrastructure. They didn\u2019t receive a response.\n\nUndeterred, Payant sent another in when the official request for Expressions Of Interest came out, but this also went unanswered. Why? The NRC was, according to its eligibility criteria, only looking for companies with an annual turnover of a billion naira ($2.4 million) or more, something only a few startups in Nigeria have. Preferring to work with large firms does more than stymie startup growth. It could lead to vendor lock-in and eventually, bilateral dependence between government and supplier. Both do not bode well for the quality of services rendered.\n\nHarsh regulatory policies also deter local and global partnerships. Like US-headquartered 54gene, many of Nigeria\u2019s best startups have chosen to incorporate outside the country. When one defines startup location as a place of incorporation, Nigeria falls out of the top four African VC funding locations\u2013the most adversely impacted country.\n\nThis year alone, government actors have stopped banks from processing transactions associated with cryptocurrency exchanges and issued a cease and desist to investment startups offering access to foreign securities. Both actions have negatively impacted startups working in those spaces. More importantly, they may signal an unwillingness to cooperate that will put off startups serving the government market.\n\nAso Villa Demo Day \u2013 Enterprise 54\n\nFor Inspiration, Look Local\n\nMitigating these and other negative behaviours will be hard work. But the Federal Government need not look far for inspiration; it can take a page out of the Kaduna State Government (KDSG)\u2019s Govtech playbook. Govtech developments in Kaduna have unfolded as part of a broader governance reform programme; reform has itself been driven by the capable leadership of seasoned public servant Nasir El-Rufai. Elected for a second term in 2019, perhaps the most important quality Governor El-Rufai brings to the table is a capacity for making unpopular but ultimately effective decisions. He previously displayed this capacity as Minister of the Federal Capital Territory from 2003 to 2007; in the face of limited resources, he downsized the civil service, an action he is repeating in Kaduna.\n\nBuoyed by experienced leadership, KDSG is blazing the trail for both digital government interventions and partnering with startups and SMEs. Its globally recognised Eyes and Ears budget monitoring program enables citizens, via a mobile app, to provide feedback on public infrastructure projects. It worked with Yellow Line Services, a Kaduna-based IT company, to facilitate electronic voting during its 2018 local government elections, Nigeria\u2019s first and Africa\u2019s second electronic voting exercise. It has recently signed a deal with drone-delivery unicorn Zipline to deliver Covid vaccines and other on-demand medications. According to the World Bank\u2019s latest subnational Doing Business ratings, Kaduna is the most accessible state to register property and get contracts enforced in Nigeria. Kaduna\u2019s example is an exciting preview of what could be should the Federal Government follow through on a promising start.\n\nWritten by Tolu Segun, Fellow at StateUp.\n\nStateUp is a leading provider of public-purpose technology intelligence. We aim to bridge the gap between the worlds of government and technology through specialist, multi-disciplinary advisory, training, and information services focused on digital innovation that serves a public purpose.",

          "text": "OPay is reportedly in talks to raise $400 million from investors at a valuation of $1.5 billion, according to an exclusive report from The Information.\n\nOPay is looking to raise funding to finance its expansion plan, having launched in Egypt this year. The payments giant says it processed $1.4 billion in payments in October 2020 alone, and that number also reportedly increased to $2 billion by December 2020.\n\nHaving done impressively in Nigeria since its launch in 2018, the new push for funding means that the company has bigger plans.\n\nAn Africa-focused company with Chinese backers\n\nWhile OPay is based in Nigeria, its backers are mostly Chinese companies like Meituan, a multi-billion-dollar Chinese shopping platform.\n\nIn July 2019, OPay raised $50 million from Sequoia Capital, IDG Capital, Source Code, GSR Ventures and Meituan-Dianping. Opera itself also invested in the round. Four months later, it raised a massive $120 million in a Series B round.\n\nThe company\u2019s initial play seemed to be focused on building a super-app, and it led with its popular bike-hailing service, ORide. But the ban on bike hailing in Nigeria stopped that, and the company focused on what had always been at its core: payments.\n\nThe pandemic is one factor that spurred growth for OPay, and as social distancing and Covid-19 regulations made banking halls challenging to access, more people are leaning on mobile money services. The company also has plans to roll out debit and credit cards.\n\nCompetition in the mobile payments space is stiff; while at one time OPay seemed to be the only company growing its agent network, other rivals have now tapped into the same network.

          "text": "Lagos, Nigeria. 26th of May, 2021. \u2013 In the recently released Africa\u2019s Best Brands 2021, TECNO ranked for five consecutive years among the TOP 6 brands on the African continent, marking another prestigious recognition of the brand\u2019s leadership in Africa.\n\nEstablished in 2011, the Brand Africa 100: Africa\u2019s Best Brands rankings is the most authoritative survey and analysis on brands and underlying businesses in Africa, based on a study by Geopoll across 28 countries spanning all the five economic regions and analysis and ranking by Kantar and Brand Leadership. Collectively they account for over 80% of the population and over 80% of the GDP of Africa. The 2021 survey was conducted between March and April 2021 and yielded over 80,000 brand mentions and over 3,500 unique brands.\n\nSince its entry into the African market, TECNO\u2019s operations have been customer focused. Year in year out, they have ensured that their offerings are tailored to meet the needs of Africans.\n\nSpeaking to this at a virtual event organised by Brand Africa, Vincent Uzoegbu, Public Communications Manager, TECNO said; \u201cFrom the first day of our business, TECNO made a strategic decision to focus exclusively on Africa, and when we first entered Africa, our core strategy was to focus on sub-Saharan Africa, where mobile phone penetration was still very low and largely ignored by global mobile phone manufacturers. The aim was to bring a mobile phone that would suit African consumers and improve the lives of as many people in Africa as possible by bridging the digital gap through technology and innovation.\u201d\n\nTECNO has worked tirelessly all these years to do just that. With the brand\u2019s Phantom, Camon, Spark and Pova smartphone series, TECNO has been able to set numerous records that define its success and popularity on the continent, evident of its dogged resolve to present Africa with the best of technology and innovation. When TECNO launched dual SIM cards in Africa, there had been nothing of the kind before then. TECNO was also the first to develop long-lasting batteries that lasted 3 days to combat the epileptic power supply in places like Nigeria. The brand was also the first to bring camera solutions on their smartphones that suited the predominant African dark skin.\n\nAfter more than a decade of commitment and consistency, the rewards are finally falling in. Earlier in the year, Counterpoint Research ranked TECNO as Africa\u2019s number one smartphone brand in 2020, stating that TECNO made its breakthroughs in mobile photography technology and continued investment in the market throughout the pandemic despite a challenging year. And now, with Brand Africa\u2019s new rankings, TECNO has once again come out tops, becoming a leading player in mid to high-end mobile brand segments in Africa.\n\nAttai Oguche, Marketing Manager TECNO Nigeria said; \u201cWe\u2019re very honoured to be listed again amongst Africa\u2019s Best Brands ranking this year and to be part of the key contributors to the development of African business. Shouldering African consumers\u2019 trust and great support, we will keep the momentum to continuously unlock our best of contemporary products and technologies for consumers across Africa and inspire them to pursue a better life via mobile technology innovations.\u201d\n\nAbout TECNOTECNO Mobile is a smartphone brand from TRANSSION Holdings.

They prepared a special evening meal for Ramadan called Iftar and compared the subtleties of cooking with those ingrained in trading.\n\n\u2018Ramadan Special\u2019 is the first cooking show in Nigeria produced by a financial company. However, OctaFX had two great reasons for this accomplishment.\n\nFirst, the company honoured the Holy Month along with its clients. Ramadan is about being with your family, and what better way to bring the relatives together than cooking a tasty meal?\n\nSecond, trading and cooking surprisingly have a lot in common. The two hosts of the show explored this correlation while putting together ingredients for their very own blend of Iftar\u2014a popular evening meal for Ramadan.\n\nThe duo prepared this particular version of iftar quite close to Nigerian tradition, including a fruit salad, grilled chicken, grapes, dates, jollof rice, and a vegetable salad. Influencers Abdulazeez Greene and Apaokagi Maryam rose up to the challenge to deliver this delicious meal.\n\nApaokagi Maryam is a frequent collaborator of the global Forex broker and took part in the last OctaFX Goal Booster promotion. According to Rosbena, she ranked first among the \u2018Top Ten Nigerian Instagram Comedians\u2019. Neither influencers are professional traders but have already had their fair share of exciting Forex encounters.\n\nThe show went live on YouTube on 8 May and is available for viewing. This is not OctaFX\u2019s first take on producing a show. The company enjoys experimenting with formats to bring its clients the most engaging and useful content. In March 2021, OctaFX stepped into an exciting collaboration with the popular rapper Peruzzi, taking part in his music video \u2018Somebody Baby\u2019.\n\nOctaFX is committed to educating its clients about trading in accessible and appealing ways. The company is aspiring to create more shows like \u2018Ramadan Special\u2019 in the future.\n\nOctaFX is a global broker that provides online trading services worldwide since 2011. It offers a state-of-the-art trading experience to over 7 million trading accounts globally. OctaFX has won more than 40 awards since its foundation, including the \u2018Best ECN Broker 2020\u2019 award from World Finance and more recently the 2020 \u2018Best Forex Broker Nigeria\u2019 award and the 2020\u2032\n\nMost Transparent Broker\u2019 award from Global Banking & Finance Review and Forex Awards, respectively.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nNCC to take subscribers\u2019 IMEI | Newsbites\n\nMay 26: New Episode!

          "text": "On Monday, May 24, 2021, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) announced new licensing requirements for Payment Service Providers (PSPs) in Nigeria.\n\nThe new requirements apply to companies registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) and wish to apply for new licences or renew old ones.\n\nThese requirements relate to licences for Switching and Processing, Mobile Money Operators (MMOs), Payment Solution Services (PSSs), Super Agent, Payment Solution Service Providers (PSSPs), and Payment Terminal Service Providers (PTSPs).\n\nThere is a flat application fee of \u20a6100,000 for all categories, and if an application is successful, \u20a61m is to be paid into CBN\u2019s Licensing fee for Payment Products account. This excludes other additional financial requirements for each category.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSwitching companies like Interswitch that facilitate communication between different payment service providers are expected to have \u20a62 billion in shareholders\u2019 funds and deposit an escrow of \u20a62 billion into CBN before getting the Switching and Processing licence.\n\nThe same requirements also apply to the MMO licence for mobile apps like Paga and OPay used to send and receive money.\n\nCompanies applying for a PTSP or PSSP licence are expected to have \u20a6100 million in shareholders\u2019 funds and deposit an escrow of \u20a6100 million into CBN.\n\nPTSPs like CitiServe deploy and maintain payment terminals for banks, while PSSP like Paystack and Flutterwave accept electronic payments.\n\nFor a Super Agent licence required to provide an agent network for deploying payment services, companies like the Nigerian Postal Service (NIPOST) must have \u20a650 million in shareholders\u2019 funds and deposit an escrow of the same amount.\n\nA company looking to get a PSS licence, which encompasses all earlier mentioned licences, is expected to have \u20a6250 million in shareholders funds and deposit an escrow of the same amount.\n\nFor all categories, shareholders\u2019 funds must be unimpaired by losses, escrow deposits made in full, and payments made in the name of the company applying for the licence \u2014 not an individual or related company.\n\nAccording to the CBN, the escrow deposits are refundable and will be invested in treasury bills.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecall that in December 2020, CBN made changes to its licence categorisation, dividing up payment system licences into four broad categories: Switching and Processing, MMOs, PSSs, and Regulatory Sandboxes.\n\nThus, the previous PSP licence with its tier systems no longer applies.\n\nComparing the old with the new\n\nIn comparison with CBN\u2019s previous requirements, there are very few differences. These new requirements act as a further explanation in line with the apex bank\u2019s decision to create new categories.\n\nIt introduces the following:\n\nEscrow deposits are to be invested in treasury bills.\n\nAll payments must be made in the applying company\u2019s name.\n\nAn Information Technology policy detailing ten different policies relating to cybersecurity, data privacy, and physical security.\n\nOther documentary requirements peculiar to each category.\n\nIn addition to these new requirements, the document does not state how much it would cost to renew a licence, a licence\u2019s validity, or how long the CBN should hold escrow deposits.\n\nIt is also important to note that in comparison with the old PSP tier system \u2014 super licence, standard licence, and basic licence \u2014 there are reductions in the required minimum Shareholders\u2019 Fund (SHF) and application fees.\n\nSwitching and Processing, PSSPs, PTSPs, and Super Agent (super licence) \u2014 no longer apply: \u20a63 billion reduction in minimum SHF, \u20a61,900,000 reduction in application fees.\n\nMMOs, Non-Bank Merchant Acquiring, and Super Agent (standard licence) \u2014 no longer apply: \u20a61 billion reduction in minimum SHF, \u20a6900,000 reduction in application fees.\n\nPSSPs, PTSPs, and Super Agent (basic licence) \u2014 no longer apply: no change in minimum SHF, no change in application fees.\n\nWhat does this mean for fintechs?\n\nFintechs wishing to get into the PSP space have to meet all the requirements stated in the document. While these requirements are not new and even seem favourable, they might pose challenges for cash strapped startups.\n\nHowever, the requirements set by the CBN are there for a reason. The PSP space is a capital-intensive industry, and these requirements will prevent unscrupulous persons from handling large sums of money.\n\nFor fintechs already in the PSP space, further guidelines are needed regarding the specific amount to be paid in renewal fees. This is doubly interesting because the CBN\u2019s deadline for compliance is the end of June 2021.\n\nWhy is the apex bank just releasing these guidelines? Did it communicate these requirements with the PSPs? Why take the PSPs by surprise?\n\nRegister to attend the largest educators\u2019 event in Africa. Edves Catalyst 2021: \u201cA New Path\u201d.

          "text": "On Monday, May 24, 2021, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) announced new licensing requirements for Payment Service Providers (PSPs) in Nigeria.\n\nThe new requirements apply to companies registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) and wish to apply for new licences or renew old ones.\n\nThese requirements relate to licences for Switching and Processing, Mobile Money Operators (MMOs), Payment Solution Services (PSSs), Super Agent, Payment Solution Service Providers (PSSPs), and Payment Terminal Service Providers (PTSPs).\n\nThere is a flat application fee of \u20a6100,000 for all categories, and if an application is successful, \u20a61m is to be paid into CBN\u2019s Licensing fee for Payment Products account. This excludes other additional financial requirements for each category.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSwitching companies like Interswitch that facilitate communication between different payment service providers are expected to have \u20a62 billion in shareholders\u2019 funds and deposit an escrow of \u20a62 billion into CBN before getting the Switching and Processing licence.\n\nThe same requirements also apply to the MMO licence for mobile apps like Paga and OPay used to send and receive money.\n\nCompanies applying for a PTSP or PSSP licence are expected to have \u20a6100 million in shareholders\u2019 funds and deposit an escrow of \u20a6100 million into CBN.\n\nPTSPs like CitiServe deploy and maintain payment terminals for banks, while PSSP like Paystack and Flutterwave accept electronic payments.\n\nFor a Super Agent licence required to provide an agent network for deploying payment services, companies like the Nigerian Postal Service (NIPOST) must have \u20a650 million in shareholders\u2019 funds and deposit an escrow of the same amount.\n\nA company looking to get a PSS licence, which encompasses all earlier mentioned licences, is expected to have \u20a6250 million in shareholders funds and deposit an escrow of the same amount.\n\nFor all categories, shareholders\u2019 funds must be unimpaired by losses, escrow deposits made in full, and payments made in the name of the company applying for the licence \u2014 not an individual or related company.\n\nAccording to the CBN, the escrow deposits are refundable and will be invested in treasury bills.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecall that in December 2020, CBN made changes to its licence categorisation, dividing up payment system licences into four broad categories: Switching and Processing, MMOs, PSSs, and Regulatory Sandboxes.\n\nThus, the previous PSP licence with its tier systems no longer applies.\n\nComparing the old with the new\n\nIn comparison with CBN\u2019s previous requirements, there are very few differences. These new requirements act as a further explanation in line with the apex bank\u2019s decision to create new categories.\n\nIt introduces the following:\n\nEscrow deposits are to be invested in treasury bills.\n\nAll payments must be made in the applying company\u2019s name.\n\nAn Information Technology policy detailing ten different policies relating to cybersecurity, data privacy, and physical security.\n\nOther documentary requirements peculiar to each category.\n\nIn addition to these new requirements, the document does not state how much it would cost to renew a licence, a licence\u2019s validity, or how long the CBN should hold escrow deposits.\n\nIt is also important to note that in comparison with the old PSP tier system \u2014 super licence, standard licence, and basic licence \u2014 there are reductions in the required minimum Shareholders\u2019 Fund (SHF) and application fees.\n\nSwitching and Processing, PSSPs, PTSPs, and Super Agent (super licence) \u2014 no longer apply: \u20a63 billion reduction in minimum SHF, \u20a61,900,000 reduction in application fees.\n\nMMOs, Non-Bank Merchant Acquiring, and Super Agent (standard licence) \u2014 no longer apply: \u20a61 billion reduction in minimum SHF, \u20a6900,000 reduction in application fees.\n\nPSSPs, PTSPs, and Super Agent (basic licence) \u2014 no longer apply: no change in minimum SHF, no change in application fees.\n\nWhat does this mean for fintechs?\n\nFintechs wishing to get into the PSP space have to meet all the requirements stated in the document. While these requirements are not new and even seem favourable, they might pose challenges for cash strapped startups.\n\nHowever, the requirements set by the CBN are there for a reason. The PSP space is a capital-intensive industry, and these requirements will prevent unscrupulous persons from handling large sums of money.\n\nFor fintechs already in the PSP space, further guidelines are needed regarding the specific amount to be paid in renewal fees. This is doubly interesting because the CBN\u2019s deadline for compliance is the end of June 2021.\n\nWhy is the apex bank just releasing these guidelines? Did it communicate these requirements with the PSPs? Why take the PSPs by surprise?\n\nRegister to attend the largest educators\u2019 event in Africa. Edves Catalyst 2021: \u201cA New Path\u201d.

          "title": "These 11 startups are preparing African kids for the future",
          "text": "\u201cKnowledge is power. Information is liberating. Education is the premise of progress, in every society, in every family.\u201d \u2013 Kofi Annan.\n\nEducation is vital for any society looking to make any form of progress. In Africa, however, that is not always the case. The United Nations Children\u2019s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) reports that close to half of Africa\u2019s population is under 18.\n\nThanks to steady growth in births and declining child mortality rates, Africa\u2019s child population is expected to reach the 1 billion mark by 2055.\n\nAccording to the UNESCO Institute of Statistics, one in five children between the ages of 6 and 11 are out of school. That number increases as the children get older, with one-third of youth between the ages of 12 and 14 out of school and almost 60% of youth between 15 and 17 out of school.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese numbers are more startling when we consider school enrolments by gender. Nine million African girls between the ages of 6 and 11 will never go to school compared to 6 million African boys. By the time these children are adolescents, the exclusion rate for girls is 36% compared to 32% for boys.\n\nRecognising the role of education in development, the United Nations designated quality education as one of its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nEdtech startups are rising to the occasion in Africa. Although they do not receive as much coverage or funding as fintech or agritech startups in Africa, they supplement the job of the continent\u2019s existing educational structures. However, they face a major hurdle with low internet penetration meaning that only a few children can access these services.\n\nData from Techpoint Intelligence showing the percentage of students with access to digital connectivity in West Africa reveals that The Gambia has the highest rate of digital connectivity among school-age children with 65%.\n\nNigeria, on the other hand, has just 3% of school-age children able to access the Internet at home despite having more edtech startups than any other African country.\n\nThe sector has grown consistently, with a Briter Bridges report stating that there are over 210 edtech startups on the continent as of Q1 2020. These startups adopt different models but with the same goal, making learning seamless while getting outstanding outcomes.\n\nListed in no particular order below are 11 randomly selected edtech startups you should check out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nuLesson\n\nFollowing stints at Konga, DealDey, and E-motion Advertising, Nigerian serial entrepreneur, Sim Shagaya, founded uLesson in 2019 to bridge the gap in learning for kids in secondary schools across Africa.\n\nSince its launch, the startup has recorded more than one million app downloads and raised over $10 million from investors, making it one of Africa\u2019s best-funded edtech startups.\n\nCurrently serving students in Nigeria, Ghana, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and The Gambia, uLesson has its sights trained on the East and South African regions in its expansion plans.\n\nUsing interactive videos and focusing on producing content that students enjoy, uLesson seeks to augment the existing educational systems.\n\nIt can be accessed through an Android device or a Windows PC for a relatively affordable fee. Depending on what plan a user chooses, they could end up paying as little as $6 monthly.\n\nTuteria\n\nIn 2005, Godwin Benson was not paid for tutoring services he rendered. Worse still, the man who hired him searched for two months before he found him.\n\nThat experience inspired him to co-found Tuteria \u2014 an online platform that connects people who want to learn to people who can teach them \u2014 with Abiola Oyeniyi in 2015.\n\nSome of the startup\u2019s investors include Microsoft, Facebook, and the Royal Academy of Engineering.\n\nPrepClass\n\nPrepClass was founded in 2014 by Chukwuwezam Obanor and Olumide Ogunlana to address the severe shortage of trained teachers in Nigeria. Similar to Tuteria, PrepClass connects learners and tutors for a fee. The startup has raised over $400,000 from investors such as Venture Garden Group and Africa Angels Network.\n\nPass.ng\n\nExaminations are an important part of the educational system. For a long time, the only resources available to Nigerian students preparing for examinations like the West African Examinations Council (WAEC) were voluminous past questions. But with Pass.ng, students have the opportunity to test their knowledge of different subjects through a series of mock tests.\n\nAlthough the startup initially focused on students preparing for WAEC and the Joint Admission Matriculation Board (JAMB) examination \u2014 now the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) \u2014 it currently supports tests for the University of Lagos (UNILAG) diploma programme and the Federal Government\u2019s N-Power programme.\n\nM-Shule\n\nLaunched in January 2016 by Julie Otieno and Claire Mongeau, Kenyan edtech startup, M-Shule, utilises artificial intelligence to deliver personalised learning experiences to learners through SMS and chatbots. Performance data from students is then shared with parents, schools, and teachers to enhance the learning process.\n\nAmbani Africa\n\nAs more parts of Africa become urbanised, there is the danger that indigenous African languages would be lost in the process. For families that feel this way, Ambani uses augmented reality (AR) to teach young people African languages. The languages currently available on the app include isiZulu, isiXhosa, Setswana, Sepedi, Tshivenda, and English.\n\nSmartix Education\n\nGhanaian-based Smartix Education develops learning solutions for students using animated videos, activities, and books delivered through an Android and web app. It also runs a vacation school for students in kindergarten and upwards.\n\nSyafunda\n\nSyafunda was founded in 2013 by Zakheni Ngubo in South Africa to provide access to digital content. The startup partners with local content developers setting up digital libraries in places where Internet connection is limited or non-existent.\n\neLimu\n\nThe Kenyan edtech startup\u2019s name means education in Swahili, and it creates educational apps and content for students in primary school. In 2020, it was acquired by CcHUB as part of its content creation expansion plans. The idea for eLimu was conceived by Marie Githinji and Nivi Mukherjee in Kenya\u2019s iHub; the startup uses local examples to teach concepts to students.\n\nKidato\n\nPublic schools in Africa have a high student-to-teacher ratio of 1:50. An alternative is private schools which have a student-to-teacher ratio of 1:20. However, this comes at a steep price for parents. Kenyan serial entrepreneur, Sam Gichuru, founded Kidato to solve this problem after he had to take his children out of school to be homeschooled.\n\nThe startup was accepted into Y Combinator in 2021. Kidato is an online school for students between the ages of 4 and 18. It offers both regular academic classes and after-school lessons for students. To ensure that the students also have the interaction that occurs in regular schools, the school takes students on monthly educational field trips.\n\nGradely\n\nGradely provides an adaptive learning platform that helps parents and schools identify learning gaps in students and recommends specific ways to close those gaps. It was founded in 2019 by Boye Oshinaga, Femi Ibiwoye, Seyi Adelaju, and Babatunde Caleb, and counts Microtraction as one of its investors.\n\nFeatured image credit: Global Partnership for Education \u2013 GPE Flickr via Compfight cc\n\nRegister to attend the largest educators\u2019 event in Africa.

          "title": "Green Africa disrupts airline business with cheap airfares",
          "text": "With insecurity driving more people to travel by air and the incessant surge in airfares as a result of depleting fleet and high foreign exchange, Green Africa, a new entrant in the Nigerian aviation sector, may cause disruption in airline business as it commences sales of tickets with airfares as low as N16,500.\n\nFrom N28,000 for one hour flight after the high season in December 2020, the average cost of one hour ticket has now risen to N60,000 for one way ticket and rising still as high as N80,000 for passengers who buy a ticket on the day they are travelling.\n\nAirlines have continued to increase the price of tickets because they source foreign exchange from the parallel market at N500 per dollar.\n\nThis is also as operators point out that many aircraft that were taken out of the country overseas were yet to be brought back because of the coronavirus pandemic, which has hindered activities in most countries, so the Nigerian carriers have limited fleet but high demand for air travel, as insecurity continues to discourage many people from travelling by road.\n\nWith the 70 percent slash in airfares offered by Green Africa, stakeholders are concerned if these fares would be sustainable and if passengers would be willing to fly propeller aircraft instead of jet aircraft, considering how uncomfortable these aircraft can be.\n\n\u201cActually, if I ran an airline in Nigeria, I would do exactly what Green Africa appears to be trying to do \u2013 target the mid-to-lower end of the market with cheap tickets by using propeller aircraft instead of jet aircraft.\n\n\u201cUp to 40 percent less fuel consumption so cheaper tickets. The trade-off is longer flight times and more in-flight turbulence since turboprops have lower cruising altitude (and turboprops are also noisier than jets). But in Nigeria, the deciding factor is always price,\u201d David Hundeyin, a renowned writer, journalist and researcher stated via his twitter handle @DavidHundeyin.\n\nHe acknowledged that turboprops are less comfortable and take longer time than jets, adding that some aircraft type like the ATR72, which Green Africa uses are known to have tail rudder issues in severe icing conditions, but in our equatorial climate, that is unlikely to be a factor.\n\nHundeyin, who expressed his optimism in Green Africa\u2019s business model, added, \u201cLet people fly for N20,000 and you\u2019re printing money.\u201d\n\nWith Green Africa\u2019s commencement of ticket sales, some airlines are already slashing fares.\n\nFor instance, airfares from Lagos to Abuja has dropped from N60,000 in April to between N25,000 and N35,000 now.\n\nAirPeace slashed the airfare from Lagos to Ilorin from N52,500, some airlines charged last month, to N32,700.\n\nSeyi Adewale, CEO, Mainstream Cargo Limited, told BusinessDay that N16,500 airfares was just a promotional fare by Green Africa to appeal to passengers not used to flying a propeller aircraft and who were yet to experience the airline for the first time.\n\n\u201cIf Green Africa does not get people to experience their flights, they won\u2019t be able to penetrate the market. People would be willing to fly the turboprops, as long as it is cheaper,\u201d Adawale said.\n\nHe assured that after two weeks of offering promotional prices, Green Africa would begin to adjust prices to fit into current operational and economic realities.\n\nChecks by BusinessDay show that the seat capacity for an ATR 72-600 aircraft that would be operated by Green Africa would take between 70 and 78 passengers, depending on the seat configuration.\n\nJohn Ojikutu, aviation security consultant and secretary general of the Aviation Safety Round Table Initiative (ASRTI), told BusinessDay that the load factors of the small aircraft were lower, so they may not break even if they charge the same rates with airlines having bigger aircraft.\n\nIt cost airlines between $500,000 and $1 million to carry out mandatory C-checks on their aircraft every 18 months.\n\nChecks show that it cost not less than N2 million to operate a one-way flight using a Boeing 737 aircraft. Aviation fuel cost about N220 per litre and operators would need not less than 8,000ltr (N1.7m) to operate a one way Lagos- Abuja flight. In addition, operators need to pay for landing and parking fees, ground handling fees, en-route air navigation services, catering, among others.\n\nAviation analysts say when airlines charge passengers less than N40,000 for a one-way flight, they are operating at a loss or relying on government intervention funds, palliatives or concession on recurring debts.\n\nHowever, Tolu Odutola, a pilot and aviation expert, argued that Green Africa operates ATR 72-600, which are generally cheaper to maintain than the 737s, CRJs and other aircraft operated by local airlines.\n\nOperations cost is generally cheaper and that is probably why ticket costs are commiserate, Odutola said, but noted that N16,500 fare may also just be an introductory rate to break into the market.",

Hon. Comr. Philip Shaibu, reaffirmed the government\u2019s commitment to containing the pandemic and curbing irregular migration among youths in the state.\n\nHe noted that the present administration of Governor Obaseki is putting in place reforms and policies to ensure a business-friendly environment to attract investment into the state.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cBefore we came on board, our youths were migrating in their large numbers abroad, passing through dehumanizing situations to reach Europe but we said no, it\u2019s dangerous for them to risk their lives.\n\n\u201cWe have changed the narrative in discouraging our youths from taking dangerous routes abroad; rather we have created legal means, ensuring they are equipped with skills and other means to legally embark on such journeys without putting their lives on the line.\u201d\n\nThe governor further commended the World Health Organization for its support to the government\u2019s efforts in fighting COVID-19 pandemic in the state.\n\nHe continued: \u201cWe have transformed the educational sector, starting from the basic education. We introduced the Edo Basic Education Sector Transformation (EDOBEST) programme, where we have efficiently deployed and utilized technology to impact knowledge on our pupils.\n\n\u201cThey can now read and write with the aid of technology. The activities of teachers can easily be monitored; they have also benefited as we have enhanced their skills, using technology.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Kallon said the delegation was in Benin to reinforce partnership with the government and to see how they can work better in the fight against COVID-19.\n\nHe noted that a part of the aim for the visit was to discuss ideas that would put an end to irregular migration among youths in Edo.\n\n...",

          "text": "The Nigerian government has again publicly declared a total of 132 travellers as \u201cpersons of interest,\u201d for allegedly violating new protocols put in place to halt the spread of the dreaded coronavirus disease in the country.\n\nA statement issued on Thursday night by the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) on COVID-19 and signed by its chairman and Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, said the listed individuals who recently visited or arrived from India, Brazil and Turkey, are potential health hazards to the society.\n\nThis newspaper had earlier reported the declaration of 90 travellers as health hazards for allegedly committing the same offence. The list had then comprised both Nigerians and Indians.\n\nThe PSC has, therefore, sought the whereabouts of the violators on the latest list, and asked them to urgently present themselves for appropriate evaluations.\n\nThe statement added that the alleged violators evaded the mandatory seven-day quarantine at port health facilities before they are allowed to move about in the country.\n\nAccording to the statement, these persons who arrived in the country through the Nnamdi Azikiwe Airport, Abuja, \u201chave been declared Persons of Interest (POI) on account of posing considerable danger to overall public health and violation of Nigeria\u2019s COVID19 travel protocol by evading the mandatory 7-day quarantine for persons arriving from restricted countries.\u201d\n\nThe government has, therefore, said those on the new list \u201cconstitute an immediate health hazard to the society.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey must therefore transport themselves safely, to the nearest state public health departments within 48hrs of this notice for immediate evaluation and call the Port Health Services, Federal Ministry of Health on 08036134672 or 08032461990 for further directions,\u201d the statement added.\n\nThe statement added that the concerned violators shall face regulatory sanctions including but not limited to, \u201cdisabling their travel passports for a period not less than one year; cancellation of visas or permits of foreigners that have abused our hospitality; and prosecution under the 2021 Health Protection Regulations.\u201d\n\nThe list of violators as provided by the government is reproduced below:\n\n1.

          "text": "The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), has said in the last two years, the Commission has recorded a total of 41 incidents involving deliberate attacks on the commission\u2019s facilities.\n\nThis is even as the nation\u2019s electoral body noted that these attacks will not only undermine the commission\u2019s capacity to organise elections and other electoral activities but will also damage the nation\u2019s electoral process and democracy.\n\nThe INEC chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, who disclosed this while speaking during an emergency meeting with the security agencies under the auspices of the Inter-agency Consultative Committee On Election Security (ICCES) on Thursday in Abuja, said he believes in the capacity of the committee to ramp up its activities to curtail the unjustifiable acts of aggression against the Commission.\n\nYakubu told the committee that nine incidents of the attack on the commission happened in 2019 and 21 cases in 2020.\n\nIn the last four weeks, he said 11 offices of the commission were either set ablaze or vandalised.\n\nYakubu noted that two of these incidents were caused by Boko Haram and bandit attacks while 10 resulted from thuggery during election and post-election violence.\n\nAlthough the commission was assessing the loss of materials during recent attacks, Yakubu said preliminary assessment so far indicates that INEC lost 1,105 ballot boxes, 694 voting cubicles, 429 electric generating sets, and 13 utility vehicles to the attacks.\n\nThe INEC helmsman said by working together with the security agencies, they can stop the attacks and the wanton destruction of critical electoral assets.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe said, \u201cIn the next nine months, two major elections will be conducted. The Anambra State Governorship election is scheduled to hold on 6th November 2021 to be followed by the end-of-tenure elections for 68 Area Council constituencies in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) holding on 12th February 2022.\n\n\u201cThese major elections will be followed by the Ekiti and Osun State Governorship elections ahead of the 2023 General Election which is just 632 days away.\n\n\u201cIn addition to elections, the commission is also preparing for the resumption of the nationwide Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) exercise on 28th June 2021 to enable Nigerians who have attained the age 18 years and those who did not register previously to do so.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, registered voters who wish to change their voting locations and those who wish to correct their names and other details on their Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs) can do so. We plan to create 2,673 registration centres and deploy 5,346 officials for the exercise along with expensive voter enrollment machines. All these activities require security, thereby adding to the urgency and importance of this meeting.\u201d\n\nHe noted the attacks, which initially appeared as isolated and occasional actions, have now become more frequent and systematically targeted at demobilising and dismantling critical electoral infrastructure in the country.\n\nYakubu, therefore, said destruction of the commission\u2019s facilities should be treated as a national security emergency.\n\n\u201cUnder the auspices of ICCES, we should ramp up our activities to curtail these unjustifiable acts of aggression. This will entail not only drawing on our separate and collective resources within ICCES but also increased collaboration with citizens, communities, and all stakeholders.\n\n\u201cI must place on record the support to the Commission from communities we serve across the country. Among many other things, they have donated land to locate many of the Commission\u2019s facilities, provided voluntary assistance during electoral activities like registration of voters, and even donated materials such as chairs and shelter during elections.\n\n\u201cEven in the context of the recent destruction of INEC facilities, some of these communities have offered to rebuild our offices and to help protect them going forward. We should tap into this goodwill in finding solutions to the present situation,\u201d he added.\n\nAs a commission, he said they have been undertaking their own internal review of the situation and seeking answers.\n\nHe said on Wednesday last week, the commission met with the Resident Electoral Commissioners (RECs) and received briefings about the rising threats.\n\nHe continued: \u201cWe are presently compiling the useful suggestions from the meeting and other internal reviews, which we hope to share with this body in due course.\n\n\u201cI understand that the security agencies are doing their own individual assessments. Beyond Election Day security, we look forward to creating a framework for an all-year-round, end-to-end protection of electoral facilities under the auspices of ICCES.\u201d\n\nHe noted that since the conclusion of the 2019 general election, the commission has been working with the security agencies and has so far conducted four end-of-tenure governorship elections and 28 out of 32 bye-elections.\n\n\u201cOn this note, may I also extend our condolences to the Inspector-General of Police and other security agencies for the loss of their personnel on electoral duty, the most recent of which occurred during the Ekiti East State constituency bye-election on 20th March 2021.\n\n\u201cMay God comfort their families as well as the families of voters who lost their lives during that election. The Commission has already indefinitely suspended the bye-election,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "Programming is a well-paid job that requires a whole lot of analytical skills, training, motivation, willingness, a positive attitude and most importantly, consistency to become an expert, says Cloud Specialist, Nkemakolam Nnad.\n\nNnad describes a programmer as someone whose job description is to write code (syntax) that is understandable to computers to solve simple to complex problems or automated processes.\n\n\u201cYou also need to pick the right programming language that suits the kind of job that you are applying for, because there are different kinds of programming languages like the low level language (e.g. machine language and assembly language) and the high level language (e.g. the procedural-Oriented Language, Problem-Oriented language and the Natural language).\n\n\u201cEach organisation works with the one that suits them, and you can pick the one that suits your company\u2019s need and be determined to learn it,\u201d he adds.\n\nChallenges\n\nPatience is required for this job and it takes a whole lot of time, effort, motivation and consistency. \u201cSo as a young person, you need to spend hours, learning programming. That is the only way to go. The problems/obstacles are even worse for Nigerians, because learning programming language requires constant light, laptop and constant internet connection\u201d Nnad added.\n\nFor instance, as a Nigerian and one that was not born with a silver spoon, Nnad said he had to struggle to be a programmer. \u201cI had to raise money to buy myself a laptop, spent nearly all my salary on internet and pay for courses. And because I was determined to learn programming, I spent a lot of my time learning it,\u201d he added.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nProfitability\n\nNnad says programming is lucrative anywhere in the world as nearly every company needs a programmer. It is also one of the highest paid jobs depending on the type of programming e.g. web programmer, cloud developer, engineer, system programmer and digital scientists among others are some of the highest paid, he said.\n\nIn Nigeria, for instance, Nnad says most youths who are programmers are well paid. \u201cMost of my friends who are programmers are working remotely. Some of them have two to five well-paid jobs. Though based in Nigeria, they are working for companies in Canada, USA and Netherlands. In a month, they make nothing less than N1.3million,\u201d he said.\n\nHe, however, noted that programmers who are fully employed by Nigerian companies are not well paid because most employers don\u2019t understand the value of a programmer. \u201cThat is the main reason majority of us are traveling abroad or working remotely,\u201d he said.\n\nHe urged those who aspire to be programmers, to put in effort, be determined to learn it and be consistent.",

Nigeria, I congratulate you all on this special day set aside to celebrate you across the Federation.\n\n\u201cThe Government of this nation has set aside 27th of May each year to rededicate her unalloyed commitment to your total wellbeing and protection as enshrined in the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the Child Rights Act, the Violence Against Persons Prohibition Act (VAPP Act) and other international treaties and conventions.\n\nOur aim is to emphasize your importance as the future leaders of our great nation.\n\n\u201cThis administration is therefore deeply concerned about these worrying incidences and has put in place several interventions to ensure that all our children are protected from incessant attacks, kidnap, violence, abuse and exploitation and live in a holistic and protective environment for a guaranteed and prosperous future.\n\n\u201cOne of Such interventions is my commitment to the \u201cSafe Schools Declaration (SSD)\u201d which I ratified in 2019 to ensure the Government of Nigeria puts in Place a national policy that would guide its implementation nationwide.\n\n\u201cHowever, endorsement of the safe School Declaration is not sufficient as implementation or the project is very critical to the prevention and response to attacks on education, including those targeting women and girls.\u201d\n\nHe therefore called on state governments and security agencies to rededicate themselves to this project to protect children from incessant attacks and ensure that their education suffers no setback.\n\nFurthermore, Buhari said that his administration is also expanding the Home-Grown-SchoolFeeding Programme by targeting an additional 3 million children who will receive one free nutritious meal a day.\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, the issue of Street Children or children in non-conventional educational system are also being given the requisite attention through the Alternative School Programme, where children who are out of conventional schools are enrolled in schools or supported to continue their education wherever they are.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, I have directed that a full range of Social Intervention Programmes be deployed across all Ministries, Departments and Agencies of government to achieve the, vision of lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty by 2030.\n\nThe goal is that in the next 10 years, there will be less out of school children, less indices of malnutrition and less child mortality rate.\u201d\n\nIn a related development, the Minister of the FCT, Malam Muhammad Bello, while congratulating all the children in the Federal Capital Territory on the celebration of the 2021 National Children Day charged them to imbibe the virtues of integrity, honesty, hard work, discipline and a deep sense of patriotism and love for country.\n\nHe also reminded them that as national and global leaders of the future with the desire to ensure the greatness of Nigeria and also excel in their chosen fields of endeavor, it was essential that they embraced these character traits.\n\nHe also charged them to shun all acts that might negatively impact their future such as cultism, immoral behavior, disrespect for authority, drug abuse, and online criminal activities amongst others.\n\nMalam Bello also charged them to be patriotic at all times and love and honour Nigeria, calling on them to always work in harmony for the benefit of the country.\n\n\u201cYou have no other country but Nigeria and as residents of the FCT, you have an obligation to live together in peace and harmony as envisaged by our founding fathers\u201d, the Minister said.",

Osuoza who made the declaration in a statement in Asaba, said the repudiation of the claim which the APC attack dogs led by Mr. Sylvester Imonina latched on to deride the person of His Excellency, Senator Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, Governor of Delta State and calling him unprintable names has further exposed the propagandists as ill-mannered, unrefined, and who would go to any length to do the unimaginable to propagate lies against Dr. Okowa and his administration.\n\nDr. Osuoza said: \u201cWe commend the nobility of Deltans who held themselves together when APC\u2019s \u2018nattering nabobs of negativism\u2019 spewed their distorted and deceptive information of a non-existent payment to Delta State, and for which without double-checking for the fact of the matter, they unabashedly, with gusto rushed into conclusions.\n\n\u201cTheir mission, which is in consonance with their sworn mindset to tarnish the image of the governor, his administration, and the PDP evidently turned out to be ill-fated, as the Accountant General of the Federation, Ahmed Idris withdrew his earlier claim in a statement saying: \u201cThe issue of the \u00a34.2m loot has not been properly resolved.\n\nThe money is still being awaited, after which the issues around it will be resolved before further action is taken. For now, no money has been returned to Delta State.\u201d\n\n\u201cHas Mr. Imonina, APC\u2019s chief officer in misinformation and disinformation heard of the above clarification by the Office of the Accountant General of the Federation?\n\nA person of character and good conscience would have also recanted and withdrawn all the false theatrics made in the name of a Press Release by now just like the OAGF has done?\n\nBut no, not those who have sworn to at all cost bring down Governor Okowa, his administration, and paint the well-loved PDP black. We laugh at their foolishness and indiscretion.\n\nMeanwhile, the House of Representatives has queried AGF Idris over illegal withdrawals from recovered funds\u2019 accounts.\n\nMinister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, told the lawmakers on Thursday that she had no clue concerning the recovered \u00a34.2m Ibori cash from the United Kingdom.\n\nIdris and Ahmed were being questioned by the House Ad-hoc Committee on Assessment and Status of All Recovered Loots Movable and Immovable Assets from 2002 to 2020 by Agencies of the Federal Government of Nigeria, for Effective Efficient Management and Utilisation, headed by Adejoro Adeogun.\n\nOn the illegal withdrawals from the recovered loot accounts, reference was made to the sum of N19 billion, which was withdrawn from the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) recovery account.\n\nIdris, the AGF listed several recovery accounts including that of the EFCC, trying to justify the withdrawals from these separate recovery accounts, insisting that they were all linked by the Treasury Single Account, hence technically an extension of the Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF).\n\nHe stressed that withdrawals from the accounts were made with the appropriate approvals.\n\nMembers of the committee however, disagreed with this position, saying there was no basis for such withdrawals as they were not appropriated for.\n\nThey insisted that any withdrawal must be from the CRF and must be backed by law, adding that the AGF should be held responsible for possible violation of the constitution and extant financial regulations.\n\n\u201cOf what essence is appropriation if you can just dip your hands and take money from government accounts,\u201d a member of the committee, Wole Oke, querried.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s constitutionally wrong to withdraw money that was not from CRF and not approved by the National Assembly.\u201d\n\nThe lawmakers argued that no approval from any authority could supersede the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria adding that it was \u2018illegal\u2019 withdrwals according to findings.\n\nMembers of the Committee butressed that withdrawals from the recovery accounts could not be traced in any Appropriation Act, and the National Assembly was not aware.\n\nFinance Minister Ahmed, agreed with the House members on this, saying it was wrong to take money from any other government account that was not the CRF.\n\n\u201cEven then, any money taken from the account must be appropriated for by the National Assembly,\u201d Ahmed opined.\n\nShe said though there is provision in the budget for recovered loot, they have to be moved to the CRF first before it can be used for anything else.\n\n\u201cIf there were instances where money is taken directly from the recovery accounts, then they were wrong.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the status of the \u00a34.2 million Ibori loot from the United Kingdom, Ahmed said she was yet to get any information on the recovery.\n\n\u201cOn the \u00a34.2 million I am still waiting to get information about this recovery. I have read in the media that the recovery has been made.\n\nBut what has happened in the past is that the Attorney General would write to Mr President and report that recovery then, give advice on what needs to be done or give advice based on the negotiations that they made during the process of the recovery.\n\n\u201cThe instruction will be conveyed to us. But up till now, I have not received any formal conveyance, any formal information written in respect of this \u00a34.2 million, so, I cannot say whether it is a Federal Government fund or a state fund. It depends on the advice that would come,\u201d she said.\n\nBefore adjourning sitting to the following day, the committee directed the AGF and Finance Minister to furnish it with a summary of all transactions made from the recovered loot accounts since 2002.\n\nThe committee also invited the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele, to appear before it on June 3, 2021 to properly reconcile all recovery accounts.",

          "text": "There are mixed feelings over Thursday\u2019s appointment of Major-General Farouk Yahaya as the 22nd Chief of Army Staff (COAS).\n\nHis appointment by President Muhammadu Buhari followed the death of Lt.-General Ibrahim Attahiru, in an air crash alongside 10 other military officers in Kaduna last Friday.\n\nAlso, Blueprint gathered Yahaya\u2019s choice was greeted with jubilation among soldiers at the Theatre Command headquarter in Maimalari Cantonment, Maiduguri as he was hailed while addressing the troops shortly after the announcement.\n\nA statement by Army spokesperson, Brigadier-General Mohammed Yerima, said Yahaya was before now the Theatre Commander, Operation Hadin Kai responsible for counter terrorism and counter insurgency operations in the North-east, a position he held since April 3, 2020.\n\nBorn on 5 January 1966 in Sifawa, Bodinga local government area of Sokoto state, Yahaya is of the Nigerian Army Infantry Corps and holds a Bachelor of Arts Degree in History and a Masters\u2019 Degree in International Affairs and Diplomacy.\n\nA member of the 37 Regular Course of the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA), the new army helmsman started his cadet training 27 September 1985 and was commissioned into the Nigerian Army Infantry Corps on 22 September 1990.\n\nHe has held several appointments, including Staff, Instructional and Command.\n\nExpectations\n\nSpeaking on expectations from the new Army Chief, a security analyst, Mr Yahaya Idris told Blueprint that Yahaya would do well as COAS because he worked with two former Chiefs of Army Staff.\n\n\u201cThough he was appointed by General Tukur Buratai as Theatre Commander Operation Lafiya Dole, he was retained by late Lt-Gen. Attahiru because of his track record. He is one of the key military officers that executed the former Chief of Army Staff\u2019s strategy against Boko-Haram. With him, the campaign against insurgency in the North-east was reorganised and renamed Operation Hadin Kai.\n\n\u201cSince his appointment as Commander of Operation Lafiya now Operation Hadin Kai, he has taken the battle to the insurgents. He is highly experienced for the job. We hope to see measurable progress in the war against insurgents and bandits.\u201d\n\nCSOs in mixed reaction\n\nAlso, Executive Director Peering Advocacy and Advancement Centre in Africa (PAACA) Ezenwa Nwangwu said the job of the new COAS was already well cut out.\n\nNwangwu said, \u201cHe must bring to bear his experience as senior operative in the North East to inspire confidence in the citizens in the ability of the military to confront the myriad of security challenges confronting us.\n\n\u201cWe are looking forward to a new vista of serious and professional army that is well motivated, disciplined and nationalistic.\n\n\u201cHe must justify the huge trust reposed on him by the president by maintaining principled, respectful engagement and coordination with other services and other stakeholders.\u201d\n\nBut the Convener Take Back Nigeria Movement; Co-convener Say No Campaign, Jaye Gaskia said \u201cThis appointment, however meritorious, compounds the existing crisis of confidence and trust between the various peoples of the country.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is not only another manifestation of the nepotism and parochialism, some will say provincialism of this President and Commander-in-Chief, it is also very insensitive.\n\n\u201cWhatever the reasons for this particular appointment may have been, it represents at the very least, a missed opportunity to correct the perception among the general citizenry about the nepotism of the President; as well as a missed opportunity to actually address the perception of systemic exclusion by South Easterners.\n\n\u201cYes it is true; such an important and strategic appointment should be made on merit. It is equally true, however, that of the 30 or so Major Generals in the Army, there are equally competent and meritorious officers from all parts of the country among this club of generals.\n\n\u201cSo, it begs the question; why continue to make such appointments from just a section of the country? Why continue to create the enabling environment for separatist agitators to mobilise grievance?\n\n\u201cWhy continue to give forces that are tearing us apart, fuel fires of disintegration?\u201d\n\nEl-Rufai, Matawalle\n\nCongratulating the new COAS, Kaduna state Governor Nasir El-Rufai described him as hard working and foresighted.\n\nA statement issued Thursday by the state Commissioner for Internal Affairs and Home Security, Mr Samuel Aruwan said the government and people of Kaduna state, having worked successfully with the new COAS when he was the GOC 1 Division Nigerian Army, Kaduna, looked forward to working with him again to address the spate of insecurity in the state.\n\n\u201cThe Governor of Kaduna state, Malam Nasir el-Rufai has congratulated the newly appointed Chief of Army Staff, Major General Yahaya Farouk.\n\n\u201cMalam el-Rufai said that he wishes newly appointed COAS every success in taking the Nigerian Army to greater heights, building on the efforts of his predecessors, including Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru of blessed memory.\n\n\u201cThe Government of Kaduna state is elated with the appointment of Major General Faruk having worked closely with him when he meritoriously served as General Officer Commanding, 1 Division Nigerian Army, Kaduna covering Kaduna, Niger, Kano and Jigawa States.\n\n\u201cHe exhibited hard work and foresight in helping to manage the security challenges of the state when he served as GOC.\n\n\u201cGovernor El-Rufai has, on behalf of the people and government of Kaduna state, congratulated the new Chief of Army Staff and wished him success and God\u2019s guidance in this onerous task.\n\n\u201cThe Kaduna state government is looking forward to working with the newly appointed COAS to advance peace and security in Kaduna state,\u201d he said.\n\nSimilarly, Zamfara state Governor Bello Mohammed Matawalle congratulated the new army chief on his appointment, and charged him to justify his choice for the top job.\n\nIn a statement Thursday by Director General on media to the Governor Yusuf Idris, the governor said: \u201cOn behalf of his humble self, the government and good people of Zamfara state, wishes to congratulate the new Chief of Army Staff over his new assigned responsibility as the Head of the Nigerian Army.\u201d\n\nMatawalle described the appointment of the COAS as well deserved and designed by the Almighty.\n\nGovernor Matawalle further said: \u201cThe new COAS is very conversant with the security challenges caused by armed bandits and the governor\u2019s humble efforts in addressing the menace through dialogue with those ready to accept peace and kinetic measures by the military against the recalcitrant one, and will join hands with the state government in tackling criminality in Zamfara\u201d.\n\nAPC sets agenda\n\nSimilarly, the All Progressives Congress (APC) welcomed the Yahaya\u2019s choice as new army helmsman.\n\nA statement signed Thursday in Abuja by the party\u2019s National Secretary of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, expressed satisfaction that the Buhari-led administration has prioritised the provision of more and advanced equipment for the armed forces.\n\nThe party said: \u201cOn behalf of the National Chairman of the Party\u2019s Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), H.E. Governor Mai Mala Buni, we urge the new Chief of Army Staff to consolidate on the successes recorded by the military in tackling all security threats in the country.\n\n\u201cThis could be achieved and deepened sustainably through increased collaboration among the security services and communities. More vigilance and increased cooperation and support through sharing information can pave way for faster mopping up the remnants of the insurgents and ending banditry and kidnapping in parts of the country.\n\n\u201cThe APC notes with satisfaction that the President Buhari-led administration has prioritised the provision of more and advanced equipment for the armed forces which has enhanced their operational capability against elements posing threats to the country\u2019s internal security.\n\n\u201cA battlefield commander with considerable experience, Major-General Farouk Yahaya will as Chief of Army Staff, lead a thoroughly professional, adequately equipped and highly motivated officers and troops in their duty of protecting the territorial integrity of our country.\n\n\u201cWe are confident that the new Chief of Army Staff will repose the President\u2019s confidence in him by doing everything to stem the tide of insecurity. The success of the military is our collective success as a party and nation.\n\n\u201cThe APC as an institution congratulates the new Chief of Army Staff and wish him success in his new, important and strategic national assignment.\u201d\n\nTake battle to enemy\u2019s gate \u2013 Fani-Kayode\n\nAlso, fiery politician, Femi Fani-Kayode has charged the new Chief of Army Staff, Major General Farouk Yahaya to crush those behind insecurity in the country.\n\nFani-Kayode urged Yahaya to take the battle to the enemy as he assumes his new role.\n\nIn a tweet, Fani-Kayode wrote: \u201cCongratulations to Major General Yahaya on his appointment as Nigeria\u2019s new Chief of Army Staff.\n\n\u201cNow is the time to take the battle to the gates of the enemy and utterly crush them.

Quite a large number of Nigerian children have fallen victims of illicit commercial activities which include human trafficking, sexual exploitation domestic servitude, and street begging.\n\n\u201cThe safety of our children from kidnappers, abusive parents and guardians as well as the sale of our children for exploitative purposes further re-enforces the need to strengthen the resolve to accelerate action on policies and programs including a legal framework that will help in enhancing the protection of our children from these evil elements and criminal minds.\n\n\u201cThis framework includes the need for the passage and full implementation of the Child\u2019s Right Acts, and the Violence Against Persons (Prohibition) Act in all States that have neither passed nor implemented these laws as these laws have been designed to provide a safe-net for our children.\n\n\u201cThere is a great need to begin instilling in our children the core values of honesty, hard work, selfless service, moral rectitude, patriotism, respect for elders, accountability, discipline and self-confidence. We as leaders must set a good example for the children.\n\n\u201cI am convinced that if our children grow with these core values instilled in them, the hope of having a truly great Nation in the near future will be rekindled.\n\n\u201cTo parents, teachers, guardians and religious leaders, I implore you all on this day to take into cognisance the need to protect our children and wards from unscrupulous elements that see our children as mere commodities and toys to be toiled with and exploited.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore imperative that parents work closely with NAPTIP and other law Enforcement Agencies in ensuring that perpetrators of evil acts towards our children are reported in order to ensure that such perpetrators are brought to book.\n\n\u201cNAPTIP on its part shall continue to work assiduously towards the protection of our children,\u201d she said.",

This has only increased during the pandemic.\n\n\u201cToday of all days, we must commit to reinforce the protection mechanisms for all children.\n\n\u201cBut we have learned from this pandemic too. One thing we have learned is that education takes place not only in schools \u2013 children can and should learn both in and out of school. A learning continuum is critical, so that all children continue to get an education irrespective of their situation, location, or the pandemic.\n\n\u201cNigerian children are resilient, talented and aspire to do great things. And it is our responsibility to give them the platform and encouragement to do just that.\n\n\u201cWe know that protecting children and investing in women and families is not only the right thing to do it has proven to be a sound economic choice and a cost-effective tool for national development.\n\n\u201cAs we celebrate our children today, we must act in their best interests and deploy innovative solutions to fast-track learning and health services to build back better, for every Nigerian child.\u201d",

          "title": "Macron Recognises French \u2018Responsibility\u2019 in Rwanda Genocide",
          "text": "French President Emmanuel Macron, in a visit to Rwanda, has said France recognised its \u201cresponsibility\u201d in the 1994 Rwandan genocide, asking for forgiveness for his country\u2019s role but without offering an official apology.\n\nHis comments on Thursday came during a solemn speech at the Kigali Genocide Memorial, where 250,000 victims of the mass killings are buried.\n\nSome 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed by Hutu militias in 100 days of bloodletting that began in April 1994. The genocide ended in July 1994 when the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), led by current President Kagame, swept in from Uganda and seized control of the country.\n\nMacron said France did not listen to those who warned it about the impending massacre in Rwanda and stood de facto by a \u201cgenocidal regime\u201d.\n\n\u201cStanding here today, with humility and respect, by your side, I have come to recognise our responsibilities,\u201d he said, adding, however, that France \u201cwas not an accomplice\u201d to the genocide.\n\nMacron said France had a duty to admit the \u201csuffering it inflicted on the Rwandan people by too long valuing silence over the examination of the truth\u201d.\n\nHe added that only those who had survived the horrors \u201ccan maybe forgive; give us the gift of forgiveness\u201d.\n\nFor his part, Kagame hailed Macron\u2019s speech.\n\n\u201cHis words were something more valuable than an apology. They were the truth,\u201d he told a joint press conference after the two leaders met in Kigali.\n\nWhile Macron\u2019s comments went further than his predecessors, many in Rwanda were hoping for a full apology.\n\nIbuka, the country\u2019s main genocide survivor group, said it was disappointed did not \u201cpresent a clear apology\u201d. Egide Nkuranga, president of the association, said Macron did not \u201cask forgiveness\u201d, but he \u201creally tried to explain the genocide, how it happened, what they didn\u2019t do, their responsibilities \u2026 It\u2019s very important, it shows that he understands us.\u201d\n\nMacron\u2019s visit follows the release in March of a report by a French inquiry panel that said a colonial attitude had blinded French officials and the government bore a \u201cserious and overwhelming\u201d responsibility for not foreseeing the slaughter. However, the report absolved France of direct complicity in the killings.\n\nKagame, who has previously said France participated in the genocide, said last week that the report \u201cmeant a lot\u201d to people in his country.\n\nRwandans could \u201cmaybe not forget, but forgive\u201d, France for its role, said Kagame, a Tutsi and the main power in Rwandan politics since his rebel army ended the killings by death squads loyal to the Hutu-led government.\n\nMacron agreed in April to open the Rwanda archives of former President Francois Mitterrand, who was in charge during the genocide. Shortly afterwards, Rwanda released its own report that found France was aware a genocide was being prepared and bore responsibility for enabling it, continuing in its unwavering support for Rwanda\u2019s then-President, Juvenal Habyarimana.\n\nIt was the shooting down of Habyarimana\u2019s plane, killing the president, that unleashed the frenzy of killings.\n\n\u201cFrench officials armed, advised, trained, equipped, and protected the Rwandan government,\u201d the report said. France then proceeded to cover up its role for years, it added.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Malcolm Webb, reporting from Kigali, said Macron was \u201cbetween a rock and a hard place, to some extent\u201d.\n\n\u201cHe has to think about France\u2019s interests in Africa generally and here in Rwanda there\u2019s definitely a requirement to win the allegiance of Paul Kagame and the government to make the French narrative now match the narrative of RPF,\u201d added Webb, noting that narratives around the genocide and the events of the 1990s are still controversial and contested.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, Macron has an election coming up in France and he has to stave off critique from the far right,\u201d Webb said. \u201cIf he\u2019d apologised here, that very likely would have been attacked by the far right and would not have been appreciated by powerful people in the military.\u201d\n\nFrom Rwanda, Macron will travel to South Africa, where he will meet President Cyril Ramaphosa to discuss COVID-19 and regional crises.",

          "text": "US President Joe Biden\u2019s $715 billion Department of Defense budget will shift funding from old systems to help modernize the nuclear arsenal to deter China, while also developing future warfare capabilities, people familiar with the budget said.\n\nThe defense spending request, which will be sent to Congress on Friday, is expected to contain investments in troop readyness, space, the Pacific Deterrence Initiative aimed at countering China\u2019s military build-up in the region and nuclear weapons technology, the people said.\n\nThe budget request would buy ships, jets and pay for maintenance and salaries, but an additional $38 billion is earmarked for defense-related programs at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Energy and other agencies bringing the national security budget to $753 billion, a 1.7% increase over the 2021 figure.\n\nThere will also be money to further develop and test of hypersonic weapons and other \u201cnext generation\u201d weapons systems as the military aims to build capabilities to counter Russia and China.\n\nPresident\u2019s budget requests, including those for the military, are commonly a starting point for negotiations with Congress which ultimately decides how funds are spent.\n\nThe Pacific Deterrence Initiative, created to counter China, focuses on competition in the Indo-Pacific and aims to boost U.S. preparedness in the region through funding radars, satellites and missile systems.\n\nTo pay for this, people familiar with the shift said, the Pentagon is seeking to divest some of its older equipment with higher maintenance costs including four Littoral Combat Ships, several A-10 aircraft which provide close air support to ground troops, as well as the number of KC-10 and KC-135 planes in the mid-air refueling fleets.\n\nTensions with an increasingly assertive China are on the minds of U.S. military planners. Bejing accused the United States last week of threatening the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait after a U.S. warship again sailed through the sensitive waterway.\n\nThe U.S. Army\u2019s goal for troops in the budget was reduced very marginally, the people said.\n\n\u201cWe must modernize if deterrence is to endure and, if confirmed, I would seek to increase the speed and scale of innovation in our force,\u201d Kathleen Hicks said in her testimony in February before she was confirmed as deputy secretary of defense.\n\nAmong the Pentagon\u2019s competing priorities, the Biden administration will request 85 stealthy F-35 fighter jets made by Lockheed Martin, the people said. The 2021 and 2020 presidential budgets requested 79 and 78 of the jets respectively, ultimately Congress authorized additional fighters.

          "text": "The Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, declared that N35 trillion (about $85bn) investment in infrastructure is required for the economy to post a double-digit growth.\n\nBut, he declared that given the paucity of government revenues, it will be difficult to support such investments using government funds alone.\n\nThe Nigerian economy recorded a 0.51 per cent growth in the first quarter of 2021 after a 0.11 per cent growth in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nIn a goodwill message he delivered at a\n\nwebinar on \u201cFinancing Public-Private Partnership to Boost Infrastructure Delivery in Nigeria,\u201d organised by the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) in Abuja, Thursday Emefiele noted that\n\nthe theme of the webinar was topical as a critical part of efforts to drive sustainable growth of the Nigerian economy.\n\nThe CBN Governor whose message was delivered by the Deputy Governor of the bank on Economic Policy, Dr. Kingsley Obiora, said the COVID-19 pandemic had exerted unprecedented impact on the Nigerian economy, adding that significant interventions by the monetary and fiscal authorities had led to exit from two recessions although growth is muted.\n\nHe observed: \u201cWhile this news is positive, growth is still well below our population growth of 2.7 per cent. It is therefore imperative that we all work together to harness the growth potential of the Nigerian economy.\n\n\u201cIf we take into account Nigeria\u2019s Infrastructure Masterplan, we require close to N35 trillion worth of investment in order to attain double-digit growth. But given the paucity of government revenue, which the BPE Director General mentioned earlier, it will be difficult to support these investments using government funds alone.\n\n\u201cSo, finding ways to harness public-private partnerships have become very important and we are happy to acknowledge that these partnerships have started in earnest and the Central Bank of Nigeria looks forward to continuing collaboration with the BPE to harness these partnerships to ensure that we significantly scale up investment in our infrastructure.\u201d\n\nIn her keynote address, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Dr. Zainab Shamsuna Ahmed disclosed that from the 2021/2022 budget cycle, all infrastructure projects in Nigeria must be screened for Public Private Partnership (PPP) suitability and compliance with the National Integrated Infrastructure Master plan by her ministry and the BPE before inclusion in national budgets and subsequent procurement.\n\nThe Minister who is also the Vice-Chairman of the National Council on Privatisation (NCP) said \u201call these efforts are to ensure that PPP takes a center stage in the procurement of infrastructure in the Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe government, she said, is ready and willing to dialogue and incorporate valuable suggestions from stakeholders with a view to further strengthening Nigeria\u2019s PPP framework.\n\nShe noted that the webinar was an opportunity to hear directly on the concerns and areas the participants would like the government to address to make investment beneficial and deliver value for money to the country at large.\n\nWhile soliciting the support and cooperation of the public and private sectors partners, local and foreign partners, financial institutions and other important key stakeholders towards the successful implementation of the government\u2019s new PPP policy directive, she said the present administration was committed to the development of the country\u2019s infrastructure through PPP arrangements.\n\nIn his remarks, the BPE Director General, Mr. Alex Okoh said in line with its new role in the administration of concession programmes of the Federal Government of Nigeria, the Bureau in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget & National Planning, has developed a PPP project information tool which has been forwarded to all the ministries, departments and agpencies (MDAs) to capture all current and proposed infrastructure projects in the country.\n\n\u201cThis will help document a pipeline of PPP projects across various sectors of the economy\u201d and that a number of the MDAs have already submitted their PPP Project Information Data and that the final date for submission is May 31, 2021,\u201d Okoh disclosed.\n\nAccording to him, the Bureau would partner with the United Kingdom Nigeria Infrastructure Advisory Facility (UKNIAF) to screen projects to ensure that only those that are financially as well as economically viable are included in the \u2018National Pipeline of PPP Projects\u2019.\n\nHe stated that the BPE also intends to establish a revolving Project Development Fund (PDF) for PPP transactions, adding that funds realised from the pool would be used to facilitate the proper structuring of PPP transactions.\n\nExpressing the hope that financial institutions would support the initiative to increase the number of viable projects that could be successfully brought to commercial and financial close in the infrastructure space through PPPs, Okoh observed that considering the huge gap in infrastructure stock in the country and the quantum of funding required to bridge the gap, the role of private sector financing through PPPs has assumed a very significant importance, hence the need to host the webinar.\n\nNdubuisi Francis in Abuja",
