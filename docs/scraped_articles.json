          "title": "Asaba Declaration: Southern Govs have no apologies on open grazing, restructuring \u2014 Okowa",
          "text": "*Says impossible for federal police to secure the country\n\nDelta State governor, Sen. Ifeanyi Arthur Okowa, has berated critics of southern governors on the ban of open grazing of cattle and the call for national dialogue to restructure Nigeria.\n\nThese were part of the decisions taken when he hosted his 16 colleagues on 11 May, 2021 in Asaba where they also called for state police and devolution of powers from the Federal Government to the States.\n\n\u201cWe owe no apologies, because we spoke the truth and we thought that the truth we spoke was in the best interest of this nation.\n\nOkowa expressed surprise that some elements in the Presidency are still advocating for the retention of open grazing of cattle.\n\n\u201cCan we truly at this moment be promoting open grazing? Thank God that the President was misrepresented, because I have seen news headlines that the President is not opposed to the ban on open grazing.\n\nWe need to begin to look into what is best for us. Where we were 50 years ago should not be where we should be today and tomorrow.\u201d\n\nHe acknowledged that it might not be a one-day affair. He said: \u201cIt may not be but the process has to start and there must be a programme that must become evident, a programme in which we will begin to see actions being taken.\u201d\n\nHe warned that Nigeria\u2019s growing food insecurity may soon spiral to a tipping point on account of the threat posed by open grazing of cattle.\n\n\u201cToday, a lot of money is being spent by the Central Bank of Nigeria to encourage farmers to ensure that we are food sufficient but a lot of these efforts are lost, because of insecurity.\n\nFarmers can\u2019t go to farm, their crops are destroyed, they are maimed and raped and some are even killed. We cannot continue like this, because if you have a programme you are spending billions on, we must secure it and we must ensure the food security of this country.\u201d\n\nOkowa called for wholesale adoption of ranching given that, apart from safety issues, it is more beneficial for both cattle owners and herders.\n\n\u201cRanching obviously is the only way out as is happening in other climes and it\u2019s not impossible in this place. In some parts of Taraba State, ranching has been on for so many years and we can actually create those ranches where the cattle will have more meat, more milk and then the children can actually afford to go to school\u201d, he said.\n\n\u201cWe may not go into the big ranches but we can start in some form by acquiring some lands for that purpose and it may not be owned by individuals. Government can own the ranches where individuals can come and populate and pay some form of token\u201d, the governor stated.\n\nThe voices for restructuring have been very strong out there. Why will somebody even criticise on restructuring? The only thing you need to know is that restructuring is of various facets, you only have to bring forth your arguments\u201d, Okowa said as he spoke with selected journalists in Asaba.\n\nHis stand came against the backdrop of the criticisms of the Asaba Declaration by Abubakar Malami, Federal Attorney and Minister of Justice including Mallam Garba Shehu, presidential spokesman.\n\n\u201cI actually thought that the voices who tend to criticise the meeting failed to have an understanding. People should learn to approach things after a very deep thought rather than just looking at the surface picking one thing and speaking about it.\n\n\u201cWe actually came in as state governors to reaffirm our belief in the Nigerian state and secondly we do also realise that there are things going on very wrongly and there was a need to address them\u201d, the governor said.\n\nHe had earlier called for the writing of a new constitution, not an amendment, to accommodate emerging issues of good governance and greater interest of Nigerians when he received on a courtesy visit, the Senate sub-committee on review of the 1999 Constitution led by Senator James Manager in Asaba.\n\nHe told the committee that a new Constitution for the country had become imperative in view of observed inadequacies in the 1999 Constitution and called for the insertion of a clause to allow for the re-writing of the present Constitution while it would continue to be in operation until a new one was ready.\n\n\u201cI believe that the southern governors\u2019 meeting was in the best interest of this nation and not just the southern part of the country, because the voices of our people have continued to ring loud and ours was just to reflect their voice.\n\n\u201cWe first proclaimed as a people and as governors who run the various States in Southern Nigeria that we believe in the Federation and unity of this country, because there has been a lot of voices on secession here and there\u201d, Okowa stated.\n\n\u201cThere is nobody that has not talked about restructuring. Even the APC government constituted a restructuring committee headed by Nasir el-Rufai and they agreed that restructuring was inevitable. It has to be done. That is why we asked for the national dialogue so that we can sit down and look at the issues and agree together as a nation, as peoples of same nation on what and what will be needed and I think it is very important.\n\n\u201cIt is important and it will help to enhance the peace and recreate hope amongst our people that truly we are in a federation that is united in the best interest of the federating units. I don\u2019t see why people will need to criticise that\u201d\n\nOn state police, Okowa said the way the federal police is structured \u201cis such that they won\u2019t be able to police this nation, its impossible. We are not saying that they are incompetent.\n\n\u201cBut when the police hierarchy is already calling for vigilantes, they are calling for state police. So the state police can be organized in such a manner that it assists the federal police, because the level of insecurity in this country now is too high and we need to do something about it.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By James Ogunnaike\n\nFormer President Olusegun Obasanjo on Thursday, once again blamed series of challenges currently confronting Nigeria on bad leadership, and thereby called on all Nigerians to join hands together towards taking the country to where God has created it to be.\n\nObasanjo, who lamented that Nigeria is currently dripping bitterness and sadness, which he said has prevented it from achieving what God destined it for, admonished all Nigerians to rally together and speak in a civilized language towards changing the narratives.\n\nThe former president said this in his remarks at the unveiling of a book titled: \u201cThe Man, The General and The President\u201d, authored by Femmy Carrena at the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library (OOPL) in Abeokuta, Ogun State capital.\n\nThe former President said, \u201cGod has created Nigeria to be a land flowing with milk and honey, but due to leadership failure, the country is wallowing of crises and problems\u201d.\n\nHe said, that Nigeria has been destined to lead the black race, but \u201cfailure of leadership\u201d has impeded it from taking its place in the comity of developed nations.\n\nHe said, \u201cMy prayer is that all of us particularly in this country and now is that we will have something to contribute to make this country to the making of what God has created it to be; a land flowing with milk and honey\u201d.\n\n\u201cRight now, it is a land flowing with bitterness and sadness. That is not what God wants this country to be\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe must change the narrative. We must talk to ourselves in the civilized language\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere is no where you go in this country that you will not see a genius in any section of the country\u201d.\n\n\u201cSo, for what reason should we look down on ourselves or others except we are not human beings.\u201d\n\nOff course, we will get this country to what God has created it to be, because where we are now is not what God has created Nigeria to be\u201d.\n\n\u201cEducation must be one of the main pillars of getting Nigeria to where it should be and the over 14 million Nigerian children that are now out of school, we must a find a way of getting them into school. Otherwise, we are preparing the Boko Haran of tomorrow and there is nothing that will prevent that\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t do it now, then, we lose the opportunity and the consequences in the future will be. Some of us might have gone, but those who will be around will bear the brunt of the problem\u201d.\n\n\u201cMy own belief is that God had created races in the world and at one time or the other, he has decided that every race will be led by a particular nation in the world\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs at today, the white race is being led by American; I don\u2019t know how long that will be. Yellow race is being led by the China and whatever we say or do, China will lead the world before the middle of this century and there is nothing we can do about it\u201d.\n\n\u201cI believe that God has created Nigeria to lead the black race. That we are not doing is not because God has not given us all that we need to do it. It is because we have failed in leadership to do it and that have to be corrected. That is the fault of all of us\u201d.\n\nThe former President expressed worry that, Nigerians usually perform \u201cfantastically well\u201d outside the shores of the country, but seem to be underperforming when there are in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe have great Nigerians. Why do Nigerians bloom outside Nigeria. As at today, we have five Nigerians directly running international organisations and running them very well and one or two at the number two level\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have Akin Adesina running the African Development Bank (AfDB), we have Benedict Oramah running the Afrexim Bank, we have Mohammed Barkindo running the OPEC, we have my sister, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala running the WTO and we have Amina Mohammed who I think celebrated her 60th birthday yesterday or day before yesterday, who is number two in the United Nations (UN). These are things that should give hope and encouragement for the future\u201d.\n\nThe point is that, if these people are here in Nigeria, if you hear of them at all, we would have shackled them and make it impossible for them to perform as they are performing outside\u201d.\n\n\u201cAnd each of these people that I have mentioned, they are doing fantastically well. We have even at the AU, Ambassador Bankole Adeoye who had just taken over as the Commissioner for Political Affairs & Peace and Security (PAPS) of the AU\u201d.\n\n\u201cSo why are they doing well there and here we are not doing well, something must be wrong. We should be interrogating this. We should and then what should we do. What we should do is put house in order and we can put our house in order.\n\nThe book was reviewed by Emeritus Prof. Michael Abiola Omolewa, a former Chairperson of UNESCO and the review was read at the event by Ndidi Amaka \u2013 Okafor.\n\nIt was facilitated by Dr Taiwo Olayinka Afolabi, the Vice Chairman/CEO SIFAX Group Limited and was donated to the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library (OOPL) and all federal tertiary institutions nationwide.\n\nIn his remarks, the author of the book, Femmy Carrena disclosed that the idea of the book was conceptualised 11 years ago to document the achievements of Obasanjo during his tenure as the President of Nigeria between 1999 to 2007.\n\nHe described Obasanjo as his life guiding mentor who has changed his life and that other Nigerians for good.\n\nThe book was reviewed by emeritus Prof Michael Abiola Omolewa, former Chairperson UNESCO.

This could tear some countries apart.\n\n\u201dA terrorist organisation (IPOB) poses a significant threat to the safety and security of Nigerian citizens.\n\n\u201dWhen the President said that they will be treated \u201cin a language they understand,\u201d he merely reiterated that their force shall be met with force.\n\nAccording to him, this is a basic principle of security services response world over, adding that this is not promotion of hate, but a pledge to uphold citizens\u2019 right to freedom from harm.\n\n\u201dThe government cannot be expected to capitulate to terrorists.\n\n\u201dIPOB is proscribed under Nigerian law. Its members murder innocent Nigerians. They kill policemen and set government property on fire.

We are no longer slaves under them.\n\n\u201cThe South has oil and water and other natural resources, but Fulani are the ones enjoying them. Most of our university graduates are Okada riders being what our politicians who tell lies recklessly have made us to be.\n\n\u201cYoruba is the most educated race in Nigeria, but are these graduates getting jobs, no. Rather, our politicians would be buying motorbikes for them for Okada riding. This is wrong and would have to stop. Can they allow their children to be riding Okada?\n\n\u201cToday, they have shared everything that belongs to Nigeria among themselves. The President is a Fulani man, the Inspector General of Police, Director General of the Department of State Services, the Chief of Army Staff, Chairmen of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agencies and Economic and Financial Crimes Commission and Comptrollers General of Immigration and Customs are all Fulanis.\n\n\u201cLet me say this emphatically, we won\u2019t vote in the Southwest in 2023. We need a government of our own. The Fulanis are kidnapping us and collecting ransom, killing and raping us and our leaders are watching because of politics. This will no longer be tolerated\n\n\u201cThe next line of action now is that, we are entering the bush to chase away these Fulani herders. We don\u2019t want them on our lands again. We will pursue them just like I have been saying,\u201d he stated.",

This suspension, which is a reaction of the Nigerian government to the company\u2019s enforcement of its platform rules, is aimed at insulating the government from criticism, especially by Nigeria\u2019s youth who are over 70per cent of the country\u2019s population.\n\n\u201cIt must be noted that Nigeria\u2019s President has notably been insulated from every form of public accountability. He is perhaps the only president since the country\u2019s return to democracy in 1999 who never grants live interviews or holds media chats. This move is therefore aimed at making him unaccountable to the people of Nigeria who constantly take to social media platforms to share their views on the actions and policies of the government.\n\n\u201cIt is evident that shutting down Twitter is illegal and illegitimate policies such as this are unacceptable!\n\n\u201cA 2016 United Nations resolution affirms that the rights that citizens have offline must apply online. Coincidentally, this resolution was co-sponsored by Nigeria with others. We urge the Nigerian authorities to respect and enforce citizens\u2019 fundamental rights as provided for by the Nigerian constitution and international human rights treaties that Nigeria is a party to.\n\n\u201cWe will further contact the Ministry of Information to get exact details of this announcement, and the legal framework that supports such undemocratic pronouncement.\n\n\u201cWe advise all users of Twitter and other social media platforms in Nigeria to download virtual private networks (VPNs) to enable them continue to use the platforms for their economic survival and social and political engagements while we all push back on this draconian order by the Nigerian government.\u201d",

          "title": "Twitter: Malami orders prosecution of ban violators",
          "text": "By Enyeribe Ejiogu (Lagos), Godwin Tsa, Aidoghie Paulinus and Adanna Nnamani (Abuja), Femi Folaranmi (Yenagoa) and Seye Ojo (Ibadan)\n\nAttorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), has ordered the immediate prosecution of Nigerians who attempt to circumvent the Federal Government\u2019s ban on Twitter operations in the country.\n\nIn furtherance of this, the Director of Public Prosecution of the Federation (DPPF) has been directed to commence in earnest the process of prosecuting of violators of the ban in Nigeria.\n\nA statement by the Special Assistant on Media and Public Relations to the AGF, Dr. Umar Gwandu, yesterday, said Malami directed the DPPF to liaise with the Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy, National Communication Commission (NCC) and other relevant government agencies to ensure the speedy prosecution of offenders.\n\nThe directive followed the indefinite suspension placed on Twitter\u2019s operations in the country by the government. The suspension was announced in a statement by the Ministry of Information and Culture on Friday.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government has suspended, indefinitely, the operations of the microblogging and social networking service, Twitter, in Nigeria,\u201d read the statement, which was posted on the ministry\u2019s official Twitter handle on Friday evening. It accused the American social media company of allowing its platform to be used \u201cfor activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\u201d\n\nThe suspension came two days after Twitter deleted a tweet by President Muhammadu Buhari, which the global microblogging site said was widely perceived as offensive and a contravention of Twitter\u2019s rules strengthened in the wake of former President Donald Trump\u2019s use of the platform to incite violence and attack on the United States Congress on January 6, 2021, following his loss of the November 3, 2020 presidential election.\n\nIn the tweet that prompted the action taken by Twitter to delete it, President Buhari, on Tuesday, threatened to deal with people in the country\u2019s southeast, whom he blamed for the recurring attacks on public infrastructure in the region.\n\n\u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian Civil War. Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand,\u201d Buhari wrote, referring to the brutal 30-month Nigeria-Biafra war, which killed an estimated one to three million people, mostly from the Igbo tribe between 1967-1970.\n\nBuhari\u2019s tweet was deleted on Wednesday after many Nigerians flagged it to Twitter, and the platform said it had violated its policy on abusive behaviour.\n\nResponding to the ban placed on its operations in the country, Twitter said in a statement: \u201cWe are deeply concerned by the blocking of Twitter in Nigeria. Access to the free and #OpenInternet is an essential human right in modern society. We will work to restore access for all those in Nigeria who rely on Twitter to communicate and connect with the world.\u201d\n\nAs reactions continue to trail the indefinite suspension of Twitter by the Buhari administration, Oyo State governor, \u2018Seyi Makinde, has counseled the Federal Government of Nigeria not to hamper the operations of thousands of businesses and services with its recent suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria, stressing that the government is capable of affecting investors\u2019 confidence in the country.\n\nGovernor Makinde, in a statement he signed yesterday, called for due consideration from the government on the implications of its action, saying that \u201cTwitter has become the platform for young people and indeed all Nigerians to exercise their fundamental right to express and publish an opinion.\u201d\n\nThe governor, who has a strong presence on Twitter, said it became imperative for him to make the statement as the country debates the ban.\n\nHis words: \u201cIt has become imperative for me to release a statement regarding the suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria by the Federal Government. As leaders, we should go beyond emotional reactions to issues and think about how our actions will affect the people we lead, and our international ratings, socially and economically.\n\n\u201cTwitter has become the platform for young people and indeed all Nigerians to exercise their fundamental right to express and publish an opinion. They use the platform to complain, argue and give feedback to government and its agencies, which in turn use these to improve policies. This is a fundamental point that should be kept in mind as we debate the necessity of this suspension.\n\n\u201cWe should also remember that Twitter has gone beyond a source of communication for many of our hardworking youths in Nigeria. It has become a source of livelihood for many, irrespective of their political affiliations or religious leanings. Nigerian youths and digital communications organisations earn a living from being able to use the platform to post communications on behalf of their clients.\n\n\u201cOthers who may not have physical stores also rely on Twitter to give visibility to their products and services.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, I believe the Federal Government should be actively interested in how certain policies and actions will affect investor confidence. I, therefore, use this medium to appeal to the Federal Government to reverse this suspension for the greater good of Nigerians.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of the enforcement of the ban on the micro-blogging app by telecom companies as directed by the Nigerian Communications Commission on Friday, thousands of Twitter users in Nigeria are currently gnashing their teeth while the development has continued to elicit reactions within Nigeria and overseas with many describing the move as draconian and undemocratic.\n\nCommenting on the development, firebrand lawyer and Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Mr Mike Ozhekome, condemned the ban saying that Twitter was one of the few places where Nigerians could freely express their grievances.\n\n\u201cWell, I am not surprised that the Federal Government has suspended Twitter operations in Nigeria. Are you? I have always said that this government has a very thin skin for criticism. It is a government that cannot take punches, but delights in always giving punches to adversaries, real or imaginary,\u201d the lawyer said.\n\n\u201cThe government knows that Nigerians now express their resentment and protest through Twitter, by telling the whole world how Nigeria has been turned into a corruption haven, and a sprawling field of butchery, extra-judicial executions and slaughtering. Those in government do not want the world to hear about their atrocities.\n\nFormer Vice President of Nigeria, Mr Atiku Abubakar, who tweeted few minutes after the indefinite suspension was announced on Friday expressed shock at the development, adding: \u201cHopefully, this won\u2019t be my last tweet.\u201d\n\nSimilarly the Newspaper Proprietors\u2019 Association of Nigeria (NPAN) in a statement by its President, Kabiru A. Yusuf, expressed strong reservation over the decision of the Federal Government, saying that the suspension of Twitter\u2019s operation by Nigerian is wrong and an overreaction.\n\nThe statement read in part: \u201cThe action would not win us friends as closure of public space limits public discourse and democratic advancement. It is a futile exercise in any case, as other platforms are more likely to suspect Nigeria\u2019s intentions towards democratic tenets and act in an adversarial manner towards Nigeria.\n\n\u201cTwitter is a global platform for public communication that has expanded the frontiers of free speech and press freedom. It is a platform for business that has brought relief to Nigeria\u2019s youthful population that has prospered by its operation. The NPAN believes Twitter, as a business, is not infallible and can be influenced through high-level engagement, to be a more responsive, liberal platform of public good and not a cynical champion of suspicious causes.\n\n\u201cThere should be a compromise: Nigeria needs friends and not enemies at this critical juncture of her existence. She should not play into the hands of the enemies who are relentless in seeking to destroy and ostracise her.\u201d\n\nSamuel Ola, an influencer and market said: \u201cThe fact they really did this is worrisome. Now it is Twitter. Only God knows what next if we don\u2019t stand strongly against this. I am an influencer on Twitter, and I make my money from promoting products and brands on the platform. This is like taking away my source of income because I already have a huge followership and this could affect that.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, some people have suggested a number of ways Twitter users can bypass the restriction. A Twitter user with the handle @Tundegold offered this solution: \u201cIf your Twitter account is blocked in Nigeria, go to Google Playstore and download Windscribe VPN, set your location to another country. You will be accessing your Twitter account seamlessly. We get sense pass them.\u201d\n\nThe United States Government has described the ban on Twitter operations in the country as an infringement of the rights of Nigerians to freedom of expression.\n\nIn a terse statement issued in Abuja by the United States Diplomatic Mission to Nigeria, the United States Government also said the ban was a way of sending a poor message to Nigerian citizens, investors and businesses.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s constitution provides for freedom of expression. The government\u2019s recent #Twitterban undermines Nigerians\u2019 ability to exercise this fundamental freedom and sends a poor message to its citizens, investors and businesses,\u201d the United States said.\n\nThe United States further said banning social media and curbing every citizen\u2019s ability to seek, receive, and impart information undermined fundamental freedoms.\n\n\u201cAs President Joe Biden has stated, our need for individual expression, open public conversation, and accountability has never been greater. The path to a more secure Nigeria lies in more, not less communication, alongside concerted efforts toward unity, peace, and prosperity. #KeepitOn,\u201d the United States added.\n\nMeanwhile, former Commissioner for Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) and Pension in Imo State, Prof. Vitalis Orikeze Ajumbe, has given a nod to the Federal Government for suspending the operations of Twitter in Nigeria indefinitely.\n\nIn a statement made available to Sunday Sun in Abuja, the chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and also ex-Commissioner for Information, Tourism and Public Utilities, said the ban became necessary as a result of the indiscriminate application of Twitter by those who posed threat to Nigeria\u2019s unity and corporate existence.\n\nThe South East Coordinator for Yarima Support Organization (YSO) said: \u201cThe Federal Government should be commended and not vilified for taking a wise decision by suspending the operations of Twitter in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is regrettable that Twitter availed its platform to those who spewed messages of hate, which was capable of disintegrating the country. No government will watch and allow those who fan the embers of discord continue to use their platforms that aid the dissemination of hate and divisive messages.\u201d\n\nThe National Association of Seadogs (Pyrates Confraternity), however, slammed the Federal Government over its suspension of the operations of the microblogging platform, Twitter.\n\nNAS in a statement by the NAS Capoon, Mr Abiola Owoaje, said it was appalled by the action and condemned it in its entirety, stressing: \u201cThe latest development sadly buttresses the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government\u2018s trademark predilection for suppressing free speech, stifling the Nigerian civic space and trampling on the fundamental rights of Nigerians.\u201d\n\nOwoaje, who dismissed the reasons given for the suspension, pointed out that the Nigerian government should have taken up any issue it has with Twitter directly rather than \u201cdrag the whole country into this personal vendetta like human shields.\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, the International Press Institute (IPI) expressed concern over the suspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria by the government.\n\nIPI (Nigeria), in a statement jointly issued by the Chairman, Kabiru Yusuf and Secretary, Raheem Adedoyin, said: \u201cThe action is detrimental to the free press in Nigeria which uses Twitter as a major platform. IPI notes the concern of the government on the use of Twitter and other social media platforms to promote hate speech and disinformation. We urge Twitter and other social media outfits to pay greater attention to the content they promote on their platforms, which violate their own rules.\n\n\u201cIPI implores the government to reverse the suspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria and engage in meaningful dialogue with the social media outfit on issues of concern to the government.\u201d",
          "summary": "In furtherance of this, the Director of Public Prosecution of the Federation (DPPF) has been directed to commence in earnest the process of prosecuting of violators of the ban in Nigeria.\nResponding to the ban placed on its operations in the country, Twitter said in a statement: \u201cWe are deeply concerned by the blocking of Twitter in Nigeria.\n\u201cWell, I am not surprised that the Federal Government has suspended Twitter operations in Nigeria.\n\u201cTwitter is a global platform for public communication that has expanded the frontiers of free speech and press freedom.\nWe get sense pass them.\u201dThe United States Government has described the ban on Twitter operations in the country as an infringement of the rights of Nigerians to freedom of expression.",

In expressing its anger, the federal government, however, ought to exercise restraints to avoid giving the impression that it is intolerant of opposing views and expression of opinion by individual and corporate citizens\u2019\u2019, the Guild stated.\n\nStressing its concern over the growing insecurity in the country, the Guild advised social media leaders, which provide micro-messaging services, to also beam their searchlight on the activities of those who want to use their platforms to cause divisions and spread hatred in the country and the global community as well.\n\nNoting the socio-political and economic benefits of social media platforms, the NGE explained that strong democracies rely on both civic and political participation by citizens, saying that Twitter, has over the years, aided citizens\u2019 participation in the nation\u2019s democratic process.\n\n\u2018\u2019The Guild is aware of the democratizing influence of social media platforms, including Twitter, in helping to check dictatorship and promote democracy worldwide.\n\n\u2018\u2019Twitter also builds a market research prospect for businesses to see what customers are chit-chatting about, their feeling and what is important to them about products and services\u2019\u2019, the Guild said,\n\nThe Guild therefore called on the federal government to immediately rescind its decision in order not to deny millions of Nigerians who rely on Twitter to provide services and earn a living.",

          "text": "From Adanna Nnamani, Abuja\n\nThousands of Twitter users in Nigeria are currently gnashing their teeth following the total enforcement of the ban of the micro-blogging app by telecom companies as directed by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) on Friday.\n\nThe Minister of Information, Mr Lai Mohammed, had on Friday announced the federal government\u2019s plans to indefinitely suspend Twitter after it deleted two tweets of President Muhammadu Buhari for violating its Community Standards.\n\nBarely a few hours after the Minister announced the planned suspension, it immediately backed it with a directive to the NCC, who in turn ordered that telcos comply immediately.\n\nThe development has continued to elicit reactions across Nigeria and abroad, with many describing the move as draconian and undemocratic.\n\nAnalysts who weighed in on the matter said there was no justification for the ban, especially since it has become a source of livelihood for thousands of Nigerians and a reliable news dissemination platform.\n\nCommenting on the development, a seasoned lawyer and Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Mr Mike Ozhekome, condemned the ban, saying that Twitter was one of the few places where Nigerians could freely express their grievances.\n\n\u2018Well, I am not surprised that the Federal Government has suspended Twitter operations in Nigeria. Are you? I have always said that this Government has a very thin skin for criticism. It is a government that cannot take punches, but delights in always giving punches to adversaries, real or imaginary,\u2019 the lawyer said.\n\n\u2018The government knows that Nigerians now express their resentment and protest through Twitter, by telling the whole world how Nigeria has been turned into a corruption haven, and a sprawling field of butchery, extra-judicial executions and slaughtering.\n\n\u2018Those in government do not want the world to hear about their atrocities. So, they just gleefully tell the world that they have suspended Twitter and that they would soon license other OTT and social media operations.\u2019\n\nOyo State Governor Seyi Makinde urged the federal government to reverse the ban, saying the microblogging and social networking platform has become a source of livelihood for many Nigerians.\n\nFormer Vice President of Nigeria Atiku Abubakar, who tweeted a few minutes after the suspension was announced on Friday, expressed shock at the development, adding: \u2018Hopefully, this won\u2019t be my last tweet.\u2019\n\nMany young Nigerians use Twitter to market their products, advertise their skills and source information. More so, Ministries, Departments and Agencies have lately deepened the use of Twitter to disseminate information, having found it effective and cost-saving.\n\nMany subscribers who commented on the government\u2019s decision condemned the Presidency for being too high-handed, comparing President Buhari to former US President Trump who was banned from all social media platforms and yet did not indefinitely suspend the big tech companies.\n\nSamuel Ola said: \u2018The fact they really did this is worrisome. Now it is Twitter. Only God knows what next if we don\u2019t stand strongly against this. I am an influencer on Twitter and I make my money from promoting products and brands on the platform. This is like taking away my source of income because I already have a huge following and this could affect that.\u2019\n\nSome have, however, suggested a number of ways Twitter users can bypass the restriction.\n\n\u2018If your Twitter account is blocked in Nigeria, go to Google Playstore and download \u201cWindscribe VPN\u201d. Set your location to another country. You will be accessing your Twitter account seamlessly. We get sense pass them,\u2019 said user @Tundegold.\n\nTwitter in its latest update has promised to restore access to the microblogging app for Nigerians.\n\n\u2018We are deeply concerned by the blocking of Twitter in Nigeria. Access to the free #openinInternet is an essential human right in modern society. We will work to restore access for all those in Nigeria who rely on Twitter to communicate and connect with the world,\u2019 it said.",

Yusuf.\n\nThe statement warned that the action by the federal government after Twitter deleted a tweet by President Muhammadu Buhari to separatist agitators, would not win Nigeria friends. It noted that the closure of public space would constitute a limit to public discourse and democratic advancement.\n\nNPAN described the ban as a futile exercise, saying other platforms were more likely to suspect Nigeria\u2019s intentions towards democratic tenets and act adversarially towards the country.\n\n\u201cTwitter is a global platform for public communication that has expanded the frontiers of Free Speech and Press Freedom. It is a platform for business that has brought relief to Nigeria\u2019s youthful population who have prospered by its operation. The NPAN believes Twitter as a business is not infallible and can be influenced through high level engagement, to be a more responsive, liberal platform of public good and not a cynical champion of suspicious causes.\n\n\u201cThere should be a compromise: Nigeria needs friends and not enemies at this critical juncture of her existence. She should not play into the hands of the enemies who are relentless in seeking to destroy and ostracise her. Banning Twitter is regressive and should be rescinded in favour of dialogue.\u201d NPAN warned.\n\nThe newspaper proprietors noted that it was the threat of maximum state reprisal by President Buhari that Twitter found objectionable, in line with its corporate policy, leading to sanction on the President through deletion of his tweet.\n\nIt noted that it was not the first time Twitter would sanction world leaders for infractions against its stated policy as it did so to former US President Donald Trump, to global acclaim when the latter used the social media to spread hate and instigate insurrection by a mob which stormed the Capitol.\n\nAlthough it faulted the federal government, the association also challenged Twitter to correct itself as its sincerity was questionable to the extent that it may have been hasty in sanctioning President Buhari while showing an uneven application of its rules against the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) separatist leader, Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nAccording to NPAN, while Nigeria has retaliated with the cudgel against Twitter for alleged double standard in a hasty sanctioning of the President, the micro bloggers appeared to be pampering an unrestrained Kanu for using the same Twitter platform not just for serial hate speeches but for actually provoking and justifying violence in his separatist agitations.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "A Nigerian government that is overseeing the headquarters of global poverty, sky-high unemployment, rampant extrajudicial killings and an unabating insurgency has decided that its worst problem is its citizens\u2019 use of Twitter, and all media enabled by the internet.\n\nThat government, headed by a former military dictator, has rewinded Nigeria to the dark days of press crackdowns and a reign of fear that the world thought the country had moved on from.\n\nIn 1984, Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s military government proclaimed Decree 4 to shutter newspapers, radio and television stations. It was a response to open criticism of government officials. It applied retroactively to journalists and citizens, punishable by jail time.\n\nUnder the same retired major general\u2019s supposedly democratic reawakening a generation later, the biggest independent platform for citizens to bond over grievances, where they come together to pool medical, legal and educational aid, has come under his hammer.\n\nAn infamous ban\n\nAs of the morning of Saturday June 5, most people living in Nigeria could no longer access Twitter.\n\nTelecommunications providers like MTN, Airtel and 9Mobile have cut off access to the social media app and website. Some users say they still have access from some internet service providers, but VPNs have become the primary medium to stay on Twitter for most people.\n\nThe Association of Licensed Telecommunications Operators of Nigeria (ALTON), a trade body for telcos in Nigeria, confirmed that they have implemented the Twitter ban:\n\n\u201cWe wish to confirm that our members have received formal instructions from the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), the industry regulator, to suspend access to Twitter.\u201d\n\n\u201cBased on the national interest provision in the Nigerian Communications Act, 2003, and within the license terms under which the industry operates; our members have acted in compliance with the directives of the Nigerian Communications Commission\u2026\u201d\n\nThe rest of ALTON\u2019s statement tries to have it both ways: \u201c\u2026we endorse the position of the United Nations that the rights held by people offline must also be protected online. This includes respecting and protecting the rights of all people to communicate, to share information freely and responsibly\u2026\u201d\n\nWhat does that matter? Actions speak louder than endorsements.\n\nALTON confirms telcos have shut down Twitter in Nigeria\n\nBut of course the whole responsibility for Nigeria\u2019s Twitter darkness lies at the top.\n\nBuhari was disciplined on Twitter because his tweet breached sensible rules on threatening violence. In a response that smacks of a thin skin, he has summoned his ostensibly constitutional command of violence.\n\nHis ruse of protecting Nigeria from \u201cactivities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence\u201d rings hollow to everyone who has followed his government\u2019s faltering attempts at keeping Nigerians safe for six years.\n\nBut he did it because, in two elections, Nigerians decided he should. And if he can do this, what more is on the table?\n\nPrepare for the worst\n\nAnother look at yesterday\u2019s announcement should raise an ominous feeling.\n\n\u201cThe Minister said the Federal Government has also directed the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to immediately commence the process of licensing all OTT and social media operations in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn effect, suspending Twitter is just the beginning, a taste of a very unpleasant menu that could be served soon.\n\nOver-the-top platforms include instant messaging apps like WhatsApp, Telegram, Netflix, Shomax and other streaming platforms. Basically, any media and communication service that uses data provided by internet service providers.\n\nBecause they are available over the internet, OTT platforms do not need cable or satellite infrastructure to be available to end users. The Nigerian Broadcasting Commission oversees TV and radio because TV and radio stations rely on national infrastructure and as such need licenses from regulators.\n\nNow, Nigeria wants to license OTTs indirectly through the ISPs that enable them.\n\nIt is not yet clear how this will be done. Messaging apps like WhatsApp and Telegram are end-to-end encrypted. Will the government demand access to users\u2019 chats as part of licensing agreements?\n\nDon\u2019t say it is beyond the scope of imagination. By suspending Twitter, Nigeria has stepped into the internet control realm currently championed by China, Iran and India, a fellow country under democracy. Under this protocol, all is fair in love and war against government criticism.\n\nWill Nigeria step up censorship of Netflix by demanding more local content (like South Africa wants to do), or query Showmax for the behaviour of contestants when Big Brother Nigeria returns in a few months?\n\nAgain, nothing is off the table. If anything is off the table with this Twitter ban, it is the alternative means of livelihood with which many Nigerians put food on their tables.\n\nDown with the informal economy\n\n\u201cSocial media has been at the forefront of income generation for digital marketers,\u201d Wale Adetona, an influencer with 176,000 Twitter followers tells TechCabal.\n\nHe believes the Twitter ban will have a \u201cconsequential effect on brand communication.\u201d\n\nGenerally, we can expect brands to be fine. They will find other ways to reach audiences. But thousands of informal economy workers \u2013 food vendors, event planners, etc \u2013 who rely on finding customers on their timeline will feel the brunt. They can migrate to Instagram but generating viral marketing content isn\u2019t as easy as it is on Twitter.\n\nIf Abuja factored these people in the decision to ban Twitter, it was ultimately decided that the informal part of the digital economy is necessary collateral damage. It was decided that they are dispensable. Maybe they will be referred to join TraderMoni or N-power, as palliatives.\n\nFor now, everyone has been marched through the barricades without distinction. As one suppressed people, united by a history of trauma in the Giant of Africa. One nation under Buhari\u2019s democratically reformed gun.",

          "text": "Twitter has reacted to the indefinite suspension of the social media site by the Nigerian government, expressing concern.\n\nA statement by a Twitter spokesperson to TechCabal said:\n\n\u201cThe announcement made by the Nigerian Government that they have suspended Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria is deeply concerning. We\u2019re investigating and will provide updates when we know more.\u201d\n\nWhile Twitter does not have physical offices in Nigeria, the platform is freely available in the country and has up to 2 million users, according to some estimates. The government\u2019s suspension as announced by Lai Mohammed, the Minister for Information and Culture, has been interpreted as a potential directive to Internet Service Providers to cut off users\u2019 access to the social media platform\n\nAs we have reported, the suspension is a culmination of a three-day drama. It started when Twitter deleted a tweet by President Muhammadu Buhari for violating its rules.\n\nA few hours after Twitter\u2019s action, Mohammed, the Information Minister, held a press conference in which he denounced the US social media company for having a suspicious agenda in Nigeria. He accused Twitter of enabling violence during #EndSARS protests in October 2020.\n\nIn the end, he justified his suspension of Twitter on the grounds of \u201cpersistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\u201d\n\nThe suspension brings Twitter squarely into the heat of the debate about the intersection of democracy and internet freedom in Africa.\n\nWhen they announced that Ghana will be the location of their first Africa office, Twitter said it was because Ghana is \u201ca champion for democracy, a supporter of free speech, online freedom, and the Open Internet, of which Twitter is also an advocate.\u201d\n\nTwitter remains available in Nigeria at the time of publishing this \u2013 two and half hours after the announcement was posted on the Information Ministry\u2019s verified Twitter account. It remains to be seen when the suspension takes effect and what actions Twitter takes.\n\nUpdate: Twitter has now been shutdown in Nigeria.",

          "title": "5 Reasons Why You Should Consider A Loan from Page Financials",
          "text": "Personal loans are good for a variety of purposes\u2014from consolidating debt to solving a myriad of pressing issues. They are personal, which means your reasons are yours.\n\nDo you remember the first time you needed more money than you had? Borrowing money then was not as easy as it is now.\n\nYou probably would have run to family members or friends which usually meant nothing was certain, or apply for a bank loan, which was a very tedious process, hard to get \u2013 especially if you do not have an enviable collateral in choice locations, or know someone in top management position in the banks to stand as a guarantor.\n\nThe situation is completely different now. There are financial services providers like Page Financials who have changed the game entirely, they have not only disrupted the borrowing and lending ecosystem but have also shaped how even the banks respond to providing these services today.\n\nWith the intervention of Page Financials, a leading financial services provider, anybody with a verifiable and consistent income, that meets a few other criteria \u2013 like having a good credit history \u2013 can now easily get a personal loan from the comfort of their home.\n\nIf you are still thinking about whether or not to consider a personal loan, we have highlighted 5 reasons why customers usually resort to getting a personal loan.\n\nCash Emergencies\n\nIf you need money right away to cover bills, an emergency cost or something else that needs immediate attention, you can take out a personal loan. Page Financials provide online applications that allow you to complete application conveniently in minutes.\n\nYou could receive funding immediately as well, depending on your past credit history and the information you have provided. You can use a personal loan to cover emergencies like:\n\nPaying past-due home payments and utilities\n\nMedical bills\n\nFuneral expenses\n\nAn unexpected car repair or purchase\n\nWhat you can do with a personal loan is limitless, and as established earlier, it is personal to you.\n\nDebt Consolidation\n\nOne of the popular reasons to get a personal loan from Page is for debt consolidation.\n\nIf you have existing facilities with different lenders, you\u2019d agree that managing multiple loans from several lenders can prove to be challenging. Missing on payments can result in negatively impacting your credit score. Availing a personal loan in such a situation can save you from financial distress.\n\nAll you require to do is approach Page and state that you have some other loans elsewhere and would like to consolidate different payments into one debt with the help of a loan. This method offers several benefits that include enjoying an overall lower rate of interest which can help in reducing the timeframe required to pay-off your loan.\n\nRent, Home Improvement and Repairs\n\nWhether you want to renew your rent or looking to move to a more befitting neighborhood, or simply looking to upgrade your apartment and fix some repairs, a personal loan is a great way to cover the costs conveniently.\n\nThe urgencies that come with meeting these needs are usually unprecedented which is why a personal loan may be your surest way to meet up with the deadline.\n\nFailure to meet up with rent on time for example will lead to series of embarrassments from your landlord, and\u2026you don\u2019t what that. In the same vein, if you see a new apartment that you love and fail to make payment on time, the house goes to someone else that has cash at hand.\n\nThis is why speed and convenience are of essence when it comes to personal loans and part of the USPs at Page Financials, you can access a loan and get support anytime whether it\u2019s 2 am or 2 pm so you don\u2019t have to miss any opportunity again.\n\nVehicle Financing\n\nAuto loans are available if you\u2019re looking to buy or lease a car, but personal loans are also available to finance any need you may have \u2013 including a vehicle financing.\n\nAnother great reason why you should consider a personal loan rather than going for an Auto loans are secured loans and use your vehicle as collateral. If you\u2019re worried about missing payments and your car getting repossessed, a personal loan might be a better option for you.\n\nStarting/Expanding Your Business\n\nSide hustles are very popular these days, and are a great way to test the entrepreneurial waters. If you have one, or you are thinking of starting one, you are going to need some funds to run or expand it.\n\nChanneling extra funds into your side hustle can help you take it to the next level. But if you don\u2019t have the money you need now, taking out a personal loan for your side business may help.\n\nGetting an outright business loan would normally require some sort of security or collateral \u2013 which most startups don\u2019t have, which is why taking a personal loan as a salary earner \u2013 to fund your side business, would be a smart thing to do.\n\nPersonal loans may be well-suited for side hustles because they are often smaller than typical business loans and don\u2019t require a high level of collateral or profitability. All you need is a proven source of income \u2014 and that can come from your current day job.\n\nWhat To Consider When Considering A Personal Loan\n\nApplying for a Page Loan is super easy, everything happens online and you don\u2019t need to visit their office.\n\nTo begin the application, click here to visit the website as a private sector employee or click here to visit the application page for public sector employee.\n\nThe application process is in stages, at each stage, you\u2019ll supply relevant information that helps make a decision to approve your loan.\n\n(See requirements for each category below)\n\nYou can upload all the documents online while filling the form so you do not have to worry about carrying files from one office(er) to another.\n\nThe first stage you will encounter while filling the application form is the BVN and IPPIS verification phase. You will be required to provide these details to help us to verify your identity and financial standing.\n\nLoan Requirements for Private Sector Employees\n\nTo be considered eligible for a loan as a private sector employee, it is required that:\n\nYou earn a monthly salary (minimum 150k monthly) You have up to 6-months\u2019 salary account statement You live/work in Lagos or Ibadan (bankers nationwide can apply) You have a valid work ID from where you work or an evidence of employment or promotion You have a BVN that is actively connected to your working mobile number\n\nSome of the items above will be retrieved automatically when you begin the application, it usually takes customers less than 3 minutes to complete the application if they have the requirements ready.\n\nTo apply as a private sector employee click here\n\nLoan Requirements for Public Sector Employees\n\nTo be considered eligible for a loan as a Federal Government Civil Servant, it is required that:\n\nYou have your work ID You have a valid Government issued ID You have at least 3 months\u2019 payslips You will present a signed letter of authority to debit (the letter is available for download on our website)\n\nTo apply as a public sector employee, click here\n\nReasons to Avoid a Personal Loan\n\nWhile personal loans can be a saving grace in times of great need, there are some instances you should avoid borrowing money. Consider avoiding a personal loan if:\n\nYou can\u2019t afford it. Borrowing money in the short term is one thing, but remember you\u2019ll still need to pay it back. If you can\u2019t afford monthly payments for your new personal loan, consider skipping it.\n\nBorrowing money in the short term is one thing, but remember you\u2019ll still need to pay it back. If you can\u2019t afford monthly payments for your new personal loan, consider skipping it. You don\u2019t need it. If you\u2019re taking out a personal loan to cover the cost of something you don\u2019t need in the immediate future, think about putting it off until you have more cash on hand.\n\nThe Page customer service is available 24/7 to answer any questions you may have.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "title": "4 ways Nigeria\u2019s Twitter ban could affect businesses",
          "text": "On Friday, June 4, 2021, Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, announced the indefinite suspension of Twitter in the country.\n\nHe also disclosed the government\u2019s directive to the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to start licensing all over-the-top (OTT) and social media operations.\n\nThe move has understandably drawn outrage from Nigerians who see it as yet another attack on free speech by the government. However, free speech is not the only thing affected.\n\nThe Twitter ban could also affect the country\u2019s economy. Consequently, investor confidence would weaken, and there\u2019d be a negative impact on development.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA 2016 World Bank study found a correlation between increased broadband penetration and an increase in per capita GDP.\n\nIn addition, Internet or social media shutdowns cost sub-Saharan countries $237.4 million in 2020.\n\nWe examine how this ban could affect Nigeria\u2019s economy.\n\nInfluencers\n\nOver the past few years, the influencer marketing space in Nigeria has grown so much that almost anyone with dedicated followers could snag deals with organisations looking to extend their reach.\n\nThough some influencers \u2014 mostly lifestyle \u2014 use Instagram more, Twitter is the primary platform for most of them.\n\nWhile the organisations that work with them can easily use other channels for their marketing activities, it could be harder for them to do the same.\n\nAlso, while they may be able to afford VPN services, their followers who keep them in business may be unable or reluctant to do so. Either way, this does not end well for these influencers.\n\nFreelancers\n\nThe increase in Internet penetration has increased the number of people making a living off the Internet, specifically social media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom social media managers to content creators and product photographers, thousands of Nigerians have created careers off these platforms. This ban puts their sources of livelihood at risk.\n\nIn a previous article, we examined how Nigerians are now using Twitter to get jobs, investors, and fill vacancies. These are all activities that a social media ban would hinder.\n\nStartups\n\nNigeria\u2019s startup scene has experienced tremendous growth in a short time, with $3,77.4 million raised in 2019, although that figure fell to $120.6 million in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThis has resulted in jobs for a significant number of people and revenue in the form of taxes for the government.\n\nHowever, this ban puts all of that at risk. For most startups, their businesses depend, in some part, on social media.\n\nWithout access to social media to run marketing campaigns or build relationships with their customers, business would take a hit. Applications that are built using Twitter APIs are also affected.\n\nWhat did these humans do fgs? Block twitter and thereby blocking every other domain that has twitters apis embedded in it? React native elements, UI kitten, my components libraries are not working. I can\u2019t do my work. Wth is wrong with this country! \u2014 Mazi Juls (@AAjulibe) June 5, 2021\n\nWhile these businesses would find ways to innovate around the ban, their users may not.\n\nYou now have to add \u201chow would navigate a government ban\u201d to the type of questions you might have to answer when fundraising. \u2014 Oluyomi Ojo (@OluyomiOjo) June 4, 2021\n\nPolitical stability is one of the factors that investors consider while making investment decisions. By banning Twitter and directing the NBC to start licensing OTT services in the country, investors are not likely to jump at the opportunity of investing in Nigerian startups depriving the country of much-needed investments.\n\nMerchants\n\nSmall and medium enterprises are vital to the growth of any economy, frequently providing as much as 60-70% of the economy with jobs. Numbering about 117.4 million, SMEs in Nigeria contribute 48% of national GDP, account for 96% of businesses, and 84% of employment.\n\nMany SMEs have leveraged the Internet, especially social media, for business activities such as marketing and customer service. The number of vendors on Twitter and Instagram is a testament to this.\n\nWhile these businesses could move to other platforms, their posts might not gain as much engagement as Twitter provides. What\u2019s more? There are no assurances that a ban on other social media platforms would not follow.",

          "text": "The Nigerian Federal Government has announced that it will be indefinitely blocking access to microblogging and social media platform, Twitter, in Nigeria.\n\nOn Friday, June 4, 2021, Nigeria\u2019s Federal Ministry of Information and Culture made this move known on its Twitter and Facebook handles.\n\nPRESS RELEASE\n\n\n\nFG Suspends @Twitter Operations in Nigeria pic.twitter.com/7z5BQ0Mi3U \u2014 Fed Min of Info & Cu (@FMICNigeria) June 4, 2021\n\nPer the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, the government made this suspension due to the \u201cpersistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis move comes just a few days after Twitter deleted a controversial tweet made by Nigeria\u2019s President Muhammadu Buhari. That action had since been criticised by some government officials, and decisive action appears to have been taken.\n\nInterestingly, Facebook has also deleted the President\u2019s message on its platform. Could the hands of Nigerian law also fall heavily?\n\nOver the years, Twitter has become an important social media platform for Nigerians. Several humanitarian causes and protests have moved from hashtags to reality. #OccupyNigeria and #BringBackOurGirls are some notable ones.\n\nNigeria\u2019s latest suspension means that it could order telecom companies to block access to Twitter if this move is not fought against.\n\nRecall that there were fears of a possible Internet shutdown, or, at least of social media after Twitter aided in the #EndSARS campaign \u2014 a nationwide protest against police brutality. That led us to curate an informative piece on how to bypass an Internet shutdown in Nigeria.\n\nIt is then interesting that all it took this time was a deleted tweet, for the Nigerian government to take such drastic action.\n\nThe Ministry of Information and Culture has also ordered the Nigerian Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to start licensing other over-the-top (OTT) and social media platforms going forward.\n\nIt is probably safe to state that this suspension might not end with Twitter if the NBC implements the full provisions of its broadcast code. In 2019, Nigerian lawmakers passed a Social Media Bill through a second hearing in record time, and it took several human rights bodies to pause proceedings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, all signs point to the fact that the Social Media Bill could be very much alive.\n\nSadly, Nigeria has finally joined the ranks of African countries that have implemented some form of Internet censorship.\n\nTwitter\u2019s decision to open its first African office in Ghana, while advertising job roles meant for Nigeria might now be deemed a masterstroke.",

Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, says it\u2019s been a real struggle getting the app to function properly across devices.\n\nAccording to WABetaInfo, on June 3, 2021, Zuckerberg said, \u201cIt\u2019s been a big technical challenge to get all your messages and content to sync properly across devices even when your phone battery dies, but we\u2019ve solved this and we\u2019re looking forward to getting it out soon!\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not all that\u2019s coming to the app. The CEO also revealed a \u2018view once\u2019 feature which will let users send pictures and videos that disappear after they have been viewed.\n\nWhen are these features coming? Though there is no launch date for these features, Zuckerberg hints at some time within the next two months.\n\nTesla for Africa might be getting closer\n\nBe it self-driving or battery-powered, bringing an electric vehicle to African roads is a challenge for obvious reasons: the state of the roads and a lack of electricity.

I will train you to get the desired output from you; we are going to generate more revenue to run our state.\u201d\n\nThe governor warned the workers against cutting corners to favour themselves, and urged them to be committed and stand upright to better the system.\n\nHe continued: \u201cI will see how your pay and allowance can be improved, but I don\u2019t want to see or hear that any one of you is found corrupt, or engaged in corrupt practices; I will not accept that. I have spoken to the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to collaborate with us on this, and also organise training for you people.\n\n\u201cI will bring in experts to train you in your areas of specialization, and make sure that all leakages are blocked to enable us to move our state forward.\n\n\u201cMy administration is determined to make things work the way it should be; the era of who you know is over, it is now the era of what you can offer the system.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs heads of MDAs, institutions and departments, you should not allow any file to stay in your offices beyond 48 hours. Anyone who flaunts the rule will get an automatic query and after three queries such a person leaves the system. As the governor of the state, no file stays in my office beyond 48 hours,\u201d Obaseki noted.\n\nOn his part, Edo State Head of Service and Chairman, Transition Committee Chairman, Barr. Anthony Okungbowa said, \u201cObaseki is investing in creating e-governance platforms, reviewing rules of service, and developing performance management strategy scorecards to rate workers performance.\u201d\n\nOkungbowa said the Obaseki-led administration has embarked on training and retraining of Edo State public and civil Servants, ensuring that Edo people get the best out of them.\n\n...",

          "text": "The threat by the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, to prosecute \u201cviolators\u201d of the government\u2019s ban on Twitter operations in Nigeria lacks legal basis, some lawyers have argued.\n\nThe government, through the information minister, Lai Mohammed, had on Friday suspended Twitter operations in the country.\n\nThe crackdown on Twitter came two days after the social media platform deleted President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s controversial tweet seen as a veiled threat of violence against the Igbo ethnic group.\n\nIt is seen by many Nigerians as an attack on citizens\u2019 right to freedom of expression and a step closer the execution of the government\u2019s years-long ambition to impose regulations on the social media space in the country.\n\nBut since the ban on Twitter on Friday, many Nigerians have been using various Virtual Private Network (VPN) applications to remain active on the microblogging site.\n\nMr Malami, in reaction to the development on Saturday, ordered the Director of Public Prosecution of the Federation (DPPF), Umar Muhammed, to begin the prosecution of those bypassing the ban.\n\nHe directed the DPPF to liaise with the Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy, National Communication Commission (NCC) and other relevant government agencies to ensure the speedy prosecution of the \u201coffenders without any further delay\u201d.\n\n\u2018No constitutional backing\u2019\n\nBut in separate telephone interviews with our correspondent on Saturday, lawyers argued that there were no constitutional provisions to support Mr Malami\u2019s directive to the DPPF to try Nigerians for alleged breach of the government\u2019s suspension of Twitter operations.\n\nA legal practitioner and human rights activist, Malcolm Omirhobo, said it was unfortunate that the attorney-general was unable to offer sound legal advice to President on the Twitter matter and other issues in the country.\n\n\u201cThe inability of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, to distill issues so as to guide the President and government properly on what decisions to take in issues of law and many others in the country is most unfortunate.\n\n\u201cMr Malami\u2019s directive to the DPP of Nigeria has no legal backing,\u201d Mr Omirhobo said.\n\n\u2018Use of Twitter not codified as an offence\u2019\n\nAlso a constitutional lawyer, Daniel Bwala, agreed with Mr Omirhobo, that the use of Twitter had not been defined as an offence by mere suspension of the social media platform by the federal government.\n\nAccording to Mr Bwala, \u201cunless the use of Twitter is codified in law as an offence, you (the government) cannot prosecute any Nigerian for the use of Twitter.\u201d\n\nHe explained, \u201cThe law of the land says nobody will be convicted or prosecuted for any offence that is not defined by law for which the punishment is prescribed in a written constitution.\u201d\n\nIn a video post on Facebook, Mr Bwala, agreed with the government\u2019s suspension of Twitter operations on the grounds the firm\u2019s \u201cdouble standards\u201d in allowing other alleged violators of the company\u2019s policy, but urged Nigerians to \u201cdiscard the assertion by the AGF that people can be prosecuted for the use of Twitter\u201d in Nigeria.\n\n\u2018Tending towards dictatorship\u2019\n\nAnother lawyer, Silas Onu, queried what law would be violated if a Nigerian used Twitter.\n\nHe noted that the action of the AGF was tending towards dictatorship.\n\n\u201cWhat law will be broken if someone uses Twitter? Some things done by this Attorney General truly do not deserve any response. Nothing is an offense unless it is clearly stated as such and punishment also prescribed for breaches. Therefore, the action of the AGF is tending towards dictatorship,\u201d Mr Onu said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u2018Disregard prosecution threat\u2019\n\nWhile lampooning the minister on Twitter on Saturday, Inibehe Effiong, urged Nigerians to disregard his threat.\n\nIn his tweet, Mr Effiong, a human rights lawyer, said inter alia, \u201c\u2026this is supposed to be a Senior Advocate of Nigeria. Nigerians, ignore this infantile statement. It is brutum fulmen. Using VPN to bypass illegal suspension of Twitter is not a crime.\u201d\n\n\u2018Amounts to crime against humanity\u2019\n\nOn its part, the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP), in a tweet said \u201carresting and misusing the criminal justice system to prosecute Nigerians using Twitter in Nigeria (on the basis of a public statement by the Federal Government) would amount to a CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY.\u201d\n\nReferencing Section 36(12) of the 1999 Constitution, another lawyer, Festus Ogun, explained,\n\n\u201cMalami\u2019s order for the arrest and prosecution of Twitter users has no stand in law. Section 36(12) of the Constitution provides that an arrest and prosecution cannot be made except by a law.\n\n\u201cIs Malami now a law unto himself?,\u201d the lawyer wondered, adding that Nigerians would resist any attempt to deny them of their liberty.\n\nCondemnation\n\nMeanwhile, a group known as Youth Rights Campaign, has condemned the ban on Twitter, describing it as \u201can attack on democratic rights.\u201d\n\nIn a statement by its national coordinator, Adaramoye Michael, the group demanded an immediate reversal of the ban.\n\n\u201cThe Youth Rights Campaign (YRC) strongly condemns the recent suspension of Twitter in Nigeria. This declaration of suspension is dictatorial and a direct attack on the democratic rights of Nigerians to freely express themselves.\n\n\u201cWe hereby call on the Federal government to reverse this suspension immediately. At the same time, we call for a halt to all attacks on democratic rights including reversal of the social media bill and indeed all measures aimed at curtailing civil liberties. We also demand the unconditional release of all political detainees.\u201d",

          "text": "The presidency has justified what it called a temporary suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria, noting that it is part of efforts to prevent the violent consequences usually linked to the spread of fake news and misinformation.\n\nLai Mohammed, minister of information, had announced the \u201cindefinite\u201d suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria on Friday, sparking angry reactions.\n\nThe suspension had come after Twitter deleted a tweet by President Muhammadu Buhari in which he made reference to Biafra war, while vowing to treat those destroying public facilities in the language they understand.\n\nHowever, in a statement on Saturday, Garba Shehu, presidential spokesman, said the suspension of Twitter in Nigeria is not only because Buhari\u2019s post was deleted, even as he hinted that the ban was temporary.\n\n\u201cThe temporary suspension of Twitter is not just a response to the removal of the President\u2019s post. There has been a litany of problems with the social media platform in Nigeria, where misinformation and fake news spread through it have had real world violent consequences. All the while, the company has escaped accountability,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, the removal of President Buhari\u2019s tweet was disappointing. The censoring seemed based on a misunderstanding of the challenges Nigeria faces today.\n\n\u201cThe President in his address at the United Nations General Assembly, UNGA in 2019 said \u201cthe world was shocked and startled by the massacre in New Zealand by a lone gunman taking the lives of 50 worshippers. This and similar crimes which have been fueled by social media networks risk seeping into the fabric of an emerging digital culture.\n\n\u201cMajor tech companies must be alive to their responsibilities. They cannot be allowed to continue to facilitate the spread of religious, racist, xenophobic and false messages capable of inciting whole communities against each other, leading to loss of many lives. This could tear some countries apart.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari has therefore been warning against social media\u2019s disruptive and divisive influences and the government\u2019s action is not a knee-jerk reaction to Twitter\u2019s preposterous deletion of his tweet which should have been read in full. The tweet was not a threat, but a statement of fact.\u201d\n\nHe explained what Buhari meant by the post on the Civil War experience, adding that with the current security challenges, the federal government needs to take measures to prevent escalation of tensions.\n\n\u201cA terrorist organisation (IPOB) poses a significant threat to the safety and security of Nigerian citizens. When the President said that they will be treated \u201cin a language they understand,\u201d he merely reiterated that their force shall be met with force. It is a basic principle of security services response world over,\u201d Shehu said.\n\n\u201cThis is not promotion of hate, but a pledge to uphold citizens\u2019 right to freedom from harm. The government cannot be expected to capitulate to terrorists.\n\n\u201cIPOB is proscribed under Nigerian law. Its members murder innocent Nigerians. They kill policemen and set government property on fire. Now, they have amassed a substantial stockpile of weapons and bombs across the country.\n\n\u201cTwitter does not seem to appreciate the national trauma of our country\u2019s civil war. This government shall not allow a recurrence of that tragedy.\u201d",

All the while, the company has escaped accountability.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cnevertheless, the removal of President Buhari\u2019s tweet was disappointing. The censoring seemed based on a misunderstanding of the challenges Nigeria faces today.\n\n\u201cThe President in his address at the United Nations General Assembly, UNGA in 2019 said \u201cthe world was shocked and startled by the massacre in New Zealand by a lone gunman taking the lives of 50 worshippers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis and similar crimes which have been fueled by social media networks risk seeping into the fabric of an emerging digital culture.\n\n\u201cMajor tech companies must be alive to their responsibilities. They cannot be allowed to continue to facilitate the spread of religious, racist, xenophobic and false messages capable of inciting whole communities against each other, leading to loss of many lives. This could tear some countries apart.\n\nHe explained further that, \u201cPresident Buhari has therefore been warning against social media\u2019s disruptive and divisive influences and the government\u2019s action is not a knee-jerk reaction to Twitter\u2019s preposterous deletion of his tweet which should have been read in full.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe tweet was not a threat, but a statement of fact.\n\n\u201cA terrorist organisation (IPOB) poses a significant threat to the safety and security of Nigerian citizens.\n\n\u201cWhen the President said that they will be treated \u201cin a language they understand,\u201d he merely reiterated that their force shall be met with force.

They kill policemen and set government property on fire.

          "text": "Following national criticism, President Muhammadu Buhari reversed his position on the indefinite ban on Twitter in Nigeria on Saturday night, stating that the restriction is just temporary.\n\nFollowing the removal of Mr Buhari\u2019s warning to repeat civil war carnage in south eastern Nigeria from the microblogging site Twitter, Lai Mohammed declared on Friday that Twitter in Nigeria had been suspended indefinitely.\n\nMr Mohammed\u2019s spokesman, Segun Adeyemi, stated, \u201cThe Federal Government has halted, indefinitely, the operations of the microblogging and social networking site, Twitter, in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nNigerians from all walks of life have continued to protest the action since the contentious announcement. Sweden\u2019s, Canada\u2019s, the United States\u2019, and the United Kingdom\u2019s diplomatic missions, as well as Amnesty International, have all condemned the move and demanded for it to be reversed.\n\nThe restriction on Twitter, according to local and international rights organizations, is an infringement on Nigerians\u2019 freedom of expression.\n\nMr Buhari\u2019s spokeswoman, Garba Shehu, has now said that the ban is only temporary, not forever, as Mr Mohammed had previously suggested.\n\nRead the entire statement here:\n\nRead full statement:\n\nPRESIDENTIAL STATEMENT ON TWITTER SUSPENSION IN NIGERI\n\nThe temporary suspension of Twitter is not just a response to the removal of the President\u2019s post. There has been a litany of problems with the social media platform in Nigeria, where misinformation and fake news spread through it have had real world violent consequences. All the while, the company has escaped accountability.\n\nNevertheless, the removal of President Buhari\u2019s tweet was disappointing. The censoring seemed based on a misunderstanding of the challenges Nigeria faces today.\n\nThe President in his address at the United Nations General Assembly, UNGA in 2019 said \u201cthe world was shocked and startled by the massacre in New Zealand by a lone gunman taking the lives of 50 worshippers.\u201d\n\nThis and similar crimes which have been fueled by social media networks risk seeping into the fabric of an emerging digital culture.\n\nMajor tech companies must be alive to their responsibilities. They cannot be allowed to continue to facilitate the spread of religious, racist, xenophobic and false messages capable of inciting whole communities against each other, leading to loss of many lives. This could tear some countries apart.\n\nPresident Buhari has therefore been warning against social media\u2019s disruptive and divisive influences and the government\u2019s action is not a knee-jerk reaction to Twitter\u2019s preposterous deletion of his tweet which should have been read in full.\n\nThe tweet was not a threat, but a statement of fact.\n\nA terrorist organisation (IPOB) poses a significant threat to the safety and security of Nigerian citizens.\n\nWhen the President said that they will be treated \u201cin a language they understand,\u201d he merely reiterated that their force shall be met with force. It is a basic principle of security services response world over.\n\nThis is not promotion of hate, but a pledge to uphold citizens\u2019 right to freedom from harm. The government cannot be expected to capitulate to terrorists.\n\nIPOB is proscribed under Nigerian law. Its members murder innocent Nigerians. They kill policemen and set government property on fire. Now, they have amassed a substantial stockpile of weapons and bombs across the country.\n\nTwitter does not seem to appreciate the national trauma of our country\u2019s civil war. This government shall not allow a recurrence of that tragedy.\n\nGarba Shehu\n\nSenior Special Assistant to the President\n\n(Media & Publicity)\n\nJune 5, 2021",

We are no longer slaves under them.\n\n\u201cThe South has oil and water and other natural resources, but Fulani are the ones enjoying them. Most of our university graduates are Okada riders being what our politicians who tell lies recklessly have made us to be.\n\n\u201cYoruba is the most educated race in Nigeria, but are these graduates getting jobs, no. Rather, our politicians would be buying motorbikes for them for Okada riding. This is wrong and would have to stop. Can they allow their children to be riding Okada?\n\n\u201cToday, they have shared everything that belongs to Nigeria among themselves. The President is a Fulani man, the Inspector General of Police, Director General of the Department of State Services, the Chief of Army Staff, Chairmen of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agencies and Economic and Financial Crimes Commission and Comptrollers General of Immigration and Customs are all Fulanis.\n\n\u201cLet me say this emphatically, we won\u2019t vote in the Southwest in 2023. We need a government of our own. The Fulanis are kidnapping us and collecting ransom, killing and raping us and our leaders are watching because of politics. This will no longer be tolerated\n\n\u201cThe next line of action now is that, we are entering the bush to chase away these Fulani herders. We don\u2019t want them on our lands again. We will pursue them just like I have been saying,\u201d he stated.",

          "text": "\u2026It\u2019s a threat to nation\u2019s corporate existence \u2013 CDS \u2018\u20266,145,000 illegal arms with civilian non-state actors\u2019\n\n\u2026Increases insecurity, deaths \u2013 Ex-head of state\n\n\u2026Drives increasing violence rate in Nigeria \u2013 Oxfam\n\n\u2026Land borders, maritime routes poorly manned \u2013 Experts\n\nDespite the efforts being made by security agencies to tackle the myriads of security challenges confronting the country, insecurity is on the increase and experts have attributed it to the proliferation of weapons. BENJAMIN SAMSON in this report takes a second look at the issues amidst citizens\u2019 growing concerns.\n\nThe Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), Gen. Lucky Irabor, recently decried the proliferation of illegal arms in Nigeria, saying it was a threat to the country\u2019s corporate existence.\n\nIrabor stated this in Asaba, the Delta state capital, while addressing journalists after a courtesy visit to Governor Ifeanyi Okowa, adding that the presidential directive to shoot-on-sight anyone illegally bearing an AK-47 rifle was very clear and must be enforced. While saying Nigeria as a country forbade illegal bearing of arms, he warned that anyone found with such weapons was an enemy of the state and would be treated as such.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe mandate of the president for dealing with everyone holding AK-47 illegally is a mandate that must be enforced because we are a state that does not condone illegal bearing of arms.\n\n\u201cThe armed forces and other security agencies are the only institutions that are mandated to carry arms in the course of their duties. So, anyone who is carrying an AK-47 or any other weapon, for that matter, is considered a threat to the existence of the state.\u201d\n\nStatistics\n\nAccording This Day Newspapers, a March 2017 research report by Oxfam estimated that Nigeria had two million small and light arms in the hands of non-state actors. Also, in October 2020, an Africa-focused geo-political research firm, SBM Intelligence, also raised the alarm that the proliferation of small arms and ammunition was driving the increasing rate of violence in Nigeria.\n\nIn the report, the firm noted that \u201cthe number of small arms in circulation in Nigeria, in the hands of civilian non-state actors is estimated at 6,145,000, while the armed forces and law enforcement collectively account for 586,600 firearms.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, the trend of arms proliferation in Nigeria has had an impact on Nigeria\u2019s internal security, which has led to violence and the deaths and injury of thousands of innocent citizens.\n\nA further testament to the harm arms proliferation was doing to Nigeria was the Global Terrorism Index 2020 report, which ranked it the third most terrorised country in the world due to insecurity.\n\nAbdulsalami\u2019s alarm\n\nSimilarly, Nigeria\u2019s former Head of State, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar (retd.), recently expressed concerns over the proliferation of all calibres of weapons in the country.\n\nAbubakar, who spoke during a dialogue session of the Committee with stakeholders in Abuja, lamented the state of affairs in the country, acknowledging that the proliferation of weapons has heightened insecurity and led to over 80,000 deaths and close to three million Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) across the country.\n\n\u201cThe proliferation of all calibres of weapons in Nigeria is worrying. It is estimated that there are over six million of such weapons in circulation in the country. This certainly exacerbated the insecurity that led to over 80,000 deaths and close to three million internally displaced persons.\n\n\u201cWe believe Nigeria must find a way out of these problems. Our hope is that perhaps among us, by listening to your different perspectives, we can begin to build up confidence among our people so that we can hold together. So, our hope is that we shall not only share our collective lamentations about the current situation, but propose some concrete suggestions that can point the way forward, suggestions that can inspire more confidence among our people and ensure that our country remains one,\u201d Abubakar, who is also the chairman of the National Peace Committee (NPC), said.\n\nPorous borders\n\nExperts who spoke with Blueprint noted that the increase in cases of banditry, kidnapping, ethnic conflicts, cult clashes, among others, is as a result of Nigeria\u2019s porous borders.\n\nAlso, the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS), in 2014, through its then comptroller-general, David Parradang, revealed that although the country had 84 approved borders, there were over 1,400 illegal routes.\n\nParradang, who made the disclosure while addressing the National Conference Committee on Immigration, cited the examples of Ogun and Adamawa states, with 83 and 80 illegal posts, respectively.\n\nA security expert, Dr. Don Belema, in his view, blamed it on the lack of harmonious relationships among security agencies in arms proliferation and poor border management.\n\nHe stressed that the federal government should ensure it builds intelligence gathering for the security apparatus in order to tackle the menace.\n\nHe said, \u201cMost of the arms that filtered into the country came in through most of our neighbouring countries that have suffered some kind of armed conflict in the form of insurgency, rebellion, civil war, and so on. Places like Sudan, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Libya, worsen the situation.\n\n\u201cNow, we should begin to ask ourselves: What has been the problem with Nigeria\u2019s security architecture? If we are talking about the security architecture in Nigeria, we should learn to incorporate our entire sister agencies, other than the armed forces and the police. Then we talk about roles, responsibilities and the porous areas, from where these arms come into the country.\n\n\u201cWe have had Customs confiscate rifles that were shipped into the country. We have had them impound 12 cartridges. But those in the security sector will tell you that the problem of the Nigerian security is not such arms like compaction rifles and the double barrels and single barrels because they are firing gauge 12 cartridges, and by law, actually are not prohibited arms. However, they are supposed to be licensable.\u201d\n\nIsa Alkali, a security analyst, said Nigeria\u2019s land borders, particularly in the northern regions, and maritime routes were being poorly manned by those responsible for the tasks. He charged the federal government to revisit the firearms regulations and make it effective.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have porous borders, where many weapons are being brought illegally. There are people hiding arms and ammunition and smuggling into the country. The government needs to look again at the firearms regulations in this country. The law is old; it is a colonial law. We need to look at it and see how to move regulations that could control small arms in the country.\n\n\u201cThere is a committee of federal government bodies that are in charge of small arms proliferation and prevention. The agency should be able to be well-funded in order to do their jobs.\u201d\n\nBorder security\n\nA security/international relations expert and chief executive officer of X-Ray Systems, Mr. Abraham Etukudo, in a chat with this reporter, called on the government to re-strategise and come up with innovative approaches on how to tackle the porous nature of our border.\n\nHe said, \u201cA country is rated by the way it protects its borders from intruders. Nigeria is perennially at the mercy of gunrunning syndicates, smugglers and pastoral herdsmen. The Buhari regime needs to re-strategise quickly on the issue of security in border communities.\n\n\u201cA holistic, innovative approach to achieving operational control of the border is sorely needed now. It is time to re-jig our national patrol strategy. With just a workforce of 22,300 in 2014, the NIS staff strength might need to be re-examined.\n\n\u201cThe allocation of resources, manpower and material, should be based on detailed threats and risk assessments of the borders. Rapid border intervention teams, surveillance systems, radar, satellite and helicopters should be deployed. In the United States, electronic sensors are placed at strategic locations along the nearly 6,000 miles of Mexican and Canadian international land borders and over 2,000 miles of coastal waters surrounding the Florida Peninsula and the island of Puerto Rico to detect people or vehicles entering the country illegally. Video monitors and night vision scopes are also used to detect illegal entries.\n\n\u201cThe federal government must strive to maximise the available resources and apply appropriate prosecutorial pressure and punishment in order to discourage illegal entry into the country.\u201d\n\nInsecurity\n\nIn his view, Dr. Belema said it has posed security and development challenges and resulted in the deaths of thousands of people every year.\n\n\u201cNowadays, if bandits are not attacking communities and kidnapping helpless residents, including students, Boko Haram terrorists or \u2018unknown gunmen,\u2019 usually armed to the teeth, will be attacking security personnel and facilities, carting away every weapon they can lay their hands on in the process\n\n\u201cArms proliferation is enabling the bandits to defy a long list of militancy operations aimed at dislodging them. The bandits have continued to intensify their terrorist operations with recent high profile mass abduction events in Kankara, Katsina state, Jangebe Niger state, Zamfara state, Afaka, Kaduna state and more tragically Greenfield University Kaduna state where five students were executed.\n\n\u201cSecession rhetoric is becoming violent in the South-east and South-west. The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) recently attacked the Owerri Prison, freed over 1,800 persons and torched the facility. It also attacked Police Headquarters in Owerri. Many police personnel have been shot dead in the East, and their service weapon seized, further proliferating weapons.\n\n\u201cKiller Fulani herdsmen who have been declared the fourth most deadly terrorist group in the world have also been able to take over whole communities in the Middle Belt and the Southwest by the force of arms ejecting the inhabitants from their ancestral land.\u201d\n\nFG\u2019s action, battles\n\nIn a bid to tackle the challenges posed by arms proliferation, President Muhammadu Buhari recently established the National Centre for the Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons (NCCSALW) and appointed Maj.-Gen. A.M. Dikko (retd.) as its pioneer coordinator.\n\nThe NCCSALW is domiciled in the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA) and replaces the defunct Presidential Committee on Small Arms and Light Weapons (PCSALW). It will serve as the institutional mechanism for policy guidance, research and monitoring of all aspects of Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) in Nigeria and forms part of the ongoing restructuring of the nation\u2019s security architecture.\n\nAmong others, it is expected to help address emerging threats and strengthen the regional mechanism for the control, prevention and regulation of SALW.\n\nIn a statement, the ONSA while announcing the centre, said it was one of the measures to help tackle the general insecurity in the country as it would \u201cBe fulfilling the requirements of the ECOWAS Moratorium on Import, Export and Manufacture of Light Weapons, as well as the UN Plan of Action to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit trade in SALW.\n\n\u201cThe NCCSALW will serve as the National Focal Point on SALW in Nigeria and lead a multi-stakeholder process involving Ministries, Departments, Agencies (MDAs) and the civil society in implementing all national, UN and ECOWAS plans of action on the control of SALW.\n\n\u201cThe centre will maintain international cooperation and also operate zonal offices in the six geopolitical zones to ensure quick response and effective mobilisation of resources.\u201d\n\nBeyond the centre\n\nReacting on the creation of the centre, Etukudo said it was just the beginning of the battle against arms proliferation, adding that what Nigerians want to see is results.\n\n\u201cAlthough we are averse to the creation of new agencies, which often than not do not add much value to the country as it rather increases the cost of governance, I support anything that will help to address the insecurity situation in the country.\n\n\u201cHowever, it must be noted that the creation of the centre is just the beginning of the battle. It must be made to work so that Nigerians can see results. The centre should hit the ground running; working in synergy with the police, military, Department of State Services (DSS), National Intelligence Agency (NIA), immigration and other paramilitary groups towards meeting set goals.\n\n\u201cStakeholders, especially those that man the borders \u2013 land, air and water \u2013 must not allow pecuniary benefits to continue to put Nigeria at risk. They should reduce the volume of the corrupt practices within their ranks that allows the inflow of SALW into the country in the first place.\n\n\u201cThey should work and share intelligence not only with relevant national security agencies, but also neighbouring countries and regional organs like ECOWAS. The centre is coming on board at a very critical time in the nation\u2019s history and it should ensure that it makes the necessary impact,\u201d he said.",

Lucky Irabor, recently decried the proliferation of illegal arms in Nigeria, saying it was a threat to the country\u2019s corporate existence.\nA security expert, Dr. Don Belema, in his view, blamed it on the lack of harmonious relationships among security agencies in arms proliferation and poor border management.\nWe need to look at it and see how to move regulations that could control small arms in the country.\n\u201cThere is a committee of federal government bodies that are in charge of small arms proliferation and prevention.\n\u201cThey should work and share intelligence not only with relevant national security agencies, but also neighbouring countries and regional organs like ECOWAS.",

All the while, the company has escaped accountability.\n\n\u201cMajor tech companies must be alive to their responsibilities. They cannot be allowed to continue to facilitate the spread of religious, racist, xenophobic and false messages capable of inciting whole communities against each other, leading to loss of many lives. This could tear some countries apart.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Government announced an \u201cindefinite suspension\u201d of Twitter operations in Nigeria on Friday.\n\nBy early Saturday, users across the country started to experience difficulties in accessing the service and many resorted to using Virtual Private Networks (VPN).\n\nThe decision to suspend Twitter has been criticised by many, but the Presidency in its Saturday statement insisted it was a justified move\n\n\u201c. . . the removal of President Buhari\u2019s tweet was disappointing,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe censoring seemed based on a misunderstanding of the challenges Nigeria faces today.\u201d\n\nThe tweet deleted by Twitter had referenced the Nigerian civil war, in which millions of Igbo died, many due to starvation.\n\nPresident Buhari had threatened to deal with IPOB \u201cin the language they understand\u201d, a statement many interpreted as a repeat of the civil war injustices meted out to Igbos.\n\nIPOB is a group, proscribed by a Nigerian court, seeking secession of a chunk of Southern Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe tweet was not a threat, but a statement of fact,\u201d Mr. Shehu\u2019s statement said.\n\n\u201cA terrorist organisation (IPOB) poses a significant threat to the safety and security of Nigerian citizens.\n\n\u201cWhen the President said that they will be treated \u2018in a language they understand,\u2019 he merely reiterated that their force shall be met with force. It is a basic principle of security services response world over.\n\n\u201cThis is not promotion of hate, but a pledge to uphold citizens\u2019 right to freedom from harm. The government cannot be expected to capitulate to terrorists.\n\n\u201cIPOB is proscribed under Nigerian law. Its members murder innocent Nigerians. They kill policemen and set government property on fire. Now, they have amassed a substantial stockpile of weapons and bombs across the country.\n\n\u201cTwitter does not seem to appreciate the national trauma of our country\u2019s civil war. This government shall not allow a recurrence of that tragedy.\u201d",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nA consultant anatomic and forensic pathologist, Prof. John Obafunwa on Saturday told the Lagos state judicial panel on restitution for victims of SARS related abuses and other matters, that the coroners office conducted post mortem autopsies on 99 bodies between the October 20 and 27.\n\nProf Obafunwa made this disclosure while testifying with a view to assist the panel in its investigation of the October 20 Lekki toll gate shootings.\n\nThe pathologist, who was involved in coroner services through the office of the Chief Medical Examiner of Lagos State, said the 99 bodies were picked up from different locations by officers of the Lagos State Environmental Health Monitoring Unit, LASEHMU.\n\nOf these 99 bodies, the pathologist said that only three were identified as victims of the Lekki shootings.\n\nHe proceeded to speak to the post mortem report and the cause of death of each of the three victims, all male.\n\nThe witness also played a video evidence detailing the extent of injury suffered by the deceased and the cause of death.\n\nAccording to the witness, the first body of an unknown victim simply identified as number 005, EndSARS/Yaba/2020 and brought in from Lekki bridge, on October 24 by the Lagos state government agency showed a fracture, a laceration on the left side of the skull and a body that was already decomposing.\n\nThe pathologist gave the cause of death as \u201ca result of bleeding into the chest cavity, following a blunt force trauma to the chest.\u201d\n\nAccording to the witness, the second body , \u201c041 unknown identity\u201d, was said to have died at about 1.45am on October 21; he was taken to Reddington hospital Lekki in an unconscious state as a result of open skull fracture, an attempt to revive him failed and he was pronounced dead after which he was taken to LASUTH on November 1 for post mortem.\n\n\u201cX-ray conducted prior to touching the body showed no bullet or pellets in the body,\u201d the witness said. \u201cThe x-ray revealed multiple skull fracture. Autopsy showed there was a ragged laceration running from the left side to the right side of the skull, further exploration of the wound showed bleeding into the scalp, multiple fracture of the skull, bleeding into the brain tissue. In the chest, there was bruises of the anterior, fracture of the left rib.\n\n\u201cGenerally the internal organs were pale and it suggested there was severe blood loss. Hypertensive heart disease, upon examination under the microscope and samples for DNA, death was as a result of skull and brain injury which was due to blunt force trauma.\u201d\n\nThe third case, identified as \u201c062 unknown identity\u201d, was also said to have died at Lekki tollgate. The body was said to have been taken to the General Hospital Yaba and autopsy was conducted on November 2. Cause of death was said to be severe blood loss as a result of disruption of major blood vessel, caused as a result of gun shot injury.\n\nCounsel to some of the #EndSars Protesters, Olumide Fusika, however faulted the testimony that only three of the 99 bodies were related to the Lekki shootings.\n\nHe made an application that the witness be required to produce details of all 99 bodies to enable him fully conduct his cross examination of the pathologist.\n\nCounsel to the Lagos State Government, Olukayode Enitan objected to the granting of the application.\n\nHe noted that the summons which commanded the attendance of the witness at the panel required him to give reports of incidents of October 20, which occurred at the Lekki toll gate with a view to assisting the panel.\n\nFor him, anything outside this will amounted to inviting the panel to go beyond its terms of reference and the instruments setting it up and this will be tantamount to acting ultra vires. He urged the panel to refuse the application.\n\nAfter taking submissions from other lawyers in the matter, the panel chairman, Justice Doris Okuwobi noted that though it would take a lot of the panel\u2019s time to sit through looking at 96 more bodies, she would bow to the majority decision of the lawyers.\n\nThe panel then ordered the pathologist, Prof Obafunwa to produce the records and autopsy reports of the remaining 96 bodies.\n\nFurther proceedings on the matter were adjourned to June 19.",

          "text": "Editors in Nigeria have called on the federal government to immediately reconsider the suspension of operations of Twitter as the move projects the Nigerian government as a dictatorship.\n\nThe editors under the aegis of the Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE) described the federal government\u2019s action as an overreaction to Twitter\u2019s decision to delete President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tweet and called on the Nigerian government to seek other legitimate means of resolving its dispute with the microblogging company.\n\nThe Nigerian editors stated this in a statement on Saturday and noted that the federal government\u2019s action has the unintended consequence of jeopardising the economic interests of many Nigerians who rely on the social media platform for vital information to make informed business decisions daily.\n\n\u201cAdvising the federal government to desist from any action that would project the Nigerian government as a dictatorship, the Nigerian editors said that the action is an infringement on Section 39 of the 1999 Constitution and violates the right of Nigerians to interact freely on this platform,\u201d the statement signed by Mustapha Isah (President) and Iyobosa Uwugiaren (General Secretary) read.\n\n\u2018\u2019In addition, the suspension is a grave breach of Nigeria\u2019s international obligations under article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights, and article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\n\u2018\u2019The Guild sees the federal government\u2019s action as an overreaction to Twitter\u2019s decision to delete President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tweet early this week.\n\n\u2018\u2019If the federal government finds Twitter\u2019s action against the President objectionable, Nigerians should not be made to suffer the collateral damage of denying them their right to freely discourse on Twitter\u2019\u2019, the Guild added.\n\nThe Guild noted that the federal government had in an initial reaction by the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, condemned the deletion of President Buhari\u2019s view as an unacceptable tab on the president\u2019s right, saying this ought to have been a sufficient response.\n\n\u2018\u2019However, the ban at the weekend, of Twitter\u2019s operation in Nigeria, is an overkill that gives wind to the sail of critics who daily accuse the Buhari administration of intolerance of opposing views.\n\n\u2018\u2019Certainly, the federal government has the responsibility to safeguard the unity, peace and stability of Nigeria and any person or group that threatens this must draw its ire. In expressing its anger, the federal government, however, ought to exercise restraints to avoid giving the impression that it is intolerant of opposing views and expression of opinion by individual and corporate citizens\u2019\u2019, the Guild stated.\n\nStressing its concern over the growing insecurity in the country, the Guild advised social media leaders, which provide micro-messaging services, to also beam their searchlight on the activities of those who want to use their platforms to cause divisions and spread hatred in the country and the global community as well.\n\nNoting the socio-political and economic benefits of social media platforms, the NGE explained that strong democracies rely on both civic and political participation by citizens, saying that Twitter, has over the years, aided citizens\u2019 participation in the nation\u2019s democratic process.\n\n\u2018\u2019The Guild is aware of the democratizing influence of social media platforms, including Twitter, in helping to check dictatorship and promote democracy worldwide.\n\n\u2018\u2019Twitter also builds a market research prospect for businesses to see what customers are chit-chatting about, their feeling and what is important to them about products and services\u2019\u2019, the Guild said,\n\nThe Guild therefore called on the federal government to immediately rescind its decision in order not to deny millions of Nigerians who rely on Twitter to provide services and earn a living.\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",
