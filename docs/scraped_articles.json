          "text": "The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board has attributed the drop in the revenue it generated from the sale of forms for the 2021 Unified Tertiary and Matriculation Examinations and the Direct Entry Examinations to the introduction of the National Identification Number requirement into the registration process.\n\nIt said the NIN requirement made it impossible for some prospective candidates to register, leading to the reduction in number of registered candidates and the proceeds generated from sales of forms.\n\nThe board\u2019s Director of Press and Public Relations, Dr Fabian Benjamin, disclosed this in a telephone interview with our correspondent on Sunday.\n\nThe PUNCH had reports that JAMB generated N5,887,628,900 from the sale of forms for the 2021 UTME/DE.\n\nThe figure is lower than the N6,563,086,710 the board generated from forms in 2020.\n\nThe sum generated from the sale of forms was obtained under the financial inflow column of the board\u2019s weekly bulletins for April and May 2021.\n\nWhen asked what was responsible for the drop in the revenue generated from the forms, Benjamin said, \u201cLast year, we had over two million candidates who registered for the examinations, both the UTME and DE. But this year, we are talking about between 1.3 million and 1.4 million. We know factors such as the introduction of the NIN to the registration process were responsible.\n\n\u201cFrom the information on ground, the NIN did not make lots of candidates register and you know before now we have been having cases of multiple registrations and that was why we brought in the NIN.\u201d\n\nThe 2021 registration which started on April 10, 2021 ended on May 29,2021, though the board had disclosed its intention to give an extension to a few candidates with \u201cspecial cases.\u201d\n\nIn 2021, no fewer than 1,338,687 candidates registered for the UTME, while 75,328 registered for the Direct Entry examination.\n\nThe figures are against the total of over two million registered candidates for 2020.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "\n\n\n\nThe National Democratic Coalition (NADECO) has lamented the level of political instability and insecurity in Nigeria.\n\nThe General Secretary and Spokesman of NADECO, Mr. Ayo Opadokun, in an open letter to the Secretary General of the United Nations Organization, (UNO); The Security Council of the UNO; the President of the United States of America; the Speaker of the Congress and Leader of the Senate of the United States of America; European Union and European Parliament; the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and the House of Commons, the President of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) and the President of the Supreme Council of Islamic Affairs of Nigeria alleged that the \u2018Fulanisation Policy\u2019 of the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari and its disregard for the constitution was fuelling secessionist agitations.\n\nNADECO, in the letter dated June,15, 2021, a copy of which was made available to Vanguard on Sunday said: \u201cOther than diminishing Democracy to a virtual dictatorship, NADECO wonders by which Section of our Ill-founded and presently extremely beleaguered so called Federal Republic of Nigeria Constitution 1999.\n\n\u201cDo the trio of your good self, Mr. President, the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives aided by your hound dog, the Minister of Justice, public service officers all, with specific functions set out in the Constitution, find the justification to judge yourselves entitled to jump uninvited, with decrying statements, into the compendium of frays between trespassing Fulani herdsmen and ancestral land owners exercising their primordial rights to decide whom they want or do not want on their lands? (Local lands, i.e. upon which the Chief Security Officers of the State localities of the arguendo, do not only have supervisory authority, but were also already mentoring).\n\nNADECO said perhaps, it should be wondering whether because the President is the Patron of the Fulani Herdsmen and Cattle Traders, (Miyetti Allah), land owners\u2019 rights must be suspended in awe of such trespassers.\n\nIt said needless to say that it was such defence for specially preferred ethnicities that had led to the various discomfort experienced by groups like Ndigbo and the whole of the Middle Belt and Southern Nigeria, who have reached the end of their tether, seeking to get out of Nigeria.\n\nNADECO noted that this was due to \u201cthe unacceptability of this administration\u2019s now obvious Policy of Fulanisation and the President\u2019s refusal to discontinue operating Nigeria in accordance with a \u2018Constitution concocted to fraudulently obtain the consent of the people of Nigeria to surrender their sovereignty, lands, resources and rights to the control of the promoters of the forged constitution and a clever ploy to transfer the resources protected by the independence constitution for the ethnicities in the spaces where they are found, to the 1999 Constitution and the President\u2019s preferred and substituted beneficiaries.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn all the circumstances of this matter, NADECO has no alternative but to join in the insistence that there better be no more elections under the 1999 so called Federal Constitution, until we return to the negotiated 1960 and 1963 Federal Constitutions to which Nigerians subscribed at independence and when we became a republic. \u201c\n\nNADECO stressed that out of the total of 360 House of Representatives members, the entire South has 169, while the North has 191.\n\nIt also decried the injustice in the distribution of oil revenue.\n\nCiting Nigeria Bureau of Statistics report of 2017, NADECO noted that the North Central receives 20 per cent of oil revenue and contributes 0.00 per cent, while the North-east receives 16 per cent and contributes 0.00 per cent.\n\nIt added that the North-West receives 21 per cent from the oil revenue and contributes 0.00 per cent.\n\nNADECO said every month, the 19 Northern states receive a minimum of 57 per cent of 100 per cent of oil revenue to which they contribute 0.00 per cent.\n\nIt said South-west receives 16 per cent, contributes 6.36 per cent, while South-east receives 11.00 per cent; contributes 3.12 per cent and South-South receives 16.00 per cent and contributes 70.64 per cent.\n\nWorking with the data from the office of the Accountant General as published by the Ministry of Finance (2013 April), NADECO stressed that the 357 LGAs of the 17 Southern States receive 45.1% and contribute 100 per cent, while the 419 LGAs of the 19 Northern States receive 54. 9% and contribute 0.00 per cent.\n\nNADECO added: \u201cThe foregoing narrative explains why the owners of Nigeria were not given the opportunity to participate in Constitution making whilst the Tables of Rights of the component parts of the Country show the reasons why you, Mr. President and your preferred citizens will forever not allow Nigeria to go back to what was agreed and formed part of the Independence Constitution; making One Nigeria the biggest fraud ever.\u201d\n\nNADECO further decried the nepotic, ill treatment, inequitable and unjust nature with which Buhari\u2019s administration has governed Nigeria.\n\nIt pointed out that Section 6 of the1999 Constitution ousts the jurisdiction of Nigerian Courts and therefore there is no local Nigerian Legal Forum the entraps ethnic nationalities who constitute the majority and are occupying four out of the six zones in the country can seek redress.\n\nNADECO stressed that Buhari has rejected all entreaties and appeals by eminent Nigerians, ethnic nationalities leaders for the country to return Nigeria to the Independence Constitution as negotiated by the founding fathers and upon which Nigeria sought membership of the United Nations, but would rather accuse the protagonists of seeking to break up the country whilst ridiculing and threatening them with the charge of secession.\n\nIt said it was based on this that it decided on behalf of Nigerians to put world leaders on notice through the open letter.\n\nNADECO stated categorically that it supported and endorsed the clarion call made by Gen. Theophilus Danjuma and the \u2018Save Our Soul Plea\u2019 of the Ilana Omo Odua led by Prof. Banji Akintoye asking Nigerians to exercise their rights of self defence.\n\nIt said its reason was because the federal government had failed to fulfil its Constitutional responsibility as contained in section 14 (2) (b) of the 1999 Constitution which states \u201cthe security and welfare of the people shall be the primary purpose of government.\u201d",

In addition, N52.76bn was recorded in 2017, while the sector accounted for N41.98bn in 2016.\n\nOn minerals exports, the report showed that the solid minerals sector accounted for N124.23 billion of the total government exports of N24.275 trillion for 2019, representing 0.51 per cent of total exports for the year.\n\nAs for the sector\u2019s contribution to the economy, NEITI cited data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) which stated that mining and quarrying contributed 0.26 per cent to GDP in 2019, a higher figure than the 0.18 per cent contribution in 2018.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s GDP in 2019 was \u20a6144.210 trillion with contributions from the solid minerals sector totaling \u20a6368.99billion, representing 0.2per cent of the total amount.\n\n\u201dThis shows a steady growth in the sector\u2019s contribution to the economy in the past five years, from a contribution of 0.12% in 2015 to 0.26% in 2019,\u2019\u2019 the report added (NAN)",

          "text": "\n\nBy Ibrahim Wuyo\n\nRampaging bandits who attacked Gana and Rampashi communities in Zamfara state have rustled about 700 cattle and over 200 camels, even as locals in 5 villages in the state have since deserted their villages.\n\nAlready, according to a BBC Hausa report monitored on Saturday, the bandits have killed 29 locals in the affected communities.\n\nMeanwhile, Naomi Yakubu, mother of one of the students who was shot during the recent Yauri attack, has told the BBC Hausa that her 18-year-old son who was a final year student in the college, fell victim to the bandit\u2019s bullet while he was carrying some primary school pupils to safety.\n\nWhile narrating her story, she said \u201d I was informed of what happened and on our way, I was told that one boy was shot. I had the premonition, it could be my son that was shot. On reaching there, I found it was my son that was shot, with 2 bullets.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Half-naked women lament killing of 13-year-old, block Kaduna-Abuja highway over banditry\n\nOn the condition she met her son, she said \u201d well, praise be to Allah. I met him lying down\u2026..it\u2019s now that they allowed me to talk to him. He is 18 years old. He told me that there were little children who the bandits were pursuing to kidnap. He is in SS3, he was running while carrying the primary school children. It was in that process that they shot him from the rear.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen he fell down, the bandits put him in their vehicle to go with him. But they saw blood gushing out of his body and decided to drop him. They pushed him down.\u201d\n\nNaomi explained that her son survived by the will of Almighty Allah because a lot of blood gushed out of his body.\n\n\u201cHe is getting better, he is in the hands of people, with the doctors\u2026\u2026Because of the blood coming out, one teacher quickly carried him and ran away with him,\u201d she said.\n\nA source told the BBC Hausa that 3 students have died so far,2 females and a male.According to the report,one of the female students was asthmatic,as her father had said.But the male student died from gun shots.\n\n\u201cSo far,only one soldier had problems but he was rushed to Birnin Kebbi\u2026.A father who was at the college to look for his son,bursted into tears when he saw the dead body,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a similar development ,the BBC Hausa reported that bandits have sacked about 5 villages in Anka and Bukuyum communities of Zamfara state.\n\nAccording to the report,already about 29 locals were killed by the rampaging bandits,who rustled their livestock and stole farm produce,a development that led to a mass exodus in the communities.\n\nAbubakar Mai Inji,a resident of Tungan Rogo who had since moved to another location,said the bandits have chased out the locals in 5 villages within the Bukuyum and Anka axis.\n\n\u201d The places have been deserted, we\u2019ve been in a state of fear and confusion. We are now in Nasarawa, with no food. We are hungry. They\u2019ve killed 29 of our people, drove our cattle away and packed our food,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother local who sought anonymity told the BBC Hausa that the bandits came on bikes numbering about 300, each carrying 3 bandits wielding dangerous weapons.\n\n\u201cThey were shooting sporadically, they blocked the road..they crossed over to Gana and Rampashi where they rustled cattle, about 700 and over 200 camels,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen contacted,the PPRO in Zamma state,Mohammed Shehu ,told the BBC Hausa service that they were yet to get the information ,but would investigate.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

The high-profile delisting shaved off more than N82 billion from the market capitalisation at the NGX.\n\n11 had opted for voluntary delisting after its new owners pushed through shareholders delisting programme as part of restructuring of the downstream oil company.\n\nThe NGX stated at the weekend that it delisted the entire share capital of 11 from its Daily Official List in line with the approval of the shareholders of 11 to delist the petroleum company.\n\nNIPCO Investments Limited, a subsidiary of NIPCO Plc, had in March 2017 taken over the 60 per cent majority equity stake of ExxonMobil Oil Corporation in Mobil Oil Nigeria Plc in a $301 million acquisition deal. It subsequently changed the name of the company to 11 Plc, pronounced as double one. The name change was sequel to the resolution passed by the company\u2019s shareholders at its annual general meeting held on May 24, 2017.\n\nExxonMobil and Nipco had, in October 2016, executed a sale and purchase agreement (SPA) to sell the former\u2019s majority equity stake of 60 per cent in Mobil Oil Nigeria (MON) to Nipco, an indigenous oil and gas company.\n\nExplaining the rationales for the delisting to shareholders, 11 stated that the delisting of its shares from the NGX would enable the company to implement strategic plans that will improve the overall performance of the downstream oil company.\n\nThe company stated that the delisting would enable it to explore strategic opportunities, alliances and collaborations that can bolster earnings and synergised benefits with little or no regulatory obligations.\n\nAccording to the company, delisting will lead to greater focus and impact on the performance of its performance while it will not have any material changes on its operations, staff and board compositions.\n\n\u201c11 Plc will be able to focus on revenue generation, consider strategic opportunities, alliances and collaborations; and tremendously shift from regulatory, administrative, and financial reporting regulations that companies listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange must adhere to,\u201d 11 stated.\n\nThe company stated that while its shares will no longer be available for trading on the NSE, now NGX, upon delisting, it would continue to operate as an unlisted public company. This raises possibility of its shares being listed and traded on the NASD OTC Securities Exchange \u2013the over-the-counter platform for trading of unlisted public companies.\n\nThe company had noted that the delisting would not have any impact on the existing employment contracts of its staff as well as the composition of the board of directors.\n\nShareholders of 11 had at their annual general meeting (AGM) on October 14, 2020 approved a resolution to delist the entire 360.6 million ordinary shares of 50 kobo each of 11 from the NSE.",

          "text": "By Taofik Salako, Deputy Group Business Editor\n\nTrading has been suspended on the shares of Guaranty Trust Bank (GTBank) Plc as Nigeria\u2019s largest financial institution prepares to transit into a holding company (holdco) structure from its commercial banking structure.\n\nThe Nigerian Exchange (NGX) Limited at the weekend suspended trading on the shares of GTBank, citing the impending transition of the bank. With the suspension, there will be no trading or share price movement throughout the period leading to the delisting of the GTBank and relisting of the holdco.\n\nAccording to the NGX, the step it took was necessary to prevent trading in the shares of the bank in preparation for the eventual delisting of GTBank from the Daily Official List of the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) and listing of the holding company, Guaranty Trust Holding Company Plc on NGX.\n\nThe bank will adopt one-for-one share exchange ratio that will not reduce or impact its shareholding structure of the bank.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nShareholders of GTBank had approved the restructuring of the bank to a holdco. The approval paved way for GTB to conclude transition from a standalone commercial bank to a group structure that allows it to invest in other areas of financial services or other businesses.\n\nAt the court-ordered meeting in Lagos, shareholders approved the transfer of issued and paid up capital of GTBank totalling 29.431 billion ordinary shares of 50 kobo each to a new company to be known as Guaranty Trust Holding Company Plc. The new company, Guaranty Trust Holding Company (GTHoldings) Plc, will simultaneously allot the same 29.431 billion ordinary shares of 50 kobo each to the former shareholders of GTBank in accordance with their shareholdings in the bank.\n\nManaging Director, Guaranty Trust Bank (GTB) Plc, Mr. Segun Agbaje said the adoption of holdco was necessitated because of Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN) regulations, which require the separation of commercial banking business from other financial services businesses.\n\nHe explained that under the new structure, shareholders of GTBank would be migrated to Guaranty Trust Holdings through a share-for-share exchange between the shareholders of GTBank and GTHoldings.\n\nAccording to him, the overall strategy was to create an operating model that would profitably grow the bank\u2019s presence in the market for commercial banking and non-banking financial services in order to achieve the aspiration to be the dominant financial services group.\n\n\u201cI am delighted over the approval by shareholders for the holding company and I assure the investors of a more rewarding future. The bank will not embark on any share reconstruction as the same number of shares they have with the bank will be maintained,\u201d Agbaje said.\n\nShareholders were excited about the transition to a holdco structure.\n\nFounder, Independent Shareholders Association of Nigeria (ISAN), Sir Sunny Nwosu said the shareholders were excited because the arrangement the bank has put in place for the transition to holdco was devoid of complexities usually known as share reconstruction.\n\n\u201cWe are excited about the development because we are going to get value as everything we have would be transferred to the holding company. There will be no manipulation as a result of reconstruction that usually leads to fractional shares,\u201d Nwosu said.\n\nPresident, Progressive Shareholders Association of Nigeria (PSAN), Mr. Boniface Okezie, said GTBank has over the years proven to be a force and leading initiator of revolutionary advancement and technology-based development in the nation\u2019s banking industry.\n\nHe said shareholders would be looking forward to the growth and advancement the bank will bring into the new business areas it will be taking on with the holdco structure.\n\n\u201cThe arrangement where all existing shares of the bank would be transferred entirely to the holdco in the name of the beneficial owners is good, while the same number of units and percentage would be held in the new entity, is commendable,\u201d Okezie said.",

And we are following up with dialogue, which at the end of the day is what will happen. We have to talk, we have to discuss. Minister of Defence, Minister of Interior and service chiefs were in Enugu earlier last Saturday and we are going to do follow-up meetings on that again starting from tomorrow.\n\n\u201cWe briefed him and he accepted that dialogue is the way to go in all these. Like I keep on saying, there is a very thin line between perception and reality, so certain things should be done, at least to assuage the feelings of the people in the area and make them not to feel unwanted, so that area was also discussed.\u201d\n\nHe said they also briefed the president on labour issues, including the recent strike by Judicial Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) and Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria (PASAN) for two months before it was called off.\n\n\u201cI have to see him to appraise him with labour industrial milieu, especially when you know that the judiciary and parliamentary workers JUSUN and PASAN respectively had been been on strike that lasted for two months.

The two women were arrested with seven bags of cannabis weighing 77.23kg brought in from Ogbese, Ondo State, to supply a man they simply identified as Alhaji. According to them, they had earlier supplied the same Alhaji two bags before coming with the seven bags they were caught with.\n\nOn Friday June 18, operatives of the Oyo state Command acting on intelligence also raided the residence of Alhaji Faruq, at Elebu area, Akala expressway, Oluyole LGA, Ibadan, where they recovered 43 ampoules of methylphenidate. In Kaduna state, a drug trafficker, Segun Abraham was arrested at Panteka area of the state on 17th June with 211.500kg of skunk heading to Kano state.\n\nMeanwhile, a Nigerian returning from Pakistan, Ezenyeche Kingsley Ebuka has been arrested by NDLEA operatives at the Murtala Muhammed International Airpirt, MMIA, Ikeja Lagos with five pellets of heroin weighing 250grams discovered in his anus. The suspect had arrived the \u2018D\u2019 arrival hall of the airport on 14th June on Turkish airline flight from Pakistan with the illicit drug inserted in his anus. He however failed to beat the eagle eyes of narcotic officers during inward clearance of passengers on the flight.\n\nWhile commending the Ogun, Oyo, Kaduna and the MMIA Commands of the Agency for sustaining the offensive action against illicit drug trafficking and the cartels running it, Gen. Marwa warned that the NDLEA will not spare any law enforcement agent hiding under the privilege of his uniform to engage in narcotic criminal business.\n\n\u201cThose who think they can sabotage ongoing efforts to rid Nigeria of the menace of illicit drug trafficking and abuse hiding behind the fa\u00e7ade of their uniforms should better think twice because they\u2019ll have NDLEA to contend with.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022Seeks suspension of elections until new grundnorm is promulgated\n\n\u2022Urges UN to intervene in resolving crisis in Nigeria\n\nAdedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nThe National Democratic Coalition (NADECO) has written to President Muhammadu Buhari over the rising security challenges in the country and canvassed as panacea, the return to the 1960 and 1963 Constitutions to replace the extant 1999 grundnorm, which it said the military imposed on Nigerians.\n\nThe pro-democracy group, which was in the vanguard of the clamour for the rebirth of democracy in Nigeria during the military regime of late Gen. Sani Abacha, leading to the return to civil rule in 1999, in an open letter to the president, pressed for the suspension of further elections until the country gets a new constitution.\n\nThe letter, dated June 15, 2021, and obtained by THISDAY, was signed by its General-Secretary, Mr. Ayo Opadokun.\n\nAnother letter by the group also dated June 15, 2021, and signed by Opadokun, to the Secretary-General, United Nations Organisation (UN), Mr. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, requested the global body\u2019s intervention to halt the fast deterioration of national security and political instability in Nigeria.\n\nTHISDAY also obtained a copy of the letter to the UN copied to the UN Security Council; the President of the United States; the Speaker of the Congress and Leader of the Senate of the United States; the European Union and European Parliament; the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and the House of Common and the President of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Buhari as well as the President of the Supreme Council of Islamic Affairs of Nigeria.\n\nNADECO, in the letter to the president, accused him of fuelling secessionist agitations through the \u201cFulanisation\u201d policy of his administration and its disregard for the constitution.\n\nIt also decried the deterioration of national security and political instability under Buhari\u2019s administration.\n\nIt said: \u201cOther than diminishing democracy to a virtual dictatorship, NADECO wonders by which Section of our Ill-founded and presently extremely beleaguered so-called the Federal Republic of Nigeria Constitution 1999 do the trio of your good self, Mr. President, the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives aided by your hound dog, the Minister of Justice, public service officers all, with specific functions set out in the constitution, find the justification to judge yourselves entitled to jump uninvited, with decrying statements, into the compendium of frays between trespassing Fulani herdsmen and ancestral land owners exercising their primordial rights to decide whom they want or do not want on their lands.\u201d\n\nNADECO said perhaps Buhari\u2019s interest in supporting the herdsmen was due to the fact of his being the patron of the Fulani herdsmen and cattle traders, (Miyetti Allah), making him to push for the suspension of land owners\u2019 rights \u201cin awe of such trespassers.\u201d\n\nIt stated that it is such defence for especially preferred ethnicities that had led to the various discomfort experienced by other groups, including Ndigbo and the whole of the Middle Belt and Southern Nigeria, which now want to opt out of Nigeria.\n\nNADECO argued that the growing secessionist tendencies in the country were fueled by what it called the obvious policy of Fulanisation and the president\u2019s refusal to discontinue the operation of the 1999 Constitution as altered.\n\nIt said: \u201cIn all the circumstances of this matter, NADECO has no alternative but to join in the insistence that there better be no more elections under the 1999 so-called federal constitution, until we return to the negotiated 1960 and 1963 federal constitutions to which Nigerians subscribed at independence and when we became a republic.\u201d\n\nNADECO also expressed concern about the inequitable distribution of political posts between the North and the South, saying that out of the total of 360 House of Representatives members, the South has 169, while the North has 191.\n\nIt also decried the injustice in the distribution of oil revenue.\n\nCiting the Nigeria Bureau of Statistics report of 2017, NADECO stated that the North-central receives 20 per cent of oil revenue and contributes 0.00 per cent, while the North-east receives 16 per cent and contributes 0.00 per cent.\n\nIt added that the North-west receives 21 per cent from the oil revenue and contributes 0.00 per cent.\n\nNADECO said every month, the 19 Northern states receive a minimum of 57 per cent of 100 per cent of oil revenue to which they contribute 0.00 per cent.\n\nAccording to it, the South-west receives 16 per cent, contributes 6.36 per cent, while South-east receives 11.00 per cent; contributes 3.12 per cent and South-South receives 16.00 per cent and contributes 70.64 per cent.\n\nWorking with the data from the office of the Accountant General of the Federation, as published by the Ministry of Finance (2013 April), NADECO stated that the 357 LGAs of the 17 Southern states received 45.1% and contributed 100 per cent, while the 419 LGAs of the 19 Northern states received 54. 9% and contributed 0.00 per cent.\n\nNADECO added: \u201cThe foregoing narrative explains why the owners of Nigeria were not given the opportunity to participate in constitution-making whilst the Tables of Rights of the component parts of the country show the reasons why you, Mr. President, and your preferred citizens, will forever not allow Nigeria to go back to what was agreed and formed part of the independence constitution; making one Nigeria the biggest fraud ever.\u201d\n\nNADECO decried what it regarded as the nepotism, ill-treatment, inequitable and unjust nature with which the Buhari administration has governed Nigeria.\n\nIt said since Section 6 of the 1999 Constitution ousted the jurisdiction of courts, there was no local Nigerian legal forum the entrapped ethnic nationalities who constitute the majority and are occupying four out of the six zones in the country can seek redress.\n\nNADECO accused Buhari of rejecting all entreaties and appeals by eminent Nigerians and ethnic nationalities leaders for the country to return Nigeria to the independence constitution as negotiated by the founding fathers and upon which Nigeria sought membership of the United Nations, but would rather accuse the protagonists of seeking to break up the country whilst ridiculing and threatening them with the charge of secession.\n\nIt said it was based on this that it decided on behalf of Nigerians to put world leaders on notice through the open letter.\n\nNADECO stated that it supported and endorsed the clarion call made by a former Minister of Defence, Lt. Gen. Theophilus Danjuma (rtd), and the \u2018Save Our Soul Plea\u2019 of the Ilana Omo Odua led by Prof. Banji Akintoye, asking Nigerians to exercise their rights of self-defence.\n\nIt said its reason was that the federal government had failed to fulfil its constitutional responsibility as contained in section 14 (2) (b) of the 1999 Constitution as altered, which states: \u201cThe security and welfare of the people shall be the primary purpose of government.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Hon. Marcus Onobu, told THISDAY that about five bills critical to good governance could not be passed due to the strike embarked by the legislative workers.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe assembly has five outstanding bills at various stages of passage before the strike by legislative began.\u201d\n\nOn the judiciary, THISDAY\u2019s investigation revealed that the judicial workers in the state did not embark on any strike.\n\nIt was gathered that their refusal to join the national body was borne out of the experience they had when they participated in such strike during the administration of Mr. Adams Oshiomhole and were not paid for the period they were on strike to date.\n\nIn Ekiti State, no fewer than 880 cases were stalled in different hierarchies of courts as a result of the strike, which commenced on April 6 and ended on June 14.\n\nThe Public Relations Officer, Ekiti State Judiciary, Mr. Oba Olayiwola, told THISDAY that a total of 880 cases were paused by the industrial action.\n\nHe said: \u201cOut of these cases, 600 were in the Ekiti State High Court, Ado Ekiti, while the magistrates and other high court divisions had 280 pending cases.\n\nHowever, the Speaker of the Ekiti State House of Assembly, Hon. Funminiyi Afuye, said the strike didn\u2019t affect the legislature much because the lawmakers were meeting at his lodge regularly to attend to legislative issues.\n\nAfuye, however, agreed that the industrial action affected the passage of some bills, which he assured would soon be passed to make up for the lost period.\n\nThe Chief Registrar of Sokoto High Court, Mr. Bashir Ibrahim, told THISDAY that over 100 cases filed in the state high court were stalled due to the strike.\n\nHe lamented that many lawyers complained that their clients who were awaiting trials suffered unnecessarily due to the strike.\n\nThe Public Relations Officer (PRO) of the Nasarawa State Judiciary, Mr. Enoch Ali-Maku, also told THISDAY that many cases that were on the cause list could not be heard while fresh ones filed shortly before the commencement of the strike could not be listed.\n\nHe, however, said he did not have the exact number of the cases whose proceedings were disrupted by the strike.\n\nThe Clerk of the state House of Assembly, Mr. Ego Maikeffi, also said 15 bills were not passed into law by the legislature as a result of the parliamentary workers\u2019 strike.\n\nIn Bauchi State, the Chairman, House Committee on Information, Hon. Garzali Wunti, said the lawmakers had only four bills pending, which would have been considered and passed if not for the parliamentary staff strike.\n\nIn Taraba State, the Chairman, House Committee on Information, Mr. Bashir Bape, who represents Nguroje State Constituency, told THISDAY that some bills that were at various stages of passage were affected by the industrial action.\n\nIn Katsina, the Chief Registrar of the state High Court, Mr. Kabir Shu\u2019aibu, told THISDAY that there were over 100,000 outstanding cases, whose proceedings were stalled as a result of the strike.\n\nShu\u2019aibu, in an exclusive interview with THISDAY, said Sharia and magistrate\u2019s courts had the highest number of pending cases.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have over 100,000 pending cases because of the strike. Sharia and magistrate\u2019s courts are the courts with the highest number of these outstanding cases. The police have even called us that they have about 400 inmates and that some of the inmates were dying in their cells because of the congestion during the strike.\u201d\n\nThe spokesman for the Kano State High courts, Mr. Baba Jibo, told THISDAY that he could not tell the number of pending cases since they were still been compiled.\n\nChairman, Plateau State House of Assembly Committee on Information, Hon. Peter Dasun, said a backlog of bills and motions were stalled but added that he could not give an exact figure.\n\nAlso speaking to THISDAY, the Chief Registrar of Jos High Court, Hon Ladi Madaki, said the judges were currently \u2018calling over\u2019 cases that should have been heard during the strike, and assigning them new dates.\n\nAccording to her, there is a timing for filing of cases, and defaulters are expected to pay default fees, but the state chief judge has issued a circular that default fees should not apply between April 2021 and June 15 when the courts opened to avoid burden on litigants and their counsel.\n\nShe feared that judges\u2019 annual vacation, which begins by July ending and will last through August, may further constitute a delay, but said it was statutory for judges in superior courts.\n\nBut Plateau State NBA chairman, Mr. Yakubu Bawa, said his association was already meeting the state Chief Judge, Justice Yakubu Dakwak, to appeal to the judges not to go on the six-week annual vacation.\n\nIn Lagos State, the strike had minimal effect on the workings of the state House of Assembly as it carried on its business normally.\n\nWithin the period, the assembly suspended six local government and development councils\u2019 chairmen for breaching rules and regulations guiding the operations of council areas.\n\nIt also approved the executive branch\u2019s request for the purchase of operational vehicles for ministerial and extra-ministerial departments.\n\nHowever, the same cannot be said of the judiciary where all activities were crippled throughout the strike.\n\nFollowing the resolution of the strike, a memo was sent to all heads of department and registrars of court by the state Chief Judge, Justice Kazeem Alogba, waiving default fees in the state from April 6 to June 14, 2021.\n\nIn Niger State, the House of Assembly is now in a dilemma over how to comply with Section 104 of the constitution, which provides that Houses of Assembly should sit for 181 days in a legislative year.\n\nThe Clerk of the House, Alhaji Abdullahi Kagara, confirmed that the assembly is thinking about how it will solve the constitutional crisis the strike has plunged it into, as a result of its inability to meet for the number of days it should sit in a legislative year.\n\nKagara said: \u201cThis is a problem we are trying to solve but since it is not deliberate and it is a national issue, we will get over it.\u201d\n\nIn Ondo State, efforts to ascertain the number of cases stalled by the strike from the Chief Judge, Justice Oluwatoyin Akeredolu, was unsuccessful.\n\nSpeaking with THISDAY, the Chairman of the House of Assembly Committee on Information, Hon Gbenga Omole, said the passage of three important bills were stalled.\n\nHe said: \u201cAnti-Open Grazing Bill; Violence Against Persons Prohibition Bill; and the Public Fund Committee Bill of the Judiciary and Legislative Autonomy were stalled by the strike.\n\n\u201cApart from these three bills, there are other bills at different stages of debate and legislative actions, which were affected by the strike.\u201d\n\nIn Cross State House of Assembly, the Cross River State Mining and Quarrying Bill (2020) is the only outstanding Bill whose passage was stalled by the strike.\n\nSpeaking with THISDAY, the Clerk of the Abia State House of Assembly, Sir John-Pedro Irokansi, said that with offices shut down, it was impossible for legislative activities to continue during the strike.\n\nFor Imo State House of Assembly, the Chairman, House Committee on Information, Hon. Johnson Duru (representing Ideato South State Constituency), told THISDAY on the telephone that the activities of the house was not badly affected by the strike.\n\nHe stated that members were meeting at the official quarters of the Speaker, Hon. Paul Emezim, which is a public building in line with the rules of the House of Assembly, to deliberate on matters concerning the smooth running of the state.\n\nSpeaking yesterday, the spokesman of the Osun State House of Assembly, Mr. Kunle Alabi, told THISDAY that the state legislature used the period of the strike to increase its oversight functions since the assembly complex was shut.\n\nBut the state Commissioner for Justice, Mr. Femi Akande, said the strike stalled all court proceedings in cases as far as hearing of both substantive and interlocutory matters were concerned.\n\nThe Director of Public Prosecution (DPP) in Kwara State, Alhaji Mumin Jimoh (SAN), told THISDAY that thousands of cases that were supposed to be adjudicated upon at the various courts in the state were affected.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Initiative to help Nigeria conserve forex\n\nChinedu Eze\n\nAs part of efforts to end the huge capital flight spent on maintenance of aircraft overseas put at $2 billion annually, some operators in the aviation industry and the Akwa Ibom State government have taken steps towards developing maintenance facilities in Nigeria.\n\nIn the last four years, the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) has given Aircraft Maintenance Organisation (AMO) certificates to Aero Contractors, 7-Star Global Hangers Limited, and Overland Airways for the maintenance of ATR aircraft in addition to the certification given to Execujet, a global maintenance organisation for executive jets.\n\nAlso, by early next year, the Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) facility being built in Uyo by Akwa Ibom State government will come on stream, while the Chairman and CEO of Air Peace, Mr. Allen Onyema, has announced that the airline has completed plans to set up an MRO facility in Nigeria for the maintenance of its fleet and others.\n\nOwing to these, industry experts said the move would end the huge resources spent overseas in the maintenance of aircraft, which is the highest operations cost to airlines after aviation fuel by Nigerian carriers and others.\n\nThe maintenance facilities would, in turn, be a source of forex earner for the country as airlines and aircraft owners in Africa and beyond could maintain their equipment in Nigeria.\n\nThe Head of Engineering and Maintenance of Ibom Air, Mr. Lookman Animaseun, told THISDAY in a telephone interview yesterday that it was good that the NCAA was licensing MRO organisations in Nigeria to save the country about $2 billion spent on aircraft maintenance overseas every year.\n\nAnimaseun said besides the Nigerian market, airline operators in West and Central Africa would also bring their aircraft to be maintained in Nigeria, which would attract forex to the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is good that NCAA is licensing MROs. This is good for Nigeria. We also expect the MRO organisations to reciprocate and properly equip their facilities. I do not have any doubt that we can accomplish that.\n\n\u201cThere is huge market for the facilities in West, Central and other parts of the continent and beyond. It makes me happy that the owners of these maintenance facilities have a good purpose. It is people we know their background and we have interacted with.\n\n\u201cThese facilities will be saving Nigeria $2 billion annually if properly harnessed. We shall have more of the facilities by the time Akwa Ibom completes its own early next year.\n\n\u201cWhat makes me happy is that there is a huge market for these maintenance facilities. Aero Contractors, which has maintenance facility, cannot cope with the demand anymore. It should look for a place to expand its hangar. The company needs to up its game to match to what the industry is looking up to now.\u201d\n\nIndustry expert, Captain Ado Sanusi, told THISDAY that the MRO business is a good one. \u201cBut before investors go into it, they should do their commercial evaluation, looking at the manpower, the clientele and the skills so that their operations would be profitable,\u201d he advised.\n\nOn the market for the MRO facilities in Nigeria, the Managing Director of Aero Contractors, Captain Mahmood Abdullahi, said Aero Contractors had been having third party aircraft (from other airlines) for maintenance and they were not coming from Nigeria alone.\n\n\u201cYou can see a lot of third party aircraft are here in the hangar. It is not only Nigerian airlines. There is the Democratic Republic of Congo, they have their Boeing 737 here and we have already signed with the Ghana Civil Aviation and they have given us the approval to maintain aircraft registered in Ghana.\n\n\u201cAnd so, we have an agreement with Passion Air in Ghana. So is Tunisia, they are working on it to get their approval and then Malta also, we are working on it to get their approval. Yes, we are working on all those approvals; once we have those approvals we will maintain aircraft registered in those countries in our facility here,\u201d Mahmood said.\n\nHe also spoke about the cost of taking aircraft overseas for maintenance, saying: \u201cI think there are so many disadvantages to taking your aircraft out of the country for maintenance. If you talk about how much it is going to cost an airline to fly its aircraft from Nigeria, to probably Europe, or wherever it is going to, if you talk about the fuel that they would burn to go, navigational charges paid, the aircraft goes there, and then fly it back again.\n\n\u201cAll these costs are saved by having an MRO here. We have saved the airlines such huge costs. Then, if you come to the maintenance aspect, you are talking about the labour. If they go there, they pay for man-hour in dollars, but here we charge them the man-hour in naira. So it is easy for them if they cannot access the forex, at least we are giving them an opportunity to pay naira here.\u201d\n\nOnyema decried the huge costs the airline incurs maintaining its aircraft overseas, saying that the company has completed plans to establish a maintenance hangar in Nigeria.\n\nHe explained: \u201cThe establishment of a veritable MRO is long overdue. You don\u2019t want to know the amount of capital flight, monies that could have been used for other things in our nation is going abroad. Let me give you an example, at the last count, as at two weeks ago, Air Peace has 21 planes out of this country. You don\u2019t want to know the amount we are spending on those planes.\n\n\u201cWe are at the mercy of these MRO owners overseas and you and I know the way they stigmatise us and everything in Nigeria. So you expend a lot of money taking these planes abroad. We need to have our MROs here. The good thing about having MRO is that you are not only going to be maintaining your own fleet, other Nigerians will come there, the whole of Africa will come here. Aviation is the same worldwide.\n\n\u201cOnce you have EASA (European Union Aviation Safety Agency) approval for your MRO, you have FAA (US Federal Aviation Administration) approval for your MRO, NCAA approval and you have other civil aviation authorities\u2019 approval, the whole world will be coming here. And that will be capital influx, not the ones (forex) flying out of Nigeria. So it will help. Yes, Air Peace is ready, we have acquired the land, we are ready to give this country a maintenance repair and overhaul facility that Africa will be proud of.\u201d\n\nRecently NCAA granted 7Star Global Hangar Ltd, AMO certificate to operate an all-inclusive Maintenance Repair and Overhaul facility.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

So some economists say wait until you gather the money, that\u2019s bad economics,\u201d the minister said.\n\nWhile pointing out that many developed countries created super economies through borrowing, Fashola said that the recent loans obtained by the Federal Government would not mortgage the future of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe came from a background of colonialism where we were told that if you go borrowing, you go sorrowing, so, my parents and their generation told us never to borrow.\n\n\u201cBut while we were not borrowing, those who laid the rules started borrowing.\n\n\u201cThe largest debtors in the world today are from the West. But with borrowing they have created super economies, built massive train terminals, massive airports, schools and hospitals.\n\n\u201cAnd you know what is happening, we go to use them and they charge us, so who is paying?\n\n\u201cI have heard people say they are mortgaging the future of people, as we are holding this meeting, one new baby has arrived, if you don\u2019t prepare for him you make that future bleak.\n\n\u201cAs at the time we were building Lekki Bridge in Lagos, it was N29 billion, the child that was born then in 2010 is going to be 11 this year.\n\n\u201cIf his mother carrying his pregnancy had crossed that bridge at any time, he used that bridge before he was born and we had secured that asset for him before he arrived.\n\n\u201cIf we wait until he is about 30 to build that bridge, we can\u2019t buy it at N29 billion anymore.\n\n\u201cSo, if he contributes to paying it so be it because he started using it before he even arrived.\n\n\u201cSo, those who said don\u2019t borrow have changed their minds, they have set parameters of debt to GDP and within those parameters you play very well.\n\n\u201cAnd those who say so now, where were they in 2005 or 2006 when the government paid out $12 billion in cash to go and buy a tent when the house is flooding, who does that?\n\n\u201cThey took $12 billion in cash to go and write off debts that had been classified.\n\n\u201cThe roads were bad then, the rail was not built, airports needed expansion, Lagos-Ibadan (Expressway) needed to be built.\n\n\u201cBut since the aftermath of going to write off that debt we started borrowing again, so this administration did inherit all the debt.\n\n\u201cThere is a sector of our economy called the financial services sector, if all of us put money in a bank and nobody is borrowing, that bank is going to fold up.\n\n\u201cSo, if you have anybody in any venture capital, finance house, mortgage bank, it is because the government is borrowing that they can pay their salary.\n\n\u201cBorrowing is not a sin, it is part of the essence of keeping the economy growing and the armchair economists talking about public expenditure for example who have never run a government must be careful what they feed to the public,\u201d Fashola added.",

          "text": "The Buhari administration has stepped up efforts to regulate the online media in Nigeria in what is seen by many as attempts to further stifle the civic space in the country.\n\nTwo weeks after blocking Twitter\u2019s operations, the federal government has asked the House of Representatives to enact a law that will empower the Nigerian Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to control all forms of internet broadcasting and social media.\n\nThe request was made on Wednesday by the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, during a public hearing organised by the house committee on information, national orientation, ethics, and values on a bill to amend the NBC Act.\n\nThe commission already controls television and radio broadcasting in Nigeria, based on provisions in Section 2(b) of the NBC Act. It states that \u201cthe Commission shall have [the] responsibility of receiving, processing and considering applications for the establishment, ownership or operation of radio and television stations including cable television services, direct satellite broadcast and any other medium of broadcasting.\u201d\n\nLai Mohammed now wants the commission to also regulate the online media, in addition to other channels of broadcasting. \u201cI want to add here specifically that internet broadcasting and all online media should be included in this because we have a responsibility to monitor contents, including Twitter,\u201d the minister told lawmakers.\n\nBefore Lai Mohammed\u2019s proposal, the broadcasting regulator had asked all social media platforms and service providers in the online broadcasting space in Nigeria to apply for a broadcast licence.\n\nPossible clampdown on freedom of expression\n\nWidespread criticism has trailed the proposal by the Nigerian government, which has only further stoked concerns over a possible clampdown on free speech and internet freedom by the Buhari administration.\n\nMedia stakeholders at the public hearing kicked against the inclusion of online media under NBC\u2019s mandate, asking the panel to instead make the commission more independent of the Minister of Information.\n\nOver time, the NBC has acted as an extension of the Ministry of Information and Culture, which rarely acts independently, and thus, the commission\u2019s operations have often been subject to political interference. This was condemned by the International Press Centre (IPC) and the Centre for Media Law and Advocacy in a joint statement that called for the neutrality of the commission.\n\nAccording to Akin Akingbulu, executive director of the Institute for Media and Society, the commission should not receive directives from the information minister. \u201cThe power to give directives to the commission, vested in the minister of information in section 6 should be removed and replaced with powers which include policy formulation for the broadcasting sector.\u201d\n\n\u201cSocial media bill through the backdoor\u201d\n\nDespite the ban on Twitter, Nigerians continue to use the platform thanks to virtual private networks (VPNs) that help bypass the suspension. Many have taken to Twitter to express criticism over the proposed regulation of online media.\n\nBREAKING: NBC Amendment Bill Is Social Media Bill Through The Backdoor \u2014 SERAP (@SERAPNigeria) June 17, 2021\n\nAmendment of the NBC act;grafting the shoot of autocracy. \u2014 Senator Shehu Sani (@ShehuSani) June 17, 2021\n\nNigeria Govt is asking House of Reps to amend the NBC Act and include \u201cinternet broadcasting\u201d.\n\n\n\nThat means all online radio/TV stations must register with NBC and Lai Mohammed. This is social media censorship brought back through the back door.\n\n\n\nLend your voice. Say no.

          "text": "Facebook, this week, said it has removed fake accounts, pages and groups that posted about news and politics ahead of Ethiopia\u2019s general election scheduled to hold next week.\n\nIn a statement published on its website, the social media giant reportedly took down 65 Facebook profiles, 52 pages, 27 groups and 32 Instagram accounts for violating its rules against misleading others about their purpose and identity.\n\nThe fake accounts mainly posted in Amharic about topics that include the Prosperity Party and Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. They also criticised opposition politicians and groups in Ethiopia, such as the Oromo Liberation Front, Ethiopian Democratic Party, and the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front.\n\n\u201cThe people behind this activity coordinated with one another and used fake accounts as a central part of their operations to mislead people about who they are and what they are doing, and that was the basis for our action,\u201d Facebook said.\n\nAccording to the company\u2019s head of security policy, Nathaniel Gleicher, the fake accounts posted the same content across multiple pages and groups to grow their following, and targeted domestic audiences in its own country.\n\nRoughly 1.1 million accounts followed one or more of the Facebook pages, about 766,000 accounts joined one or more of the groups, and around 1,700 people followed one or more of the Instagram accounts.\n\n\u201cGiven the upcoming election and the ongoing tensions in Ethiopia, our teams moved as quickly as possible to complete the investigation and disrupt this operation,\u201d Gleicher said.\n\nFacebook also linked the fake accounts to individuals associated with the Information Network Security Agency (INSA) in Ethiopia.\n\nA brutal war erupted in the country\u2019s Tigray region after which the United States restricted visas for government and military officials of Ethiopia and Eritrea over allegations of human rights violations.\n\nPro-government demonstrators in Ethiopia had criticised the move by Washington and Gleicher added that the fake accounts were critical of the sanctions as well. Although they did not directly focus on the conflict in Tigray.\n\nFacebook\u2019s move comes after severe criticism it has faced in the past for not doing enough to tackle fake accounts during national elections, including in the U.S. The social network has outlined plans in preparation for the Ethiopia vote, including ways to combat misinformation and hate speech.\n\nThe June 21 general elections will see Ethiopians elect members of the House of Peoples\u2019 Representatives.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Netflix on Sunday, June 13, commenced its first 3-month Episodic Lab (EPL) and Development Executive Traineeship (DET) programmes in Africa. This is in partnership with the Realness Institute, a South Africa-based Centre for African film-makers.\n\nOver 500 applications were received from Nigeria, Kenya, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe for the inaugural development lab for African writers and DET initiatives. However, only twelve professionals were selected to take part in both trainings.\n\nTwo Nigerians, Ayoade Adeyanju and Kehinde Joseph, selected to take part in EPL based on their story ideas, will get to develop their concepts with help from expert story consultants and creative producers. Other participants are Andile Ngcizela, Dominique Jossie and Kudakwashe Maradzika from South Africa and Mary Waireri from Kenya.\n\nThe lab participants will receive about $2,000 monthly stipend to enable them to focus entirely on their training, which will run remotely till September 5, 2021. At the end of the lab, each writer will have an opportunity to pitch their incubated concept to Netflix and could see their series further developed for production.\n\nMeanwhile, Ololade Okedare is the only Nigerian selected to participate in the DET, in addition to South Africans Anneke Villet, Antionette Engel and Thandeka Zwane, Damaris Irungu Ochieng\u2019 from Kenya and Lara Sousa, a Mozambican.\n\nThe executive trainees will get to immerse themselves in the story development process and receive technical training by partnering with the EPL writers to develop story concepts into quality productions.\n\nImproving storytelling in Africa\n\nThe Netflix programme is being held to strengthen the foundation of quality storytelling in Africa and is part of efforts by the global streaming giant to produce more original local content from creative writers on the continent.\n\n\u201cWithout the existence of our storytellers, our favourite Netflix stories wouldn\u2019t be possible,\u201d Alison Triegaardt, Netflix manager for Grow Creative in Africa, said. \u201cAfrica has an amazing pool of talent \u2013 both in front and behind the camera \u2013 hence Netflix is committed to investing in African stories and talent long-term.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, a 5-day workshop focusing on post-production organised by Netflix is scheduled to be held later this month. The APost Lab is aimed at training film & television professionals from across Africa on technical best practices, technical and creative support methods, and methods to facilitate the best creative process.\n\nThirty-two participants have been invited to participate in the workshops while more than 100 film & TV professionals from across the continent will be part of the Masterclasses.\n\nPotential boost to subscriber base\n\nIn addition to improving quality storytelling in Africa, Netflix would most likely be looking to grow its relatively small subscriber base in the region by producing more relatable, original local content with the help of the development lab.\n\nAccording to a Digital TV Research study, Netflix currently has about 2 million subscribers in Africa, which is half of the continent\u2019s total streaming subscriber base.\n\nThere is a chance having more relatable original African content could lure more viewers on the continent to use the streaming service particularly as the London-based industry researcher estimates streaming subscriptions in Africa will reach 13 million by 2025, up from over 3.9 million in 2020.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re energised and excited by the many opportunities that lie ahead for us to help strengthen the quality of African storytelling and to bring fresh voices to our members in Africa and around the world\u201d, Triegaardt concluded.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Kiishu* was still running her undergraduate course when she decided to explore other parts of the country for her six-month internship program. Miles away from home in South-southern Nigeria, she was having an enjoyable learning experience, but with two months to go, she had an awful experience.\n\nShe was sexually assaulted by her host\u2019s friend, who visited, knowing his friend was away on a trip.\n\n\u201cIt was a cold and sad evening,\u201d she recounts, \u201cbut help came, albeit late.\u201d\n\nA trip to the police station provided no succour, even though they knew the culprit. She would eventually be bullied by the perpetrator\u2019s influential family to agree to arbitration outside court \u2014 presided over by her workplace\u2019s governing authority \u2014 with the culprit having only to sign an undertaking to stay away from her after admitting to the crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was hard, but I agreed to take it because I had a short time to spend there.\u201d\n\n\u201cBesides, neither my sponsors nor I could think of any other channel to get help.\u201d\n\nThat was in 2014.\n\nIt\u2019s 2021, but unfortunately, varying degrees of sexual offences are still perpetrated daily, with statistics confirming an increased incidence of the global crime. The United Nations (UN) affirms that the COVID-19-induced lockdowns in 2020 exposed vulnerable people to more risk of sexual violence.\n\nDespite the Nigerian Federal Government launching its first sexual offender register in November 2019, there were so many cases of sexual violence in 2020. Consequently, all 36 state governors declared a state of emergency on rape, agreed to set up a sex offender register, and sign laws to punish the crime.\n\nIn May 2021, Lagos State \u2014 one of the few with an active online sex offender register \u2014 disclosed that it added 206 names to its list of sexual offenders between 2020 and 2021.\n\nHighlighting existing response channels\n\nJust like Kiishu, most sexual assault survivors don\u2019t bother to report their experiences. Their overriding emotion is often fear that their complaints won\u2019t get the required attention, and they\u2019d either be blamed or stigmatised. There is also the possibility that the perpetrator would not be brought to book, further putting them in harm\u2019s way.\n\nHowever, the number of channels currently available to report such cases have increased compared to recent years. Victim support groups, activist movements, non-profit establishments, government-owned humanitarian agencies, and global organisations like the UN are just a few of the options available to victims.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cA friend introduced me to this support group that helped me talk about my experience. Even though it was years after the incident, I experienced closure and felt I could properly get justice if I wanted to,\u201d Kiishu relays.\n\nApart from support groups, there is the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP), a government-owned organisation that monitors trafficking and sexual-based violence cases.\n\nInterestingly, they have multiple channels \u2014 one of which I tried during my investigation \u2014 for receiving and addressing complaints.\n\nI called the conspicuously written toll-free number on the NAPTIP website and got through to a representative in less than 60 seconds; receiving a response redirecting me to the office closest to me took less than 120 seconds. While the response time was quick, I have no idea how long it would have taken to dispatch help to my location had I been in danger.\n\nThe Agency\u2019s impressive setup is the result of deliberate work done over time.\n\nMr Ganiu Aganran, NAPTIP Zonal Commander for Lagos State, who leads the Sexual and Gender-based Violence unit, tells Techpoint Africa that different tech-enabled channels have made it easier to access help.\n\n\u201cAt the headquarters, we have a 24-hour monitoring centre. When a call is put through, whatever is said is recorded and sent to the appropriate command that will handle it in real-time. We also receive SOS through the website and emails.\u201d\n\nThough he cannot speak to the number of reported cases and prosecuted offenders, he says that \u201cin the Lagos Zonal Command, sometimes, in a week, we have nothing less than 35 cases coming in, including those that come from sister law enforcement agencies through referrals.\u201d\n\nAganran says that social media has been a great tool, and with action taken to address the many cases reported on social platforms, his claim appears to be true.\n\nBetween March and June 2020, several campaigns aimed at getting justice for rape victims trended on social media.\n\nHowever, Aganran submits that the same channel is also responsible for the increasing cases of sexual violence and human trafficking.\n\nHe admits that the Agency would have been able to do more if it has more tools to work with. There are limitations apart from funding,\n\n\u201cThe issue of tracking could come in, but we do tracking through our partners, especially the DSS or the police. These are some of the law enforcement agencies that have this technology, which may not be available when we have to check the environment well to respond promptly.\u201d\n\nHowever, with relevant partnerships, he concludes that the agency can cover more ground.\n\nMore hands at work\n\nAganran attests that the Agency usually looks to partner with private organisations \u2014 for public awareness campaigns, information gathering, and referrals, among others \u2014 so it does not get overwhelmed.\n\n\u201cWe can never have it enough; there are challenges. The issue of logistics is key. You need to be able to move your victims when you rescue them. There are other things like going to court, going to arrest, and going for surveillance; all these demand a lot. But the truth is that working closely with partners, they also come to our aid.\u201d\n\nApart from NAPTIP partners, there are platforms operating in Nigeria that do the same thing.\n\nWhat survivors want: Enter WARIF\u2026\n\nWARIF Webpage\n\nFor obvious reasons, what a survivor wants is to be heard, cared for, and defended. The Women at Risk International Foundation (WARIF) is a non-profit organisation launched in 2016 to respond to and care for young girls and women who are victims of rape.\n\nThe Foundation\u2019s website serves as a channel for anonymous reporting, legal and health assistance, and evidence gathering for the police. It also has a feature that allows survivors to have virtual group therapy.\n\nDuring the lockdown in 2020, it improved the platform\u2019s live chat feature and looked for cases on social media.\n\nGovernment-owned agencies also refer cases to WARIF\u2019s rape crisis centre. And Kemi DaSilva-Ibru, WARIF Founder, disclosed that the centre received up to 300 cases between March and April 2020 in Lagos State.\n\n\u2026 and Helpio app\n\nHelpio App About Page\n\nIn August 2020, Kano-based Android developer and women-in-tech advocate, Sa\u2019adat Aliyu, launched Helpio app, a platform for reporting sexual abuse cases in Nigeria.\n\nAvailable in both Hausa and English languages, users can sign up either as an emergency help centre, report anonymously, share a story, render legal assistance, or provide counselling.\n\nAliyu informs Techpoint Africa that she was inspired to build the platform during the lockdown to remove the hindrances to reporting cases of sexual and gender-based violence and get survivors closer to help.\n\nShe believes that many rape cases are unreported because of the associated stigma. History also plays a part as there are fewer cases of victims getting justice than perpetrators going scot-free.\n\nThis can be put down either to inadequate legal representation or poverty. However, there are non-governmental organisations set up solely to fight against SGBV, which provide financial, legal, medical, or even socio-psychological support to victims of sexual abuse.\n\nWithin the first ten months of launch, the platform already has support groups and certified organisations \u2014 for confidentiality \u2014 signed up to help with reported cases and emergency calls. And for cases requiring counselling, there are experts available for live chats.\n\nStill in its early stage, Aliyu says the platform undergoes regular changes to improve user experience. Subsequently, the platform will reflect real-time statistics of cases and include more localised languages.\n\nShe hopes to get more people to use the platform and render more help.\n\n\u201cThrough the app, over 50+ cases were reported, and the \u201ctalk to experts\u201d feature was among the most-used in the application.\u201d\n\nAganran explains that having recognised their reach, the government wants to take advantage of the opportunities created by platforms like WARIF and Helpio.\n\nWith more tech tools in place, there\u2019s no telling how many cases will be reported, and perpetrators brought to book.\n\nAganran believes that doing nothing isn\u2019t an option as everyone must intervene, show support, or help survivors get what they want.\n\n* \u2013 Not real name",

          "text": "Former Andela Community Manager, Babajide Duroshola, has stepped down as Safeboda\u2019s Country Director for Nigeria. Duroshola made this announcement today via his Twitter handle and in a Medium post.\n\nI came, I saw and conquered!!! https://t.co/vtdlgCWknP \u2014 Bab\u00e1j\u00edd\u00e9 D\u00far\u00f3sh\u1ecdl\u00e1 (@Babajiide) June 18, 2021\n\nDuroshola took over as Country Manager in 2019. This came after months of speculation regarding the Uganda-founded ride-hailing startup\u2019s launch in the country. During his tenure, the company introduced its finance offerings with users able to purchase airtime on the platform.\n\nThe startup initially announced plans to launch in Lagos following a Series B round, but that never happened. Although not the stated reason, the okada ban in Lagos meant that Safeboda had to launch in Ibadan, where ORide and MAX.ng were already present.\n\nThat decision seems to have paid off, with the company claiming to have completed 1.5 million trips and onboarded over 5,000 drivers. These appear to be impressive figures, especially when you consider that the startup said it had onboarded 2,500 riders and completed 1 million trips on the anniversary of its first year in operation.\n\nAt the time of its launch in Nigeria, there were predictions of bike-hailing wars with ORide and MAX.ng. However, in an interesting turn of events, as Safeboda launched in Ibadan, ORide exited the ride-hailing market.\n\nPerhaps to justify their decision to launch in Ibadan, Safeboda has regularly publicised the number of rides made on the platform. And with MAX.ng not doing the same, it is difficult to say if Safeboda is the dominant player in the ride-hailing industry.\n\nFounded in 2014 by Ricky Rapa Thompson, Maxime Dieudonne, and Alastair Sussock in Uganda, the startup soon spread to Kenya in 2018. However, by 2020, it announced that it was moving out of Kenya, having been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhile no announcements have been made regarding Duroshola\u2019s replacement, he hinted that the startup had found a replacement internally.",

          "text": "The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has announced plans to restructure the country\u2019s current licensing structure to bring it in line with global standards in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) ecosystem.\n\nThe current structure has served the industry for 18 years since its publication, and as NCC CEO, Umar Danbatta, says, it is due for an \u201curgent review\u201d.\n\nHe also set up a standing committee that would prepare reports and recommendations on existing licences, consultative fora, new licence undertakings, amendment to licence fees and durations, benchmarking of licences with similar jurisdictions, and the impact of certain licences on other licence holders.\n\nThe committee is also expected to recommend solutions and develop an updated regulatory framework for new and amended licences with a final report on the project with all recommendations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDanbatta, while inaugurating the committee, said the need for the review of the existing licence structure was informed by the wide range of technological advances and the convergence of technologies and services which have characterised the global telecoms space over the years, and whose impact is increasingly being experienced in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria\u2019s licence structure\n\nNigeria currently favours a two-category regime \u2014 individual and class \u2014 for general and specific services.\n\nClass licences have a flat fee of \u20a610,000 ($24.39), while individual licences are within the range of \u20a6250,000 ($609.76) and \u20a650,000,000 ($121,952.22).\n\nThere will be amendments to fees as the committee is expected to give recommendations based on a comparative analysis of countries with similar jurisdiction.\n\nIn comparison with Nigeria, South Africa also operates a two-category licence structure, but its fees are more expensive. For class licences, they have a flat fee of R13,721 ($971.73), and for individual licences, application costs are determined by the Information Technology Association (ITA).\n\nKenya also operates the same licence regime with prices ranging from Ksh 1000 ($9.28) to Ksh 15 million ($139,146.57).\n\nConsidering all that the committee has to deliberate on, we might see significant changes such as increased licencing fees based on fees in other African countries, new licences relating to 5G implementation, mobile virtual network operators, or over-the-top licences.\n\nGlobal ICT standards\n\nAccording to the International Telecommunication Union\u2019s (ITU) 2020 Global ICT Regulatory Outlook, Nigeria is a third-generation (G3) country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo put this in context, the ITU ranks countries into five generations using Regulatory Tracker indicators divided into four pillars: Regulatory Authority, Regulatory Mandate, Regulatory Regime and Competition Framework. The Regulatory Tracker is an evidence-based tool to help decision-makers and regulators make sense of the rapid evolution of ICT.\n\nWith an overall score of 78.3, Nigeria barely passes the benchmark above G2 countries where basic reform \u2014 partial liberalisation and privatisation across all layers \u2014 occurs.\n\nThe Ethiopian government\u2019s bid to sell off its stake in Ethio Telecom gives more clarity. Before the sale of its first private national telecoms licence to Safaricom\u2019s consortium, the country ranked as a G1 country \u2014 government-owned and controlled industry.\n\nAfter the sale, it was bumped up to a G2 country because the industry had been privatised.\n\nAs a G3 country, Nigeria\u2019s ICT ecosystem enables investment, innovation and access \u2014 dual focus on stimulating competition in service and content delivery, and consumer protection.\n\nKenya is the only African country to rank as a G5 country. According to ITU\u2019s ranking, the East African nation\u2019s ICT Regulatory Framework fosters vibrant markets and is also key to finding market solutions. It also means that Kenya\u2019s ICT regulator plays a leadership role.\n\nIt\u2019s been 18 years since the last licence review. In that time, we\u2019ve seen Glo\u2019s famous per second billing that blew the market wide open, competition leading to reduced \u2014 but still expensive \u2014 data prices, 4G coverage, MainOne\u2019s fiber cable\n\nWill the door be open to new players? Will a new entrant come to break MTN\u2019s dominance? We will have answers when the review is completed.\n\nWhile this move by the NCC shows progressiveness \u2014 especially in light of recent policy amendments \u2014 it appears there are still some ways to go before Nigeria attains global ICT standards.",

          "text": "Looking at where Nigeria is today, in terms of worsening insecurity, poverty, economic malaise, among other ills, many Nigerians are wondering what the state of the nation will look like in the next two years when the current administration is expected to come to an end.\n\nSome have described the next two years as an \u201ceternity\u201d, saying that to endure the \u201csuffocating air\u201d for the next two years would be the worst punishment for Nigerians.\n\nDuring the 2015 general election campaign, the then ruling party and the main opposition party promised Nigerians a lot of goodies.\n\nThe campaign afforded the then opposition the platform to blame the insecurity, economic woes, and every other problem in Nigeria on the failure of the then ruling party.\n\nBut as much as Nigerians quickly concluded that the messiah has come, they seemed to have never enjoyed any relief since the then opposition party came to power.\n\nFor many, the situation has degenerated from bad to worse in all fronts; from economy, social life, healthcare, and especially tackling insecurity, which many considered as reason the opposition won in 2015.\n\nInflation, unemployment rate, death rate, debt profile among other negative trends have more than quadrupled in the last six years of this administration and the remaining two years may likely make no difference.\n\n\u201cIt is no longer Boko Haram and North East. Now bandits, kidnapers, and herdsmen have taken the war to all parts of the country. There are killings every day and the government, which promised to tackle insecurity keeps doing little or nothing to tackle it,\u201d Yohanna Bulus, a lawyer and an aggrieved indigene of Borno State, decried.\n\n\u201cHow can Boko Haram hoist its flag in Nigeria and nothing is happening, government negotiates ransom with bandits and kidnapers take a whole school or town hostage without challenge. Nigeria is in a war situation now,\u201d Bulus observed.\n\nFor the Lagos-based maritime lawyer, the country is fast drifting apart and the principals and political actors are not keen on saving the situation because it is going according to their long-hatched plans.\n\n\u201cIf government wants to calm the situation and restore peace across the country, it will do it. But it does not want for obvious reasons; instead, it is threatening to roll out tanks in some parts of the country. You heard what they reeled out as achievements since gaining power; in sincerity, have there been achievements in a country where government is witnessing ethnic cleansing and wanton killings every day and keep silent? For me, safeguarding the lives of the citizens is far better achievement, which this administration has failed to do\u201d, Terhumba Tor, a senior lecturer at a federal university said.\n\nFor him, the principles of democracy and ideals of civil living are not upheld by the present administration and Nigerians are not expecting any positive change in the remaking two years of the present administration.\n\nOkwui Duruike, director, Centre for African Leadership Ideals, an Abuja-based African economy and politics research outfit, which has relocated to Cotonou in Benin Republic, noted that Nigerians should not expect miracle in the remaining two years of this administration as the country has been falling in development, human right and democracy indices in the last five years.\n\n\u201cWe have conducted several researches on development, good governance and security in collaboration with international agencies across 30 African countries. Nigeria is among the worst in Africa, while Ghana, Seychelles and Gaborone are leading across many fronts. The Nigerian case is lack of will power by government to tackle insecurity, enforce necessary actions, restore peace, woo back investors and boost the economy. Stability of a country and economic development go hand in hand but that will not happen in the remaining two years,\u201d Duruike said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIn one of our reports on the worsening insecurity, we advised one of our foreign partners to inform the Nigerian government that all they needed was sincerity of purpose, boosting morale of its security operatives, fishing out sabotage, working with locals and collaboration with foreign governments.\u201d\n\nConsidering the huge damage done across the country due to the inaction of government, Tor thinks that two years will not be enough to rebuild the country.\n\n\u201cWhere do you want to start, or what are you going to promise that has never been promised in the past. I don\u2019t expect any relief in the remaining two years of this administration because the thousands killed will not come back, houses burnt, farms destroyed and hopes dashed cannot be restored. I expect the worst in two years,\u201d Tor said.\n\nFor Bulus, the change we desire cannot come now or within the remaining two years because the recent actions of this administration point to a people that are running against time.\n\n\u201cThis is six years after taking over from Goodluck Jonathan, who was regarded by many as a weakling. One former governor of Lagos State even said during campaign that a serious government will fix electricity issue in one year. So, they have been there for six years now and the trouble is quadrupling, so where is their magic wand?\u201d Bulus asked.\n\nOn his part, Ademola Fadahunsi, a political analyst, noted that though South West is clamoring to take over from President Buhari in 2023, the damage done so far is huge and will take almost the whole tenure of an incoming president to restore.\n\n\u201cIt is sad that we don\u2019t value human lives again. The killing is much, the country is soaked in blood and no matter how much infrastructure you put in place, you need living humans, peaceful country and stability for such infrastructure to be meaningful. They flagged off Lagos-Ibadan rail, but Abuja-Kaduna rail is besieged by bandits. Why not tackle insecurity first before investment that is already threatened by current realities in the country?\u201d Fadahunsi said.\n\nHowever, observers note that insecurity is the biggest issue in the country today and that every effort of this administration should be channeled to address it. Yet, they don\u2019t see any difference in the current situation within the remaining two years of this administration.\n\n\u201cYou cannot fool Nigerians by promising them a quick fix of insecurity in two years when since Jonathan\u2019s tenure, the country has been spending on security without result. We have witnessed change of security chiefs and increased budgets on security, yet no result. It will definitely get worse in the remaining two years of Buhari,\u201d Angwe Yakubu, a retired senior security personnel, said.\n\nSpeaking further, the Shamdam Plateau State-born retiree and now poultry farmer, said the fight against insecurity does not require huge spending on heavy armament, but will power and sincerity on the part of government, better treatment for soldiers, welfare for families of dead soldiers, empowerment of locals and collaboration with foreign countries to win.\n\nDon\u2019t listen to rhetoric that Boko Haram and bandits carry more sophisticated weapons. Can\u2019t such weapons be bought by Nigeria? All we need is sincerity of government to fight these terrorists, military to fight sabotage in its midst, locals to help with useful information and foreign partners to be given required information and free hand to work,\u201d Yakubu said.\n\nAccording to him, this is the only way the remaining two years of this administration will make a difference, but he does not see them toeing the solution line.\n\nTunde Daramola, a politician, is not optimistic about a turnaround in the next two years.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe ship of the state has been grounded by the present administration of Muhammadu Buhari. The first responsibility of a reasonable government is the security of lives and property. Presently, no Nigerian is safe; people are scared to go out and work or even travel. This APC- led government is a failure.\u201d\n\nAccording to Daramola, \u201cThe President is clueless on providing security for Nigerians not to talk of foreigners. No foreigner would come into Nigeria and invest with the level of insecurity today.\n\n\u201cNobody is happy and Nigerians are disappointed. It is a shame. I think the situation will get worse before 2023, or is it not getting even worse? Is the sign not there?\u201d\n\nBe believes that \u201cThis government appears overwhelmed with the situation; even the President confirmed it in the interview. I think these terrorists have some form of support, or how would you explain the situation now in the North where terrorists write letters to a community and come the same day to carry out an operation without any form of resistance?\n\n\u201cNigerians want this government to end today, not even tomorrow or 2023. Except for divine intervention, I don\u2019t see the situation improving. On the way forward, I am of the view that the President should urgently seek foreign help and intervention since he has admitted that the situation has overwhelmed him.\u201d\n\nAdelaja Adeoye, a political analyst, said there was nothing more to expect from Buhari\u2019s remaining two years than what Nigerians have experienced in the last six years.\n\n\u201cThe government has lost touch with the people and they are even sinking deeper with their attempt to stifle media and social media. It is only when a government feels terribly defeated due to bad governance that they tend to clamp down on media and other forms of communication used by citizens to express their displeasure,\u201d Adeoye said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe level of insecurity is getting worse by the day, as you can see; another set of students has just been kidnapped in the Northern Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is worrisome that people are now hired to welcome or protest in favour of Buhari; a truly performing government will not hire people; this goes to show that Buhari is not popular among Nigerians.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is left for the government to review its actions and activities or continue to allow citizens to suffer, first time ever where Nigerians now buy yam pieces due to food inflation and increased poverty rate,\u201d he added.",

          "title": "Is Nigerian Senate playing politics with PIB, Electoral Act and Constitutional Amendment?",
          "text": "On Wednesday, June 9, 2021, the 9th Senate had a special session to celebrate its anniversary. The occasion afforded the senators the opportunity to sing their praises and what they said they have been able to achieve individually and collectively within the last two years.\n\nDespite being seen as a \u2018rubber stamp\u2019 Senate, one acclaimed major achievement of the 9th Senate was the interventions in restoration of the national annual budget to the January-December cycle.\n\nAnalysts have said the measure has made the nation\u2019s fiscal plans more predictable and boosted the confidence of local and foreign investors in the economy.\n\nThe federal lawmakers also mentioned the passage of the Deep Off-Shore and Inland Basin Production Sharing Contracts Act CAP D3 LFN 2004 (Amendment Bill, 2009). The senators passed the important law to increase Nigeria\u2019s share of revenue from its crude oil.\n\nFor ease of doing business, the Finance Bill 2019 (Nigeria Tax and Fiscal Law) (SB.140), which amended seven existing tax laws and Companies and Allied Matters Act, Cap C20 LFN 2004 (Repeal and Reenactment) Bill 2019 (SB.270) were also passed by the lawmakers.\n\nHowever, the current Senate headed by Ahmad Lawan has not gained the confidence of majority of Nigerians, who have continued to criticise the upper chamber and indeed the National Assembly of always doing the bidding of the executive, thus ignoring proper oversight and legislation.\n\nHaving learnt their lessons from the frosty relationship that played out between the executive and legislative in the 8th Senate, President Muhammadu Buhari and the leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) had to ensure that someone loyal to the president and the ruling party emerged as the President of the Senate. So, the emergence of Senator Ahmad Lawan from Yobe North Senatorial District and Ovie Omo-Agege from Delta Central Senatorial District as president and deputy Senate president, respectively, was largely seen as mission accomplished.\n\nThe usual bickering commonly displayed by both arms of government and the rejection of Mr. President\u2019s nominees in the 8th Senate led by Senator Abubakar Bukola Saraki has since been buried. Two years in the life of the current Senate, the relationship between the executive and legislature has been cordial.\n\nUnlike the 9th Senate, the 8th Senate always did their due diligence and oversight before passing anything from the executive, be it a bill or confirmation of a nominee(s). For instance, one case that stood out and has continued to be applauded by Nigerians was the rejection of Ibrahim Magu as the substantive Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). He was rejected by the lawmakers on two different occasions based on a security report against his nominee from the State Security Service (SSS).\n\nSimilarly, the $30 billion loan request of the president to the 8th Senate was also rejected to save the country from sinking deeper into indebtedness. In his letter, Buhari explained that the amount was Federal Government\u2019s 2016 to 2018 external borrowing plan meant to execute key infrastructural projects cutting across all sectors with special emphasis on infrastructure, agriculture, health, education, water supply, growth and employment generation.\n\nBut the Senate Committee Chairman on Loan and Foreign Debt in the 8TH Senate, Shehu Sani, explained that they rejected the loan request from Muhammadu Buhari to save Nigeria from \u201csinking into the dark gully of a perpetual debt trap.\u201d\n\nHe further argued that the lawmakers did not want the country to be re-colonised by creditor banks.\n\nUnfortunately, it is no longer the case under the current leadership as majority of the senators, especially in APC, are hitherto seen as willing tools in the hands of the President.\n\nAs a way of returning back the favour done to him,November 2019, expressedwillingness to approve all requests that come to the Senate from President Muhammadu Buhari when the Chairman, Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption, ItseSagay (SAN), paid him a courtesy visit in Abuja.\n\nHe quickly backed up the statement by saying that \u201cany request that comes from Buhari is good for the nation and the Senate will take immediate action on them.\u201d\n\nHe further said: \u201cI want to assure you that any request that comes from Mr. President is a request that will make Nigeria a better place in terms of appointments or legislation and the Senate will act expeditiously to ensure that we play our part in the confirmation or passing of legislation appropriately.\u201d\n\nTherefore, it did not come as a surprise when the President\u2019s $30bn loan request was approved by the Lawan-led Senate. Additionally, in April 2021, the Senate approved the sum of $1.5bn and \u20ac995 million external borrowings for the Federal Government.\n\nThe loans were part of the $5.5 billion and \u20ac995 million external borrowings Buhari had, in May 2020, asked the Red Chamber to approve to finance various priority projects of the Federal Government and to support the state governments facing fiscal challenges.\n\nAgain, the Senate on June 1, 2021 referred President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s loan request to borrow N2.343 trillion from external source to the Committee on Local and Foreign Debt.\n\nBesides, on May 18, 2021, Buhari had sought the approval of the Senate to borrow a fresh N2.343 trillion ($6.18bn) external loan. The committee was subsequently mandated to look into the request of the President on Donor Fund Projects under the 2018-2020 Federal Government External Borrowing (Rolling) Plan and submit its report within two weeks.\n\nMore worrisome is the fact that the 9th Senate has not been able to pass the much-awaited Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) despite assurances of early passage.\n\nThe bill was passed into second reading in October 2020 and in January 2021, there was a public hearing on it where the President of the Senate said by May 2021, they would pass the bill. But sadly, that has not been the case. He has back-tracked to say that the PIB will now be passed by June 2021 as both committees in the upper and lower chambers are now writing the final report.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe National Assembly was to pass the PIB in May, however, there was need to put in place a legislative framework to further encourage foreign investments and development in the industry.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, I think they (Joint Committee of the two chambers of the National Assembly on PIB) are about to start writing the report, which they will lay before the two chambers of the National Assembly, probably by the middle of June.\u201d\n\nIt is indeed a sad commentary that a bill of such nature, capable of entrenching transparency and accountability in the oil sector, has not been pass into law after about 20 years it was first. introduced.\n\nNonetheless, the Electoral Act Amendment bill is one bill Nigerians are calling the 9th Senate to also expedite action on in view of the 2023 general election. In fact, INEC, Civil Society Organisations (CSOs), Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), political parties, the media and other stakeholders have been voicing out, even protesting on the need to pass and sign the bill into law.\n\nAs violence and all manner of rigging have continued to blight the electoral process, the passage and signing of the bill into law now becomes imperative in view of the Anambra gubernatorial election coming up on November 6, 2021.\n\nLawan has again promised Nigerians that the Electoral Act Amendment bill and the Constitutional Amendment bill will the passed by mid July 2021 before going on recess.\n\nThe lawmakers are currently on a two-week break and will resume on June 22, 2021. Therefore, between June 22 and July 15, 2021 when they are expected to go on their summer break, the question is: can they pass these bills within 23 days?\n\nSpeaking on an interview session on Channels Television Sunrise Daily, Friday, June 18, 2021, AjibolaBashiru, Chairman, Senate Committee on Media and Public Affairs, expressed the optimism that the PIB, Constitutional Amendment Bill and Electoral Act Bill would be passed before the legislators proceed on their summer break.\n\n\u201cI am particularly optimistic that we will meet the expectation of Nigerians,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 109 senators should bear in mind that history bacons on them at this critical time to always do the right thing by enacting and passing laws that would stand the text of time.\n\nIn their oversight function, they must carry out thorough screening and confirm only qualified nominees of Mr. President, and not all manner of persons sent to them just to please the Presidency.\n\nThey should serve Nigeria and Nigerians as their priority, not sycophantic allegiance to the President, to the detriment of the country.",

          "text": "BY Ejike Ejike, Abuja\n\nAdvertisements\n\n\n\n\n\nDirector general of Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety agency (NIMASA), Dr Bashir Jamoh, has expressed worry over the persisting War Risk Insurance on Nigerian bound cargoes, calling for its removal.\n\nThis is coming on the heels of the falling piracy incidence in the Nigerian waters and the Gulf of Guinea since February when the Nigeria Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) deployed the Integrated National Security and Waterways Protection Infrastructure popularly known as the Deep Blue Project,\n\nThis came as it has been disclosed that Nigeria\u2019s maritime trade is under threat due to the increasing war risk insurance premium now being paid by Nigeria-bound vessels.\n\nJamoh noted that though piracy in the Nigerian waters is waning, stakeholders in the industry are worried that offshore underwriting firms still insist on very high premium to be paid by those conveying cargoes to Nigeria.\n\nWar risk insurance is a type of insurance, which covers damage due to acts of war, including invasion, insurrection, rebellion and hijacking. Some policies also cover damage due to weapons of mass destruction. It is most commonly used in the shipping and aviation industries.\n\nAdvertisements\n\nIt generally has two components: War Risk Liability, which covers people and items inside the craft and is calculated based on the indemnity amount; and War Risk Hull, which covers the craft itself and is calculated based on the value of the craft. The premium varies based on the expected stability of the countries to which the vessel will travel, the war risk phenomenon, which was only known to countries with high rate of piracy such as Somalia, also found its way into Nigeria following massive involvement of youths in the Niger Delta in militant activities.\n\nSpeaking during the recent official flag-off of the deep blue project in Lagos by President Muhammadu Buhari, Dr Bashir said: \u201cSince the deployment of the deep blue project assets in February, there had been a steady decline in piracy attacks in the Nigerian waters on a monthly basis.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe therefore invite the international shipping community to rethink the issue of war risk insurance on cargo bound for our ports. Nigeria has demonstrated enough commitment towards tackling maritime insecurity to avert such premium burden,\u201d Jamoh said.\u201d\n\nAccording to nonprofit Oceans Beyond Piracy\u2019s 2020 reports, the total cost of additional war risk area premiums incurred by Nigeria bound ships transiting the Gulf was $55.5 million in 2020 alone, and 35 per cent of ships transiting the area also carried additional kidnap and ransom insurance totaling $100.7 million.\n\nInsecurity got so bad in the region before the deployment of the deep blue project that global insurance firm Beazley now offers \u201cGulf of Guinea Piracy Plus,\u201d a bespoke insurance plan for maritime crew travelling through the area.\n\nThe plan provides compensation for illegal vessel seizures and crew kidnappings even in the absence of ransom demands. It tracks insured vessels on a 24-hour basis, but because the risks are so high, it limits claims to $25 million.\n\nA spokesman for Beazley disclosed that premiums for this type of coverage are decided on a case-by-case basis, however, because the risks are so great.",

          "text": "IDBIA GABRIEL, KADUNA\n\nPresident of Southern Kaduna Peoples Union (SOKAPU), Hon. Jonathan Asake, at the weekend assured people their lands that have been captured and occupied by assailants in the area would be reclaimed and given back to them by all means no matter the time taken.\n\nThe SOKAPU leader gave the assurance when he paid a sympathy visit to the village head of Unguwan Madaki, Mr. Na\u2019Allah Na\u2019Dare in his community in Kakau ward, Chikun Local Government Area of Southern part of Kaduna State.\n\nThis was contained in a statement issued by spokesman of the union, Mr Luka Binniyat, at the weekend.\n\n\u201cUnguwan Madaki was attacked last night (Friday, 18th June, 2021) by assailants that people the community described as armed Fulani men numbering over a hundred.\n\n\u201cA serving police officer (name withheld for now) and 10 year old miss Yossie Timothy Ayuba were shot dead in the attack, which was one among other past invasions of the place.\n\n\u201cNot less than 26 persons were kidnapped, including the two wives of Na\u2019Allah Na\u2019Dare \u2013 Ruth Na\u2019Alla and Blessing Na\u2019Alla. Also three of his children, aged 10, 2 and a year and half old were also taken away,\u201d it stated.\n\n\u201cThe parent of slain Yossie Timothy, Timothy Adamu and his wife were also kidnapped.\n\n\u201cThe attackers stormed the village by 10pm and operated for about 45 minutes using their superior firepower to defy resistance put up by local vigilantes that were armed with crude arms and clubs.\n\n\u201cI have come here on behalf of Southern Kaduna people to show our sadness and anger over the incessant attacks, mass murder and mass abduction of our people,\u201d he told the Chief, who was surrounded by sympathisers.\n\n\u201cIn Kakau, not far from here, 61 persons were kidnapped in past three days and at least two killed.\n\n\u201cIn Libere, in Kallah Ward, Kajuru LGA in Southern part of Kaduna, 76 Adara natives were kidnapped since on the 22nd May, 2021.\n\n\u201cWhat is even more disturbing is that Kaduna State government has refused to acknowledge and document all these crimes in its daily \u2018Security Updates\u2019 usually signed by Kaduna State Commissioner of Home Security and Internal Affairs, Samuel Aruwan.\n\n\u201cSOKAPU condemns all acts of violent crimes on anyone or community.\n\n\u201cIt was alright for Samuel Aruwan to carry along some top military brass, Kaduna State Commissioner of Police among others to condole the Emir of Zaria, HRH. Ahmed Nuhu Bamali, over the killing of a student of Kaduna State Polytechnic and the kidnap of some other persons under Zaria Emirate.\n\n\u201cBut is very unfortunate that we have no record where he has ever made such gesture and expressed such empathy to any of our traditional rulers, elders or leaders despite the huge loss in lives and property that we have been suffering ever since.\u201d\n\nThe president said that apart from the mass abduction of Southern Kaduna natives, scores of its communities have been captured and occupied by armed herdsmen with government doing nothing to recover them and return the displaced owners.\n\n\u201cI want to assure you that every inch of Southern Kaduna soil that is occupied by criminals by force will be recovered by us or our children by every means possible,\u201d he stressed.\n\n\u201cI also want to inform you that our lands can never be in the permanent ownership of those who visit terror on us and take ownership by force.\n\n\u201cIt is just a matter of time. We shall get back these lands. These criminals and all those who backed them shall also be brought to justice one day. This is just a phase. We shall overcome this evil very soon.\u201d\n\nIn response, the village head thanked. the President of SOKAPU for the visit and for previous goodwill that the union had extended to the village in the past.",

Already, seven schools on the frontline in that area have been closed and more will be closed, if we realise the situation is not safe for the teachers and students.\n\nResponding to a question on how the bandits made their contact with the parents, Arzika explained that they collected the contacts of parents and teachers from the abductees and thereafter made calls to tell them that their children and people were with them.\n\nHe said: \u201cthere was communication from them, but none of them asked for a kobo, they only said they wanted to establish contact that the abductees are in their custody.\n\n\u201cIt was yesterday (Friday) that the security agencies swung on them and since then there was no contact again\u201d.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

That we can close those schools which we think are not safe and prone to attacks in the areas close to the forest.\u201d\n\nThe NUT chairman assured that they had already closed those frontline schools, describing such a move as a proactive measure to guard against a recurrence of the incident similar to that of FGC Yauri.\n\n\u201cI am not talking about only boarding schools, any school that is on the frontline and it is not safe, we would just ask the students to pack and go home, pending the time the situation normalises.\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore now, the state government had recruited large number of vigilante members to look over our schools and we are very much satisfied with what the government has done.\n\n\u201cSome of these schools that I am talking about have policemen attached to them, honestly, we are satisfied with government actions\u201d, he said.\n\nOn the FGC Yauri abductions, the NUT chairman appealed to parents to remain calm and continue praying to God Almighty for the restoration of peace in the area and the country at large, while supporting the security agencies with vital information that would enable the rescue of the abducted persons unhurt.\n\nHe said: \u201cSince the security agencies have swung into action on the bandits, we have not made fresh contact with the parents and relatives of the students and teachers still in their captivity.\n\n\u201cWhen we made our first contact two days ago, precisely on Thursday, they did not demand any ransom, instead, they told the parents and relatives that they only wanted to establish contact with them and inform them that their children are with them.\n\n\u201cAs I am talking to you, two of our teachers have regained their freedom. Already, seven schools on the frontline in that area have been closed and more will be closed, if we realise the situation is not safe for the teachers and students.\n\nResponding to a question on how the bandits made their contact with the parents, Arzika explained that they collected the contacts of parents and teachers from the abductees and thereafter made calls to tell them that their children and people were with them.\n\nHe said: \u201cthere was communication from them, but none of them asked for a kobo, they only said they wanted to establish contact that the abductees are in their custody.\n\n\u201cIt was yesterday (Friday) that the security agencies swung on them and since then there was no contact again\u201d.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "General Superintendent, Deeper Christian Life Ministry, Pastor William Kumuyi has lifted punishment meted out to some youths of the church who obstructed a Sunday worship service to celebrate his 80th birthday.\n\nKumuyi turned 80 years on Sunday, June 6, 2021.\n\nAt the worship service that day which was attended by Governors Babajide Sanwo-Olu and Emmanuel Udom, some youths of the church strategically positioned at the first gallery of church building suddenly emerged from the blues and started blowing the trumpets and sang happy birthday to their pastor.\n\nService was temporary obstructed as they were overjoyed, singing and blowing the trumpets and other musical instruments. This was the first time such a thing has occurred in the history of Deeper Life, a conservative holiness church.\n\nThe action of the youths elicited mixed feelings in the church. While some were happy, others felt the youths have compromised the standard of the church.\n\nBut on Saturday, shortly before delivering his message at the workers\u2019 meeting, Kumuyi doused the tension and said those who had been punished by their action during the service should be restored back to the working team.\n\nKumuyi thanked the youths for honouring him with their musical instruments.\n\nHe said: \u201cOn the 6th of June some young people did something they were excited about and some of us old people, we maybe rebuked them directly or indirectly. I even heard that one of those who played instruments singing \u2018Happy Birthday\u2019..understand these are young people and sometimes young people need to express their joy and their excitement in the way we adults might not have thought, we should express our own joy\u2026but we were all happy, were you not happy?\n\n\u201cBut you didn\u2019t express it, you did yours in a quiet, matured, decent, weighty manner which is good\u2026but those young people acted like they are young people and I want to register my appreciation publicly to all of them. Those who sang, those who played instruments and those who excitedly dramatized whatever, I appreciate them, God appreciates them and we praise the Lord for them.\n\n\u201cAnd if it so happens that you know any of them or you are an authority, spiritual authority on any of them and any of them was removed from doing what they were doing in the Church, please for love sake and for unity sake, restore all of them and young people, we love you, we appreciate you, we are looking forward to you doing more for the glory of God and joining us in evangelism and bringing your own method, your own ideas and some of our own ideas as older people that are not working, if you come forward and you give us good ideas, we will replace our old ideas which are not working with your new ideas.\n\n\u201cPraise the Lord! Church are you alright? Let\u2019s encourage our children. Our children will go farther than we have done in Jesus name. Amen.\u201d",

Our party is not for business as usual, it is a totally different thing.\n\n\u201cYou all know what we are facing right now in Nigeria, it looks as if the government of today is actually bereft of ideas concerning security, they have left security into the hands of the citizenry.\n\n\u201cIt looks as if we do not have a government at all, If YPP comes on board I believe very much strongly that the story will change.\n\n\u201cWhy am I leading you if I can not give you protection, we have people who can do all these, all we should do is to empower the people that will secure the lives and properties of the people. Nigeria is not getting better.\n\n\u201cThe government needs to sit up, I can assure you that if YPP comes on board we will turn all the stones that we need to unturn to ensure the security of lives and properties and before me I am sure that we have men of capacity, you are the people we are looking forward to, to becoming our councillors, our chairmen, house of assembly members, house of representatives, president of the country and other bigger positions,\u201d he added.\n\nMr Britto maintained that the party has come to wipe tears of all members\n\nMeanwhile, the state chairman of the party, Asiwaju Adedamola Adeshina welcomed the new members into the party, saying that the party will not disappoint them.\n\nHe also encouraged Nigerian youths to participate actively in politics, saying that it is only YPP that can recognize the youths and encourage them.\n\nHe said \u201cYPP is the building ground for the youths to realise that the lifetime ambition of youths is the leaders of tomorrow, it is not as if we don\u2019t have old people with experience in YPP, YPP is providing the platform for the youths to prevent them from being a backbencher. To become leaders, to be in front, like the exercise that is going on now, all our councillors, chairmanship candidates that we have presented to the OGSIEC are all youths.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to do that to prove to other political parties that have been in existence and that has been drawing the youths, calling them lazy youths to show that Nigerian youths have the capability to rule, all of us here are ambassadors, people that are joining YPP today, these are the things should be in our minds, that we are all ambassadors, I want to call on youths to participate actively in politics, they should not see politics as a dirty game,\u201d he added\n\nOther dignitaries present were the Ekiti state chairman, Chief John Filani and women leader in the state, Mrs Ogunlana Mojisola.",

          "text": "\n\n\n\nFourteen bandits were Sunday morning gunned down during an attack on Police Station in Katsina-Ala, Benue state.\n\nThe bandits, according to police authority, were at the station to rescue five of their members earlier arrested and kept in the cell at the Area Command station.\n\n\n\nSpokesperson Benue State Police Command DSP Catherine Sewuese Anene, in a press statement said series of operations were ongoing in Katsina-Ala and in one of the operations on 19th June, 2021; the suspected bandits were arrested and kept in the cell for investigation.\n\nShe, however, noted that in the early hours of Sunday around 1:30 am, 50 bandits mobilised and invaded the station to rescue their members but the police repelled and killed 14 of them.\n\nShe said: \u201cIt is no longer news that series of operations are going on in Kastina-Ala Local Government Area of Benue State. These activities are geared towards a total clamp down on bandits\u2019 activities in the area.\n\n\u201cOn 19th June, 2021 five bandits were arrested and detained at Kastina-Ala Police Division for investigation and prosecution.\n\n\u201cOn 20th June, 2021 at about 0130hrs more than fifty other gang members of the detainees mobilised and invaded the police station to rescue their counterparts.\n\n\u201cOfficers at the division who were already at alert engaged them in a gun duel and were able to subdue the bandits.\n\n\u201cFourteen (14) of them were brought down during the exchange of fire while several others escaped with gunshot injuries. Operatives in the area are currently on the trail of suspects at large.\n\n\u201cThe good people of Kastina-Ala town are advised to remain calm and avail every useful information about the bandits to the police.\u201d\n\n15 bandits killed in Niger\n\nIn a related development, about 15 armed bandits were killed in a gun duel with troops Saturday in Anguwan Mallam, Kontagora, Niger state.\n\nBlueprint gathered that the exchange of fire occurred at about 4.00pm when the troops on patrol sighted the criminals at the location.\n\nA local source told Blueprint that the arrival of the troops was what saved the 70-member gang from dealing a deadly attack on the residents.\n\nWith the gallant soldiers exhibiting superior firepower, the bandits reportedly fled into the bush.\n\nHowever, the police authority was yet to comment on the development as at the time of this report.\n\nNAF shells terrorists\n\nAlso in yet another victory over the criminal elements, the fighter aircraft of the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) Sunday eliminated scores of ISWAP-Boko Haram terrorists, including their commanders in Lamboa in Kaga local government area of Borno state.\n\nPRNigeria gathered that the multiple airstrikes conducted by a mix of aircraft including Alpha-Jets, L-39 and MI-35 helicopters, might have also killed the notorious ISWAP Logistic Commander, Modu Sullum.\n\nSullum was allegedly responsible for the destruction of power transmission towers at Malanari along Maiduguri-Damaturu Highway and attacks on travellers in Auno and Jakana axis.\n\nThe insurgents, in a convoy of eight gun trucks had invaded Lamboa, preparatory to launching a gruesome attack in Mainok axis in the state.\n\nBut the terrorists were swiftly engaged by ground and air troops, who foiled their missions after the NAF reconnaissance platform had earlier hovered over the location before the airstrikes.\n\nIt was gathered that over a dozen ISWAP-Boko Haram fighters were killed by bombardments of the military fighter aircraft.\n\nWhen contacted, air force spokesperson, Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet confirmed the success of the military airstrikes.\n\nHe told PRNigeria that \u201cYes, it was a very successful operation. Of the eight terrorist gun trucks sighted by our surveillance team, the aircraft successfully took out six of the trucks, including an unconfirmed number of terrorists that were eliminated.\n\n\u201cCurrently, the ground troops of the Nigerian Army and our air elements are mopping up the area and assessing the situation.\n\n\u201cAs we have said before, there is no hiding place for these terrorists especially with the renewed vigour, synergy and jointness being exhibited by all members of the Armed forces in the North-East theatre of Operation.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, PRNigeria gathered that other military offensives were simultaneously taken place in other axes including Magumeri with the resumption of office of the New Theatre Commander Operation Hadi Kai, Major-General Chris Musa.",

Because Principals are teachers, all the Directors at the Board are also teachers. It is the decision that we all took that is affecting us.\n\n\u201cGovernment has given us an order and option to take any necessary action as far as our schools are concerned. That we can close those schools which we think are not safe and prone to attacks in the areas close to the forest.\u201d\n\nThe NUT chairman assured that they had already closed those frontline schools, describing such a move as a proactive measure to guard against a recurrence of the incident similar to that of FGC Yauri.\n\n\u201cI am not talking about only boarding schools, any school that is on the frontline and it is not safe, we would just ask the students to pack and go home, pending the time the situation normalises.\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore now, the state government had recruited large number of vigilante members to look over our schools and we are very much satisfied with what the government has done.\n\n\u201cSome of these schools that I am talking about have policemen attached to them, honestly, we are satisfied with government actions\u201d, he said.\n\nOn the FGC Yauri abductions, the NUT chairman appealed to parents to remain calm and continue praying to God Almighty for the restoration of peace in the area and the country at large, while supporting the security agencies with vital information that would enable the rescue of the abducted persons unhurt.\n\nHe said: \u201cSince the security agencies have swung into action on the bandits, we have not made fresh contact with the parents and relatives of the students and teachers still in their captivity.\n\n\u201cWhen we made our first contact two days ago, precisely on Thursday, they did not demand any ransom, instead, they told the parents and relatives that they only wanted to establish contact with them and inform them that their children are with them.\n\n\u201cAs I am talking to you, two of our teachers have regained their freedom. Already, seven schools on the frontline in that area have been closed and more will be closed, if we realise the situation is not safe for the teachers and students.\n\nResponding to a question on how the bandits made their contact with the parents, Arzika explained that they collected the contacts of parents and teachers from the abductees and thereafter made calls to tell them that their children and people were with them.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere was communication from them, but none of them asked for a kobo, they only said they wanted to establish contact that the abductees are in their custody.\n\n\u201cIt was yesterday (Friday) that the security agencies swung on them and since then there was no contact again\u201d.\n\nNAN\n\n",

          "title": "FGC Yauri abduction: Why Kebbi chose not to negotiate with bandits",
          "text": "\n\n\n\nFour days after the abduction of some unspecified number of students of Federal Government College (FGC), Birnin Yauri, Kebbi state, the state government has refused to negotiate with the bandits, a decision that appears a departure from the past.\n\nIn what is fast becoming a norm as Nigeria battles its multifarious security challenges, government and private citizens were always quick to commence quick process of negotiating with the victims to possibly save them from their captors.\n\nBut taking a different path, Blueprint gathered that the state government was encouraged by the citizens not to go into any form of negotiation with the kidnappers.\n\nTheir effort, it was gathered, led to the gunning down of 82 of the criminals and rescue of some of their captives.\n\nAs at the time of this report, about 11 of the abductees had been rescued. While seven were rescued Friday, 4 regained their freedom Sunday courtesy of the troops, other security agencies and vigilantes.\n\nNegotiation as no option\n\nOn why government ruled out negotiation with the bandits, a top government source said, the immediate response of Governor Atiku Bagudu and that of security agencies was what really thrilled the populace.\n\n\u201cFor once, we saw something different since this madness by bandits hit our state. For the record, you and I know that Kebbi was about the most peaceful of the whole of North-west states. But suddenly they chose to disrupt that peace like late last year and early this year.\n\n\u201cIt is even worse when the hoodlums came on bikes to abduct the students last Thursday. I must tell you that the sharp response by the security agents and that from the governor was what really inspired some level of confidence in the residents who continued to insist that government must not negotiate with the criminal elements.\n\n\u201cI think this is the way to go. Our security agents deserve a lot of commendation in the handling of this.\n\n\u201cIs it not even encouraging that the bandits were mauled and hunted down by our gallant troops, the police and the vigilante group in the state? This is just the way to go. In shaa Allah (by God\u2019s grace), banditry and other forms of criminality will soon come to an end in our dear nation. We have tolerated enough this trash. This is just the way to go to putting an end to the pampering of these hoodlums who have turned kidnapping and inflicting pains on fellow citizens to business,\u201d said the source Sunday who spoke under anonymity.\n\nAlso speaking, a resident of Yauri who simply gave his name as Muhammadu said, \u201cWe are in support of government\u2019s action because it did everything to forestall this by ensuring security agents were stationed in that school.\n\n\u201cGive it to them, the security agents are humans and not spirits, so they were overpowered. But the good thing is that they (security agents) didn\u2019t stop at that. A hot chase on the heels of the criminals is leaving no room for negotiation. Yes, government has demonstrated it\u2019s in charge and that is how it should be.\u201d\n\nThe position corroborates the various video clips on the social media showing the military dealing deadly blows on the bandits, following which some of their captives were rescued.\n\nAlthough the authenticity of the clips could not be verified as at the time of this report, a former council chairman told Blueprint under anonymity that \u201cthe bandits got the worst of their life when soldiers, police and vigilante group caught up with them at Mokuku in Sakaba local government area of the state.\u201d\n\nIt was independently gathered that not less than 82 of the hoodlums were gunned down by the security agents who overpowered the kidnappers in a gun duel over the weekend, even as they continued in the hot chase of the bandits.\n\nBagudu speaks\n\nInspired by the bravery demonstrated by the security agents and the level of cooperation from the locals, Governor Bagudu assured that efforts were being intensified by the state government to ensure the safe rescue of the abductees.\n\nThe governor spoke while addressing a mammoth crowd of vigilante groups who paid him a sympathy visit at the Government House Birnin Kebbi over the weekend.\n\nBagudu said he owed people of the state a responsibility by ensuring all the kidnapped persons returned safe to their families.\n\nHe said: \u201cI am not voted into power to sit at the Government House and enjoy all the luxury of power and watch my people been maimed and killed, likewise every other elective office holder should and must be prepared to work assiduously towards safeguarding the lives and property of the citizenry.\u201d\n\nThe visibly angry governor further said: \u201cI am ready to make sacrifices physically to confront these men of the underworld. Enough is enough of this nonsense and heartless acts in the name of banditry.\u201d\n\nHe commended the efforts of the Nigerian Army, Police and vigilante groups for their active involvement in the rescue operation leading to the release of some students and their teachers.\n\nVigilante leader assures\n\nSpeaking earlier, leader of the state chapter of the vigilantes, Alhaji Sani Zauro Hukuma hailed the governor for his timely response that ensured the ongoing joint rescue operation to comb the forest and rescue some students.\n\nHe assured that members of his group were always ready to lend their support in ridding the state of bandits and related criminals.\n\nAlso speaking to journalists, the governor\u2019s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Yahaya Sarki said the governor had received much commendations from the people of Kebbi for his prompt action.\n\n\u201cUpon receiving the news of the unfortunate abduction while in Abuja on official engagement, the governor had to cut it short and went straight to Birnin Yauri. The state government would do everything humanly possible to bring back these children and the staff back safely,\u201d he also assured.\n\n\u201cSince this unfortunate incident occurred, all hands have been on deck to ensure our children and the staff are rescued alive, hale and hearty,\u201d he said\n\nTroops rescue 3 others\n\nMeanwhile, troops of Operation Hadarin Daji, have rescued three more students of the Federal Government College Birnin Yawuri and one of the teachers.\n\nThe abductees were rescued at Makuku during search and rescue operations with one of the bandits killed.\n\nAccording to a statement by the Director Army Public Relations Brigadier-General Onyema Nwachukwu, more troops had been deployed to the forests.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cTroops of the Nigerian Army operating under the auspices of Operation HADARIN DAJI supported by Nigerian Air Force component have rescued more abductees of the FGC Birnin Yawuri.\n\n\u201cOne teacher and three students were rescued yesterday at Makuku, in the ongoing search and rescue operations. The troops also killed one bandit and recovered nine motorcycles and four handsets from the fleeing bandits.\n\n\u201cAdditional troops have also been deployed to dominate the forest and deny the bandits freedom of action.\n\n\u201cRecall that two teachers and five students were earlier on Friday 18 June 2021 rescued by the gallant troops in a coordinated fire fight with the kidnappers.\u201d\n\n15 Tegina abductees escape\n\nSimilarly, some 15 persons abducted alongside Tanko Salihu Islamiyya students in Tegina, Niger state have escaped from their captives.\n\nWhile some of the abductees arrived the town Saturday night, others returned Sunday morning and afternoon and were already in various health facilities for adequate medical attention.\n\nIn their separate accounts, the captives said they regained their freedom when the guards keeping watch over them slept off and felt into slumber.\n\nIt was gathered that after the abduction, the victims were separated from the kids whose(kids) whereabouts they wouldn\u2019t know.\n\nIt was further revealed that prior to their escape, the victims were locked down in Zamfara forests, following which government sent a reinforcement team to the forest to secure release of the other captives.\n\nIt was learnt those who escaped had been admitted in health facilities.\n\nBlueprint further gathered that the captives were received a top official of Rafi local government council at Birnin Gwari.",

          "text": "Civil Society Organizations in Defence of Justice has expressed disappointment against the continued disobedience of court order by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission EFCC and the first generation bank.\n\nAddressing a press conference in Abuja, the Convener of the group, Comr. Sam Adah, called on the new Chairman of the anti-graft agency, Abdulrasheed Bawa to flush out personnel who are fare being used by some bad elements to flout court orders, just as he stressed that the commission should rather be seen as one leading the fight against corruption which includes obeying the rule of law and not perverting justice.\n\nWhile citing the plight of some members of the Eleme Petrochemical Cooperative and Credit Society of INDORAMA Petrochemical Ltd , in Rivers State who he said have been seeking justice over issues regarding equity shares in the company, he also called for the immediate unfreezing of the cooperative\u2019s bank account in line with the orders of the Federal High Court.\n\n\u201cOn February 26, 2009, the federal government through the National Council on Privatization had approved the sale of 10% of its equity shares in Indorama Eleme Petrochemicals Ltd, Port Harcourt, Rivers State to the host community and interested staff of Indorama Eleme Petrochemicals Ltd. The 10% equity shares was shared as 7.5% was allotted to the host community while the remaining 2.5% was allotted to the Staff of Indoroma Eleme Petrochemicals.\n\n\u201cInterested Staff came together under Eleme petrochemical co-operatives in compliance to the federal government directive that a special purpose vehicle be formed where all members will belong to enable them buy the shares.\n\n\u201cIn 2013, 10 staffs who initially subscribed to the purchase of the 2.5 equity shares had their jobs terminated from the employment of Indorama Eleme Petrochemicals.\n\n\u201cThis led to the beginning of a legal battle as to whether the laid off staff can continue to enjoy the dividends since they were no longer staff in the company.\n\n\u201cWhen the shareholding became an issue the laid off staff approached the River State Ministry of Commerce and Industry to arbitrate between it and the cooperative, the Ministry gave an Arbitral Award in favour of the laid off staff and consequently, the exited staffs of the co-operative approached the Federal High Court to enforce the arbitral award and as required by law it was granted and the award became a judgment of the Federal High Court.\n\n\u201cThe judgement affirmed the laid off staffs as the authentic owners of the shares. It is of important to note that this judgement has not been appealed to this day.\n\n\u201cThis act continued until Justice Taiwo .O.Taiwo of the Federal High Court in Suit FHC/ABJ/SC/1222/2020 granted an Order stopping the EFCC from arresting, inviting, detaining and prosecuting or inquiring into the acquisition of shares of Indorama Petrochemicals.\n\n\u201cThis act continued until Justice Taiwo .O .Taiwo of the Federal high court in Suit FHC/ABJ/SC/1222/2020 granted an Order stopping the EFCC from arresting, inviting ,detaining and prosecuting or inquiring into the acquisition of shares of INDORAMA Petrochemicals ltd.\n\n\u201cWe urge the new Chairman of EFCC, Abdulrasheed Bawa to revisit the case and make sure that certain elements in the agency promoting abuse of court orders be arrested and dealt with accordingly.\u201d\n\nHe called on the EFCC rise to its mandate and responsibility and desist from been used by influencial and powerful Nigerians to intimidate poor Nigerians.\n\nOther demands includes that First Bank of Nigeria, without further delay should honour the order of the court and grant access to the funds in its custody.\n\n\u201cFirst Bank must realize that this very act has cost many loss to the members of the Co-operative especially the diseased ones, whose widows only livelihood depends on the funds in their custody.\n\n\u201cIf the impunity continues we will have no option than to commence legal Action against First Bank.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the spokesman of EFCC, Wilson Uwujaren, had said that ongoing cases are not immediately made available to his office.",

This year, candidates were able to locate their centres on time, the supervisors also came on time to take biometric of the candidates, in fact, the whole process is smooth and hitch-free.\u201d\n\nAnother parent, Mrs. Grace Godwin confirmed that the process of this year\u2019s UTME was smooth, saying that JAMB has recorded massive improvement in conducting online examination.\n\n\u201d Our children did not complain much about the use of computer or any delay during the exam. There was no case of malpractice or system failure.To me, this is a great feet that JAMB has achieved so far.\n\nAlso, a proprietor and CBT centre owner of Ade- Ola Int\u2019l Schools, Mrs. Mercy Olaosegbe told our reporter that the JAMB examinations in her centre started successfully but experienced a hitch when the server went off.\n\n\u201d The examination was going on successfully, candidates came as early as 7 O\u2019 clock, had their thumb print, we started at the appropriate time, but along the line the server went off. This, actually caused a little delay, but thank God the technical officers were able to fix it as quickly as possible,\u201d said Olaosegbe.\n\nOn the parts of the candidates, especially those who had sat for UTME in the previous years, said there was no stress locating their centres , capturing their biometrics, and operating computer during the 2021 UTME.\n\nIn her own response, Ms Amu Bethel Chioma, one of the candidates said, the conduct was smooth except that questions encountered in the Chemistry were set outside the syllabus and were tough.\n\n\u201d There was no problem with the use of computer because it was the same computers we use for Mock exam that we still used but the only problem was the Chemistry, most things I read were not in the questions,\u201dshe said.\n\nAnother candidates, Odema Nfong from Spirited International School, said her problem was only Literature- in- English where most of the questions were set from the old syllabus.",

          "text": "Emirates Airlines will resume flights to Nigeria from June 23, five months after it banned outbound flights from Abuja and Lagos. This followed the withdrawal of the Rapid Antigen Test the United Arab Emirates (UAE) had insisted passengers from Nigeria travelling to Dubai must take four hours before boarding their flights.\n\nIn another development, the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) confirmed it had fixed the airfield light at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA), Lagos, Runway 18R, to enable flights land in the night. Regional Terminal Manager in charge of MMIA, Mrs. Victoria Shin-Aba, stated this on Saturday in an interview with THISDAY.\n\nThe UAE antigen test requirement was against Nigeria\u2019s policy that passengers travelling out of the country should conduct Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test 72 hours before their flight.\n\nBut on Saturday, UAE issued a statement conceding that Nigerian passengers that wished to travel to Dubai \u201cmust have received a negative test result for PCR test taken within 48 hours before departure.\u201d\n\nThe statement posted on Instagram by the Dubai media office also said passengers travelling from Nigeria should present a negative PCR test certificate with a QR Code from labs approved by the Nigerian government. It stated that all passengers must undergo a PCR test on arrival in Dubai, adding, \u201cTransit passengers should comply with entry protocol of final destination.\u201d\n\nThe media office said the new regulation was part of measures aimed at easing inbound travel restrictions by Dubai\u2019s Supreme Committee of Crisis and Disaster Management. The committee introduced new entry protocols for passengers effective June 23.\n\nBesides the new condition for Nigerian travellers, UAE has new regulations for passengers travelling from South Africa and India to Dubai.\n\nFor South Africa, the new rules stipulate that passengers should have received two doses of a vaccine approved by UAE authorities.\n\n\u201cPassengers must present a negative test result for a PCR test taken within 48 hours before departure; UAE citizens are exempted. All passengers must undergo a PCR test on arrival at Dubai airport. Transit passengers should comply with entry protocols of final destination,\u201d the statement said.\n\nFor travellers from India, UAE said passengers should have received two doses of a vaccine approved by UAE authorities and passengers must have received a negative test result for PCR test taken within 48 hours before departure, in addition to the other conditions given to Nigeria and South Africa.\n\nConfirming the withdrawal of the antigen test, Emirates Airlines issued a statement signed by its management, which said, \u201cEmirates welcomes the latest protocols and measures announced by Dubai\u2019s Supreme Committee of Crisis and Disaster Management to allow the safe resumption of passenger travel from South Africa, Nigeria and India to Dubai. We look forward to facilitating travel from these countries and supporting various travellers\u2019 categories.\n\n\u201cWe will resume carrying passengers from South Africa, Nigeria and India in accordance with these protocols from 23rd June. We thank the Supreme Committee for their continuous efforts in monitoring the development of the situation and announcing the appropriate guidelines and protocols to protect the community and safeguard travel sector.\u201d\n\nReacting to the new development, President of the National Association of Nigeria Travel Agencies (NANTA), Mrs. Susan Akporiaye, said UAE had done what the Nigerian government wanted. Akporiaye said the new development had shown that no country could rubbish Nigeria if it insisted on a position popular with its citizens.\n\nThe NANTA president said there would be a price to pay if a country stood its ground, regretting that Nigeria had often tended to shy away from the reality of that price.\n\nAkporiaye stated, \u201cSome of the prices include the fact that many Nigerian students studying overseas that were due to travel back found it very difficult doing so without Emirates flights from Nigeria. We travel agents also paid a huge price because if Emirates flights were operating, we would have made money; we wouldn\u2019t have been at the state we are now financially.\n\n\u201cWe give kudos to the federal government and travel agencies. We will now wait for the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) to lift the ban on Emirates.\u201d\n\nUAE had made the Rapid Antigen Test compulsory for Emirates Airlines, which was to start administering the test on Nigerian passengers from February 4, 2021.\n\nIn response, the federal government temporarily banned the Middle East carrier, insisting passengers travelling out of Nigeria are only required to have PCR test 72 hours before their flight. The government said it did not have the facilities for the antigen test demanded by Emirates.\n\nFollowing Nigeria\u2019s insistence, Emirates banned its outbound flights from Nigeria and later its in-bound flights, which it had operated for several weeks after the ban on outbound flights.\n\nMeanwhile, for over one week the centre lights at the MMIA runway were unserviceable, prompting the agency to issue Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and provide bar stopper light at each end of the runways to guide pilots to land after dusk.\n\nShin-Aba told THISDAY that the airfield lighting on the runway had been fixed and all airlines could now land their planes at the airport.\n\nHowever, insider sources at FAAN told THISDAY that a temporary measure was put in place to enable flights land, as the second runway, known as Runway 18L (domestic runway), had no airfield lighting for years since its rehabilitation in 2008.\n\nThe status of the runway lighting before it was fixed on Saturday might have prompted British Airways to divert its Lagos flight to Abuja on Friday, but other airlines landed their flights at the airport in Lagos.\n\nThe FAAN regional manager stated, \u201cThe runway lights had been bad since over a week, but FAAN issued NOTAM to notify airlines and pilots globally, so any airline coming to Nigeria knew the problem with the runway.\n\n\u201cBut FAAN installed bar stopper light at the two ends of the runway to guide pilots that wish to land at the runway in the night. This is a big challenge for us because it is not about getting the airport certified; it is about sustaining the standard achieved to earn the certification.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why BA diverted its flight to Abuja, but the airline was aware of the status of the airport even before it left London to Lagos.\u201d\n\nChinedu Eze and Michael Olugbode",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has called on West African leaders to exert more pressure on the military leadership in Mali to ensure that the transition process in the country is not aborted.\n\nThe president\u2019s position was contained in his address on Saturday at the 59th Ordinary session of the Authority of Heads of State and Government of ECOWAS in Accra, Ghana.\n\nMali was recently suspended from the regional bloc due to a military coup in the country.\n\nBuhari, who spoke extensively on the Malian situation, said, \u201cAt this Summit today, we are expected to review a number of important reports dealing with various issues of concerns to our organisation and people. In doing so, we must take realistic and practical decisions, which will positively impact our citizens.\n\n\u201cSome of those decisions, necessarily, will have to do with evolving political and security situations in our sub-region as well as evaluate the health of our organisation with the hope of repositioning to serve our people and sub-region better.\n\n\u201cWhile democracy continues to develop in our sub-region, recent events in Mali are sad reminders that vigilance remains a crucial imperative to protect people\u2019s aspirations to freely choose the form of government they want. Pressures are needed to ensure that the transition process in Mali, which is halfway to its conclusion, is not aborted.\n\n\u201cA further slide in Mali could prove catastrophic to the Sub-region, considering that about half of that country is, unfortunately, under the grip of terrorists.\u201d\n\nThe president appealed to the military leadership in Mali to understand the critical state of their country, which he described as \u201cclearly under siege\u201d.\n\nNoting that the principal responsibility of the military must be to protect and guarantee the sovereignty of the West African country, Buhari cautioned them not to perpetrate acts that could destabilise and destroy their country.\n\n\u201cI urge our organisation to remain engaged with all stakeholders in Mali through our astute mediator, former President Goodluck Jonathan, who, I congratulate warmly for his untiring efforts thus far. I encourage him to sustain these efforts to ensure that the transition is completed as scheduled,\u201d the president added.\n\nOn Libya, Buhari faulted the recent United Nations resolution to expel all foreign fighters in Libya without first ensuring that they were disarmed.\n\nHe stated, \u201cOn the security situation in the region, our organisation must note with serious concern the recent decision by the United Nations and its Resolution to expel all foreign fighters in Libya without, first, ensuring that they are disarmed and that neighbouring countries and the Sub-regions were engaged, to put in place modalities for containing or managing the movement of these fighters.\n\n\u201cWhile this action was aimed at bringing about sustenance of peace in Libya, non-collaboration with regional stakeholders on this critical decision has now created newer threats to peace, security and stability in the region, which could lead to lack of coordinated management of huge humanitarian crisis across the Sahel, North, Central and West Africa, including the Lake Chad region.\u201d\n\nThe president said these regions faced a clear possibility of instability with the invasion of the fully armed foreign fighters.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative that ECOWAS leaders, at this Summit, decide how the UN-Sub-regional organisations partnerships should be reviewed to address the dangers that this UN Resolution poses to the region,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe speech by the Nigerian president at the Summit also addressed other issues of concern in the organisation, including the on-going institutional reforms in ECOWAS. He declared Nigeria\u2019s unequivocal support to the reform process, saying he looks forward to an ECOWAS that is \u201cfit for purpose\u201d, delivering services to the satisfaction of the community citizens.\n\nBuhari commended the President of the Commission and his team, the Ad-hoc Ministerial Committee on Institutional Reforms, as well as the Council of Ministers for the excellent report presented to the Authority of Heads of State.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have clearly realised that operating a bloated administration with the current global economic collapse occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic will be to the detriment of services to our people, which is not sustainable. This positive action will certainly enable our organisation move on and deliver services to the satisfaction of our Community citizens.\n\n\u201cLet me remind us that this is only the beginning as the responsibility of streamlining operational costs as well as the modalities for the appointment of statutory positions of the incoming management are still outstanding. It is my view that paying attention to existing regulations that guide the appointment of statutory appointees will further guarantee the efficiency and sustainability of the organisation.\u201d\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja",
