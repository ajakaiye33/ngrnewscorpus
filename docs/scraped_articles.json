          "title": "Nigerians present divergent views as constitutional panel holds hearing",
          "text": "PARTICIPANTS at the public hearing on the National Assembly\u2019s proposed alterations to the 1999 Constitution on Wednesday called for a fresh constitution for the country.\n\nThose who spoke at the public hearings held in Asaba, Enugu, Akure\u2026dismissed the amendment to the constitution being undertaken by the National Assembly, saying it was becoming a jamboree.\n\n1999 Constitution hurriedly put up \u2013 Okowa\n\nIn Delta State, Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, said a new constitution for the country had become imperative in view of observed lacunas in the 1999 Constitution.\n\nOkowa stated this on Wednesday when the Senate Sub-Committee on review of the 1999 Constitution visited him at the Government House, Asaba.\n\n\u201cWe know that some amendments were made recently but on a general note, we are also aware that the Constitution itself appears to have just been hurriedly put up just before the 1999 elections and handed over,\u201d Okowa added.\n\nCurrent constitution leading Nigeria to extinction, says Afe Babalola\n\nIn Ekiti State, an elder statesman and founder of Afe Babalola University, Ado Ekiti, Aare Afe Babalola, said the National Assembly\u2019s move to amend the 1999 Constitution was a futile exercise.\n\nBabalola said on Wednesday that rather, what the National Assembly ought to do was \u201cto call for a National Conference to discuss and make a new true federal constitution which will provide for a parliamentary system of government\u201d.\n\nThe senior advocate, in a statement titled, \u2018Proposed amendment to the 1999 Constitution by the National Assembly: A futile exercise\u2019 said, \u201cThe root cause of our problems, which has brought Nigeria to the brink of extinction, is the 1999 constitution foisted on it by the military when it was exiting the reign of governance in 1999.\u201d\n\nBabalola, who queried why the National Assembly could not convene a National Conference for a fresh constitution, said, \u201cAlternatively, since amendment in law includes substitution for an existing document, why is it that the National Assembly cannot call for a public hearing on the substitution of the 1999 Constitution for the 1963 Constitution which was made with the consent of the people?\u201d\n\nProponents of new constitution calling for anarchy \u2013 Ekweremadu\n\nSpeaking, a former Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, said those canvassing a new constitution for the country were calling for anarchy.\n\nEkweremadu said, \u201cI have heard that argument; some said bring back our 1960 Constitution, some said bring 1963 Constitution, some said okay, why not just throw away this constitution and bring a new one?\n\n\u201cThe question is how would you do that? There is no such provision in our constitution unless you are calling for anarchy.\u201d\n\nWhile declaring the hearing open, Enugu State Governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi enjoined all relevant institutions, civil society organizations, stakeholders and entire state citizenry to avail themselves of the opportunity of the zonal public hearing \u201cto participate in this momentous national conversation\u201d.\n\nValentine Madubuko of the National Human Rights Commission, Mazi Zulu Ofoelue of the Movement of Biafrans in Nigeria, and Dr. Ikem Nwafor of YIAGA Africa argued that devolving power to the states and allowing them to have their own police would bring the country from the part of precipice.\n\nOfoelue stated that devolution of powers from the federal to the regions would solve a lot of problems bedeviling the country.\n\nIn his presentation, however, Nwafor appealed to the National Assembly for the creation of a new constitution and halting of the ongoing constitutional amendment process.\n\nFG carries too much weight, says El-Rufai\n\nIn their remarks, stakeholders from four states of the North-West comprising Kaduna, Katsina, Kano and Jigawa converged on Kaduna on Tuesday for the public hearing.\n\nThe Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El Rufai, said devolution of powers was necessary because the current structure overburdened the Federal Government with too many responsibilities which it could not efficiently handle.\n\nEl-Rufai said, \u201cThe reality of our security situation today requires that Nigeria must strengthen its military and security agencies. This includes decentralising the police to enable the states to exercise effective control in securing their residents and communities.\u201d\n\n1963 Constitution better for Nigeria \u2013 Akeredolu\n\nIn his remarks, the Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, said it would be better for the country to adopt the 1963 Constitution, which he added contained the principles of true federalism.\n\nThe governor, who berated the current 1999 Constitution, described it as improper and needed to have been changed before this time.\n\nAkeredolu spoke at the opening of the zonal public hearing on the proposed alteration in the provision of the constitution held in Akure, the state capital.\n\nAccording to the governor, there is a need to correct the fundamental mistakes made in the past on the existence of the country.\n\nHe warned that the ongoing process of amendment of the 1999 Constitution must not be taken frivolously.\n\nIn his remarks, the Chairman, the Senate Ad-hoc Committee on the Review of the 1999 Constitution, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, explained that the ongoing review provided a platform for Nigerians to express their opinions on the \u201cfundamental law that governs our lives through proposals that will lead to the highest good for the greatest number of our people.\u201d\n\nRepresented at the hearing by the senator representing Ondo North Senatorial District, Prof. Ajayi Boroffice, the chairman said, \u201cNo doubt, we are going to have diverse and differing views on the different themes of the exercise. However, the focus for this committee is how to manage the review in a fair, inclusive, credible and transparent manner.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu seeks special status for Lagos, state police\n\nMeanwhile, the Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, demanded a special economic status for Lagos, saying the progress and prosperity of Nigeria was linked to the progress and prosperity of Lagos State.\n\nRead Also\n\nThe governor also demanded a state police and entrenchment of true fiscal federalism in Nigeria.\n\nHe made the demands at the opening of the two-day Senate zonal public hearing on the review of the 1999 Constitution under the leadership of Senator Oluremi Tinubu, held at Marriot Hotel, Ikeja in Lagos State.\n\nThe governor said,\u201cFor us in Lagos State, the issues of state police and fiscal federalism are at the top of the priority list for us in this ongoing review process.\n\n\u201cEqually fundamental, particularly for us in Lagos State, is the issue of a special economic status for Lagos, considering our place in the national economy and the special burdens we bear by virtue of our large population and limited land mass.\u201d\n\nLabour, others call for true federalism, restructuring\n\nPresident of the Nigeria Labour Congress, Ayuba Wabba, Lagos State Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Moyosore Onigbanjo, SAN, and representatives of civil organizations, associations, towns, communities, across the states, professional bodies, among others presented and submitted their individual memorandum to the committee.\n\nWabba insisted that labour and the national minimum wage be retained on the exclusive legislative list.\n\nHe said, \u201cAny contemplation to remove the national minimum wage from the exclusive legislative list to the concurrent legislative list will only expose Nigeria to international ridicule and opprobrium.\u201d\n\nAlso, Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Mudashiru Obasa, who was represented by the Lagos State Deputy Speaker, Wasiu Eshinlokun-Sanni, submitted that the most fundamental aspect of the call by state government was the 30 per cent derivation on natural resources for the domiciling states, as well as the criminalising undue interference in activities of the legislature by the executive.\n\nThe state Chairman of CAN, Rev Steven Adegbite, queried the establishment and functionality of Sharia Courts since the constitution said there would be no state religion.\n\nHe said CAN might be forced to vie for Canon courts in the spirit of equity and justice.\n\nSeparatists should embrace dialogue \u2013 Yahaya\n\nSpeaking, the Gombe State Governor, Muhammadu Yahaya, urged secessionists in the country to give the legislators the opportunity of correcting perceived errors in the 1999 Constitution, adding that dialogue remained the most appropriate tool.\n\nYahaya made this disclosure, while declaring the North-East zone constitution review public hearing held in the state.\n\nHe said, \u201cI\u2019m therefore calling on all disgruntled elements to desist from utterances and actions that are capable of undermining our constitutional order. Instead, all aggrieved parties should embrace dialogue and pursue their legitimate aspirations through their elected representatives at both national and state levels.\u201d\n\nMild drama as Gombe differs on state police\n\nBut the Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice in Gombe State, Zubair Umar, said it would be inconsequential for the state to agitate for state police due to paucity of fund.\n\nThe commissioner\u2019s comment on the topical issue of establishment of state police generated murmurings from the audience.\n\nHe said since the current sharing formula favoured the Federal Government, it would be unrealistic for the state to support such clamour, adding that the financial burdens of states made the calls impracticable.\n\nAccording to Zubair, when the relevant adjustments are made, states should earn 60 per cent of the revenue allocation.\n\nSokoto: Judicial autonomy, others top amendment demand\n\nIn Sokoto State, judicial autonomy, gender equity, restructuring/devolution of power and role for traditional rulers, dominated submissions on the first day at the Sokoto centre of the ongoing proposed constitution amendments holding simultaneously across the six geopolitical zones of Nigerian.\n\nLeading the pack of prominent individuals and groups that made presentation at the event was Ahmed Umar, the state NLC Chairman.\n\nUmar in his submission averred that, \u201cNLC says yes to labour legislation, minimum wage, and pension on exclusive legislative lists; autonomy for judiciary, state legislatures and local governments.\u201d\n\nDeclaring open the exercise, the Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal, represented by his Deputy, Alhaji Mannir Dan Iya, noted, \u201cIn the 22 years of Nigeria\u2019s experience in government by representation, our gains have more than justified our challenges.\u201d\n\nConstitution review alone can\u2019t guarantee peace, says Lalong\n\nIn his remarks, Governor of Plateau State and Chairman of Northern Governors\u2019 Forum, Simon Lalong, declared that it was not how many times Nigeria amended its constitution that would guarantee its unity, development, peace, and good governance, rather, it was how committed Nigerians followed the constitution and obeying its provisions that would make the difference.\n\nLalong, who made the declaration on Wednesday in Jos, Plateau State at the North Central public hearing, said every Nigerians ought to be the guardians and defenders of the constitution.\n\nOn restructuring, Lalong said the time had come to thoroughly deal with the matter and ensure that the agitations and anxieties being expressed were addressed.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "The risk of further eruptions from volcano Nyiragongo led DR Congo authorities to order the evacuation of parts of the city of Goma Thursday, causing an immediate exodus of tens of thousands of people.\n\n\u201cCurrent data on seismicity and the deformation of the ground indicate the presence of magma under the urban area of Goma, with an extension under Lake Kivu,\u201d the local military governor General Constant Ndima said in a broadcast public address.\n\n\u201cRight now we can\u2019t rule out an eruption on land or under the lake, which could happen very soon and without warning,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThe situation can change rapidly, and is being constantly monitored.\u201d\n\nNdima said there were also supplementary risks associated with the interaction between magma and water in Lake Kivu.\n\nThere were several potential problems linked to this, he explained, among them the \u201cdestabilisation of the volume of gas dissolved in Lake Kivu and the emission of potentially dangerous gases at the surface\u201d.\n\nHe said evacuation is necessary and should be done calmly and without rushing.\n\nAuthorities have arranged transport towards Sake, around 20 kilometres (12 miles) west of Goma, in each of the ten districts of the city affected, Ndima said.\n\n\u201cPeople should take the bare minimum with them, to make sure everyone has a chance to get on,\u201d he added.\n\n\u2013 Thousands homeless \u2013\n\nThe announcement was followed by the immediate departure of tens of thousands of people towards the southwest, in the direction of the Rwandan border, an AFP correspondent said.\n\nThe United Nations says 32 people have died and at least 5,000 are feared to be homeless after the volcano erupted on Saturday.\n\nThe UN humanitarian affairs office OCHA said 24 of the victims were burned alive by lava, adding that 40 adults have been reported missing.\n\nBy the time the eruption ended on Sunday, the volcano had spewed out two rivers of molten rock, one of which came to halt on the edge of Goma after obliterating villages in its wake.\n\nGoma, a lakeshore city of 1.5 million people, lies around a dozen kilometres (eight miles) from the volcano.\n\nLocal volcanologists have recorded hundreds of aftershocks since Nyiragongo roared back into life, including 119 on Monday alone.\n\nA so-called strato-volcano nearly 3,500 metres (11,500 feet) high, Nyiragongo straddles the East African Rift tectonic divide.\n\nIts last major eruption, in 2002, claimed around 100 lives.\n\nAFP",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\n\u2022IPOB Australia, commends MASSOB for shifting its sit-at-home\n\nAn Igbo leader and former Presidential Aspirant, Chief Charles Udeogaranya has urged Ndigbo to ignore the social media circulation trending around, urging them to stay at home on 30th May.\n\nUdeogaranya spoke at a time the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Victoria Community in Australia, disclosed that it will hold a two-day candle light dinner and procession programme between May 30 and May 31,2021 in the heart of Melbourne, Australia, to remember Biafra\u2019s fallen heroes.\n\nUdeogaranya reminded Ndigbo that the national holiday for Dr. Martin Luther King Jr in America is considered a day on and not a day off and that is what Ndigbo should do in honour of their fallen heroes.\n\n\u201cRemember your fallen heroes in solemn prayers, charity to all but without the colouration that you are still a rebel.\u201d\n\nHe maintained that the fallen heroes of Ndigbo will be happier wherever they are with an Igbo society without violence of which they died and therefore, their death should not be in vain.\n\nUdeogaranya pointed out that \u201cby faith as Christians, our God commanded us not to be rebels as vengeance belongs to God\u201d.\n\nHe argued that those asking Ndigbo to sit at home do not know what Ndigbo go through to pay their school fees, medical fees, house rents, shop rents, upkeep and numerous bills. But they stay in their safe havens to dish out frivolous orders when no one has elected or appointed them as lords over Ndigbo, particularly when they are not doing anything to solve Igbo problems but rather compounding them with threats of violence, rebellious acts and attracting wars and genocide against Ndigbo.\n\nHe added that : \u201d No doubt, President Buhari\u2019s government is the worst for Ndigbo and so many other ethnic groups in Nigeria. And with that, we are not alone in this carnage. But nevertheless, we have to manage the situation very well in order to safe guard our people through this trying period\u201d.\n\nIPOB Australia, commends MASSOB for also shifting its sit-at-home\n\nIPOB also applauded the Comrade Uchenna Madu-led Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State Of Biafra, MASSOB\u2019s decision to shift, like IPOB did, the observation of sit-at-home protest from Sunday May 30th to Monday May 31st 2021, to allow Church activities to hold across Biafra land and the Diaspora.\n\nThis was disclosed in a statement by IPOB\u2019s Director of Socials and Leader, Community Affairs Committee, IPOB Victoria, Australia, Mazi Nnamdi Nwokedi, in a statement made available to Vanguard.\n\nMazi Nwokedi\u2019s statement read in part: \u201cIPOB Victoria will host 2 days candle light dinner and procession programme in the heart of Melbourne Australia to remember Biafran fallen heroes.\n\n\u201cIPOB Victoria Community Australia also applauded the decision of Comrade Uchenna Madu leadership of the Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra, MASSOB, to observe a sit-at-home, on May 31st 2021.\n\n\u201cThe sit at home is not only to show respect for the ultimate sacrifice by our fallen heroes but also to send warning signals to Nigerian government that Biafrans are still speaking with one voice. There is no greater sacrifice than the ones made by over 3 million Biafrans, whose only wrong was their determination to live freely.

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Rotimi Ojomoyela\n\nEKITI\u2014VICE-Chairman of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum, NGF, Governor Aminu Tambuwal, yesterday, accused President Muhammadu Buhari of overreaching himself on the Executive Order 10 that canvassed judicial and legislative autonomies for states.\n\nTambuwal, who is the governor of Sokoto State, noted that the NGF expected President Buhari to have consulted widely before issuing the order, saying exercising such powers unilaterally was tantamount to illegality.\n\nHe spoke during an Attorney-General\u2019s Colloquium, organised by the Ekiti State Ministry of Justice Academy in honour of the retiring Chief Judge of the state, Justice Ayodeji Daramola.\n\nSpeaking on the topic \u2018The Judicial Autonomy: Perspective of the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum\u2019, Tambuwal said Buhari was ill-advised in issuing the order that craved judicial autonomy for states, adding that such illegal voyage undermined the powers of the governors.\n\nHis words: \u201cAs Governors of the 36 states on the platform of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum, let me state very clearly that we are unequivocally committed to the autonomy of the judiciary and the legislature.\n\n\u201cThe recent misunderstanding on the financial autonomy of the Judiciary is predicated on the need to establish an implementation framework to the 4th Alteration of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in Section 121(3). What we have questioned, and we have made this known at every opportunity, is the process of implementing this provision of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cAs governors, we will be failing in our responsibility if we refuse to draw the attention of the President, stakeholders and the country to grave concerns about the constitutionality of Executive Order 10 of 2020. That was the basis of the position that we took on Executive Order 10.\n\n\u201cThe Executive Order 10 ostensibly intended to support the implementation of judicial financial autonomy, was completely unnecessary and ill-advised.

I have received a lot of calls that there was a Fulani herdsman suicide bomber in Afikpo and this is really unfortunate. The accident that happened was a self-inflicted accident by a Mobile Policeman.\u201d\n\nHe urged the people of Afikpo to go about their normal businesses peacefully.\n\nIn respect to the the South East regional security outfit, Ebube-Agu, Governor Umahi pointed out that \u201cEbube-Agu has come to stay.\n\n\u201cEbube-Agu is backed by law which is a lawful demand by the good people of the South East and it\u2019s very unfortunate that some people believe that everything is politics. If you are law-abiding and you are in the state, you will enjoy the protection of the conventional security and the Ebube-Agu security.\n\n\u201cEbube-Agu can arrest by the reason of the law. Ebube-Agu has the powers to arrest and send the person to the Police to be prosecuted\u201d.\n\nUmahi also urged the youths to eschew violence and criminality.\n\n\u201cFinally, let me appeal to our youths. You have no reason to go into crime; you have no reason to be brainwashed. We have made contingent provision for our youth\u2019s empowerment. If you still engage in any form of criminality, you will regret it.\u201d\n\nOn the sit-at-home order slated to hold on the 30th and 31st of May, 2021 as ordered by IPOB, Governor Umahi reminded the people that \u201cThe Biafra we need is this development that we are doing.\n\nAnywhere the South East people are being marginalized, we are articulating them and we are taking them to the national.\u201d\n\nGovernor Umahi is hopeful that at the end of all the competitions with participants from primary and secondary schools in the state, tertiary institutions and the development centres, with grand finale in Abakaliki, those that will represent the state in future sports events will emerge.\n\n\u201cThe winners in the zone will be heading to the state capital, Abakaliki to compete with other zonal champions in order to decide the overall best teams.\u201d\n\nReiterates commitment to protection of\n\nlives, property\n\nAlso speaking yesterday, Ebonyi State Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Orji Uchenna Orji in line with Governor Umahi said the protection of lives and property of the people of the state remains a priority.\n\nHe spoke in Abakaliki in an interview with newsmen.\n\nAccording to him, the state government has a social contract to guarantee the safety and security of the people at all times.\n\n\u201cPeople of Ebonyi and other residents in the state are law abiding and obedient to constituted authorities. And we do believe that when we have a peaceful environment, it guarantees development, it guarantees economic progress of the people.\n\n\u201cWe are mindful that South-East needs a lot of attention and interventions by the federal government to enable it harness its potential that will trigger economic growth and development.\n\n\u201cSo, all these concerns are being synthesized to ensure that the zone is not in any way left out in the development programmes of the federal government,\u201d Orji said.\n\nThe commissioner noted that delegates from Ebonyi to the zonal public hearing on the amendment to the 1999 constitution would articulate the concerns of the state and make their presentations during the sitting.\n\n\u201cThe delegates will look into the expressions of worries by our people on the issues of the provisions of the constitution, especially on devolution of powers and issues that will trigger even development among the comity of states.\n\n\u201cWe want to assure our people that all is going to be well. Gov. Dave Umahi is very proactive, he is up and doing in engaging all necessary stakeholders including those aggrieved and those that feel that violent agitation is the solution.The governor is engaging all of them to see how we can come together to chart the course of the destiny of our state to the glory of God,\u201d he added.\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Some Nigerian stakeholders have called on President Muhammadu Buhari to disclose spending details of all recovered funds for the past four years.\n\nDAILY POST reports that since the President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s first tenure when the Whistle-blowing policy was implemented on December 21 2016, the Federal Government via the anti-corruption programme has succeeded in recovering some looted government funds and assets from past leaders.\n\nThe FG on April 4, 2020 recovered over $311 million of the alleged stolen funds by the country\u2019s former military ruler, General Sani Abacha, from the United States and Jersey.\n\nOn December 2017, Switzerland repatriated $322 million Abacha loot to the country as part of agreement between the two countries in 2004 during Olusegun Obasanjo\u2019s regime.\n\nRecall also that on August 14, 2020, the Republic of Ireland agreed to return about N2,514,651,800 (\u20ac5.5 million) stolen by Sani Abacha to Nigeria.\n\nThe Federal Government on July 28 2020, said it recovered over N800 billion in looted funds.\n\nThe Minister for Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, while confirming the amount recovered, said the government also secured the conviction of over 1,400 persons.\n\nAccording to him, \u201dThis administration\u2019s fight against corruption is as strong as ever, and we have the records to back up this claim,\u201d Mr Muhammed said.\n\n\u201cThis administration has recorded over 1,400 convictions, including high profile ones, and recovered funds in excess of N800 billion, not to talk of forfeiture of ill-gotten properties. This is no mean feat,\u201d he added.\n\nIn another development, The Attorney-General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, on May 18 2021 said the government of the United Kingdom repatriated to Nigeria, the sum of \u00a34.2million looted by associates and family members of a convicted former governor of Delta State, James Ibori.\n\nAccording to Malami, The FG has recovered a total of $700 million looted funds in the last four years.\n\nHe also stated that the government \u201cis still working with our international partners and other countries to ensure that all Nigeria\u2019s assets that are identified are recovered.\u201d\n\nRecall that the United States Embassy in Nigeria on May 7 2020 revealed that another $319m (N121bn) Sani Abacha loot was in the United Kingdom and France.\n\nCiting the current economic situation in the country, some Nigerians have demanded to know what has happened to the recovered funds.\n\nThe Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammadu Sa\u2019ad Abubakar III on Tuesday called on President Buhari to explain to Nigerians how his government spent the recovered fund.\n\nHe stated this in Sokoto State at zonal dialogue with stakeholders on the National Ethics and Integrity Policy, organized by the Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, in collaboration with the Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related Offences Commission for the northwest zone.\n\nThe Sultan who was represented by the Waziri Sokoto, Prof. Sambo Wali Junaidu, said keeping mum on the recovered loots despite questions from some Nigerians would have negative effects on the fight against corruption in the country.\n\n\u201cThe government owes Nigerians an explanation, we want to know how much billions of naira was recovered from our past leaders. Where the monies are and what are they doing with them?\n\n\u201cThis explanation is necessary considering the state of our education and other infrastructure like roads which need serious government attention,\u201d he said\n\nSimilarly, the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project, SERAP, a few days ago, asked President Buhari to disclose to Nigerians the spending details of the $700 million looted funds which the FG claimed it had recovered.\n\nIn a statement dated May 22, 2021 issued by SERAP Deputy Director, Kolawole Oluwadare, the organization also asked the president to disclose the list and location of projects completed with the money, as well as details of the contractors that executed the projects to enable Nigerians know the benefit of the fight against corruption to the nation.\n\nSERAP said, \u201cDisclosing spending details of the recovered $700m loot, and spending plans for the \u00a34.2m loot would promote transparency, accountability, and be entirely consistent with your constitutional oath of office to ensure the well-being of Nigerians.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Rights organization, the FG could suspend its move to borrow fresh N2.3trillion ($6.18bn) external loan and make use of the recovered loots to fund the 2021 budget.\n\nAn On-Air Personality, John Omale who spoke with DAILY POST correspondent from Benue State said President Buhari needs to do the needful and clear the air on what looted funds have been used for.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIt is not just enough to tell us how much they have recovered. They should also tell us where the money has been channelled to.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be recovering all these monies and still be borrowing as if the country has nothing in the treasury.\n\n\u201cWe want to see the impact of that money. Which road have they constructed with the money\u201d?\n\nA member of the Nigerian Union of Teachers who preferred not to be mentioned in print for fear of victimisation said keeping mum on the use of the money would bring a setback in the fight against corruption.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I appreciate President Buhari\u2019s administration on the recovery so far. Until the administration came up, most of us were not aware that such money belonging to the nation was hanging somewhere.\n\n\u201cWe have had other past administrations but none was able to go this far, so we must give them that accolades.\n\n\u201cI also think that being transparent on the issue would help them gain confidence from the society. Tell them what you have done with the money or what you intend to do with it\u201d, she said.\n\nEfforts to reach the Accountant General of the Federation, Ahmed Idris, for comment on the report proved abortive as at press time.",

          "text": "The President, Christian Lawyers in Africa, Barrister Sunny Abayomi Akanni, has alleged that the constitutional review exercise embarked on by the 9th Senate may end up like the previous ones in the country which till date had remained inconclusive.\n\nHe said, \u201cl am sure that if this Senate will do the constitutional review we (Nigerians) are asking for, they will become the only lawmakers that may have made Nigerians happy but nothing may come out of it and l will not be surprised. But l am praying for them that they should just wake up and have the courage to do what Nigerians are asking them to do.\u201d\n\nSpeaking exclusively with DAILY POST on Wednesday in Kaduna on the sideline of the ongoing constitutional review exercise, the Kaduna and Abuja based legal practitioner noted that if the Senate failed to do what Nigerians are asking them to do, \u201cIf not one way or the other, certain things may force us to do what we need to do.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe are believing and hoping that the exercise will be fruitful. This is not the first constitutional review exercise that l have participated in. I have not seen fundamental changes that we are looking for because the 1999 constitution is not a constitution for Nigeria, the constitution was imposed on us. If you read it, the prefixes, it was given to us by a decree, so we are looking for a constitution that will be the constitution of the people of Nigeria and that is whyl said, l hope the exercise will be fruitful.\u201d\n\nHe noted that Nigerians are talking of Nigeria as a Federal Republic of Nigeria, adding that there is nothing Federal in Nigeria. \u201cAll we see are governors going to Abuja to go and collect money, that is not federation, \u201d he stressed.\n\nHe explained, \u201cIf you said a federating unit, the State should be a unit that generates its own money, spends it and sends some to the central government. If this is done in this nation, Nigeria will become great.\u201d\n\nThe former President, Christian Lawyers Fellowship of Nigeria observed that Nigerians are talking about regions, stressing that constitutionally, the six regions are illegal because they are not in the constitution. It is 36 states and Abuja that we have in the constitution, the six geopolitical zones came into play not in the constitution.\n\nHe noted that if the country wants the regions to be constitutional, it should be done properly so that they would be allowed to develop at their pace, allow them make money, have their police and have quite a lot of other things so that when anybody sees it, he would say it is a regional government.\n\nHe lamented that the former constitutional review exercises have no conclusive outcome, adding that the National Conference report of 2014 is somewhere wasting away.\n\nHe noted, \u201cSo what is wrong with those ones that had no conclusions? There are no results coming out of those discussions, so it looks as if we are wasting our time and resources. Some of us are angry because the present Senate is half way to end its tenure, they will tell us that they don\u2019t have time. If you know you want to do it constitutionally, begin it in earnest, that is at the right time, go round the country, get opinion, put it together and let\u2019s forge ahead.\u201d\n\nHe is of the belief that some structures in the country have bottlenecks, pointing out that a police Commissioner cannot take instructions from a governor but from the Inspector General of Police.\n\nHe explained that the governor is handicapped as he or she could not tell the soldiers, police or security agencies to do something unless with the permission of the federal government.\n\nHe called on Nigerians to have hope in the future, assuring that things would take shape for the overall development of the country.",

          "text": "Olusegun Bamgbose, National Coordinator, Concerned Advocates for Good Governance, CAGG, has noted that the senior special assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Media and Publicity, Garba is now de facto leader of Nigeria.\n\nHe called on President Buhari to address Nigerians as soon as possible, adding that Shehu lacks the constitutional right to act as President of Nigeria.\n\nBamgbose, a chieftain of the New Nigerian Peoples Party, NNPP, also lamented that the office of the Vice President has been relegated to the background with Shehu taken charge at the Presidency .\n\nAccording to the senior lawyer, Nigerians no longer know when Shehu is airing his personal opinion or speaking the mind of the President.\n\nBamgbose was angered by the recent reactions of the Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, and Shehu, to the outcome of the recent Southern Governors\u2019 meeting in Asaba Delta State.\n\nThe Governors had met to deliberate on the security challenges facing their region and thus pronounced a ban on open grazing.\n\nMalami had kicked against the governors\u2019 decision, comparing open grazing by herders, to spare parts dealers in the North.\n\nAnd a few days later, Shehu came up to rescue the situation by informing Nigerians that the resolutions of the Southern Governors were of questionable legality.\n\nBamgbose described this as ridiculous, adding that it clearly shows that the Presidency is uncoordinated.\n\n\u201cNigerians are confused as to identify who exactly is in control of the affairs of this nation,\u201d he told DAILY POST.\n\n\u201cWhen the Presidency discovered that the statement of Malami could not sail through, Garba Shehu came up to rescue the situation by informing Nigerians that the resolutions of the Southern Governors were of questionable legality.\n\n\u201cIt was equally reported that President Buhari backed Malami\u2019s stand on the resolutions of the Southern Governors. This scenario has clearly shown that the Presidency is highly uncoordinated.\n\n\u201cOne won\u2019t be wrong to assert that we have multiple presidencies in Nigeria, in essence, we have more than one President in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn the real sense of it, Buhari may not be in charge. We now have proxies ruling this nation. This is tantamount to the bastardization of the presidency.\n\n\u201cWhy won\u2019t President Buhari who went round the country to campaign, come out and address the nation on a national TV broadcast?\n\n\u201cGarba Shehu has now become the de facto leader of Nigeria. One does not know when he is airing his personal opinion or speaking the mind of the President.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s high time President Buhari addressed the nation. Garba Shehu lacks the constitutional right to act as President of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis confusion in the Presidency must be brought to an end. Its most unfortunate that the office of the Vice President has been relegated to the background. This is a constitutional mess. We need to correct this abnormally in the Presidency.\n\n\u201cThis is why we must have to embrace National dialogue. We need to give room for restructuring of the country.\n\n\u201cNigerians don\u2019t understand what is going on in the Presidency. Every Dick, Harry, and Tom claim to speak for the Presidency. This is not helping matters. This is belittling the Presidency.\u201d",

Is Afikpo in a state of war and is the school premises the theatre of war?\n\n\u201cSupposing we go by the line of the Ebonyi State police that the policeman was carrying teargas Canister that exploded and killed him, the question is, what was a policeman doing alone in a peaceful school environment with a teargas that exploded and killed him?\n\n\u201cWas there riot in that school environment that only him went to quell? Ebonyi State government and the Ebonyi State Command are twin evils and haven\u2019t told Nigerians the whole truth and nothing but the truth and Nigerians should take their conclusion with a pinch of salt.

          "title": "Constitution review public hearing: Senate gets requests for state police, power devolution, new state in S\u2019East",
          "text": "From Bamigbola Gbolagunte, Akure; Noah Ebije, Kaduna; Paul Osuyi, Asaba; Lukman Olabiyi; Tunde Omolehin, Sokoto; Sola Ojo, Kaduna; Stanley Uzoaru, George Onyejiuwa Owerri and Chukwudi Nweje\n\nThe Senate Committee on the review of the 1999 Constitution (As Amended) began public hearing yesterday, in the various geo-political zones across the country, with renewed clamour for creation of additional state in the South East, state police and power devolution among other demands listed by the State governors and other stakeholders.\n\nKaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai and his Delta and Plateau counterparts, Ifeanyi Okowa and Simon Lalong, respectively, top the list of governors calling for power devolution and true federalism\n\nEl Rufai argued that devolution of powers is necessary because the current structure overburdens the federal government with too many responsibilities which it cannot efficiently handle.\n\nThe governor further recalled that the APC Committee on True Federalism, which he headed, had identified legislative interventions that the National Assembly can more easily undertake to achieve a truly balanced, equitable and fair federal structure.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe reality of our security situation today requires that Nigeria must strengthen its military and security agencies. This includes decentralising the police to enable the states to exercise effective control in securing their residents and communities.\n\n\u201cWe need to have federal, state and community police, with each granted sufficient powers to make them effective in securing the areas assigned to them and cooperating closely with each other.\n\n\u201cThe power to hire and fire police officers should revert fully and totally to the Inspector General of Police, under the supervision of the National Police Council, as envisaged by the Constitution.\u2019\u2019\n\nIn Asaba, Delta state capital, which hosted the public hearing Delta, Bayels and Edo states, Over Ifeanyi Okowa said there should be \u201cacceptable and legitimate division of powers among different tiers of government; a written constitution delineating such division; the coordinate supremacy of the levels of government with regard to their respective functions; and a considerable measure of autonomy \u2013 fiscal, legislative and judicial \u2013 of the Federal Government and the federating units.\u201d\n\nThe governor, who was represented by the Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Sheriff Oborevwori, advocated that revenues collected by the Federal Government through the parastatals of NNPC, NLNG, CBN, NIMASA, FAAN and other similar agencies should be remitted into the federation account.\n\n\u2022We want amendments that\u2019ll enhance Nigeria\u2019s unity, prosperity \u2013 Ugwuanyi\n\nEnugu State Governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi declared his administration\u2019s support for constitution amendments that will enhance the nation\u2019s unity and prosperity \u201cin an environment where justice, fairness and equity shall prevail\u201d.\n\nThe governor enjoined all relevant institutions, civil society organisations, stakeholders and entire Enugu state citizenry to avail themselves the opportunity of the zonal public hearing to participate in the national conversation.\n\n\u201cI, particularly, acknowledge the leader of the team and Senator representing Enugu West Senatorial District in the 9th Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Distinguished Senator Prof. Ike Ekweremadu, CFR. I also recognise in a special way, Distinguished Senator, Chuka Utazi, who represents me and the people of Enugu North Senatorial District in the Red Chamber of the National Assembly.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on behalf of his colleagues from Enugu, Anambra and Ebonyi states, the Speaker of the Enugu State House of Assembly, Edward Ubosi, assured the people of South East geo-political zone that the state legislature will first seek their opinions before adopting the outcome of the constitutional review by the National Assembly.\n\nThe Speaker, who maintained that constitution alteration is a continuous exercise, commended the 9th National Assembly for taking up the task again and thanked governor Ugwuanyi for providing the enabling atmosphere for the event.\n\nIn his vote of thanks, Senator Ekweremadu, also applauded governor Ugwuanyi, who he described as \u201cInsurance Guru\u201d, for his immense contributions towards the hosting of the zonal public hearing in Enugu.\n\n\u2022Sanwo-Olu pushes for special status for Lagos\n\nGovernor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who declared the Lagos centre of the public hearing open, yesterday, demanded a special economic status for the state, saying the progress and prosperity of Nigeria is inextricably linked to the progress and prosperity of Lagos State.\n\nSanwo-Olu also demanded for a State Police and entrenchment of true fiscal federalism in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFor us in Lagos State, the issues of State Police and fiscal federalism are at the top of the priority in this ongoing review process. Equally fundamental, particularly, for us in Lagos State, is the issue of a Special Economic Status for Lagos, considering our place in the national economy and the special burdens we bear by virtue of our large population and limited land mass.\n\n\u201cI believe the need for this Special Status has been sufficiently articulated and justified. It suffices for me, at this point, to restate that this request is by no means a selfish one, but one that is actually in the interest of every Nigerian and of Nigeria as a nation,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022Constitution reference point of democracy \u2013 Tambuwal\n\nSokoto State Governor, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, represented by his Deputy, Alhaji Muhammadu Manir Dan Iya, described the Constitution as the reference point of democracy.\n\nHe said: \u201cAnd in the 22 years of Nigeria\u2019s experience in government by representation, our gains have more than justified our challenges.\n\n\u201cAll constitutions are, therefore, work in progress, because they are subject to the changing needs and aspirations the people, at different times.\n\n\u201cAnd constitutional reviews are the processes for ensuring this guiding document plays that function.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, Kebbi State Governor, Senator Abubakar Atiku Bagudu noted that, the exercise is coming at the time of Nigeria\u2019s life when more dialogue is in dire need.\n\n\u201cIt is an opportune time to, therefore, collectively brainstorm on how to discuss these issues, for the country to move forward in unison, by having a more robust constitution.\u201d\n\n\u20221999 Constitution outdated- Senator Uba Sani\n\nThe Senator representing Kaduna Central Zone, Uba Sani noted that the 1999 was outdated with some contentious issues that needed to be addressed, hence, the need to review it.\n\nSpeaking in Kaduna Sani noted that the Constitution was last reviewed 22 years ago which had brought crisis into governance.\n\n\u2022UN Women coalition advocates more in governance, inclusive language\n\nThe Coalition of Women Leaders in Kaduna State, in collaboration with UN Women advocated for an increase of women\u2019s rights, especially in political leadership, to enhance the participation of women in governance.\n\nThe coalition also called on the representatives of the committee currently meeting in Kaduna to be conscious of inclusive language as they amend the 1999 constitution of the federal republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u2022State police, additional states dominate S\u2019East constitution review\n\nThe public hearing on the review of the 1999 Constitution which kicked off in Owerri, Imo State, yesterday, was dominated by popular agitations for State policing and creation of another State in South East.\n\nChief of Staff to Abia State government, ACB Agbazuari, while submitting his memorandum, noted that State police will strengthen the peaceful coexistence in the southeast and check security challenges.\n\nHe urged members of the senate committee review to look into their submission in view of granting their request.\n\nSimilarly, Chief Theo Okire, who represented Aba Mass Movement, submitted that an additional states should be created in the South East.\n\nHe said if additional states are created in the South East, it would bring an even political atmosphere and less marginalisation of the zone.\n\nOther memoranda submitted were calls on gender equity, revenue allocation system, youth empowerment in politics, maintaining standards in professions in the country and accordance of constitutional roles to traditional institutions.\n\nGover Hope Uzodimma who also seized the opportunity to warn his detractors said: \u201cLet me, however, use this auspicious opportunity to tell these alarmists and pretenders to love of Ndigbo, that they are not more Igbo than I am and they do not love Igbo more than I do.\n\n\u201cThe difference is that while they want immediate and sentimental public applause, I want enduring prescriptions that can comprehensively address the Igbo challenge in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWithout sounding simplistic, what we seek is justice and equity. When we talk of restructuring or devolution of power, we are talking actually of having an environment created for us to unleash our potential and talent without let or hindrance.\n\n\u201cWe are also talking of being treated equally like every other part of Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\u20221999 constitution amendment effort in futility, Babalola tells NASS\n\nLegal luminary Aare Afe Babalola (SAN) has charged the 9th National Assembly to, rather than waste time and resources at amending the 1999 constitution, convoke a National Constitutional Conference to fashion out a new true federal constitution.\n\nHe said the way out is to return the country to a parliamentary system of government and the 1963 structure.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that there is no way the National Assembly can amend the 1999 constitution to cure the inherent defects in the 1999 constitution. First, you cannot cure fraud. Second, it is impossible, by way of amendment, to take away the military system of government under the 1999 constitution or the power and control of public funds by the President. Or can we, by way of amendment, change the Judicial powers of the President under the 1999 constitution? The fact remains that you cannot amend a Coconut tree which has no branches to become and Iroko tree which has branches. It is a well-known fact that everything about the 1999 constitution is wound around the Presidential system of government. Why then is the National Assembly afraid of calling a National Constitutional Conference to fashion out a new true federal constitution and come up with a Parliamentary system of government as we had in 1963,\u201d he further said.\n\n\u2022N/Assembly\u2019ll provide a constitution that\u2019ll Nigeria challenges \u2013 Omo-Agege\n\nDeputy Senate President and Chairman, Senate Committee on Constitution Review, Sen. Ovie Omo-Agege has expressed the determination of the National Assembly to provide Nigerians with a fair and inclusive constitution that will address the challenges of the nation.\n\n\u201cThe focus of this committee is how to manage the review exercise in a fair, inclusive, credible and transparent manner. At the commencement of this 9th Senate, we had set for ourselves a legislative agenda as a basis on which we are to be assessed. Sitting prominently in that agenda is the need to address , by way of constitutional amendments, topical issues like judicial and Electoral Reforms, Local Government Autonomy, and devolution of powers.\u201d",

          "text": "By Chukwudi Nweje\n\nThe Nigerian Press Organisation (NPO) has charged the Federal Government to immediately take steps towards addressing the socio-economic, political and security challenges threatening the existence and unity of the country.\n\nThe body comprising Newspaper Proprietors\u2019 Association of Nigeria (NPAN), Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE), and Nigeria Union Of Journalists (NUJ) also condemned the high cost of governance, outrageous allowances and flamboyant lifestyles of political officers and appealed to politicians and state actors to minimise their inflammatory rhetorics to reduce tension and ease the growing sense of fear among Nigerians\n\nIt also called for the pruning of the excessive powers vested in the Federal Government. It said the country\u2019s resources hold innumerable economic and soft power advantages for the well being of the entire population if well managed.\n\nThese positions are contained in a communique jointly signed today by Kabiru A. Yusuf, President NPAN and President NPO; Mustapha Isa, President of NGE and Chris Isiguzo, President of NUJ after the end of its recent meeting in Abuja.\n\nThe NPO tasked the Federal Government to immediately implement the report of the Kaduna Governor, Mallam Nasir el\u2019Rufai-led committee report on true federalism and restructuring even as it also called for the implementation of the Steve Orosanye report on restructuring and rationalisation of Federal Government parastatals, commissions and agencies, which provides a veritable road map for arresting the unsustainable high cost of governance.\n\nThe El\u2019Rufai committee inaugurated in August 2017 by the Progressive Governors Forum, the umbrella body of governors elected on the All Progressives Congress (APC) ticket, submitted its report in January 2018,recommending the merger of states to boost their solvency, review of derivation, devolution of power, state police and other far-reaching adjustments to the structure of governance.\n\nSaid the NPO: \u201cA Federal system of government, particularly in a country like Nigeria which is an overbearing centre is counterproductive to the development of the centre itself and the component units. To leave the Federal Government with 68 items under the Exclusive Legislative List, including policing, is a recipe for unending destructive tension in the struggle for advantage among the federating units. It explains why our country is seemingly overwhelmed by non-state actors engaged in criminality and separatist agitations.\u201d\n\nIt cautioned the Federal Government on the frequency at which it solicits foreign loan as it may spell doom in the future considering the dwindling relevance of crude oil, the country\u2019s major revenue earner in the world market.\n\n\u201cThere is a need to avoid the debt overhang inherent in excessive borrowing. We are aware that borrowing is good so long as such loans are deployed to funding enduring development projects, within the GDP ratio. However, the current borrowing in the face of the slide in the value of the country\u2019s number one revenue earner-oil remains worrisome,\u201d NPO said.\n\nIt called for the immediate passing of the Petroleum Industry Bill, (PIB) and asked the government to put pressure on the National Assembly to hasten action on the bill.\n\n\u201cThe Bill has gone into our history as the longest bill to ever go through legislative processes. It is of common knowledge that the petroleum industry has been long overdue for an overhaul and the passage of the bill will be a major boost. That the bill has stayed this long in the National Assembly militates against improved corporate governance in the oil sector.\u201d\n\nThe group lamented that Nigeria has been embroiled lately in profound socio-economic, political and security challenges that threaten its very existence as reflected in ethnic divisions and separatist agitations in the country, with growing fears that an implosion is imminent.\n\n\u201cToday, criminality \u2013 kidnapping for ransom, banditry, arson, killings \u2013 defines the everyday reality for a good number of our citizens.\u201d",

It offers another opportunity for us to continue to work hard for an acceptable constitution that will meet the aspirations of Nigerians in general. This also provides for us in the South East the opportunity to address those issues that have been bothering us in the recent past.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the governor of Abia State, Okezie Ikpeazu, represented by his Chief of Staff, ACB Agbazuere called for the devolution of powers, state and local government policing and fiscal federalism.\n\nGovernor Ikpeazu also advocated a review of the current revenue allocation formula and argued that the current system under the Nigerian Constitution is not beneficial to states.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe current revenue allocation formula allocates more funds to the Federal Government at the detriment of the states and local governments. Secondly, the system discourages striving for an increased Internally Generated Revenue (IGR).

The governor lamented that the people are losing confidence in the country because a number of issues have been allowed to fester for too long.\n\nWhile reiterating his unwavering commitment to the unity of the nation, Governor Akeredolu noted that issues of insecurity and true federalism have affected many things in the county, including the trust of the people.\n\n\u201cI kept making a case anytime I have the opportunity. My circumstance cannot make me believe in secession. My wife is from the South East. My sons married from other regions outside the South West. But strong points have been made. Everybody wants to see fairness and federalism. Those are the areas \u2013 is this how to run a federal government? Is it an inclusive one? How do we have fair representation? People are worried. This constitution review, your efforts, I pray it should be accepted. Our people believe that there must be dialogue. People are saying \u2018we want national dialogue.\u2019 How we convoke it, I don\u2019t know. I believe those are issues we must look at,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Anglican Bishop of Diocese of Amichi, Anambra State, Rev. Ephraim Ikeakor has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to be transparent and take full charge of Nigeria and address the current insecurity ravaging the country or resign.\n\nHe also absolved the people of South East and Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) of any involvement in the security challenges, especially burning of police stations and killing of security agents in region, alleging d that mercenaries might have been hired from outside to destabilise peace of the zone.\n\nIkeakor made the comments while addressing journalists in a pre-synod press conference held at St Andrew\u2019s Anglican Church Ebenato, Nnewi South Local Government Area of the State. The cleric insisted that Nigerians would want to know who between the President and the Presidency was in charge of the affairs of the country.\n\n\u201cNigeria is at the crossroads; security has collapsed, education has collapsed, medical health system is in shambles. It is not only shameful, but also extremely embarrassing that our leaders, including Mr President still travel overseas to seek medical care. Why can\u2019t they fix our hospitals like what they see and use overseas.\n\n\u201cThe President, if he is still there, because we are confused on who is in charge, we do not know if the country is ruled by the President or the Presidency. Who is really in charge. People are being killed and places burnt, yet the President has not visited any of the states involved.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022DPR targets to remit N900bn to FAAC in Q2\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja and Peter Uzoho in Lagos\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has expressed interest in purchasing a 20 per cent minority equity stake in Dangote Refinery, Lagos, reputed to be Africa\u2019s biggest oil refining facility and the world\u2019s largest single-train plant.\n\nThe 650,000 barrels per day (bpd) integrated refinery, expected to process a variety of light and medium grades of crude, including petrol and diesel as well as jet fuel and polypropylene is owned by Nigeria\u2019s Dangote Group and is worth about $15 billion.\n\nIt is designed to produce up to 50 million litres of petrol and 15 million litres of diesel a day, roughly 10.4 million tonnes of the product, 4.6 million tonnes of diesel, and 4 million tonnes of jet fuel per year, in addition to having a fertiliser plant, which will utilise the refinery by-products as raw materials.\n\nNNPC Chief Operating Officer, Refining and Petrochemicals, Mr. Mustapha Yakubu, unfolded the investment plans yesterday at the end of a two-day Nigeria Oil and Gas Opportunity Fair (NOGOF), 2021, tagged: \u201cLeveraging Opportunities and Synergies for Post Pandemic Recovery of the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry.\u201d\n\nHe spoke just as the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) has said it is targeting to generate and remit about N900 billion into the Federation Account in the second quarter of 2021.\n\nYakubu said discussions were already ongoing with the Dangote Group for the acquisition of the stake.\n\nHe stated during the virtual event that the collaboration will further ensure undisrupted product supply to Nigerians when the deal materialises.\n\nHe added that one of its divisions, the Greenfield Refining Projects Division (GRPD) was handling the negotiations.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have what we call the green field refinery and the Greenfield Refining Projects Division (GRPD) of the NNPC. What we do, our strategy is to collaborate and seek strategic partnerships with private investors.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, we have Dangote Refinery, which is the 650,000 capacity barrels per day plus a mini 80,000 tonnes per annum petrochemical plant.\n\n\u201cWhat are we doing there? I can tell you today that we are seeking to have a 20 per cent minority stake in Dangote Refinery as part of our collaboration and you know that there\u2019s a huge quantity of crude for that refinery.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s 650,000 barrels, going into a single crude distillation unit (CDU).\n\nWhen that comes on board, it will also wet the nation for us.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the corporation is also interested in partnering with the African Refinery in Port Harcourt, a co-location facility, the CNCEC Chinese group, which is interested in building two refineries in Nigeria, the Waltersmith modular plant, in addition to collaborating with Azikel refineries on condensate production.\n\nYakubu stated that notwithstanding the global push for renewables, Nigeria has a local, domestic and regional market for hydrocarbons.\n\nHe added that Africa will continue to rely on fossil fuels at least in the next 20 years.\n\nHe said the country would not just fold its arms and do nothing with its hydrocarbons just because the International Energy Agency (IEA) has predicted a net-zero emissions scenario by 2050.\n\n\u201cToday, when you are bringing products into Nigeria, they disappear to neighbouring countries. There\u2019s nowhere in countries around Nigeria that they sell fuel for less than N400 per litre. So, there\u2019s a market,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the country\u2019s non-functional refineries, he said there was a deliberate effort to power the refineries down because of the need to do a full rehabilitation beyond the regular turnaround maintenance.\n\n\u201cWe believe the only way to do that is to power them down to reduce some of the cost. We have heard that we are spending so much money on the refineries, yet they are idle.\n\n\u201cOf course, there are costs associated with idle refineries; we have staff salaries and remuneration and then the power plant utility operations. And also we need to maintain the plants in terms of preservation and lost investments because they are assets that we believe can be brought to life,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stated that the NNPC was exiting the running of the country\u2019s four refineries, and it has recently called for bids from competent and qualified contractors for that purpose.\n\nYakubu explained that NNPC was not in the best position to run the refineries and has opted for a new model, the Operation and Maintenance (O&M) for the running of the facilities.\n\nHe added that it is important to bring in O&M professionals, especially given the fact that as an engineer in the NNPC, no matter how competent, the employee must exit when they hit 60 years of age.\n\nThe COO said Expression of Interest (EoI) for organisations that would run the refineries was already out and many people had been evaluated.\n\nHe expressed optimism that the NNPC will choose the best contractors to handle the project.\n\nAccording to him, it is becoming more difficult to get local lenders to finance fossil fuel businesses because of the renewable energy drive, adding that the NNPC is also looking for investors for the rehabilitation of its pipelines because they remain the best way to transport products from refineries to depots.\n\nDPR Targets N900bn Remittance into Federation Account in Q2\n\nThe DPR has said it is targeting to generate and remit about N900 billion into the Federation Account in the second quarter of the year.\n\nThe agency has also received over $20 billion investment proposals since the inauguration of the Oil and Gas Excellence Centre (NOGEC) in Lagos by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nThe Director of DPR, Mr. Sarki Auwalu, at a strategic management session with the management of the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) yesterday in Lagos, said the agency exceeded its first quarter revenue generation target by 6.99 per cent and that the actual amount it remitted was N452 billion.\n\nThe NEITI team was led by its Executive Secretary, Dr. Orji Ogbonnaya Orji, who said the team came to seek partnership with DPR on how to collectively ensure transparency and create value for Nigerians through the country\u2019s oil and gas sector.\n\nAuwalu added that the agency was working to double the first quarter remittance and is trying to support the government to deliver services to the people.\n\n\u201cJanuary to March, we exceeded our target by 6.99 per cent. Actual collection, first quarter, N452 billion already sent to government and between April, May and June, I think if we are lucky, we will double this.\n\n\u201cIt is expected to be around N900 billion, which is the budgeted figure. We are trying our best to support this government to make sure that this government really works for Nigerians,\u201d Auwalu said.\n\nHe stated that the agency was serious about recovering whatever was due to the government which could be through withholding service instruments and penalties.\n\nHe added that the agency would rather want more royalties than penalties as a business enabler and a revenue generator.\n\nAuwalu said this could be achieved through the various strategies adopted by the agency like automation of business and making sure that it improves transparency and accountability.\n\nHowever, the DPR boss said since the inauguration of the National Oil and Gas Excellence Centre (NOGEC) by the president, DPR had received investment proposals of over $20 billion from local and foreign investors.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

I think there is a need to have an in depth understanding of this. Some recoveries are for State governments \u2013 specific state governments. I know there was a time recovery on behalf Plateau, there was one for Bayelsa, there was one for Delta. Such recoveries goes specifically to thoseStatess.\u201d\n\nWhen further asked where the Ibori loot was paid into, Idris without mincing words, had said it was paid to Delta State government.\n\nWhen he was reminded that his claim was contrary to the stance of the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), who had said the agreement the federal government had with the British government was to use the repatriated loot to complete specific ongoing projects, Idris had said, \u201cNo, no, any recovery that is arising from looted funds from a particular State goes to the State.

          "text": "Southern Kaduna Peoples Union (SOKAPU) has sought a new state from the present Kaduna State to stop the bloody violence that seemed to defy solution in the state.\n\nThis was part of the presentation and defence of the SOKAPU memo during the North-West public constitution review hearing in Kaduna on Wednesday.\n\nSOKAPU President, Jonathan Asake, said the Southern and Northern Kaduna, infamous for incessant inter-ethnic and religious clashes for decades, have agreed that creating a new state from the present Kaduna State will solve the age-long problem.\n\n\"The wish of Southern Kaduna is to have a brand new constitution, not an amended one. In the absence of that, we are here to make our inputs as a people who have suffered suppression and oppression for a long time,\" he said in a report by Vanguard.\n\nHe added, \"Southern Kaduna is made up of 67 ethnic nationalities, spread in 13 of the 23 Local Government Areas (LGAs) of Kaduna state. It has a landmass of 26,000kmsq with an estimated population of 5.1 million. We are endowed with an educated population and with abundant natural resources.\n\n\"Our land size is greater than that of Kano State, which has a landmass of 20,000kmsq. Yet Kano is a state of its own with 44 LGAs. Our population is greater than 21 other states of the federation. Therefore, we are demanding the amendment of Section 8 of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, which makes it almost an impossible task for the creation of a new state.\n\n\"We have been demanding for a state of our own for over thirty years and Gurara state was among the 18 states proposed in the 2014 Confab report. We are demanding the creation of the Gurara state after the amendment. This will help in solving the incessant conflicts between our people and the other divide.\"\n\nSOKAPU also asked for removing the Land Use Act from the constitution and its amendment as a law so that communities and families could have larger control of their ancestral lands.\n\nSimilarly, the Northern part of Kaduna state, under the aegis of Kaduna Development Elders Initiatives, while defending the memo of the group, said, \"We are canvassing for the creation of New Kaduna state from the present Kaduna state and we want the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria amended to make this possible.\n\n\"Kaduna South has been complaining of marginalization ever since, even though chiefdoms have been given to them and they occupy 60% of the workforce of Kaduna state.\"",

          "text": "It has been 51 days since the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) shut all courts across the nation in protest against the non-implementation of financial autonomy for the judiciary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince the strike which started on April 6, activities of the court have been crippled with litigants bearing the brunt of the action.\n\nBut why is financial autonomy important for the judiciary?\n\nThe judiciary is the third arm of government in Nigeria which is responsible for the interpretation of laws. The other two are the executive and the legislature.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe judiciary is the guardian and protector of fundamental human rights as well as the arbiter of disputes among all levels of government. This is why the judiciary ought to independent so as to be free to perform its functions without fear or favour. This is the primary goal of separation of powers \u2014 to enable the three arms of government to be functionally independent of each other.\n\nBut despite the constitutional provision, the judiciary is still dependent on the executive (governors at the state level) for their funding.\n\nPresident Muhammadu in May 2020 signed an executive order granting financial autonomy to both the judicial and the legislative arms of government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe president\u2019s decision was met with commendation, especially from the judiciary but state governors expressed concerns over its constitutionality and financial implications.\n\nThe gazetting of the order was, however, suspended after the president met with the governors.\n\nHOW IS THE JUDICIARY FUNDED?\n\nIt is important to understand how the state judiciary in Nigeria currently operates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe judiciary is funded through the state ministry of finance.\n\nExplaining how it is being funded by the ministry of finance, Jimoh Alonge, treasurer of the union, told TheCable that \u201cas a chief judge of a state, you don\u2019t have right over employing or replacing workers even if you are short of manpower. It is the governor that does that. Judiciary workers salary is prepared in the state ministry of finance. Meaning if a staff dies or retires, they just remove his name from the payroll. There is a state presently that had about 2000 or more workers but as we speak, they have just about 600 workers because the state government did not allow them to replace workers.\u201d\n\nCONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS\n\nA lot of people think the Executive Order 10 gave birth to the clamour for financial autonomy for the judiciary. But financial autonomy of the judiciary has been in the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria since 1999.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is clearly stated in section 81(2) (3), section 84 (1), (2), (3), (4) (7), 121(3) and section 162(9) of the constitution.\n\nThe constitution clearly states that any amount standing to the credit of the judiciary in the federation account/consolidated revenue fund of the federal and state governments shall be paid directly to the heads of courts concerned.\n\nLEGAL ACTION BY JUDICIARY STAFF UNION OF NIGERIA (JUSUN)\n\nIn 2013, JUSUN instituted a suit marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/667/13 against the National Judicial Council (NJC), the attorney-general of the federation and the attorney-generals of the states seeking judicial autonomy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn January 14, 2014, Adeniyi Ademola, judge of a federal high court in Abuja, gave judgment in favour of the union.\n\nAmong the reliefs granted, Ademola made \u201ca declaration that the 2nd-74th defendants\u2019 failure, neglect and/or refusal to pay the Funds/Amount standing to the credit of the States\u2019 Judiciary is a constitutional breach which has to be abated forthwith.\n\n\u201cThat an order is hereby made that the piece-meal payments/allocation of funds through the states\u2019 ministry of finance to the state\u2019s judiciary at the 2nd-74th defendants pleasure is unconstitutional, unprocedural cumbersome, null, void and be abated forthwith.\u201d\n\nThe judge also made an order mandating the 2nd-74th defendants to comply with the provision of section 162(9) of the 1999 constitution in the disbursement of funds to the head of courts forthwith.\n\nFINANCIAL AUTONOMY JUST FOR JUDGES?\n\nAlonge said: \u201cIf there is autonomy, it covers everyone in the judiciary.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you make a budget, you have capital and recurrent. The recurrent comprises salaries of workers and overhead cost of running the courts. The capital includes financing projects, buying cars and some other things. Autonomy is not only for the judges. In fact, the control of these funds is directly by the chief registrar of a state who is the chief accounting officer. The judges don\u2019t even touch money. The CJ can only give instructions on what to do. He is not a signatory to the account.\u201d\n\nSTATES THAT HAVE IMPLEMENTED AUTONOMY\n\nSince the commencement of the strike, some state governors have come out to declare their support for a financially independent judiciary.\n\nWhile Bala Mohammed, governor of Bauchi, and Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of Lagos, promised to implement autonomy for their state judiciary, Nyesom Wike, governor of Rivers, and Abdullahi Ganduje, governor of Kano, said their state judiciary already enjoy full autonomy.\n\nRecently, Ifeanyi Okowa, governor of Delta, also announced that the state\u2019s judiciary has been accorded full autonomy.\n\nBut JUSUN disagrees.\n\nAlonge said: \u201cNo state has implemented autonomy for the judiciary.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkowa\u2019s pronouncement is just a pronouncement. It has not been put into practice. All the judiciary except Anambra and Nasarawa state that allows the judiciary prepare their finance before the state house of representatives, it is the state ministry of finance that prepares their salaries.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo we can say Anambra and Nasarawa state has partially complied. But all other states have just been making noise.\n\n\u201cSome governors claim that because they buy vehicles for judges, or sometimes give money for them to go abroad for treatment which is naturally supposed to come to them directly, they now claim to have complied with autonomy. That is not autonomy at all. Autonomy means total independence financially.\u201d\n\nPROPOSAL BY GOVERNORS\u2019 FORUM\n\nThere have been meetings with relevant stakeholders in an attempt to bring an end to the strike.\n\nThe Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) set up its own committee headed by Aminu Tambuwal, Sokoto governor, which subsequently proposed a template for the implementation of autonomy for the judiciary.\n\nThe governors, in their proposal, sought the creation of a State Account Allocation Committee (SAAC) to oversee the distribution of funds to the three arms of government at the state level. They also proposed the enactment of funds management laws for state judiciary and legislature.\n\nThe law, according to the proposal, will grant each arm \u201cthe power to manage its capital and recurrent expenditure in accordance with the provisions of Sections 6(5)(a) \u2013 (i), 81(3), 121(3) & Item 21(e) of the Third Schedule of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (As Amended) and other relevant laws\u201d.\n\nThe NGF said they will ensure that the states \u201cpass and assent to the funds management law as well as put in place implementation structures within a time frame not exceeding 45 days from the date of signing this document\u201d.\n\nJUSUN has, however, rejected some of the proposals made by the NGF.\n\nThe national working committee (NWC) of the union insisted that funds due to the state judiciary must be deducted from source starting from the May 2021 Federal Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) revenue.\n\nThe union said the strike will be called off if that is done.\n\nHOW DOES IT AFFECT ME?\n\nOne may ask: \u201cHow does financial autonomy for the judiciary affect a common man?\u201d\n\nThe absence of financial autonomy has made it difficult for some judges to be impartial in handling cases that involve the executive (governors). They are at the mercy of these governors because they determine their finance. After all, \u201dhe who pays the piper, dictates the tune\u201d.\n\nIf autonomy is granted, judges will be free to carry out their responsibilities without fear or favour. Election petitions could be determined on merit, justice may no longer be for the highest bidder.\n\nA taxi driver may not be denied bail because a judge received a bribe. And judges will fairly try politicians standing trial on fraud allegations without fear.",

Truth is, I reunited with the party almost a year ago now, but in spirit never left the ideals for which the party was founded upon. It is rather unfortunate that Governor Ben Ayade who constantly egged me to rejoin the party has himself had cause to leave,\u201d Duke said.\n\n\u201cA rather unfortunate decision for which I neither support nor condemn, as I\u2019m not privy to the details except his complaints of being stifled and unappreciated by the leadership of the party and certain elements of Cross River State origin at Abuja.\n\n\u201cIn our early to mid thirties buoyed by optimism and faith in our State and Nation, we took a plunge into the unknown world of politics. Providence smiled at us and thrust us into the limelight and leadership of national politics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn Cross River State, we took on the establishment and won a razor thin victory in 1999, but through firm and adroit leadership and adherence to the democratic principles of inclusion we soon brought largely all the political class in the state under the PDP and by 2007, we were perhaps the most PDP state in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cHowever, post 2007, the party\u2019s fortune started ebbing. An autocratic leadership style emerged, communication with its followers declined and emergence in the party was determined largely not by the party constitution or structures but by the whims of the States Chief Executive. This is the structure Gov Ayade inherited and has largely led us to where we are today.\n\n\u201cThe very top down political style we fought against prior 1999, instead of consultation, accommodation and inclusion reared its head to the extent that founding members of the party in the state including former state chairmen, senators, members of the National Assembly and I, over time opted out and this attrition has continued unabated to the extent that the Governor himself has left to seek pasture elsewhere.\u201d\n\nDuke added that the party needs to rebuild its structure for young aspirants to take over the mantle of leadership.",

          "text": "OPay is reportedly in talks to raise $400 million from investors at a valuation of $1.5 billion, according to an exclusive report from The Information.\n\nOPay is looking to raise funding to finance its expansion plan, having launched in Egypt this year. The payments giant says it processed $1.4 billion in payments in October 2020 alone, and that number also reportedly increased to $2 billion by December 2020.\n\nHaving done impressively in Nigeria since its launch in 2018, the new push for funding means that the company has bigger plans.\n\nAn Africa-focused company with Chinese backers\n\nWhile OPay is based in Nigeria, its backers are mostly Chinese companies like Meituan, a multi-billion-dollar Chinese shopping platform.\n\nIn July 2019, OPay raised $50 million from Sequoia Capital, IDG Capital, Source Code, GSR Ventures and Meituan-Dianping. Opera itself also invested in the round. Four months later, it raised a massive $120 million in a Series B round.\n\nThe company\u2019s initial play seemed to be focused on building a super-app, and it led with its popular bike-hailing service, ORide. But the ban on bike hailing in Nigeria stopped that, and the company focused on what had always been at its core: payments.\n\nThe pandemic is one factor that spurred growth for OPay, and as social distancing and Covid-19 regulations made banking halls challenging to access, more people are leaning on mobile money services. The company also has plans to roll out debit and credit cards.\n\nCompetition in the mobile payments space is stiff; while at one time OPay seemed to be the only company growing its agent network, other rivals have now tapped into the same network. Telcos like MTN and Airtel are spinning their mobile money arm into standalone businesses as they are betting on it for the future.\n\nIt means that at home, where OPay may claim dominance, challengers are arising, and outside Nigeria, grabbing market share from more established players will be no easy feat. Yet, should they successfully raise $400 million, it will be the kind of war chest that makes anything possible.",

          "title": "Dominic Joshua\u2019s \u2018hedge fund\u2019 paid out 30% monthly returns. Then the scam unravelled",
          "text": "He claimed to be investing in real estate, forex and Chanel. There was no proof.\n\nIn December 2020, Michelle Adigun* transferred \u20a6300,000 ($750) to Brisk Capital, an investment firm she discovered on Instagram. The firm promised to pay her 30% of that capital for three consecutive months.\n\nThe promise was fulfilled. The last 30% was paid alongside her initial capital. Thrilled by this, Adigun more than doubled her commitment to \u20a6700,000 on March 2, 2021. Same monthly promise as above. No questions asked.\n\nBut on the 2nd of April when she was to receive the first payment, Adigun did not. \u201cThis is when trouble suddenly started,\u201d she says to TechCabal.\n\nThat payment arrived two weeks later after Adigun repeatedly pressured Dominic Ngene Joshua, the founder and head of Brisk Capital, on Instagram. But that was as good as it got. No return has been paid for May.\n\nAdigun says her sister also invested in Brisk Capital but never received any returns. They and two other people, who spoke to TechCabal anonymously, are among the latest victims of a familiar scam couched as an investment opportunity in Nigeria.\n\nJoshua, the 21-year-old self-styled \u2018Investment Maestro\u2019 behind the Brisk wheel, is now in the custody of the Nigeria Police Force on a number of charges including investment fraud and stealing. A picture of him holding a board with those charges is dated May 1st 2021.\n\nSource: Nnamdi Chife/Twitter\n\nThe police say that Joshua has diverted \u20a62 billion from over 500 investors. He has spent some of that money on \u201cparties, exotic cars, luxury watches, real estate in Abuja, Lagos and Port-Harcourt,\u201d according to a statement from the special fraud unit on Monday.\n\nHow the heck did a 21-year-old do all that in barely six months?\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s talk business\u201d\n\nBrisk Capital joined Twitter in October 2020. On the 19th of the same month, Joshua\u2019s caption on his first Instagram photo read \u201cLet\u2019s Talk Business. I am back\u2026\u201d\n\nHe had apparently been off social media for one year and had spent time \u201clearning and building a legacy focused on helping people gain financial security.\u201d\n\nIn the weeks and months that followed, his Instagram became a well-curated gallery of professionally taken pictures with apt captions. When EndSARS protesters were shot in Lekki, he said the right things \u2013 calling for calm and mourning the dead.\n\nAfter that week, he moved on to themes more in sync with the brand he was building: wealth, success and investments.\n\n\u201cFor the remaining part of the year, I would be committed towards empowering 5 business owners with $100 each every Friday,\u201d he said on October 26, 2020. Winners would be picked from the comments section. \u201c#fundsfriday.\u201d\n\nPerhaps that should have raised questions but Joshua did not invent giveaways on social media. Influencers with verifiable jobs do it all the time but anyone with enough followers and an image of wealth can also find a thirsty audience. Joshua did not have to prove anything about his job and income even if he was just twenty years old.\n\nPosh Josh sells Chanel\n\nEmpowered with an increasingly posh image and a slick Brisk Capital website, Joshua began taking funds from willing investors.\n\nThere is no difficulty with Brisk. We make investment a simple journey for you by taking the right investment decisions that yield the best result. We take up this responsibility and make your decision to invest a smooth, stress-free and easy one.\u201d Brisk Capital\n\nNnamdi Chife runs Chive GPS, a firm based in Abuja which does debt recovery and background checks. A client contacted him in December saying he wanted to invest with Joshua to earn the promised 30% monthly returns.\n\nAs part of a background check, Chife says he spoke with Joshua to verify Brisk Capital\u2019s business portfolio and investment methodology.\n\nJoshua explained that he invests his pool of client funds in real estate, forex trades and high-value fashion brands like Chanel \u2013 supposedly as a licensee who receives discounts on products.\n\nChife was anything but convinced, advising his client against investing.\n\nAn advisory note from ChiveGPS, a consultancy, to a client who wanted to invest with Dominic Joshua\u2019s Brisk Capital. Source: Chive GPS.\n\n\u201cThere was no record anywhere to establish that he did what he did,\u201d Chife says to TechCabal, describing Brisk Capital as a product-backed Ponzi scheme.\n\n\u201cWhat he provided was a manipulated dashboard of supposed forex trades.\u201d\n\nBut Joshua convinced people that he was legit. Adigun and one other victim say they were partly convinced to invest after a dinner party in December where some music artists performed. Rema, a Nigerian artist, made a gleeful post on Twitter celebrating returns from Brisk.\n\nScreenshot of a tweet by Rema, a Nigerian artist. It is not clear if this was a pad campaign on Brisk Capital\u2019s behalf.\n\nJoshua also had foot soldiers who drove sign-ups.\n\nOne victim who invested \u20a6500,000 and received 30% returns in February and March of this year says she was convinced by Brisk Capital\u2019s marketers in her school, Abia State University. According to Chife, one person brought in hundreds of people who invested up to \u20a6700 million with Brisk Capital.\n\nBut dark clouds began to converge around Joshua in April. After a heady start, his book was now filled with promises of payouts; too many to fulfill.\n\nVictims say Joshua and Brisk Capital stopped responding to payment enquiries on WhatsApp. The latest posts on the company\u2019s Instagram and Twitter accounts are from March.\n\nDoominic\n\nOn April 19, Chive GPS sent a demand notice to Joshua. It was on behalf of a client who had not received the second payment for a \u20a6200 million investment made in December.\n\nWhen Joshua failed to respond to the notice, Chive GPS involved the Nigeria Police\u2019s Special Fraud Unit. They tracked and arrested Joshua who was already making plans to leave Nigeria according to Chife whose tweet this week brought Joshua\u2019s escapades to light.\n\nThe Police said some of the properties Joshua bought with his victims\u2019 deposits have been recovered. He will be charged to a Federal High Court when an ongoing strike by the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria ends.\n\nVictims hope the process will help recover their deposits. \u201cI invested \u20a6200,000 in December, which was due by March. I have not been paid till now,\u201d one said.\n\nShe had invested because she knew people who worked with Joshua. Her friends had cashed out too. But all she has now is the hope of at least getting her capital back.\n\nChife expects the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to take over the matter. But based on other similar Ponzi schemes that have crashed, he is not sure how many people will get back their money from Joshua.\n\nLike victims of other scams, Joshua\u2019s victims admit the 21-year-old\u2019s promise of 30% monthly returns at zero-commission or fund management fees was always too good to be true.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do enough due diligence. I should have gone through appropriate authorities and done my background check,\u201d one said.\n\nShe thought the percentage was outrageous but trusted her friend who was a Brisk Capital agent to help her invest.\n\n\u201cIf I had also known my friend didn\u2019t know Joshua that well, I wouldn\u2019t have invested.\u201d\n\nBack in January, Adigun had been impressed when Joshua temporarily stopped taking deposits. \u201cBrisk gave the impression they were deliberately managing their hedge fund to keep it sizable. I am just surprised that the guy\u2019s intent was to defraud after all.\u201d\n\nApparently, Joshua has admitted his crimes to the Police, pleading for time to return what he owes. That\u2019s good news for Adigun. \u201cTo get my refund. That\u2019s all I want.\u201d\n\n* Name of victims were changed or withheld to protect identity",

          "text": "My Life In Tech is telling the stories of Africans making a difference in the world of tech.\n\nBefore he turned ten, a typical Friday would find Vuyane Mhlomi on one of many trains making his way back home from school.\n\nHis journey typically did not end at home. He would only stop there to pick up a change of clothes for his father who was very often hospitalised due to his poorly controlled diabetes.\n\nCoupled with his mother\u2019s cardiac condition, Vuyane spent a lot of his time in hospital queues waiting for any one of his parents to be attended to.\n\nHe tells me that the doctors worked hard. There were just too many people who needed help and not many doctors wanted to move to Khayelitsha, his hometown, due to the high crime rate.\n\nToday, Vuyane is a medical doctor, Rhodes scholar, and the co-founder of Quro Medical \u2013 a startup making it possible for patients to receive the best care from the comfort of their homes.\n\nWhile the company was founded in 2018, the pandemic made a case for what they had always wanted to achieve \u2013 a way for doctors to care for their patients outside of the hospital.\n\n\u201cThere is overwhelming scientific evidence that demonstrates that patients do better at home, but we have very hospi-centric healthcare systems that incentivise treatment in dedicated facilities,\u201d he said during our Google Meet call.\n\nFrom Khayelitsha to Oxford and back to Cape Town, his journey has been one of resilience and a desire to make healthcare accessible for everyone.\n\nHe is Dr Vuyane Mhlomi and this is his life in tech.\n\n\u201cCall my son, my son\u2019s a doctor\u201d\n\nOn the day he graduated from the University of Cape Town, Vuyane was all smiles. He had just finished in the top three of his class and he was standing on the steps outside UCT\u2019s Jameson Hall granting an interview to the Cape Times.\n\nIn this interview he spoke of his mother, Nomsa.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy mom has been my mother and my father. This belongs to her,\u201d he said.\n\nVuyane with his mother Nomsa at his graduation from UCT\n\nVuyane lost his father when he was eleven years old. His mother was left to care for him, his three siblings, and a few cousins, on her own.\n\n\u201cI remember at one point, there were about ten of us in the household,\u201d he told me.\n\nThe family relied on his mother\u2019s disability checks and social grants to get by and of course to go to school.\n\n\u201cI mean, we didn\u2019t grow up in squalor, my mum really did try to provide. But we were definitely poor.\u201d\n\nGrowing up in Khayelitsha was tough and from a young age, Vuyane knew that education was the one way he could possibly move upward socially. This was how he fell in love with studying; it was the way to change things \u2013 his ticket out.\n\nWhen the time came to choose a course to study, medicine was the winning choice.\n\nWhile his decision was due, in part, to the many hours spent sitting and waiting for a doctor to attend to his parents, Vuyane remembers one event that solidified his decision.\n\nIt was in his last year of high school. On the night before his matric exams, his mother had a stroke that they were lucky enough to catch early. She had developed a clot in her heart from an undiagnosed cardiac complication from when she was a kid and that clot had dislodged and gone to her brain.\n\nThankfully, she was able to get access to therapy and this helped to dissolve the clot and limited further neurological damage.\n\n\u201cAnd that inspired me. It told me that when medicine works in the way that it\u2019s supposed to work, there\u2019s a real potential to save lives.\u201d\n\nThere is something to be said about what happens when your loved ones buy into your dreams. In the middle of her stroke, with her speech slurred, Vuyane\u2019s mother said to the doctors attending to her, \u201cCall my son, my son\u2019s a doctor. Call my son.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was in grade 12, he had only just applied to study medicine and was yet to even write his entrance examinations. But there she was, in a time when she did not need to think of anything else, speaking of his dreams as if they had already come to fruition.\n\nOn the day he walked across the stage to accept his medical degree, in her excitement she would tell the Cape Times, \u201cI was sweating. I was sick. I was happy.\u201d\n\nThe road to Rhodes and the birth of a businessman\n\nAfter graduating from UCT, Vuyane could finally begin practicing as a doctor. He began his internship at Soweto\u2019s Chrishani Baragwanath Academic Hospital.\n\nIn his second year there, he applied for the prestigious Rhodes scholarship to Oxford University.\n\n\u201cI was determined to do a PhD, so I reached out to a prospective supervisor \u2013 who did not return my calls.\u201d\n\nNot one to back down easily, Vuyane made calls to Oxford to ask why he was being ignored. His call would eventually get picked up by a professor who was intrigued by his tenacity. He got an interview and the rest they say is history.\n\nIn his Rhodes profile, Vuyane speaks of the opportunity and acknowledges what his being there meant.\n\n\u201cYou can be a Rhodes Scholar even if you are from Khayelitsha.\u201d\n\nVuyane would pursue a PhD in cardiology with his thesis centering around the interesting concept of how the hearts of pregnant women rapidly increase in size to accommodate the foetus but they increase in a way that should normally cause a heart to go into shock.\n\nIn many ways this reminds me of the work Quro Medical is doing today in the field of Remote Fetal Monitoring \u2013 allowing doctors to keep a close watch of a pregnant mother and her foetus while she remains in the comfort of her home.\n\nFollowing his PhD, Vuyane began to figure out next steps.\n\n\u201cThe PhD is an incredibly lonely journey which kind of forces you to reflect a lot about your life and what it is you want to do.\u201d\n\nBy this time he knew he wanted to return home and improve the healthcare system in South Africa. He was a doctor now and could help patients but he knew he didn\u2019t want to just see one patient at a time. He could do more.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d always been entrepreneurial. However, the nature of our academic programmes was not to support anyone who had an interest in business. I recognised that I lacked the commercial attitude that would help me realise and bring the kind of projects that I had in mind to life such as Quro.\u201d\n\nVuyane enrolled in the Sa\u00efd Business School MBA at Oxford shortly after completing his doctoral studies. He would meet one of his co-founders and Quro\u2019s Chief Scientific Officer, Rob Cornish during this MBA.\n\nVuyane returned to South Africa ready to start a business that would change the healthcare landscape forever.\n\nStarting Quro and entrepreneuring while black in South Africa\n\nBefore starting Quro, Vuyane had tried setting up another tele-medicine startup with his friend, business partner and Quro\u2019s co-founder and COO, Zikho Pali. The venture didn\u2019t go far but it did provide a good springboard for the work they would eventually do.\n\nIn April, Quro announced they raised $1.1 million in a seed round. This was huge for many reasons.\n\nOn one hand, Quro finally had capital to begin expanding their services across South Africa and beyond. On the other hand it marked the beginning of a relationship with investors who were truly interested in their wellbeing.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that Zikho and I reflect on quite a bit is the manner in which the investors that we\u2019ve got engaged with us. It was a clear reflection that they didn\u2019t subscribe to the kind of belief systems and whatnot; that we see with white South Africans, given the history and culture of apartheid.\u201d\n\nWith a brilliant idea to bring healthcare directly to patients at home and the numerous use cases the pandemic helped explore, I tried to find out from Vuyane what were some issues he\u2019d faced in pushing a solution that I believe should have guaranteed support on all fronts.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realise how being black would count against me,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHere I was, having done all that people usually say you need to do; get yourself a solid degree, be on a prestigious scholarship, get yourself an MBA, if possible.\n\nI checked all of those things that people say contribute towards your success as an entrepreneur and people wanting to back you.\u201d\n\nBut the reality for black entrepreneurs like Vuyane in South Africa is that they need to go through even more hurdles to get a chance to be listened to.\n\nHe highlights a culture where black entrepreneurs are not getting \u2018backed\u2019 in the real sense. Many people are offered \u2018mentorships\u2019 but this is rarely followed up with actual capital.\n\n\u201cJeff Bezos, Steve Jobs and all of these guys, none of them were backed because they had a single idea and they made zero mistakes, backing someone recognises that you\u2019re going to make mistakes and you\u2019ll pivot as part of the business.\n\nHowever, when we look at the opportunities that have been given to black entrepreneurs in this country, across Africa, you\u2019re not being backed. You\u2019ve been given one miracle, and you\u2019re asked to make a wish. And your role is to try and make sure that you don\u2019t make those mistakes. And I do think that that\u2019s the culture that needs to change, that when we talk about backing black entrepreneurs and African entrepreneurs in particular, we need to make sure that we do just that, that we provide an ecosystem for them to learn.\u201d\n\nAn African solution to a global problem\n\nVuyane loves to cook. He also loves to travel. These are things he does often and, as soon as it is possible, he hopes to do soon. He would like to visit countries in West Africa.\n\nWhen I ask what plans he has for Quro\u2019s expansion across Africa, he gives what I consider a poignant answer.\n\n\u201cI always push back when people say this is an African solution to African problems. This is a global problem. We\u2019re seeing this everywhere. So in our context, it may be an African solution to a global problem.\u201d\n\nFor Vuyane, the goal is simple \u2013 to take over the world.",

          "text": "Lagos, Nigeria. 26th of May, 2021. \u2013 In the recently released Africa\u2019s Best Brands 2021, TECNO ranked for five consecutive years among the TOP 6 brands on the African continent, marking another prestigious recognition of the brand\u2019s leadership in Africa.\n\nEstablished in 2011, the Brand Africa 100: Africa\u2019s Best Brands rankings is the most authoritative survey and analysis on brands and underlying businesses in Africa, based on a study by Geopoll across 28 countries spanning all the five economic regions and analysis and ranking by Kantar and Brand Leadership. Collectively they account for over 80% of the population and over 80% of the GDP of Africa. The 2021 survey was conducted between March and April 2021 and yielded over 80,000 brand mentions and over 3,500 unique brands.\n\nSince its entry into the African market, TECNO\u2019s operations have been customer focused. Year in year out, they have ensured that their offerings are tailored to meet the needs of Africans.\n\nSpeaking to this at a virtual event organised by Brand Africa, Vincent Uzoegbu, Public Communications Manager, TECNO said; \u201cFrom the first day of our business, TECNO made a strategic decision to focus exclusively on Africa, and when we first entered Africa, our core strategy was to focus on sub-Saharan Africa, where mobile phone penetration was still very low and largely ignored by global mobile phone manufacturers. The aim was to bring a mobile phone that would suit African consumers and improve the lives of as many people in Africa as possible by bridging the digital gap through technology and innovation.\u201d\n\nTECNO has worked tirelessly all these years to do just that. With the brand\u2019s Phantom, Camon, Spark and Pova smartphone series, TECNO has been able to set numerous records that define its success and popularity on the continent, evident of its dogged resolve to present Africa with the best of technology and innovation. When TECNO launched dual SIM cards in Africa, there had been nothing of the kind before then. TECNO was also the first to develop long-lasting batteries that lasted 3 days to combat the epileptic power supply in places like Nigeria. The brand was also the first to bring camera solutions on their smartphones that suited the predominant African dark skin.\n\nAfter more than a decade of commitment and consistency, the rewards are finally falling in. Earlier in the year, Counterpoint Research ranked TECNO as Africa\u2019s number one smartphone brand in 2020, stating that TECNO made its breakthroughs in mobile photography technology and continued investment in the market throughout the pandemic despite a challenging year. And now, with Brand Africa\u2019s new rankings, TECNO has once again come out tops, becoming a leading player in mid to high-end mobile brand segments in Africa.\n\nAttai Oguche, Marketing Manager TECNO Nigeria said; \u201cWe\u2019re very honoured to be listed again amongst Africa\u2019s Best Brands ranking this year and to be part of the key contributors to the development of African business. Shouldering African consumers\u2019 trust and great support, we will keep the momentum to continuously unlock our best of contemporary products and technologies for consumers across Africa and inspire them to pursue a better life via mobile technology innovations.\u201d\n\nAbout TECNOTECNO Mobile is a smartphone brand from TRANSSION Holdings.

          "text": "OctaFX brought two popular bloggers together in a cooking studio: the comedian Apaokagi Maryam and the music video director Abdulazeez Greene. They prepared a special evening meal for Ramadan called Iftar and compared the subtleties of cooking with those ingrained in trading.\n\n\u2018Ramadan Special\u2019 is the first cooking show in Nigeria produced by a financial company. However, OctaFX had two great reasons for this accomplishment.\n\nFirst, the company honoured the Holy Month along with its clients. Ramadan is about being with your family, and what better way to bring the relatives together than cooking a tasty meal?\n\nSecond, trading and cooking surprisingly have a lot in common. The two hosts of the show explored this correlation while putting together ingredients for their very own blend of Iftar\u2014a popular evening meal for Ramadan.\n\nThe duo prepared this particular version of iftar quite close to Nigerian tradition, including a fruit salad, grilled chicken, grapes, dates, jollof rice, and a vegetable salad. Influencers Abdulazeez Greene and Apaokagi Maryam rose up to the challenge to deliver this delicious meal.\n\nApaokagi Maryam is a frequent collaborator of the global Forex broker and took part in the last OctaFX Goal Booster promotion. According to Rosbena, she ranked first among the \u2018Top Ten Nigerian Instagram Comedians\u2019. Neither influencers are professional traders but have already had their fair share of exciting Forex encounters.\n\nThe show went live on YouTube on 8 May and is available for viewing. This is not OctaFX\u2019s first take on producing a show. The company enjoys experimenting with formats to bring its clients the most engaging and useful content. In March 2021, OctaFX stepped into an exciting collaboration with the popular rapper Peruzzi, taking part in his music video \u2018Somebody Baby\u2019.\n\nOctaFX is committed to educating its clients about trading in accessible and appealing ways. The company is aspiring to create more shows like \u2018Ramadan Special\u2019 in the future.\n\nOctaFX is a global broker that provides online trading services worldwide since 2011. It offers a state-of-the-art trading experience to over 7 million trading accounts globally. OctaFX has won more than 40 awards since its foundation, including the \u2018Best ECN Broker 2020\u2019 award from World Finance and more recently the 2020 \u2018Best Forex Broker Nigeria\u2019 award and the 2020\u2032\n\nMost Transparent Broker\u2019 award from Global Banking & Finance Review and Forex Awards, respectively.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nNCC to take subscribers\u2019 IMEI | Newsbites\n\nMay 26: New Episode!

Year in year out, they have ensured that their offerings are tailored to meet the needs of Africans.\n\nSpeaking to this at a virtual event organised by Brand Africa, Vincent Uzoegbu, Public Communications Manager, TECNO said; \u201cFrom the first day of our business, TECNO made a strategic decision to focus exclusively on Africa, and when we first entered Africa, our core strategy was to focus on sub-Saharan Africa, where mobile phone penetration was still very low and largely ignored by global mobile phone manufacturers. The aim was to bring a mobile phone that would suit African consumers and improve the lives of as many people in Africa as possible by bridging the digital gap through technology and innovation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTECNO has worked tirelessly all these years to do just that. With the brand\u2019s Phantom, Camon, Spark and Pova smartphone series, TECNO has been able to set numerous records that define its success and popularity on the continent, evident of its dogged resolve to present Africa with the best of technology and innovation. When TECNO launched dual SIM cards in Africa, there had been nothing of the kind before then. TECNO was also the first to develop long-lasting batteries that lasted 3 days to combat the epileptic power supply in places like Nigeria. The brand was also the first to bring camera solutions on their smartphones that suited the predominant African dark skin.\n\nAfter more than a decade of commitment and consistency, the rewards are finally falling in.

          "text": "Businesses operating within the designated special economic zones (SEZs) of four international airports in Lagos, Kano, Abuja and Port Harcourt are expected to enjoy incentives such as tax cuts, while customers from air passengers to hotel guests could be looking forward to lower prices.\n\nIn air travel, taxes and levies form a significant part of air fare and with airlines getting reliefs typically associated with special economic zones, the ripple effect will be felt by travellers. With company income tax between 20 and 30 percent of profit, while the exact percentage to be enjoyed is not yet known it is not expected to deviate much from what obtains in other economies.\n\nOR Tambo International Airport in South Africa and Charles De Gaulle in France are typical examples of this well integrated airport community.\n\nFor instance, OR Tambo International is Africa\u2019s largest and busiest airport, and the SEZ there offers ease of access to Africa\u2019s more than 200-million consumers through its connectivity capabilities. The SEZ has competitive rental lease rates, with access to incentives.\n\nTax deductions are offered for projects above R200-million, and a lower corporate tax of 15 percent instead of the standard 28 percent is proposed for companies housed within the SEZ. There is also exemption from value-added tax for goods produced in the zone for export.\n\nOR Tambo International Airport has incentives packaged to support foreign or domestic direct investment. With the support of the department of trade and industry\u2019s SEZ fund, designated SEZs can apply for grant infrastructure funding for the development of bulk and top structure, resulting in lower rental rates being offered to the market, and duty-free imports of raw materials or equipment utilised for production in the SEZ.\n\nIf global standards are anything to go by, the four airports recently announced by the Nigerian government as SEZs might soon witness a flurry of commercial activities.\n\nA special economic zone (SEZ) is an area in which the business and trade laws are different from the rest of the country. SEZs are located within a country\u2019s national borders, and their aims include increasing trade balance, employment, increased investment, job creation and effective administration.\n\nExperts say designating these airports as SEZs would attract billions of naira through foreign direct investment towards Nigeria\u2019s airports, through duty free shopping, hotels, ticketing and non-aeronautical services, and also boost employment, especially in tourism and retail for Nigeria.\n\nThe airport community is ordinarily a large community. Turning this community into a large, organised and urban aerotropolis and to further demarcate it as an SEZ portends a major advantage to the Aviation Sector.\n\nThe airport community being designated SEZ brings a great advantage to the community such as top notch security system and networks thereby making it a safer community, one-stop shop for business professionals and tourists without the need of going into country\u2019s downtown or city centres, Seyi Adewale, CEO, Mainstream Cargo Limited, says.\n\nAdewale explains that because of the tax and many other government incentives therein to attract foreign direct investments, major hotels, international offices, conference centres, recreational sports and entertainment centres will want to be situated there.\n\n\u201cFor the nation, there are huge job creation opportunities, high revenue generation in the long run, greater productivity and outputs through 24/7 hour like operations, new and emerging commerce being developed and so many advantages,\u201d he states.\n\nGiving an example of the benefits thereof, he says one 5-star hotel newly built within the zone will cost approximately N70 billion, noting the job opportunities, FDI into the country, direct and indirect labour, impact on supply chain, among others.\n\nHe further explains that to the city at large, the cost of property around this zone begins to appreciate and thereby upscale infrastructure, businesses and buildings surrounding the zone with the goal to tap into the outflow resources from its vantage positioning.\n\n\u201cThe place can trigger large financial institutions to situate therein, further boosting trade and commerce,\u201d he notes.\n\nAll of these would contribute to make the airport community a fully integrated and well-structured one that caters to the needs of the elite and upper middle-class, foreigners or expatriates, businesses and tourists.\n\nAmid decline in passenger traffic as a result of COVID-19 in 2020, airports across Nigeria processed 9,426,297 passengers. From these figures, Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos (MMIA) recorded 1,046,568 passenger traffic, representing 11.1 percent; Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, recorded 473,008, representing 5 percent, and Port Harcourt International Airport recorded 29,526 passenger traffic, representing 0.31, while Kano International Airport recorded 46,071 passenger traffic, representing 0.48 percent.\n\nExperts say these airports can process more passengers if some incentives are given to airlines and operators, and this can be achieved with the approval of these airports as SEZs.\n\nAccording to Olumide Ohunayo, an aviation analyst, designating these airports as SEZ would mean tax holidays for investors, adding that there would be expeditious clearing through customs.\n\n\u201cFactories and assembling companies can spring up within the airport environment. Those living around the airport will have more jobs. Transportation will have a boost as airport vehicles would have to move in more passengers and everyone down the value chain would gain.\n\n\u201cThere is a huge economic activity that would come up with SEZ airports. The logistics companies would see the biggest gain because goods and machinery would come in,\u201d Ohunayo explains.\n\nHe however suggests that a strategic marketing arm be set up to move beyond just the government pronouncement to see how they can market these economic zones to aviation related companies and other value chains outside the country.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nAbuja \u2013 The House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs has called on security agencies to investigate and prosecute the authors of a \u201cNon-Paper\u201d petition, accusing the leadership of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of monumental corruption.\n\nThe Chairman of the committee, Rep. Yusuf Buba (APC-Adamawa) made the call in a statement on Wednesday after the committee interfaced with the Permanent Secretary in the ministry, Mr Gabriel Aduda in Abuja.\n\nAccording to him, the entire petition which held itself as a \u201cNon- Paper\u201d, with no authors and signatures was a mere calculated attempt by a faceless group hiding under the banner of a pressure group to halt the ongoing reforms.\n\nBuba said that the reform is dealing with the many years of suspected systemic corruption and official malfeasance in the ministry.\n\nHe described the petition as an attempt to thwart every move to sanitise the operations of the ministry\u2019s headquarters and the foreign missions abroad in order to continue to maintain their vicious grip on the ministry.\n\nThe lawmaker said that no group should be allowed to make such weighty allegations in public without putting their names to the document.\n\nThe lawmaker said that the writers of the faceless petition had sought nothing positive to achieve other than to maliciously malign the characters of the leadership of the ministry and the nation at large.\n\n\u201cPart of the allegations contained in the so- called petition dealt extensively with the fiscal years of 2018, 2019 and 2020 respectively.\n\n\u201cMembers, therefore, wondered why Aduda, who assumed duties in January 2021 at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs after his redeployment from the Ministry of Sports and Youth Development, was particularly singled out for castigation and indictment.\n\n\u201cThe committee calls on the security agencies to fish out the authors of the petition, which members observed, sought to place the image of the ministry and by extension, that of the entire Nigerian nation, in bad light globally.\n\n\u201cWe laud the current efforts, amidst great challenges, that have been made to promote the mandate of the ministry and drive President Buhari\u2019s reforms agenda by Aduda.\n\n\u201cHe has indeed, pointed out the way he intends to go in actualising the dreams of the National Assembly for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\n\u201cAs a result, the committee, unanimously commends the permanent secretary for his dogged commitment to upholding the reforms of President Buhari at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nBuba said that the committee condemned in very strong terms the mischief and malicious damage contained in the said \u201cNon \u2013 Paper\u201d.\n\nAccording to him, some of these suspected corrupt acts and alleged official malfeasance, as is well-known, have been the infamous subjects of recent investigations by the National Assembly.\n\nBuba said that information available to the committee by independent sources, showed a long retinue of accomplices and benefactors inside and outside the Ministry.\n\nHe, however, called for a forensic audit on the finances of the Ministry in those fiscal years 2018, 2019 and 2020 with a view to ascertaining the true position of things in relation to the finances of the Ministry in those years.\n\nThe statement quoted Aduda to have described the petition as unfortunate saying that it came at a time efforts were being made to put things in their proper places in the ministry.\n\nAduda thanked committee for its commitment to ensuring that things were done right in the ministry, promising to do everything necessary to put the ministry in the right order.\n\nHe pledged to continue to reposition the ministry towards achieving its mandate and role of promoting the image of the nation through their representational mission of the country in the global community.\n\n...",

          "text": "Mrs. Modupe Adeyinka-Oni has been involved with teaching youngsters for 38 years. She was a teacher at the Corona Schools before establishing Standard Bearers School, Lekki some 24 years ago. She is very passionate about matters that have to do with the application of technology in the school system,bridging the gap between different categories of schools in the country, education for all and the continued development of the teacher. Here are excerpts from an interview with her:\n\nStandard Bearers School is 24 years old and you have raised children across this span of time. Now you see your products out there, children you have raised, and who have gone on to play roles in society. How do you connect with this as an educationist?\n\nIt is very simple. I was working with Corona School and I had a very fantastic career, I enjoyed my job but my first child was slightly introverted and I came to realize that the big school didn\u2019t really work for him. Corona school delivered their service in that the children did very well. But sometimes it goes beyond doing well in school. It is also about having the freedom to choose and having been taught in a different way myself, I could connect with the need for a bit more engagement. And I felt that my son would probably benefit from a smaller school.\n\nAs an educationist also, I could reflect on the positive and the negative sides of his school vis-\u00e0-vis his personality. I say this because before my son started with Corona, he had been in a very small nursery school. Now at Corona, for literally one and a half term, my son would go out at break time, stand on one spot, watch the other children play, and not play with anyone.\n\nAs a young mother, I was anxious. And because I was also a popular teacher in the school, everybody wanted to also play with him. I kept on talking about it at home, and then one day he decided to play with them, but he still didn\u2019t go out there to make a lot of friends.\n\nDifferent schools work for different children. And so, I needed a school where my children would not just go but will thrive. I did not go on and pull him out of Corona school at this time though because I didn\u2019t even understand it the way I understand it now. He however left to come to my school much later and that was because I discovered a learning gap and that gap was in reading. My son is extremely brilliant and he has the ability to memorize anything.\n\nBut then I discovered that though he was coming up in unit position in class, he couldn\u2019t read. We went through a series of questions and answers with him, and finally he revealed to us that his teacher had called him ode because when he came to the school, he was using phonics to pronounce words. And she said: \u2018why are you reading like an ode, read properly.\u2019 He didn\u2019t know what ode was, but other children laughed. And he made up his mind that he was never going to read in class again because he didn\u2019t want to be called ode.\n\nWhen they call him to read, he would just stand there. \u2018Okay you don\u2019t want to read, go and sit down.\u2019 And I didn\u2019t get to know about this until the summer of his fourth year, and when he was going to Grade 5.\n\nAnd so he came over to our school and in six months he was reading. And he tells the story with pride anytime; \u2018I learnt to read in primary 5, I learnt it and imbibed it, and not only did I then want to read but I also wanted to write.\u2019 He is indeed very good when it comes to reading and writing skills.\n\nSo, in talking about my children here in the school, and what I think is most notable about them, I will say it is their confidence. We don\u2019t tell them what they cannot do, rather we tell them that if you can dream it, you can do it. We are a small school, a family school, and we believe that children should be able to express themselves in their natural environment. Because if there is anything to correct, it is through their expression that we can see it. We make it a way of life for them, so, they are forever performing.\n\nWe dance. It is a skill that I came to understand, like speaking and listening, is also a language of communication and the children actually ascribe high value to it.\n\nDance for us is mandatory. I tell them when you get to secondary school and they call on you to dance, please step out and dance. Because that is one singular thing that will define where people place you. You don\u2019t know it but I know it as an educator.\n\nWhere the children will place you in terms of the seniors and where the staff will place you. They will say you are forward, but indeed if they see you as forward, they will continue to engage you in that way. So, it is mandatory for us. We got them a very good dance teacher who takes them through what we call creative development. Creative development is about dance, spoken word, drama, and music. And in this way, we have improvised a curriculum that is still fashioned along the line of the Nigerian and British curriculum but it is uniquely different in the sense that we have put the creative side of learning into everything. So, with every opportunity, we can turn any lesson into a movie production. If you came in here earlier today (International Cultural Diversity Day), every class had picked a country to focus on. The children in that class dressed themselves in the attire of, and learned about the country, and had to talk about what they learned. And every child has to say something; that is another thing that we do here.\n\nAnd so what happens when they leave? With the amount of confidence we have instilled in them and that ability to do, to innovate and think outside the box, we have had children who have gone into the entertainment world, some of them have gone to the banking sector, etc.\n\nRecently I bumped into a parent who I had not seen since the children left the school and he was so excited because he said his three children have done fantastically well because of the foundation we gave them.\n\nConfidence is a most important thing for children. For a lot of children, their voices are being drowned out under that old philosophy of children only being permitted to listen and not be heard.\n\nI believe so much in this soro soke generation; let them have their say and help them to shine the right values behind what they are saying. We are a school that has imbibed the very notable \u20187 habits of highly effective people\u2019 which we communicate through a programme called \u2018the leader in me.\u2019 So, our children understand the same thing. Right down to nursery, they know it.\n\nWhen we start putting those kinds of values in them, we believe that our children are born to be leaders, they have already learned the foundation. So, we have five pillars that we focus on: creativity, innovation, leadership, entrepreneurship, and technology. Outside of the core academics, they must absolutely embrace these five. We believe it is a combination of that and the academics that go on to set them apart. A lot of them have gone on to Ivy League universities, are working in Wall Street, Silicon Valley, etc. I have children that started in finance, and because of the knowledge of the fact that they can evolve, have also gone on to demonstrate interest in technology, Bitcoin, and stuff like that.\n\nHow do your children with such high competencies, high expectations eventually connect with the many other Nigerians who do not have the skill set we are talking about? Is there enough being done to ensure that this does not become a problem going forward?\n\nFirst of all, I want to go back to the question of those children you say we are raising. Yes, some of them are going abroad and some of them are attending universities here. Now I have mentioned the \u2018soro-soke\u2019 generation. Do you know what I think about them? Because of their education, their ability to conduct research, inquire to know more, and seek knowledge for knowledge sake, they have come to understand that the way Nigeria is being governed today is absolutely wrong. Our children are not tribal, they are not religious, indeed they respect everybody\u2019s religion. Even on issues of sexual orientation, they are not as shocked as we are.\n\nWhat I find that is unique about these children is that they are ready to work hard, and they understand that Nigeria will change when everybody is given a fair chance. And that is why those of my generation \u2013 people who went to school between 1955 and 1985 \u2013 must concede that we haven\u2019t done a good job. It is our fault.\n\nAnd I connect this to several factors, including the fact that we did not want to be in government ourselves and we thought that we were making a good decision for ourselves and our families, but the reality today is that though there are families that have benefited but Nigeria overall has suffered.\n\nSomeone said to me yesterday that when we call ourselves the giants of Africa, it is a lie. We are in truth, one of the poorest nations in Africa. In which other country do they treat their human resource the way Nigerian leaders do? When China began to educate their people, they amassed so much wealth and power that even America now feels threatened.\n\nBut what have we done? We have crippled our nation by our own selfishness and our own greed. I count myself as part of the problem because I am asking myself why do we have the private and public schools? Why is it that the private school is thriving and the public school is seemingly deteriorating? For someone who went to a public unity school, it does not make sense. I went to school with children from all types of backgrounds. I don\u2019t have an elitist mindset but somehow when we graduated and insisted on staying in our own personal spaces, we have now woken up to find out that 35% of our youth are illiterates.\n\nThen you also ask yourself; we have had 20 years of an elected government, and in these twenty years of democracy, the politicians, the leaders, the whole system, has practically failed the people.\n\nNow back to the children, the millennials, Generation Y, Generation Z; no matter how bad or corrupt they are, they will never be like our generation. This is because many of the children who came out for the #EndSARS protests are children of the elite who are questioning the decisions of their parents.\n\nIndeed, I think the first thing elite Nigerians need to do is to tell ourselves the truth because it is only through this that we can find solutions.\n\nLook at the kidnapping, I was asking the other day why is it so bad? Somebody said because people are hungry. And yes, they are hungry.\n\nSome people came to Nigeria to do a documentary of Nigeria and as they were getting ready to go back, we had a chat. From it, I found out that so many African countries no longer see us as the continental giant.\n\nI was told that it is not as if there is no corruption elsewhere in Africa, but nobody in Kenya will take a contract and not do the contract. They are so concerned about their image, especially in their communities. They want to be able to point to a project and say I did that for my community. But in Nigeria, the politicians think they can get away with it, so they just rob the nation.\n\nYou made some point about the use of technology in the educational space. That brings me to the Technovation Challenge. Thinking about it, I am asking myself how much technology can children grasp at this stage? How is it designed and how important is technology at this time?\n\nPrior to 2019, I had started to look more critically at the role of technology beyond the subject as ICT but I couldn\u2019t feel it in the mind because I am not very skilled in technology myself. In January of 2019, the coding instructor in school approached me and said there is a competition, and the period of time they had to take part in this competition was the period where they had finished their exams and I was myself trying to get my mind around how to engage the children as they had finished their exams. Exams that used to start after Easter in the country with common entrance, individual schools now set their date and time, and we start those exams now as early as October of the preceding year. So I called the children, about 5 of them, and told them that there is this competition, would they like to do it. They said yes, Mrs Oni. I said look this competition is going to require that you put in a lot of work. They said it was okay. I said it is going to require five to six hours a day, meaning you will come in and learn this thing. They said yes. Again, not everybody can get to that level of discipline at the age they were which is between 10 and 11. The whole techno-vation challenge is teaching not just the tech side of things but the business side also. So, they came in as project managers and they all had departments, learned the marketing side of things, and everybody found their own niche and together they built this app which got them into the finals. And when I got to hear that they were in the finals, the first thing that struck me was that we were in a competition with children from around the world, and most of the time without speaking their languages, the organisers were able to use technology to communicate with everybody, such that they will actually get them to collaborate on projects yet they could not speak each other\u2019s languages. I saw here there that there was something that had taken place that we had missed.\n\nThe second thing that caught my attention was that we visited Uber and we were talking to their top management and most of these people were under 30. There was only one Indian lady that was maybe like 33. And then I said to myself that something has happened here that Nigeria has refused to also allow to happen back at home. These are the people driving Uber in their jeans, khakis, and shorts. This is the environment where we are, the workforce of the future, and back in Nigeria we are still at the bottom. I had just encountered a shift and I came back with a stronger determination to ensure that we bridge the gap in our own teaching and learning.\n\nNow this is a very difficult thing to do because I had to come back and try to transmit that to my teaching staff and for a lot of us, when we look at the philosophies of education that inform our different practice in the classroom, the reality is that most teachers in Nigeria are oriented towards pouring both the wealth and limits of their knowledge into their children. So, the children are the receptors and they call it banking education.\n\nFrom my days in school, to what I saw in America, and coming back, I understood that there was a challenge. It is not easy to get people to change their teaching style, especially people who have become established. Because that pyramid shift is the toughest part of the change process. This requires having a different mindset to say the way I teach is wrong, I need to let go. It has therefore been a lot of push and pull. I model it, I talk about it, I wield the big stick if it is necessary, but at the end of the day the staff understand that my desire is to get them to be better in their teaching and to make the teaching and learning in the school more interesting.\n\nIt is the same process we have to go through nationally but our leaders don\u2019t understand it. These youths are trying to do things, trying to make a difference out there, giving online solutions to the back office of the school, to help with the collection of data, there are so many offerings, they need to be understood.\n\nI belong to a group where we have actually taken on board the assignment to actually help schools whose pupils are paying between N20-25, 000 and below as fees to help to train their teachers. And it is just a voluntary thing that we are doing.\n\nJust recently we had our first online version of the project and we were able to reach more people than we could have at a physical event. We had people from Port Harcourt and other places participating. It showed us that the teachers are actually looking for the help it is just that nobody really remembers them. We are committed to working with them. Next month, we are having another. What we do is that we partner with a few NGOs who bring us schools and they use their centres, and have representatives from various schools attending. But we also share the Zoom link for those that can go online from their private homes to join in as well. The feedback has been tremendous and we are all encouraged to keep at it.\n\nThere are so many other things. I am involved in projects working with IDP camps, we are trying to find educational and even online solutions to solving the problem of the lack of education among the IDPs. One of the pledges I made to God when I celebrated my 60th birthday was that I will dedicate time to the teaching of his children to ensure that they get better instruction. Because we are all creations of God and there is nobody that God created that he didn\u2019t give a talent to. It is the same with everybody, we are all on this line, everyone\u2019s talent is there, everyone has their place and their usefulness. For my team and for all those that have partnered with us, it is important that we correct the mistake and everybody makes a little bit of effort to support. And it is not a handout. You cannot continue to give money because it is said that it is better to teach a person to fish than to give them fish. And that is where I am.\n\nCovid happened and affected the world. You are talking about online interactions; I am not too sure a lot of that was going on before Covid?\n\nNo, it wasn\u2019t. For the education sector, Covid disrupted us into a much better place. It helped us see ourselves not just as Nigerians. One thing about Nigerians is that we compare ourselves and status by what is going on in Nigeria. But Covid pushed us to compare ourselves on a global stage, and so having exposed us to the world and exposed the world to us, there is no going back.\n\nIn education, we were teaching classes online on account of the COVID restrictions. Now, though we are back in physical school, every child is with their laptop. Assignments are done on the laptop. I tell parents when they complain about their children staying on the computer, that the key thing they have to learn from that computer is their typing speed because tomorrow that is how they are going to take their notes. Nobody writes long notes anymore and this is a good reality check for Nigerians.\n\nNow having said that, there is the expense of pivoting into digital learning and there is even a greater expense that has to be made and that is in upskilling.\n\nOn The Platform, they asked me at the end of my speech, \u2018we don\u2019t have computers, projectors, how will we do this online learning.\u2019 I said to them even my school has not yet attained to where it is supposed to be in digital learning. But the first thing beyond learning how to use the computer or projector is to identify what courses you are going to teach online. Because the teachers who are going to teach these subjects have to be taught. And many of them don\u2019t know how to put on the computer. So, it is an investment.\n\nNow during the World Economic Forum in 2019, there was this session on the future of work. And I recall a speaker saying that in sub-Saharan Africa there is going to be a loss of 55,000 jobs, but that the good news is that there will be replaced by 104,000 new jobs.\n\nThe question is how are we going to upskill the people to enter into these new jobs, because they are technology-related. We have the population, but the people that have the technology do not have the numbers. Africa has the population and does not have the knowledge. So, the world understands that they have to focus on Africa.\n\nIn fact, it is being said that in the next decade, Africa will be home to the headquarters of many global organizations. Now if that is going to happen, we have to have the local skills to take those jobs. So that got me thinking about this upscaling and upskilling. The cost of doing that is the problem. Africa/Nigeria does not have the resources for it now. The cost of building and equipping a school and training the teachers for just one school is massive. If we look at the budget of education in our country, basically what it does right now is that it pays salaries; there is no money for resources, maintenance, even sending teachers for programmes to improve themselves. And because of that, many teachers don\u2019t even know that they have inadequacies in their learning.\n\nWhen we are talking of the digital era, if we don\u2019t solve the human resource part of it then the other problem will not even go away. One of the things we are focusing on is the redevelopment of teachers, and it is only after we have gotten the trainers to our own side that we can now say let us start training the children. It is a somewhat long process but the truth is that it cannot be denied anymore; the Nigerian educational system is broken.\n\nOn the issue of the gulf in the sector and how we are to bridge it, our first note is that it wasn\u2019t always this wide. That said, we have to fix the trainers and fix the gap between the private and the public. One of the things we see now is that for beneficiaries of high-end private school education, many of them go away for more schooling and then stay abroad. Back at home, you have those who endure a lot of our broken systems which give very little value and it is these same children that some people are now calling hoodlums. I don\u2019t call them hoodlums, because at the end of the day if we failed to do something and we see the result of our own work, we should not now say that because we failed, they failed too. No, we must try educating them properly.\n\nWhy do we have so many hackers in Nigeria? Because they have gone to the dark side of the internet. Why not give them amnesty and say that this your skill, let us put you in a programme, take a job. They are brilliant, the fact that they can do the things they do shows that they are intelligent. But though many of them can do these things but they are not really able to read and write to pass and go on to the university because they were never really properly taught. But because they are smart, they are watching someone do it, and modelling the things they need to do and they do trial and error and they get it. So, they learnt on the job.\n\nIt is the same problem somewhat with Boko Haram. Half of those who are doing these things don\u2019t know that Saudi Arabia is like the city of gold where everything is so clean and fine, and Western education is thriving there. But here they are being conditioned to believe that western education is bad because they do not want their eyes opened. At the end of the day it is a lack of knowledge.\n\nIf you have to design something like an adjustment in our educational sector, take the Ministry of Education and tell us three to five things we have to turn around. What should we do, because if we don\u2019t fix education, we can\u2019t fix the country?\n\nIf I was in government and looking at what is going on, I think anybody will know that illiteracy is the problem. Whichever way we can do it, let us go back to the basics. When the white man came to Nigeria and brought education, how did they teach us their language that became our lingua franca. They taught it, they encouraged us to speak it. We saw it as something that was new, novel, and there were incentives for coming to school.\n\nWe need to look at some of the things that they did. Yes, some of the things that they did got to influence us but the truth of the matter is that Nigeria is influencing the whole world now because they are dancing to Burna Boy now, they are giving him a Grammy award. We have things that we are exporting that are good.\n\nLook at Nigerians abroad, how many of them are in Biden\u2019s administration. We are doing good things, but must our children have that mindset that except they escape from Nigeria, they cannot be better? Many of these people who are now in the oppressive state of mind went abroad and got western education themselves. Literacy is what is going to set the minds of each person free. Nigeria is in this state because we have too many illiterates who cannot think for themselves and all they do is listen to that mob voice, \u2018they say we should do this and we will do it.\u2019 They cannot stop to reason if that is good or not.\n\nMaslow\u2019s hierarchy of need places food and shelter at the base of the pyramid. Most of Nigeria is still wallowing in that place. If we don\u2019t do things about food and shelter by giving them the opportunity to earn, give incentives to people to learn to read and speak properly, and then empower them, we would still have issues.\n\nDid you see a recent video of ewedu being sold in Walmart? If we don\u2019t start farming it for exports, the Chinese and Malaysians will overtake us. Just like the way Malaysia took our oil palm. We need to go into mechanized farming, we need to upscale everything. So, farmers own everything, but we should have arrangements where farmers harvest their crops, you do quality control, and everybody knows that from your farm, whatever you harvest this company is buying it. It is a fixed price.\n\nWhat does this do for them? They can look after their children, they can improve their lives, they can send their children to school and at the same time they are working to ensure that the products get better and better, and they have a market and that market begins to export. We have to make them equitable people of society by giving them a better life.\n\nCan you see how many people are homeless in Lagos? We have to make them understand that people need to stop coming to Lagos, there is nothing in Lagos. Let them stay in their villages. There was a time when the community will find one smart child, put money together, and send that child to school. We need to go back to that. Communities need to get involved in the process of education. Leaders of the community are encouraging all the children to go to school, and in going to school they are putting incentives in front of them to keep going.\n\nHow much is our politics the problem?\n\nIt is a problem because we elected the wrong leader and we keep getting them there because they come every election year with their garri and their 500 naira and hungry people think this is our time to take from the purse. Immediately they get that mandate, they are gone for four years, and in that period, they don\u2019t see a need to do anything.\n\nParties are too expensive on the front end, and it is too expensive on the back end when they get into office because they feel that they have come to recoup the money that they spent in the process. So, it is winner takes all kind of mentality. That is not politics.\n\nWhat will be the shape of the school of the future. What are you seeing?\n\nI believe that because we now have digital meetings and can look at what the trends in the world are pointing to, schools will no longer exist as we have them today. I believe that children will have a greater choice and parents will allow them to make that choice. We have seen it with the Covid where some children have stayed home for a whole year and have not missed out on any activity. When they grow up, what is it that someone will say to them about keeping their children in online schools that will sound strange? They have experienced it even if it is for a month.\n\nI think that the evolution of schools is for us to think beyond the indoor. Recently, we had an event, an election, and the head boy candidate had to present his manifesto, and in his manifesto, he said I promise that I will work with the management to ensure that all of our classes are filled with engagements. What the children want is that they don\u2019t want you to talk to or at them, they want you to engage them.\n\nLearning in the future is going to be about doing. It is what we should have been doing, because in doing so many things happen. If you are having an engaging class, as a teacher you can direct the dialogue, you can listen and really understand if the children have learned what you are teaching because it would be demonstrated in the kind of conversations they have. You can also take advantage of that that kind of conversation to find out more about what they want.\n\nWe are all lifelong learners. The greatest lifelong learner is the teacher not the child. Your job is to bring together the collaboration of everyone, their efforts, their research into a position paper on that topic. So when before now, you will write notes and come and tell them that these are your notes, now that is becoming the wrong course to follow. The world is changing so fast and if you are not connected to the internet, you will miss out on a lot of information. What we do here is that we have partnered with a lot of organizations, and we are using their tools, we are opening up our schools to a more robust teaching and learning engagement environment.\n\nOur teachers have to go outside to teach. There is just so much that is new, existing, that is happening in the classroom. We all know that there are videos online that we can use to teach and also we are now getting our children to make videos. So instead of submitting plagiarised works, they understand research and copyright, they cannot just copy and paste. Summarize it in your own words. So, we now tell them instead of submitting a PowerPoint presentation, do a video.\n\nWhat this whole process is teaching us is that education is constantly changing. Children in primary school today we are teaching them for jobs that don\u2019t exist. If the jobs don\u2019t exist, why are we teaching them? Only the skills and competences of the 21st century are what we are focused on.\n\nWe seem to be caught between the old and the new. Your school has done a lot in managing the tension by being dynamic, but what about the bigger picture?\n\nChange happens in one community at a time. It takes one person to start it. That is not to say I am calling myself a change maker but who knows. I feel that a lot more people are aware, I feel that the soro soke generation are more demanding, especially of what they want for their children. I feel like this whole process cannot be stopped, and the fact that the government refused to acknowledge it but history has recorded it was actually the catalyst. From that we have seen a lot of things happening in the nation.\n\nFinally, CSR. You are engaged in a number of projects, helping with the training of teachers. How long have you been doing it and going forward what next should we expect?\n\nOver 10 years. We were doing it in physical schools. We started in Ijesha, we took about 30 schools in Ijesha and we had a five-day conference and we worked with them about how to teach English, classroom management, classroom discipline, and everything that had to do with teaching. We also talked about their personal development. We had people from HR, we had educators and we had this five-day programme with them. Again, it is voluntary work so we actually contributed the money ourselves.\n\nThe next one we took it to Ogudu and we had a bigger event with about 200 plus people in attendance. Then there was a third one. And then we now started having smaller ones because donor fatigue set in. We picked it up again during Covid and I think this time we have better chances.\n\nAnother thing that we tried to do was that they had the option of if we wanted, they could come to our school and shadow my teachers. That particular school in Ijesha did that and when I called the proprietress, she said it has totally transformed her school.\n\nWhat we are planning to do now is to take the initiative online. This is how we can bridge the gap.\n\nFinally, one of the benefits of the Covid-19 era for me is that the problem with the children on the street has become my problem. I know that I have made a pact with God that if he empowers me with the resources, this is going to be my legacy project. It is about impacting the children. Because we cannot multiply the teachers that quickly and in such mass through physical outreach, that is why we need an online solution.",

          "title": "Seven Tips: On Healthy Workplace Drinks",
          "text": "Here are tips on healthy drinks you can have at home or in the workplace!\n\nINFUSE YOUR WATER WITH DELICIOUS FLAVOR\n\nFlavored waters are everywhere these days, but many contain sugar or artificial sweeteners. A healthier choice is natural flavoring: Just add slices of your favorite fruits, veggies, and herbs \u2013 try lemons, oranges, watermelon, cucumber, mint, or limes \u2013 to a pitcher of ice-cold water for a refreshing and flavorful drink.\n\nGO NATURAL WITH GREEN TEA, HOT OR ICED\n\nA review of green tea research reveals that it may help reduce the risk of several types of cancer, heart disease, obesity, liver disease, and type 2 diabetes. In addition to this, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) notes that green tea is calorie-free (if you have it without milk or sugar) and naturally high in antioxidants, according to a review.\n\nTAKE YOUR WATER SPARKLING FOR THAT BUBBLY FEELING\n\nPlain, old-fashioned H20 is the healthiest substitute for soda, \u201cbut sometimes, people have a tough time making the switch directly from drinking soda to water,\u201d Kennedy says. One way to smooth this transition: Sip seltzer. You\u2019ll get the hydration of water with the feel of carbonation from soda, Kennedy says, and there are no downsides in terms of health.\n\nADD JUICE TO SELTZER AND YOU\u2019VE GOT \u2018JELTZER\u2019\n\nThere\u2019s no need to purchase sugary sodas or pricey, so-called vitamin-enhanced waters \u2013 which also pack calories \u2013 when instead you can mix 100 per cent no-sugar-added juice with seltzer. A thick, tart juice, such as pomegranate or grape, makes for a great \u201cjeltzer\u201d base, in addition to supplying potential health benefits. Mix one part juice with three parts seltzer to create this light and bubbly concoction.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFAKE A LEMON \u2013 LIME SODA TO SATISFY YOUR CITRUS FIX\n\nCan\u2019t give up your favorite citrus-flavored soda? Indulge in an occasional treat with a healthier version made with lemon or lime and a small amount of sweetener. Start with a glass of sparkling or seltzer water and add a few slices of lemon or lime (or both) and a dash of stevia-based sweetener, which is calorie-free and low in carbohydrates. A little goes a long way, so use it sparingly.\n\nJUICE FRESH VEGETABLES, NO CHOPPING NEEDED\n\nVegetable juice offers a quick, low-calorie way to get many of the benefits of veggies, without fiber. It also contains much less natural sugar than fruit juices, according to chapter 8 of Culinary Nutrition. For example, 1 cup of orange juice contains roughly 24 grams (g) of sugar, while 1 cup of tomato juice contains 6 g of sugar. But vegetable juice can be high in sodium \u2013 1 cup of tomato juice has 629 milligrams (mg) of sodium, which is roughly 27 per cent of your daily value \u2013 so opt for a low-sodium version whenever possible.\n\nIF YOU CAN\u2019T DO DAIRY, CONSIDER SOY MILK\n\nOne cup of non-fat milk provides 250 mg of calcium, or 19 per cent of your daily value, and 40.8 international units of vitamin D, roughly 10 per cent of your daily value. But for those who are lactose intolerant or who don\u2019t consume dairy, soy milk can be a good protein-packed, plant-based alternative, available in a variety of flavors, including almond and vanilla.",

Diarrhoea can be mild or serious, it can be acute or chronic. Diarrhoea is more common and more dangerous in young children especially poorly nourished children.\n\nCAUSES OF DIARRHEA\n\nDiarrhoea has many different causes, the most common are infection and poor nutrition, with good hygiene and good food, most diarrhea could be prevented.\n\nPoor nutrition \u2013 this weakens the child and make diarrhea worst\n\nShortage of water and unclean conditions spread the germs that cause diarrhoea\n\nVirus infection or intestinal flu (i.e. an infection of the gut caused by the bacteria)\n\nAIDS (long lasting diarrhoea may be an early sign)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPREVENTION\n\nPrevent diarrhea by preventing malnutrition\n\nPrevention of diarrhea also depends on good nutrition and cleanliness\n\nHere are some other important tips for preventing diarrhea in babies:\n\nBreastfeed rather than bottle feed babies. Give only breast milk from the first month to the sixth month. If it\u2019s not possible to breastfeed a baby, feed the baby with a cup and spoon, do not use a baby bottle because it is harder to keep clean and more likely to cause an infection.\n\nKeep the baby clean and in a place. Try to keep the baby from putting dirty thins in the mouth.\n\nDo not give a baby unnecessary medicine.\n\nTREATMENT OF DIARRHEA\n\nFor most cases of diarrhoea, no medicine is needed. If it is severe, the biggest fighter is rehydration. Give the person oral rehydration therapy (ORT).\n\nAn underweight child should get plenty of energy foods and some body building foods.\n\nLaxatives and purges should never be given to persons with diarrhoea, they make it worse and increase the danger of dehydration. Antibiotics like ampicillin and tetracycline are useful in some cases of diarrhoea. But they themselves sometimes cause diarrhoea, especially in small children.",

          "text": "Idibia Gabriel, Kaduna\n\nIn a development that caught many unawares, the predominantly Muslim, Hausa/Fulani northern part of Kaduna and its rival southern largely Christian area of other tribes, yesterday called for its split into two new states.\n\nSpeaking during the presentation and defence of their memos at the Senate ad-hoc Committee and the House of Reps Special Committee on the Review of the 1999 Constitution at the Hassan Katsina House, Kawo, Kaduna, both sides, infamous for incessant inter ethnic and religious clashes for decades, said creating new states from the present Kaduna State will go a long way at solving the bloody violence that seemed to defy solution.\n\nThe President of the Southern Kaduna Peoples Union (SOKAPU), Hon. Jonathan Asake, who defended the memo of Southern Kaduna people said: \u201cThe wish of Southern Kaduna is to have a brand new constitution, not an amended one,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut in the absence of that, we are here to make our inputs as a people who have suffered suppression and oppression for a long time,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSouthern Kaduna is made up of 67 ethnic nationalities spread in 13 of the 23 Local Government Areas (LGAs) of Kaduna State.\n\nIt has a land mass of 26,000kmsq with an estimated population of 5.1 million. We are endowed with an educated population and with abundant natural resources,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOur land size is greater than that of Kano State which has a land mass of 20,000kmsq.\n\nYet Kano is a state of its own with 44 LGAs. Our population is greater than 21 other states of the federation,\u201d he went on.\n\n\u201cWe are demanding for the amendment of the provision of section 8 of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria which makes it almost an impossible task for the creation of a new state,\u201d he insisted.\n\n\u201cWe have been demanding for a state of our own for over thirty years and Gurara state was among the 18 states proposed in the 2014 Confab report,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe are demanding for the creation of the Gurara state after the amendment. This will help in solving the incessant conflicts between our people and the other divide,\u201d he said.\n\nSOKAPU also asked for the removal of the Land Use Act from the Constitution and its amendment as a law, so that communities and families can have larger control of their ancestral lands.\n\n\u201cWe stand by all the 2014 confab report which had captured most of our demands.\n\nSimilarly, the Northern part of Kaduna State, under the aegis of Kaduna Development Elders Initiatives submitted a memo signed by the Senators Representing Kaduna North Senatorial Zone, Sen. Suleiman Abdu Kwari;\n\nthe Senator Representing Kaduna Central Senatorial zone, Senator Uba Sani; all the House of Representatives members from the Northern part of Kaduna; all members of Kaduna State House of Assembly from northern part of Kaduna, their Chairmen of LGAs and Councillors.\n\nDefending the memo of the group, Abdulkadir Ahmed said, \u201cwe are canvassing for the creation of New Kaduna State from the present Kaduna State and we want the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria amended to make this possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cKaduna South has been complaining of marginalisation ever since, even though Chiefdoms have been given to them and they occupy 60% of the workforce of Kaduna State,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cLet the state be split and if they are asking for Gurara state, let them have it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis will solve all the crises we have been having in this state,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cOn our part, we are asking for the creation of \u2018New Kaduna State\u2019, which will include Kaduna North and Kaduna Central Senatorial zones,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut there should be a referendum for each section of the state to decide on where it wants to belong,\u201d he added.\n\nGovernor Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State, who declared the meeting open, also asked for true Federalism, State Police and Financial Autonomy to Local Government Councils.\n\nThe Chairman of the Committee, Senator Kabiru Gaiya from Kano State, in .his opening remarks assured all that each of the memos will be well looked into and submitted to the National Assembly for further actions.\n\nMany groups and individuals also submitted memos as the sitting continues till Friday.\n\nKaduna State Governor Mall Nasir el-rufai was the only one physically present at the Wednesday northwest session of the Constitution review as other Governors were all represented.",

Let me remind us. Before we start \u201cadmonishing, praising and decamping\u201d, let\u2019s pause for a minute and breathe in and out!\n\n\u201cWas the recovered Ibori loot returned to the Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa-led Delta State government? No.\n\n\u201cNow, let me remind us. The Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Mallami, the British High Commissioner, Catriona Laing and other relevant agencies held a press conference openly telling the world when the money would be returned, and the specific projects the money was approved for. Openly.\n\n\u201cWhen it was delayed, the Attorney General informed Nigerians of the reason for the delay. When the loot arrived, Nigerians were informed too.\n\nThe conditions under which the funds were repatriated, still stand. Again, no penny was paid to the Delta State government.\n\n\u201cIf we break the conditions for getting this chicken amount, how do we get the elephant amount that is still coming?\n\n\u201cThe British High Commissioner is also keeping an open eye on those projects.\n\n\u201cI know what we all heard. But we also know the facts. Pres. Muhammadu Buhari runs an open government. The Attorney General is part of the open policy. Nothing hidden.\n\n\u201cNigerians would be the first to know if he decides to break an agreement made with Britain. I very much doubt it. He\u2019s an Honourable man. God bless Nigeria.\u201d",

These range from pain, swelling at the site of the inoculation, to body pains and nausea.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, 52 cases of moderate to severe incidents of AEFI have been reported. These presented as fever, vomiting, diarrhea headaches, dizziness and allergic reactions.\n\n\u201cFive states have the highest records of the AEFI namely: Kaduna (970) Cross River (859), Yobe (541), Kebbi (511), and Lagos (448),\u201d he disclosed.\n\nAccording to Shuaib, as of today, April 16th, 1,071,346, representing 53.2% of the eligible persons targeted with the AstraZeneca vaccine had been administered their first dose in this vaccination phase.\n\nHe said the data were based on reports received from states through the Electronic Management of Immunization Data (EMID) system only and did not take into account vaccinations that were not yet captured in the system.\n\n\u201cWhat this number means is that these are the people who have their information already uploaded on our data base, while others are awaiting upload, potentially due to network problems and the high traffic of those coming in to take their shots at the same time.\n\n\u201cWhile we continue to optimize our registration and immunization data system, we also encourage the state teams to deploy the most suitable internet service for their locations in order to speed up the data entry process, so that we can have the actual number of vaccinated people at any given time,\u201d he said.\n\nShuaib added that in many states, the inoculation of frontline health workers had been completed and that they had begun offering vaccination to the elderly, particularly those that were 65 years and above.\n\n\u201cWe are glad to be able to progress quickly offer immunization to more members of the community.\n\n\u201cOur rollout has been marked by safety, efficiency, best practice, and speed.

We cannot just switch off crisis unless we invest in addressing the root causes of these problems.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, African leaders have had discussions, but there is the need to \u201cput a sense of urgency because we have other crises like poverty that we need to address.\u201d\n\nMr Kagame said to African leaders to capitalise and profit from the Africa Continental Free Trade Area (AfCTA), adding that the continent stands to gain more by coming together.\n\n\u201cWe must utilise the youth, women, and other institutions to help us overcome the crises faced across the continent, but we cannot drop the ball right in the middle of it for smaller interests or benefits and forget about the common interest.\n\n\u201cFor example, we have put in place the AfCTA.

          "text": "David de Gea failed at the end of a marathon penalty shootout as Villarreal dashed Manchester United\u2019s hopes of Europa League glory in Gdansk.\n\nThis was a disappointing contest lacking in quality and producing only three shots on target across 120 minutes \u2013 but drama arrived with the spot-kicks.\n\nAll 20 outfield players converted their penalties in the longest shootout in a final of any Uefa competition, and in an increasingly tense stadium Villarreal goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli blasted home his effort and then denied De Gea, who was crestfallen at the end.\n\nIt gave Villarreal a first major trophy in their history and saw former Arsenal boss Unai Emery lift the Europa League for an unprecedented fourth time.\n\nHowever, on the anniversary of both Sir Matt Busby\u2019s birth and the epic Champions League final in 1999 that earned Ole Gunnar Solskjaer hero status among the Old Trafford faithful, there was to be no new 26 May landmark as United complete a fourth year without silverware.\n\nUnited simply did not do enough, despite the massive gulf in transfer fees and salaries between the two clubs.\n\nSolskjaer\u2019s side did not start well and fell behind to a soft goal from Gerard Moreno.\n\nEdinson Cavani dragged United level 10 minutes into the second period after a Marcus Rashford shot had been deflected into his path, but United failed to build on that momentum and by the end Solskjaer was introducing Juan Mata and Alex Telles purely to take penalties in the shootout.\n\nBoth players scored. Although given De Gea had failed to save any of the previous 21 penalties he had faced, maybe Solskjaer should have followed the example of former United boss Louis van Gaal, who famously brought on Tim Krul purely for a shootout at the 2014 World Cup, which the Netherlands went on to win.\n\nFor most of this season, no-one has been quite sure which United were going to turn up. It felt like that across the whole game in Gdansk, as they alternated between inventive and passive almost with each passing minute.\n\nEvidently, Solskjaer felt he had no choice other than to stick with it.\n\nIn the final game of last season, he waited until the 87th minute of the semi-final defeat by Sevilla before making a change.\n\nBy then, his side were losing, so it was not a shock the Norwegian had not used any of the six he was allowed on this occasion as extra time began.\n\nThe brutal truth is, having gone with his strongest offensive starting XI, there was no-one on the bench Solskjaer felt confident could improve the situation.\n\nIn Cavani and Mason Greenwood, two of United\u2019s best performers were attackers. But Rashford had a poor game, which was summed up by the England man failing to convert when Greenwood had given him a clear sight at goal.\n\nAny goal would have been ruled offside but Rashford was not to know that as his scuffed effort rolled wide.\n\nScott McTominay\u2019s midfield industry outshone both Bruno Fernandes and Paul Pogba, who both flitted in and out of the game without producing anything truly remarkable.\n\nDefensive slip-up\n\nIt would be easy to point to the absence of captain Harry Maguire as the key factor in Moreno\u2019s opener.\n\nBut Maguire was on the pitch when United conceded a very similar kind of goal against Everton in February.\n\nOn that occasion it was Dominic Calvert-Lewin who slid the ball past De Gea as United\u2019s defence failed to deal with a free-kick floated from a deep position into their penalty area.\n\nThis time Moreno\u2019s run into the box went unchecked, allowing him to get in front of Victor Lindelof and turn Dani Parejo\u2019s free-kick into De Gea\u2019s goal.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

          "text": "The Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) Wednesday said the Executive Order 10 issued 2020 by President Muhammadu Buhari to guarantee financial autonomy of state legislature and judiciary was needless.\n\nThe governors said there was no basis for the Order aimed at supporting implementation of financial autonomy for the judiciary and legislature, insisting the president was ill-advised.\n\nNGF Vice Chairman and Sokoto state Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal stated this in Ado-Ekiti at a colloquium organised by the Ekiti state Ministry of Justice Academy, in honour of the retiring Chief Judge of the state, Justice Ayodeji Daramola.\n\nSpeaking on \u201cThe Judicial Autonomy: Perspective of the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum,\u201d Tambuwal said the Forum expected President Buhari to have consulted widely before issuing the order, describing the unilateral exercise of such powers as \u2018sheer illegality.\u2019\n\nWhile pointing out that the governors were not opposed to financial autonomy for the concerned arms of government, Tambuwa said the delay in implementation was occasioned by the process, structure and quest for legal clarity.\n\n\u201cNigeria in Section 121(3) provides that: \u201cAny amount standing to the credit of the \u2013 (a) House of Assembly of the State; and (b) Judiciary In the Consolidated revenue Fund of the State shall be paid directly to the said bodies respectively; in the case of the judiciary, such amount shall be paid directly to the heads of the courts concerned.\n\n\u201cAs Governors of the 36 States under the platform of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), let me state very clearly that we are unequivocally committed to the autonomy of the judiciary and the legislature.\n\n\u201cIn the journey to our current position as Chief Executives of our various States, we have all benefitted from the independence and professionalism of the judiciary, be it at the level of administering our Oath of Office or our electoral victory being upheld at the Tribunal or in Court in the interest of democracy, justice, and fairness.\n\n\u201cThe concept of judicial autonomy has its foundations in the time tested doctrine of Separation of Powers. The main object is to avoid autocratic government by eliminating the over concentration of powers in one person, agency or institution.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s critical democratic elements is the principle of checks and balances between and among the three arms of government.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe recent misunderstanding on the financial autonomy of the Judiciary is predicated on the need to establish an implementation framework to the 4th Alteration of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in Section 121(3). What we have questioned, and we have made this known at every opportunity, is the process of implementing this provision of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cAs governors, we will be failing in our responsibility if we refuse to draw the attention of the President, stakeholders and the country to grave concerns about the constitutionality of Executive Order 10 of 2020. That was the basis of the position that we took on the Executive Order 10.\n\n\u201cThe Executive Order 10 ostensibly intended to support the implementation of judicial financial autonomy, was completely unnecessary and ill advised. Let me at this juncture state clearly that we never questioned the right of Mr. President to issue Executive Orders. We only stated that Section 121(3) did not require Presidential Executive Fiat to become implementable.\n\nTambuwal expressed delight that consensus has finally been reached on the autonomy conundrum and opined that the strike is expected to be suspended anytime soon.\n\n\u201cThe agreement allows a period of 45 days for implementation structures to be put in place across States including the enactment of a Fund Management Law which will grant the Judiciary the power to manage its capital and recurrent expenditures in accordance with the provisions of constitution.\n\n\u201cBudgetary releases to the judiciary will be pro-rated based on the actual revenues recorded each month by the state government. Monthly revenue reconciliation and allocation will be presided over by a State Account Allocation Committee (SAAC) to be set up under the Fund Management Law \u2013 a similar practice to what we have at the federal level.\n\n\u201cWe hope that this will put an end to the long weeks of strike action that have seen our judicial and criminal justice system grounded to a halt. We have lost so much in the past weeks. The big takeaway is the centrality of communication, sincerity, trust and dialogue.\n\n\u201cWe have requested that the President disbands the Presidential Implementation Committee on the Autonomy of State Legislature and Judiciary, to avert future rancor between the various arms of government, arising from misconceived guidance from a committee lacking the requisite understanding of constitutional matters,\u201d the NGF said.\n\nCorroborating Tambuwal\u2019s position, the NGF Chairman and Ekiti state Governor Kayode Fayemi said the presidential directive was unconstitutional and illegal as it undermined the executive power of the governors stipulated in the 1999 Constitution.\n\nFayemi said the states\u2019 governors were committed to financial autonomy for the legislature and judiciary, stressing that \u201cdemocracy can\u2019t endure if we subject the independence of these two arms to the jackboots of the governors.\n\n\u201cWho is to take capital spending for the judiciary and legislature has always been the controversy. The governors will continue to hold our judiciary with reverence because I know that this democracy will not endure, if we subject our judiciary to the jackboots of the executive.\n\n\u201cThere is no questioning the fact that we can do a lot more for our judiciary to make it truly independent.\u201d\n\nThe Sokoto state governor expressed happiness that a consensus was finally reached on the matter of judicial autonomy.\n\n\u201cThe agreement allows a period of 45 days for implementation structures to be put in place across States including the enactment of a Fund Management Law which will grant the Judiciary the power to manage its capital and recurrent expenditures in accordance with the provisions of constitution. Budgetary releases,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking at the event, Justice Daramola said judicial autonomy was essential ingredients for democratic consolidation.\n\nHe further added that judicial autonomy was adequately guaranteed in the 1999 Constitution, saying Section 121 (3) was simple and should be respected by state governors.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

Our hope is that in the next one month we will ensure that the remaining states that do not have the model schools have them; the construction will start very soon,\u201d he said.\n\nHe noted that the whole idea about the construction of the smart schools is to ensure that children in the country compete effectively in the 21st century, adding that in many parts of the world, e-learning has become an integral part of the school system and Nigeria cannot afford to be left behind.\n\nHe said while private schools in the country are already providing e-learning facilities for their pupils, the government is pushing hard to ensure that pupils in public schools have e-learning facilities irrespective of whether they can afford to pay for them.\n\nBobboyi said UBEC was collaborating with state governments to make the model schools a paradigm that states can replicate, adding however that the carrying capacity of the schools will not be high.\n\nHe added that the commission was in discussion with the Nigerian Communication Commission, NCC, National Information Technology Development Agency, NITDA, internet service providers and other stakeholders to ensure internet connectivity in the schools.\n\n\u201cThe power systems will be provided by the Chinese company Huawei, we are making effort to ensure that we have stable power supply at the end of the day,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the commission also started vocational schools during the north east intervention, adding that when a school is built, vocational equipment are provided to help the children learn a trade.\n\nOn counterpart funding for states to access UBEC allocations, he said as at 31st of December 2020, about 120 billion was lying in the coffers of UBEC unutilised by state governments, adding that the major problem with the allocations is slow utilisation of funds.\n\nEarlier, the Director of Physical Planning, UBEC, Engr. Abubakar Sa\u2019ad, said the smart schools initiative, which was started by the leadership of Bobboyi is aimed at creating a conducive learning environment for the children.\n\nSa\u2019ad, who was recently honoured as a fellow of the Nigeria Society of Engineers, in its 17th fellowship award ceremony, said he will ensure that all the school buildings are constructed according to specifications.\n\nThe director who is currently coordinating efforts in the construction of the The director who is currently coordinating efforts in the construction of the smart schools across the country, added that some staff of the commission are currently deployed to take inventory of all UBEC-funded schools affected by rainstorm.",

          "text": "Antonio Conte has left his position as Inter Milan coach, it was announced on Wednesday. The move comes three weeks after Conte led the club to the Serie A title.\n\n\u201cFC Internazionale Milano can confirm that an agreement has been reached with Antonio Conte for the termination of his contract by mutual consent. The club would like to thank Antonio for the extraordinary work that he has done, culminating in Inter\u2019s 19th top-flight title. Antonio Conte will forever remain a part of our Club\u2019s history,\u201d the club said in a statement.\n\nItalian newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport suggested the move was in part due to the club\u2019s need to cut operating costs amid the coronavirus pandemic. The newspaper claimed Inter wanted to cut salary costs by 15-20% and player departures would be necessary, with Conte not keen to work with a \u201cdownsized\u201d project.\n\nSpeaking after Inter\u2019s last match of the season, a 5-1 win over Udinese, Conte\u2019s assistant Cristian Stellini appeared to hint at the coach\u2019s unrest over plans to sanction player departures.\n\n\u201cWe are enthusiastic about continuing, but when you have a top coach, he requires a top project too,\u201d Stellini told DAZN.\n\n\u201c[Players leaving] could change things, but it\u2019s up to the club to make clear what the situation is.\u201d\n\nInter made the high-profile signings of players like Romelu Lukaku, Christian Eriksen and Achraf Hakimi during Conte\u2019s tenure and their arrivals spurred the club to great success.\n\n\u201c2014 we spoke for the first time and we have had a bond ever since,\u201d Lukaku wrote on Instagram. \u201cWe had many moments to work together but only God knows why it never happened earlier. You came at the right time and basically changed me as a player and made me even stronger mentally and more importantly we won together!\u201d\n\nInter were also part of a group of 12 clubs that had planned to launch a breakaway European Super League, before backing out. The club are said to be upwards of \u20ac500 million in debt, due to both the coronavirus and ambitious spending. The majority owner, the Chinese retailer Suning, has been dealing with the effects of a state-sponsored bailout and has been actively seeking new club investors.\n\nAs rumours regarding Conte\u2019s future grew on Tuesday, a banner criticising Inter chairman Steven Zhang was unfurled at the club\u2019s offices that read: \u201cZhang: take responsibility or get out of our town.\u201d During the final stages of the Serie A season, Conte stopped attending prematch news conferences to avoid answering questions over his future as the coach.\n\nConte joined Inter in 2019 and steered the club to second in Serie A behind champions Juventus in his first season at the club, as well as losing the Europa League final to Sevilla FC. This season, he masterminded the club\u2019s first Serie A title success in 11 years, and 19th overall, breaking Juve\u2019s nine-year stranglehold on the trophy.\n\nThe Italian coach\u2019s move to Inter came following his sacking at Chelsea in 2018. He was out of work for a year due in part to a lengthy and acrimonious legal battle that ended with a Premier League managers\u2019 arbitration tribunal ruling in his favour. Chelsea were ordered to pay Conte around \u00a39m \u2014 the amount owed for the final, unfulfilled year of his contract at Stamford Bridge \u2014 before he was free to return to Italy.\n\nConte won three Serie A titles as manager of Juventus and the Premier League during his spell at Chelsea, as well as the FA Cup.",
