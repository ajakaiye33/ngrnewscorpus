          "text": "The Federal Government says that it inherited over 166 ongoing and abandoned water projects from previous administrations. It also explained that the abandoned projects date back to as far back as 1992 and the early 2000s.\n\nThe Minister of Water resources, Suleiman Adamu, revealed this on Thursday while speaking at the weekly ministerial briefing organised by the Presidential Communication Team at the presidential villa, Abuja.\n\nAdamu said, \u201cWe inherited 116 ongoing and abandoned projects. And we made a strategic decision that we are going to concentrate more on completing as many of the ongoing and abandoned projects that we found.\n\n\u201cSo we have not been in the habit of starting new projects, although we are coming to that in due course.\n\nHe further explained that the abandoned projects include irrigation, dam and sanitation projects.\n\n\u201cThe 166 projects include 38 irrigation projects, 37 dam projects and others. After doing a technical audit in 2016, we prioritised them into high, medium and low priority. And that has been what is driving us.\n\n\u201cWe also have a goal to complete viable projects only.\u201d\n\nAttributing the abandoned project to poor financing, the Minister said that his administration is seeking ways to source for funds beyond the national allocation.\n\n\u201cWater infrastructure is a money guzzler and this is why several past projects have not been completed.\n\n\u201cSo, we thought we could find some other ways to raise finance to complete these projects. We had to think outside the box.\n\n\u201cWe are now mobilising finance for these projects asides the normal budgetary allocation.\u201d",

          "text": "Global watchdog, Amnesty International on Wednesday claimed that its findings as revealed that 115 civilians were extra-judicially killed by security forces while 21 Police Officers were assassinated in the South east in the last four months.\n\nA statement by the Nigerian office of Amnesty International said the killings were allegedly perpetrated in four months adding that more than 500 persons were arrested and Experience torture during Police and Military raids.\n\nThe Amnesty International statement signed by Nigeria\u2019s Country Director, Osai Ojigho said, \u201cNigerian security forces have committed a catalogue of human rights violations and crimes under international law in their response to spiralling violence in Southeast Nigeria, carrying out a repressive campaign since January, which has included sweeping mass arrests, excessive and unlawful force, and torture and other ill-treatment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe evidence gathered by Amnesty International paints a damning picture of ruthless excessive force by Nigerian security forces in Imo, Anambra and Abia States.\u201d\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s government has responded with a heavy hand to killings and violence widely attributed to the armed group calling itself Eastern Security Network (ESN), the armed wing of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), a pro-Biafra movement.\n\n\u201cAccording to government officials, the ESN killed dozens of security operatives and attacked at least 10 public buildings, including prisons and police stations, from January to June. In response, security forces comprising military, police, and Department of State Services (DSS) have killed dozens of gunmen, as well as civilians, where attacks have been committed.\n\n\u201cEyewitnesses told Amnesty International that the security forces have engaged in excessive use of force, physical abuse, secret detentions, extortion, burning of houses, theft, and extrajudicial executions of suspects.\n\n\u201cHuman rights groups estimated that the death toll of violence between January and June 2021 in Anambra, Imo, Abia, and Ebonyi States might run into the hundreds. The police said ESN fighters killed 21 of its personnel in Imo State alone.\n\n\u201cAmnesty International carried out an extensive investigation to document the human rights violations and crimes under international law in Anambra, Imo, Ebonyi and Abia States from January 2021. The organisation documented 52 incidents of unlawful killings and 62 cases of arbitrary arrest, ill-treatment and torture.\n\n\u201cMedia reports, video and audio recordings reviewed show that the Nigerian security forces also employed excessive force and other unlawful means to address the rising violence.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom January 2021, gunmen suspected to be ESN militants launched a series of attacks on government infrastructure, including prisons and public buildings, killing several police officers. Amnesty International condemned these attacks and called on authorities to bring the perpetrators to justice.\n\n\u201cNigerian security forces launched security operations in June, primarily targeting ESN militants or those perceived as such to decimate the group. Amnesty International documented at least 115 persons killed by security forces between March and June 2021.\n\n\u201cMany relatives of the victims told Amnesty International that they were not part of the militants that were attacking security agents. Many of the victims were deposited at government hospitals in Imo and Abia States. According to several hospital sources, all the victims deposited by the police had bullet injuries.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor instance, in two of the cases documented by Amnesty International, the victims were targeted with no apparent justification: Uguchi Unachukwu, a Germany-based businessman was killed by soldiers on 31 May at a checkpoint near Owerri airport on his way out of the country. The police are yet to investigate the crime.\n\n\u201cMathew Opara, a 45-year-old businessman, was shot by soldiers on 25 May 2021 in Orji, near Owerri. Witnesses told Amnesty International that he was returning from work when he ran into a team of soldiers in an armoured vehicle and Hilux vans shooting at residents. He was shot in the chest and could not receive immediate medical help because of the violence. His family said the military acknowledged the killing but did not launch an investigation or offer any apology.\u201d",

          "text": "A Federal High Court in Abuja has ordered the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and four other banks to pay N5.5billion judgment debt into an interest yielding account before September 1.\n\nOther affected banks are Fidelity, Access, UBA and Zenith whose case would not be heard in court until evidence of payment of the punitive sum.\n\nJustice Inyang Eden Ekwo gave the order as a condition for the hearing of the applications filed by CBN and the four banks for the stay of execution of an order of garnishee absolute made by the court from June 15.\n\n\u201cThe garnishees are hereby ordered to pay the judgment sum into an interest yielding account to be maintained by the Chief Registrar of this court as condition for the application for stay to be heard.\n\n\u201cThis case is hereby adjourned to 1st September, 2021 for the respective applications,\u201d Justice Ekwo said.\n\nThe banks are listed as garnishees in the suit, marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/1165/2020 initiated by a firm \u2013 Maggpiy Trading TFZE \u2013 to retrieve about N5.5B (N3.82billion and $4.95million) judgment sum earlier given in its favour by the court in the suit it filed against the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS) and the Chairman of its Board.\n\nIn their applications, the banks are seeking to stay the execution of the garnishee order absolute pending the determination of their appeals.\n\nMaggpiy Trading had sued the NCSB, its Chairman and the National Security Adviser (NSA), claiming that, on March 18, 2017, officials of the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS) unjustly sealed off its warehouses located within the Tinapa Free Trade Zone and Resort (TFTZR), Calabar, Cross River State.\n\nIt stated, in the suit marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/40/2017 that the warehouses, at the time they were sealed off by men of the NCS, contained 90 containers worth of rice, with each of the containers holding 540 bags of rice.\n\nThe firm added that, without any provocation and after accepting N53M from it as stamp duties, men of the NCS also detained by the road side at Onne, Port-Harcourt, Rivers State, 40 trucks with which it was transporting 317 transit containers of rice to its Tinapa Free Trade Zone and Resort facility.\n\nMaggpiy Trading company stated that its warehouses were eventually unsealed after over four months and that it was compelled by the defendants to re-export the imported rice to Cotonou, Benin Republic on July 28, 2017.\n\nThe firm stated that it found that some of the containers had been stolen; incurred heavy costs and that most of what was left of the consignment had been destroyed.\n\nThe defendants however denied any wrongdoing, claiming that the plaintiff (Maggpiy Trading) breached the Federal Government\u2019s fiscal policy on the importation of any physical goods into Nigeria.\n\nThey argued that the plaintiff\u2019s action of importing rice into the country \u201cwas calculated to undermine the federal government\u2019s fiscal policy on food security, which is meant to encourage local production of rice, and the ban on importation of rice through land border.\n\nThe trial court, in its judgment given on July 10, 2019, upheld the plaintiff\u2019s case on the grounds that the NCS and its officials acted outside the law when they knew that the federal government\u2019s circular on which they claimed to have acted is not applicable to Free Trade Zone which are considered as \u201ccountry within a country.\u201d\n\nJustice Ekwo, who was the trial judge, frowned at the refusal of the defendants to obey his two interlocutory orders made on December 15, 2017 and June 27, 2018 for the rice to be sold and the proceed kept in an interest yielding accounts pending the determination to the case in view of the perishable nature of the consignment.\n\nHe proceeded to grant all the plaintiff\u2019s reliefs, but exonerated the 3rd defendant (the NSA), who was found to have played no role in the whole episode.\n\nThe judge made a declaration \u201cthat the 1st and 2nd defendants have no power, authority or justification to seal off the plaintiff\u2019s warehouses located at the Tinapa Free Trade Zone, Calabar, Cross River State or to seize, detain or order the seizure or detention of the plaintiff\u2019s containers of rice lawfully Imported through the Onne Sea Port for conveyance to the Calabar Free Trade Zone.\u201d\n\nHe also made \u201ca declaration that the seizure or detention by the 1st and 2nd defendants of 317 transit containers belonging to the plaintiff at Onne Sea Port, Rivers State and the order for their re-exportation is illegal, unlawful and unjustified.\u201d\n\nJustice Ekwo further declared \u201cthat the sealing off by the 1st and 2nd defendants of the plaintiff\u2019s warehouses at Tinapa Free Trade Zone, Calabar containing 90 containers worth of rice escorted to the said warehouse by the Nigerian Customs and over which duties were duly paid by the plaintiff is illegal, unlawful and unjustified.\n\nHe granted an order of perpetual injunction restraining the 1st and 2nd defendants from further unlawfully interfering with the lawful business transactions of the Plaintiff within the Tinapa Free Trade Zone.\n\nThe judge awarded both special and general damages against the 1st and 2nd defendants totalling N3,832,779,450.00 and $4,958,950.\n\nHe ordered that the monetary part of the judgment shall attract interest \u201cat the prevailing Monetary Policy Rate (Central Bank rate) from date of judgment until judgment sums are fully liquidated.\u201d\n\nA three-man panel of the Court of Appeal, Abuja subsequently upheld the judgment in its decision on August 20, 2020 and dismissed the appeal, marked: CA/A/819/2019 filed by the Nigerian Customs Service Board (NCSB) and its Chairman.\n\nThe appellate court, in dismissing the appeal, held that the Federal High Court was in order when it held in favour of the plaintiff \u2013 Maggpiy Trading TFZE \u2013 in the judgment given by Justice Ekwo on July 10, 2019 in the suit marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/40/2017.\n\nJustices Emmanuel Agim, Peter Ige and Yargata Nimpar (of the Court of Appeal) were unanimous in holding that the appellants (NCSB and its Chairman) failed to fault the judgment by Justice Ekwo.",

          "text": "By Gbenga Bada\n\nNollywood filmmaker Chris Ihidero has argued the Nigerian film industry has the capacity to produce great original contents of global quality if the industry is adequately funded.\n\nIhidero made this argument on the popular CNN special, MarketPlace Africa while discussing the recent attention the industry is enjoying from global players, especially giants like Netflix, Showmax, and Canal+\n\n\u2018\u2018Nollywood has been at the forefront of showcasing Africa in a certain way over the years. What\u2019s beginning to happen is a recognition of Nollywood\u2019s possibilities, \u201cIhidero said.\n\n\u201cWhat the partnerships with international streaming services like Netflix have done is to first show value. That association immediately ascribes quality to you and raises your value proposition. It\u2019s removing all the shackles around creativity.\u201d\n\nIhidero, who recently produced Nigeria\u2019s first feature-length animated movie, \u2018Lady Buckit and the Motley Mopsters\u2019 also said he \u201cfeels like films such as \u2018Lady Buckit and the Motley Mopsters\u2019 tell a different story about Nollywood.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIt talks about the possibilities where talent is involved. It also talks about the possibilities where adequate funding is involved. Nollywood can do anything. You just have to fund it right.\u201d\n\nIhidero is a Nollywood veteran with over two decades of experience in the film industry. He has been a theatre artist, broadcaster, newspaper columnist, magazine editor, and university lecturer.\n\nHe made a switch to film in 2007 when he joined Amaka Igwe Studios as a trainee director.\n\nSince then, he has directed over 100 hours of TV drama and written or consulted on over 1000 episodes of TV dramatic content, including Fuji House of Commotion and Africa Magic\u2019s HUSH.\n\nHe also produced MTV Shuga Naija Series 3 in 2015 and Series 4 in 2017.\n\nThrough Chris Ihidero\u2019s StoryStory project, done in honour of his late teacher, Amaka Igwe, Chris has trained over 200 Nigerian storytellers for free.",

          "title": "Why govt opposes payment of ransom, by minister",
          "text": "The Federal Government yesterday justified its opposition to negotiations and ransom payment to bandits and kidnappers.\n\nSuch engagement was empowering criminals, Minster of State for Education, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, told reporters at the State House after weekly Federal Executive Council (FEC) at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.\n\nReacting to a question on a viral harrowing videos of some pupils in kidnappers\u2019 den, pleading for rescue, the minister said the governments was working to free the pupils.\n\nHe, however, said the government had decided to stop empowering bandits and kidnappers through ransom payment, adding that ransom payment was fueling insecurity.\n\nShedding more light on government\u2019s effort, the minister reassured that steps were being taken to rescue the children. He foreclosed further negotiations with criminal elements.\n\nThe minister said: \u201cWe are constrained to stop negotiations with bandits because we\u2019ve seen that every time they get any payment, it leads to further escalation, because they reequip and they rearm and then they go back.\n\n\u201cIf you notice what happened from the kidnap at the College of Forestry in Kaduna, this was prior to the kidnap at the Bethel Baptist College and at Usman Polytechnic before they got the university children. Now, there is none of our students that will be held that we\u2019re happy at all. It doesn\u2019t matter which level. One is even too many at any time.\n\n\u201cSo, yesterday (Tuesday) the military returned with our children that they were able to rescue. We\u2019ve seen the videos you alluded to, and while we cannot attest to their veracity and authenticity, we are in touch with the military authorities. They are in continuous pursuit of them.\n\n\u201cI was in Katsina to discuss with the detachment that is overseeing that area, and all the way to Buni Yadi, in Kebbi State, where we have some of our children still held. Tigana boys are the ones in Niger State \u2013 the Islamiya school.\n\n\u201cWe are continuously engaging; there is no such thing as the federal government not engaging; almost day and night, we are engaging. I\u2019m just trying to assure Nigerians that as distressing as it is, we are on top of it. And we will keep doing all that we can possibly do to get our children and keep our students safe.\n\n\u201cIt is disheartening anytime our pupils are taken, I can assure you that the federal government is doing all it can. We have held several meetings with our security personnel.\n\nRead Also: Bandits release 3 Baptist school pupils\n\n\u201cInsecurity at the school level, you may understand, stems from insecurity around the area. Before we had Chibok, there was Boko Haram in the area. It is the success of the military more or less, in incapacitating Boko Haram in the Northeast, that led to some level of insurgents in the Northwest and as bandits appeared they started striking randomly at some of our schools from Jengave, Kangara. You know, everywhere. And the places where they\u2019ve had to go, we\u2019ve pursued them.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, the containment policy of the military is actually in response to what we also did as the humanitarian element that surrounds it, because the way the military will engage bandits once they have our citizens will not be the same way they will engage them ordinarily. And therefore, they may not just go into the forest shooting at everything or everybody they see. And that has enabled the bandits use some of our citizens as human shields.\u201d\n\nOn the measures put in place to insulate federal government schools against attacks by bandits, the minister said: \u201cI had already said that the whole of government approaches to security exercise is not just limited to our schools.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cYes, the federal government owns a few federal colleges around Nigeria, out of the 25,000 secondary schools, federal government owns only 120 of them and we are constantly policing each of our parameter areas.\n\n\u201cAs far as we\u2019re concerned, we have policemen and we have civil defense corps. We are collaborating with the Ministry of Interior, the police to have personnel, boots on ground everywhere.\n\n\u201cBut, we\u2019re not limiting ourselves to our own institutions at all, that we\u2019re looking at the security as a national policy is a whole of government engagement. And we already had worked out with the rest of the governors and security operatives around the country on how to do this.\n\n\u201cAnd I just explained that if you look at a place like Kaduna state, with 512 secondary schools, we\u2019ve had to look at those who are most prone, which from our analysis are exposed, girls secondary schools with boarding facilities are most at risk.\n\n\u201cSo, what we\u2019ve done is to look at the radius from response time at the security agency stations to where the schools are, and if it exceeds the maximum reaction time that the military and us have worked out, we close down those schools and have them come and recite with or co-locate them with schools that are within the prescient of what we determined are safe at the moment.\n\n\u201cIf you go to Sokoto State for instance, we\u2019ve done buzzers we\u2019ve done alarm systems, we\u2019ve done perimeter monitoring, we\u2019ve done community engagement platforms, we\u2019ve done the SBMC procedures, which we put on school management bus and then attach security compliance officers alongside them, we are engaging everyone.\n\n\u201cWell, if you look at what we\u2019re doing in Borno state, and all other places where we are at risk, because even in reopening the Chibok school, if you see what Governor Zulum did there, what we did was to first of all, get all the security apparatus around the area to be able to stay within response zones.\n\n\u201cThe federal government has also expanded its own forwarding basis. And if you understand some of the military intelligence that they use those to gather, those are forwarding basis so that before there are preemptive stack around the areas where people may not ordinarily congregate, and then isolate the forest reserves that are on the far belt of the Nigerian West Wing, where you see the continuous forest stretches that they\u2019ve now put in military installations to interrupt them so that there is no continuous flow for any engagement.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve noticed that there\u2019s been a reduction in the past few days. But I\u2019m not saying that we are unchallenged but I am saying we are working to continuously engage them.\n\n\u201cLike I said, that\u2019s the function of government, problems will not go away. But if you have hired us as managers, and what we can do at the moment, is keep managing the situation and work at it\u201d.",

          "text": "From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja\n\nThe crisis in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is not about to abate as the man in the eye of the storm and National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, yesterday, fought back as he accused an unnamed \u201cFather Christmas\u201d of desperation to hijack the party.\n\nHe spoke amidst an emergency meeting of the National Working Committee (NWC) with aggrieved national officials. The officials, who are deputy national officers, had on Tuesday, served a 30-day resignation over alleged ill-treatment by the party leadership.\n\nDaily Sun gathered that at yesterday\u2019s meeting, the second within 24 hours, Secondus appealed to the deputy national officers to reconsider their decision to quit.\n\nA source privy to the discussion at meeting said Secondus told the aggrieved party officials that there was need for all members of the PDP executive to finish strong, especially as their tenure was coming to an end. The source noted that at the end of the meeting, the party said they would consult and get back to the NWC.\n\nDaily Sun equally gathered that in the aftermath of the notice of resignation by the seven national officials and call by the national youth leader, Sunday Udeh-Okoye, for the resignation of Secondus, PDP have been making frantic efforts to calm frayed nerves.\n\nIt was gathered that at a meeting attended by some members of the PDP NWC and Board of Trustees (BoT) on Tuesday night, in Abuja, all the officials, including those threatening to resign should return to their zones and consult with the stakeholders on the current situation in the party.\n\nHowever, the NWC said it had activated internal conflict resolution mechanism to ensure amicable resolution of all issues affecting the party.\n\nThe party in a statement by Kola Ologbondiyan said the party\u2019s NWC rose from a crucial meeting where it reviewed the state of the party, with a view to creating an atmosphere that would engender stability within the party.\n\nOlogbondiyan said against the backdrop, the NWC urged all PDP members to remain calm. He assured members that the PDP remained stable as the NWC was working to bring the party back to power in 2023.\n\nRegardless, Secondus, in a statement by his media aide, Ike Abonyi, alleged that a strong chieftain bent on hijacking the opposition party is unrelenting in the quest to dent his image.\n\nIn the statement entitled \u201cWho is after Secondus and Why is somebody in love of caretaker?\u201d the PDP chairman said he was aware that the said party chieftain was out to hijack the party for his inordinate ambition.\n\n\u201cAnswers to the above posers will help members of the public to decipher the recent disquiet in the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and why few months to National Convention of the party, somebody is routing for a Caretaker Committee to run the affairs of the party.\n\n\u201cThe media office of the National Chairman is privy to an intelligence that the strong party chieftain bent on hijacking the party structure for destruction is still on the lose with the main agenda of denting the image of Prince Uche Secondus the National Chairman.\n\n\u201cReports reaching this office shows clearly that this character is deploying all devious means to try and diminish the person and character of the National Chairman with a view to having his way of ultimately hijacking the structure for his disproportionately large ambition\u2026\n\n\u201cWhat continues to shock many party observers is the real reason behind the desperation of this man to get at the National Chairman and the quantum of public funds being expended to achieve this illicit goal few months to the National Convention.\n\n\u201cFew months to National Convention anybody who mean well for this party and who is a true democrat should respect the constitution of the party and approach issues dispassionately,\u201d the PDP chairman stated.\n\nMeanwhile, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, yesterday, said his recent trip to Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital had nothing to do with the plot to oust Secondus.\n\nHe was reacting to speculations that he was allegedly part of the plot to sack the party chairman.\n\nThe former vice president, who spoke through his media aide, Paul Ibe, told journalists in a telephone interview, that he is more interested in peace in the party.\n\n\u201cThe trip he made to Port Harcourt, he made a similar one to Delta. And he has more in the offing. Why will he promote peace and stability in the party and be behind moves to sack Secondus? It\u2019s ridiculous for anyone to talk about this.\n\n\u201cAtiku understands the Constitution of the PDP and what the party-stated about tenure for party leadership. So, he cannot be working against something that he understands and promotes.\n\n\u201cThat is not how democrats behave. Those are anti-democratic behaviour and that is not who he is. Whoever is saying this should know it is beer parlour talk and unnecessary mischief.\u201d\n\nIn a related development, former governor of Bayelsa, Senator Seriake Dickson admonished leaders of the PDP to convene an emergency National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting to discuss way of stabilizing the party.\n\nDickson stated this when he met with Secondus at the PDP national secretariat.\n\n\u201cAs we are all aware, some officers of our party, resigned yesterday and we should thank them for their services but If their resignation is aimed at causing crisis in the party then we should all condemn it and those behind it.\u201d\n\nDickson also called on Secondus and the NWC to \u201cutilise their powers under the constitution to discipline erring members involved in the nefarious plot to destroy the party.\n\n\u201cPDP is bigger than any individual and should no longer tolerate people with inordinate ambitions to destroy the party which belongs to all Nigerians.\u201d\n\nInspite of that, a member of BoT, Senator Joy Emordi, yesterday formally defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nAlhaji Mamman Mohammed, Director-General, Press and Media of APC, announced this in a statement issued in Abuja.\n\nThe statement said the Chairman, APC Caretaker and Extra-ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) and Governor of Yobe, Mai Mala Buni, received Emordi at a brief ceremony.\n\n\u201cBuni expressed delight with the decision taken by the board member to contribute to the unity of the country.\n\n\u201cThere is need for us to join hands for the political stability and national unity of our dear country,\u201d the statement said.\n\nBut an elder and chieftain of the party, Dr. Nnamdi Onochie, has pleaded with contending forces to bury the hatchet and close ranks to save the party.\n\nOnochie, a long-standing member of the main opposition PDP said unity, reconciliation and peaceful co-existence were needed at this point in time to save the party from implosion and destruction.\n\nHe argued that it would be a costly mistake for the party\u2019s chieftains to engage in bickering with one another with another general election drawing near.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

Under the former administration, an approval was given, but nothing was done, but today, the council has given approval to commence the Lagos-Calabar coastal route.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the rail project is important to the nation\u2019s coastal economy, which is why $11.174 billion is earmarked for it with a completion period of six years.\n\nHis words: \u201cThis particular route is very important because after the Lagos-Kano route, this Lagos-Calabar coastal route, actually will link all the coastal cities in the country.\n\n\u201cThe proposed route alignment is to go from Lagos to Shagamu, Shagamu to Ijebu-Ode, Ijebu-Ode to Ore, Ore to Benin City, Benin to Sapele, Sapele to Warri, Warri to Yenagoa, Yenagoa to Port Harcourt, Port Harcourt to Aba, Aba to Uyo, Uyo to Calabar, Calabar to Akamkpa to Ikom, to Obudu Ranch, with a branch line from Benin City to Asaba, Onitsha Bridge and then Port Harcourt to Onne Deep Seaport.\u201d\n\nThe minister also stressed that the commitment of the present administration to expanding and consolidating on the rail projects across the country informed FEC\u2019s approval of the funds for work to commence immediately on the Kano-Jibia rail and the Port Harcourt-Maiduguri route.\n\nSpeaking also, Minister of Power, Sale Mamman, disclosed that FEC approved two projects for his ministry, including the construction of 2 by 60 MVA 132 33 substation at Gagarawa, Jigawa State, in favour of Messrs Power Control and Appliances Limited in the sum of N154,212,396.05.\n\n\u201cThe second one is the award of the contract for the engineering, procurement and construction of 2 by 30 MVA 132 33 substation at Ibiono Ibom, Akwa Ibom State in favour of Messrs YEMEC West Africa Limited in the sum of US$6.2 offshore plus N1.8 billion onshore,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his part, the Minister of State for Education, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba stated, \u201cToday, the Federal Ministry of Education presented two memos. The first one dealt with ratification of convention Nigeria had already acceded to which seeks to regularise the recognition of certificates and diplomats all across Africa.\u201d\n\nThe second memo, according to him, dealt with the award of contract for the building of two blocks of social science complexes at Adamawa State University in Mubi for a total sum of N1,103,000,000, which is a TETFUND allocation that emerged from 2017 through 2021.\n\nSylva: Rehabilitation of Warri, Kaduna refineries to gulp $1.484bn\n\nMeanwhile, Sylva has announced the approval of $1.484 billion for the rehabilitation of Warri and Kaduna refineries.\n\nThe minister, who made this disclosure to newsmen at the end of the FEC meeting, also said 15 per cent of the total sum for the rehabilitation of the two refineries in Port Harcourt which was awarded earlier this year had been paid to the construction firm currently working at site.\n\nThe minister said the FEC meeting approved the award of contracts for the rehabilitation of Warri and Kaduna refineries to Messers Saipem SPA and Saipem Contracting Limited at the combined total sum of $1.484 billion.\n\nAccording to him, $897,678,800 would be spent to repair Warri refinery while Kaduna refinery will gulp $586,902,256.\n\nHe stressed that the completion of the rehabilitation exercise would be in three phases spread over a 77-month period.\n\nHe explained: \u201cThe completion of the rehabilitation of Warri and Kaduna refineries is going to be in three phases. First phase will be completed within 21 months, in 23 months phase two will be completed and in 33 months, the full rehabilitation will be completed.\u201d\n\nOn Port Harcourt refinery, Sylva noted that the repair work had commenced adding that already the first 15 per cent of the contract sum has been paid to the contractor and the contractor was fully mobilised to site.\n\n\u201cWe also discussed in council the need for us to give periodic updates. Soon, we\u2019ll be going to inspect the work in Port Harcourt refinery, and you will all be with us on that visit,\u201d he said.\n\nNNPC misses six-month revenue projection by N1.1trn\n\nMeanwhile, the NNPC failed to meet its gross revenue projections in the first six months of 2021, hitting a huge deficit of N1.106 trillion during the period.\n\nLatest data on the operations of the NNPC obtained by THISDAY indicated that against the benchmark of a monthly budget of N414.941 billion, NNPC in the first half of this year did not meet its revenue forecast, the closest figure to the budgeted figure being N320.315 billion in May.\n\nThe 44-year-old corporation is currently beset with high operational costs, especially in its drilling activities in addition to the reduction in oil production quota by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which has led to the shutting down of some of its assets.\n\nMoreover, payment of fuel subsidy remains a burden the corporation has been shouldering, even though it has said the situation is unsustainable, with under-recovery gulping over N608 billion between February and June this year.\n\nInformation on the corporation\u2019s funding performance showed that while gross revenue forecast for the year was put at N4.979 trillion and N2.489 trillion in the first half, it has only be able to meet its financial target to the tune of N1.383 trillion, leaving a shortfall of N1.106 trillion.\n\nIn January, out of the calendarised sum of N414.941 billion, the NNPC only struggled to earn a gross revenue of N195.624 billion, same in February when it made a gross revenue of N191.194 billion.\n\nIn March, revenue rose to N224.589 billion, while they were N156.366 billion, N320.315 billion and N295, 396 billion respectively in April, May and June.\n\nSome of the capital projects earmarked for the year 2021 have also suffered under-funding, with Brass LNG Gas Supply Project in Bayelsa receiving zero financing for the six months under consideration.\n\nThe Brass LNG project designed to produce 10 million metric tonnes per annum of liquefied natural gas, was initially agreed to be built by the NNPC, Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Eni Group, but have seen the exit of ConocoPhillips and Chevron. It has now been in the works for over a decade.\n\nAdded to that, national domestic gas development, which had a budget of N40.352 billion for the first six months, only got N20.22 billion, leaving a deficit of N20.130 billion. Also, gas infrastructure development had a shortfall of N15.7 billion, while funding for frontier exploration fell by N12.9 billion during the first six months of the year.\n\nSimilarly, the N3.05 billion budgeted for renewable energy for the year, had a shortfall of N789 million as of June, while the Nigeria/ Morocco pipeline with a budget of N1 billion was underfunded by N83 million.\n\nIt also showed that fuel landing cost for the 22 vessels that brought the product into the country in June, ranged from between N185 to N209, with the recorded under-recovery for the month being N114.337 billion.\n\nFor pipelines\u2019 repair and management cost for June, security and maintenance gulped N3.2 billion, actual facilities\u2019 repairs cost N599.5 million while strategic holding by the NNPC was N677.5 million, totalling N4.530 billion.\n\nHowever, the NNPC and the Minister of State, Petroleum, Mr Timipre Sylva, had on two separate occasions said they were dealing with the twin issues of high production cost per unit of crude oil, said to be one of the highest in the world as well as low production quota handed down by OPEC.\n\nOn the third issue of subsidy, the minister had said negotiations were still ongoing with organised labour.\n\nIn the heat of the COVID-19-induced oil market crash last year, the Group Managing Director of the national oil company, Mr. Mele Kyari, had said along with its joint partners, the NNPC was targeting a production cost per unit of $10 per barrel.\n\nAsked in a recent interview if the target had been met, Kyari told journalists that although the corporation had reduced unit cost by 30 per cent, he could not readily give the actual average cost per every barrel pumped at the time, saying that the NNPC had approached its contractors for renegotiation of contracts, which yielded results.\n\nHe had also said with the contract renegotiations and discounts, in addition to some optimisation of operating process driven by the National Upstream Cost Optimisation Programme (NUCOP), reduced the cost of production by close to a third.\n\nOn low OPEC quota, Sylva during a meeting with the Secretary General of the organisation, Dr. Sanusi Barkindo, last week, noted that Nigeria will be seeking a new reference production figure in addition to the 30,000 barrels Nigerian share of the members\u2019 July agreement of about 400,000 barrels per day.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022APC faces \u2018legal ditch\u2019 over Supreme Court ruling in Ondo, legality of Buni\u2019s leadership called to question\n\n\u2022PDP in crisis of confidence, plagued by defections, resignations\n\nChuks Okocha and\n\nAlex Enumah in Abuja\n\nFor the two main political parties in the country \u2013 the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) \u2013 the road to 2023 appears inauspicious. Both parties are not only bogged down by leadership crises, but they are also plagued by seemingly intractable survival battles. Strangely, since the APC was coupled together on February 6 , 2013, by the different tendencies that came together, it has never been able to form a Board of Trustees.\n\nThe ruling party is today facing stringent legal complications, which have thrown its leadership into confusion since last weekend, after a Supreme Court judgement in the Ondo State governorship election sounded the alarm. PDP, too, is not only contending with a crisis of confidence but it is also desperately afflicted by a spree of defections by governors, and lawmakers elected on its platform, which has been compounded by yesterday\u2019s resignations of top ranking party officials.\n\nThe reality of the delicate state of things in APC did not dawn on majority of members until the Supreme Court judgement in the Ondo State governorship election petition. The judgement suggested that the party would have lost the state to PDP had the opposition party\u2019s governorship candidate, Eyitayo Jegede, joined APC\u2019s National Caretaker Committee Chairman and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, in the suit. .\n\nThe technicality of the case had split the seven-man Supreme Court panel to a four-three majority decision, with the minority judgement led by Justice Mary Odili, arguing that the apex court should have sacked Governor Rotimi Akeredolu since Buni acted on behalf of the party. But the majority judgement delivered by Justice Emmanuel Agim contended that since all the issues revolved around Buni, he should have been joined for the argument to be valid.\n\nThe crux of the debate followed the position held by some members of the party that as governor of Yobe State, an executive position, Buni could not at the same time act as the APC chairman, another executive office. They alleged that Buni contravened both Section 183 of the 1999 Constitution and Article 17 (iv) of the APC constitution.\n\nBut Buni and a few other like-minded party faithful disagreed and despite a plea by majority of party members to suspend last weekend\u2019s congresses for fear of the unknown, the Caretaker Committee went ahead with the exercise.\n\nTHISDAY had reported earlier this week that the vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, acting on the instruction of President Muhammadu Buhari, had made desperate moves, after a meeting of all lawyers in the cabinet, to call off the congresses. This was for the fear that the hint from the Supreme Court judgement in Ondo State could come back to haunt the party.\n\nBut from all indications, reason is believed to have started prevailing, as governors elected on the platform of APC and other stakeholders are now considering the way forward. Their options are believed to include the possibility of cancelling the congresses to save the party from a myriad of potential future legal challenges.\n\nTo this end, a chieftain of APC, Okosisi Ngwu, has dragged the Buni-led caretaker committee before a High Court in Abuja seeking a nullification of the congresses. The plaintiff is also asking the court to declare the congresses held under Buni as illegal, flowing from the Supreme Court judgement that questioned the validity of the Buni-led Caretaker Committee.\n\nThe suit marked FCT/HC/CV/1824/2021 and dated August 2, 2021, listed the APC and all members of the caretaker committee as defendants.\n\nThey are Buni, Isiaka Oyebola, Ken Nnamani, Stella Okorete, Governor Sani Bello, Dr James Lalu, Senator Abubakar Yusuf, Hon. Akenyemi Olaide, David Leon, Abba Ali, Prof. Tahir Mamman, Ismail Ahmed, and Senator James Akpanudoedehe.\n\nIn the originating summons filed by his counsel, Chief Oba Maduabuchi (SAN), Ngwu is further asking the court to dissolve the committee, as there was no organ of the party or any such organisation in the party\u2019s constitution as Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC).\n\nHe equally sought a declaration that pursuant to Section 87(4)(b)(1) of the Electoral Act (as amended), only the National Executive Committee of a political party could validly appoint a date for the holding of primaries for the nomination of the governorship or other candidates of the political party.\n\nNgwu, who hinted that he had wanted to contest the position of the National Chairman of the party in 2018, urged the court to grant an order setting aside all actions and decisions taken by members of CECPC of the party.\n\nAPC is, apparently, yet to agree on a strategy to approach the quagmire it has found itself in. But what the majority of members feel the party can minimise its losses by, first, cancelling the congresses and, then, fathoming a way out of the legal ditch it has found itself.\n\nIn PDP, the last few months have been palpably discomforting, with the party losing about three governors and several state and federal lawmakers to different reasons, including not being able to tag along anymore with the PDP leadership.\n\nLeading the defection train was the governor of Ebonyi State, Dave Umahi, followed by Cross River State Governor Ben Ayade, and, most recently, Zamfara State Governor Bello Matawalle, whose defection had also raised some constitutional concerns following the manner of his emergence as governor.\n\nMatawalle had emerged governor after the 2019 general election, sequel to a Supreme Court judgement that disqualified all APC candidates across the board over allegedly flawed primary elections. Although PDP is still in court challenging Matawalle\u2019s defection and asking the Supreme Court to sack him, a fresh crisis has erupted in the party, with the National Youth Leader, Sunday Udey-Okoye, berating the National Chairman of the party, Uche Secondus.\n\nThis was soon taken a notch up as seven officials of the party tendered their letters of resignation yesterday over allegations of marginalisation by the party leadership.\n\nBut Secondus has described what the youth leader said as the price of leadership, wondering why he did not realise that the deputies that resigned were not given any official duties in the last three years or since the inception of the party.\n\nOther members of the NWC, it was gathered, equally berated the national youth leader, alleging that he is being economical with the truth. One of the NWC members, who spoke to THISDAY on condition of anonymity, stated, \u201cAsk the deputies that resigned, they knew before they contested elections to become officials of the party; knew that they are not entitled to attend the NWC meeting, less invited.\n\n\u201cIf they were not sponsored, why are they just waking up from their slumber? This is a constitutional issue. There is nothing we could do unless the constitution of the party is amended.\n\n\u201cThis has been the case right from the formation of the party. They are being used.\u201d\n\nThe NWC member said, a National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting would soon be summoned to address the issues raised.\n\nSecondus, in his response, claimed that the issue was not personal but the price of leadership. He alleged that the seven deputies that resigned were sponsored, as they were all aware of their status before being elected.\n\n\u201cThe National Working Committee of our great party at its meeting today received the notice of the resignation from deputies, who are elected members of the National Executive Committee,\u201d Secondus confirmed.\n\nResponding to the emergency, National Publicity Secretary of PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, said, \u201cThe meeting of the National Working Committee and the deputies immediately took place to dialogue on the issues that were raised. The party will look into the grievances raised by members of NEC as well as members of the National Working Committee.\n\n\u201cThe internal conflict resolution mechanism of our party has also been immediately activated to put these issues behind us. We call on all the leaders, stakeholder and members of our great party to remain calm as we collectively resolve these issues.\u201d\n\nBut in an interview with newsmen, the youth leader blamed Secondus for the problems of the party.\n\nThe youth leader stated, \u201cMr. Uche Secondus, the national chairman of the party, is incompetent of managing the affairs of this party, he lacks managerial capacity to manage PDP. He had made sure that many departments of the party did not function as effectively as it ought to function. Mr. Chairman has nothing to offer to the party; only to come here and deceive us.\n\n\u201cThere is a sharp division in our NWC right now, not only me, many more NWC members are more aggrieved than myself.\u201d\n\nIn a similar vein, National Organising Secretary of the PDP, Col. Austin Akobundu, confirmed the resignation of seven members of the NWC.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that by the PDP constitution, the seven different deputies that resigned were not truly eligible to attend meetings of the NWC. It is the substantive officers that attend the NWC, except where in the absence of the substantive official.\n\nBut the deputies have been agitating that they should be allowed to attend the main NWC meeting as the information reaching them after NWC was always secondary. The seven national officers of PDP, in their separate letters, addressed to National Secretary of the party, Senator Unaru Tsauri, on Tuesday, alleged being side-lined and unfairly treated by the National Chairman, Secondus.\n\nThose who have resigned are Deputy National Financial Secretary, Deputy National Organising Secretary, Deputy National Legal Adviser, Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Deputy Woman Leader, and Deputy National Auditor.\n\nOne of the deputies that resigned, who pleaded anonymity, also berated the Secondus-led NWC for allegedly treating deputy national officers \u201cas if we are nobodies.\u201d\n\nAsked to clarify the statement, the officer said, \u201cSince our election in 2017, we (deputy national officers) have only met with our chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, thrice. It is not as if he called us; on those three occasions, we sought audience with him.\n\n\u201cThe most annoying part is that during Christmas and Sallah festivities, the NWC would visit our governors. They would collect money and other items but I can tell you that they don\u2019t share anything with the deputies. To him, we are just a necessary evil to be tolerated but never to be catered for.\n\n\u201cWe all have our constituencies and our followers but from the way we are being treated, it appears they see us as nothing but appendages forced on them by the party\u2019s constitution.\u201d\n\nAs at press time, the Secondus-led NWC was meeting and a statement expected from the meeting.\n\nMeanwhile, the PDP Governors\u2019 Forum said it received with regrets and sadness the recent rumblings in the party. It called on all members of the party and stakeholders to remain calm in the face of the developments.\n\nThe PDP governors, in a statement by their chairman, Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal, said, \u201cWe plead with all aggrieved persons and those with the interest of the PDP at heart to keep their gun powder dry, as efforts are being made in consultation with members of the PDP Board of Trustees and other stakeholders to resolve all contending issues.\n\n\u201cTo this end, the PDP Governors\u2019 Forum has scheduled an emergency meeting to discuss the affairs of the party and the way forward. The PDP, as the only remaining hope of the nation for good governance, must show an example to Nigerians and also take advantage of the current disarray in the APC and its rudderless government.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

In a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Lanre Lasisi, Gbajabiamila said Emefiele was one Nigerian whose track record of excellence was there for all to see.\n\nThe statement quoted the speaker as saying regarding Emefiele, \u201cNigeria and Nigerians are proud of him for his services.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, felicitated Emefiele, describing him as an invaluable asset to Nigeria.\n\nSanwo-Olu, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Gboyega Akosile, noted that the CBN governor\u2019s input to the country\u2019s economy and the financial sector were clear testament to his visionary leadership.\n\nThe governor said the renowned economist and banker had used his wealth of experience for the benefit of the private sector, especially the banking industry, at a most challenging period of the country\u2019s economic development.\n\nSanwo-Olu stated, \u201cOn behalf of my adorable wife, Ibijoke, and the good people of Lagos State, I heartily congratulate the CBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, on the occasion of his Diamond Jubilee.\u201d\n\nThe governor said attaining the age of 60 year in grace was worth celebrating, considering Emefiele\u2019s remarkable track record in the financial world. He said the CBN governor\u2019s performance had earned him an enviable place as Governor of Nigeria\u2019s apex bank.\n\nAccording to Sanwo-Olu, over the years, Emefiele has proved his worth as a good manager of human and capital resources in both the private and public sectors.\n\nThe governor stated, \u201cAs CBN Governor, Emefiele has been a worthy partner in our administration\u2019s quest to build a Greater Lagos for millions of Lagosians, by creatively working with us in some areas of intervention aimed at building institutions for sustainable economic growth and development of Lagos State.\n\n\u201cMr. Emefiele\u2019s intellectual input to the nation\u2019s economy in this globally economic depressing period has helped in no small measure to stabilise the business environment, while restoring confidence in the ecosystem.\n\n\u201cAs Mr. Godwin Emefiele celebrates his Diamond Jubilee, I wish him good health and more fruitful years. I pray that God will continue to preserve and grant him good health to enable him render more service to humanity and our dear nation.\u201d\n\nEmefiele has been at the forefront of Nigeria\u2019s economic diversification drive, by providing the critical financial support to operators in the non-oil sector. Under him, the CBN has rolled out massive development interventions in critical sectors of the economy, especially in agriculture, manufacturing, and Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs).\n\nThe interventions Emefiele include the SME Credit Guarantee Scheme (SMECGS); Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Fund (MSMEDF); Agri-business/Small and Medium Enterprises Investment Scheme (AGSMEIS); Creative Industry Financing Initiative (CIFI); Targeted Credit Facility (TCF) and the Nigeria Youth Investment Fund (NYIF); the Youth Entrepreneurship Development Programme (YEDP); and the Anchor Borrowers\u2019 Programme (ABP), among several other development finance initiatives in the past seven years.\n\nUnder the MSMEDF, which charges nine per cent interest rate, the disbursement of over N83.9billion to 216,704 beneficiaries was recorded at the end of 2020. AGSMEIS is an initiative of the Bankers\u2019 Committee, in collaboration with the CBN, that was also set up to improve access to affordable and sustainable finance by agri-businesses and MSMEs.\n\nThe initiatives have enhanced job creation and boosted the managerial capacity of agri-businesses and MSMEs.\n\nSo far, a total of N111.7 billion has been disbursed to 29,026 beneficiaries. Furthermore, a N50 billion Targeted Credit Facility was introduced in March 2020 as a stimulus package to cushion the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on households and MSMEs across the country. The fund has been increased N400 billion.\n\nIn terms of the ABP, over 3.1 million farmers have been financed for the cultivation of crops across 21 agricultural commodities. Also, a total of 3,107,890 farmers have been financed for the cultivation of 3,801,397 hectares across 21 commodities through 23 Participating Financial Institutions in the 36 states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) from the inception of the programme till date.\n\nFor the YEDP, which was launched in 2016 to enhance the deployment of the ingenuity and resourcefulness of Nigerian youths to achieve maximum economic development, a total of N173.4 million has been disbursed to over 67 beneficiaries. The target beneficiaries are members of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), non-NYSC (but not more than five years post-NYSC), holders of verifiable tertiary institution certificates, and artisans with First School Leaving Certificate or a technical certificate or accredited proficiency certificate from the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE).\n\nEmefiele also earned his stripes as one of the heroes of the country\u2019s efforts to contain COVID-19. The CBN under Emefiele\u2019s leadership was proactive in mitigating the effects of the pandemic on the economy.\n\nImmediately the first COVID-19 case was recorded in Lagos, the Emefiele-led CBN took decisive actions and unfolded a raft of measures to moderate the effect of the virus on households, businesses, and the economy.\n\nEmefiele was also instrumental to the formation of the private-sector-led Coalition Against COVID-19 (CACOVID), which was able to mobilise billions of naira and has immensely supported the country\u2019s COVID-19 fight by setting up healthcare facilities across the country and distributing palliatives to states. It also established a health sector grant to promote research in the development of vaccines, among other policy measures.\n\nThe health sector facility has provided loans to pharmaceutical companies to expand and open drug-manufacturing plants in the country, and it has helped hospitals and healthcare practitioners to expand and build health facilities.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "A YouTuber, Israel Balogun who runs the Wholeness Africa Initiatives channel, has alleged death threats to his life by members of the Omega Fire Ministries led by Apostle Johnson Suleman over a 'Miracle Money' scandal.\n\nIn one of his videos on YouTube, Balogun analysed and condemned a video from two of the programmes of the church, one in Atlanta, USA, titled, 'Impact 2021' which was held in July and a June 2021 programme, Holy Ghost Conference 2021 held in Auchi, Edo State Nigeria, tagged, 'Harvest of Miracle Money'.\n\nBalogun, in the video, that has generated controversies, had said there was nothing like miracle money but a planned scheme to make people believe angels were dropping money into their accounts.\n\nHe also alleged that the pastor and ministers of the church will use such tactics to take double of such amounts from church members who received the miracle money.\n\nThe video of the controversial programme shows Suleman saying, \"The Holy Ghost just whispered to me, I'm going to pray and make declarations, after that you will check your account.\u201d\n\nAnother voice said, \"Papa (a term used by church members for Suleman), there is a miracle alert here, she just got her alert of $1,000.\"\n\nSuleman said again, \"Miracle alert, as you get it, run here. Angels begin to put money in your account.\"\n\nIn his analysis that has now brought about threats, Balogun said, \"Apostle Suleman is destroying the gospel of God, why would a man begin by telling people there will be miracle money in their accounts, you are using the name of Christ to do Miracle or Magic?\n\n\u201cThis is not the gospel, this man stood in the midst of the people, in the church in Atlanta and in his church in Nigeria asking people to bring out their phones and there would be miracle money in their account. You must not fold your arms and allow such a thing to continue, Nigerian Christian leaders must dissociate themselves from something like this, they must tell the world that they are never part of the gospel that this man is preaching.\n\n\u201cThis is not Christ, this is not Christianity, this is voodoo, this is magic, this is not from God and it can never be from God. God does not deposit money in people's accounts, angels do not share money. It is either this guy has some people behind the scenes who have pre-collected people's bank details, who do not even know they wanted to use it for anything.\n\n\u201cThey might have asked people to fill some particular forms and asking them to make their bank details on that form and using that form to distribute the money at the time the programme was going on. These people are going to pay more for the money they collected, time will come when they will ask them to sow the seed and pay 'dangerous tithes', they will pay double of that money back to the ministry and this man (Suleman) is using this tactic. There is nothing like angels distributing money into people's accounts.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\"This video is that of a man who has an arrangement with some guys, this is what they do behind the scenes. They would have collected information of people before now and so when the man starts the programme, the guys who want to do it have already programmed it, automated payments at the time the money will be released.\n\n\u201cAnd when the time comes, those people will pay in double because that trick will make them believe it is God and henceforth whatsoever the man of God tells them has to be obeyed, that is why I said the church must stand against that kind of practice and bring sanity back to Christianity.\u201d\n\nIn a follow-up video, Balogun said he was being threatened for all he had said in the video. According to him, members of the Omega Fire Ministries have reached out to him, threatening to kill him and \u2019get rid of him'.\n\nHe said, \"After the video that I made analysing how Apostle Johnson Suleman did a 'Miracle Money' in Atlanta and in his church in Nigeria, this year 2021, June and July, I have received countless calls, messages from his members telling me that they are coming after me, that I will get missing, they will make sure no one hears of me, that they have the power to send me to where I belong.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, one of them said and confirmed on his platform that he will let me hear the language that I understand and I think the last time such message was mentioned in my country, Nigeria, means that anyone who carries firearms will be shot or those called bandits shot on sight and I have never been part of bandits or to carry firearms, but the guy said I will be gotten rid of.\"\n\nBalogun also played a recording from the conversation he had with one Obi-West Utchaychukwu, a purported follower of Apostle Suleman who said, \"You are suffering, you are looking for followers, you have the guts to ridicule Apostle Suleman, wait I will send my photo to you, you will see my photo on WhatsApp, I travelled to Ukraine and I interview undercover.\n\n\u201cI have Adelaja, your mentor, on my palm and for me to kill you is a small thing and I will pick you up, I am already on your case. You are looking for followers that will subscribe to your channel. You want to use the man of God, you want to use Apostle Suleman for ridicule so that you will get traffic to your page, you are lying, I will get you, go and mark it, I will get you.\"\n\nBalogun continued, \"This call comes from a man who called himself Obi-West Utchaychukwu, he lives in Finland and he called me on WhatsApp threatening me that my life is about to come to an end because I spoke against the 'Money Miracle' of Apostle Johnson Suleman in Atlanta and not only that, many of the members of Omega Fire have come to my DM to threaten me, that they will shut me up, they said they know the address of my house, that they know where my wife works and where my family resides, they said they are coming for me.\n\n\u201cI am making this video to Nigerians and to anyone watching it right now, if I get missing, if nothing is being heard of my family, if anything happens whatsoever, know that these men are the ones behind it. They will say it, they will do it and this phrase of 'you will get missing is common to Omega Fire Ministries founder, Apostle Suleman because on many occasions people had issues with him and we have heard audio messages of him talking to someone that the person will not be found anymore.\n\n\u201cI don't know when I will get missing but I am calling on Nigerians and other well-to-do individuals, please do not let my death be in vain, because these men could be dangerous and whatever it is.\n\n\u201cI, Israel Balogun, will not stop talking until the day I get missing, I will keep talking about the messages that have polluted our pulpits that have turned our Christianity to paganism, I will continue to talk until mammon is dethroned, and Christ takes over his pulpit in Nigeria, I will continue to talk until you guys stop encouraging laziness and commanding money into people's accounts.\n\n\u201cGod himself designed the earth that until we till the ground, we can never make profit. It is labour that gives profit, not a miracle when people begin to have money in their accounts just by a pastor commanding it, you have destroyed the value of labour, work, dignity, you make people believe in miracles that can change their stories overnight instead of them to pass through the process of success.\n\n\u201cApostle Johnson Suleman, you can kill me, you can get rid of me, you can call IGP (Inspector General of Police) to pick me up today but remember, there are millions of my kind that will rise up in Nigeria, that will spring forth; they will speak and demand that you stop doing this.\u201d",

          "text": "A report on how former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, was the subject of a probe 11 years ago by the United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs chaired by Senator Carl Levin has been obtained by SaharaReporters.\n\nThe report detailed how Atiku as Vice President of Nigeria used offshore companies to siphon millions of dollars between 2000 and 2008 to his fourth wife in the United States, Jennifer Iwenjiora Douglas Abubakar.\n\nJennifer, originally an indigene of Onitsha, Anambra State, and a Nigerian Television Authority News correspondent in the 1980s later moved to and became a citizen of the United States.\n\nAccording to the report submitted to the US Senate by the committee on February 10, 2010, the illegally transferred money made Atiku an \u201cemployer of labor\u201d and a proud owner of American University of Nigeria (AUN), a school, whose tuition fees more than 99% of Nigerian students cannot afford.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain established AUN at a time when public universities were collapsing under him and Obasanjo and poor Nigerian students were languishing at home due to strike action by lectures over poor funding.\n\nFormer President George Bush had in 2004 barred Atiku and other corrupt politically exposed persons from being issued visas to the US.\n\nDocuments Expose How Ex-Vice President, Atiku Used Wife To Launder $40million To US For Eight Years by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\nThe US Senate probe indicting the former Nigerian Vice President was motivated by US government concern about corruption in the Third World and its corrosive effects on the development of honest government, democratic principles, and the rule of law.\n\nThe report partly reads, \u201cFrom 2000 to 2008, Jennifer Douglas, a U.S. citizen and the fourth wife of Atiku Abubakar, former Vice President and former candidate for President of Nigeria, helped her husband bring over $40 million in suspect funds into the United States through wire transfers sent by offshore corporations to U.S. bank accounts.\n\n\u201cIn a 2008 civil complaint, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that Ms. Douglas received over $2 million in bribe payments in 2001 and 2002, from Siemens AG, a major German corporation.\n\n\u201cWhile Ms. Douglas denies wrongdoing, Siemens has already pleaded guilty to U.S. criminal charges and settled civil charges related to bribery and told the Subcommittee that it sent the payments to one of her U.S. accounts.\n\n\u201cIn 2007, Mr. Atiku was the subject of corruption allegations in Nigeria related to the Petroleum Technology Development Fund. Of the $40 million in suspect funds, $25 million was wire transferred by offshore corporations into more than 30 U.S. bank accounts opened by Ms. Douglas, primarily by Guernsey Trust Company Nigeria Ltd., LetsGo Ltd. Inc., and Sima Holding Ltd.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. banks maintaining those accounts were, at times, unaware of her PEP status, and they allowed multiple, large offshore wire transfers into her accounts.

In addition, two of the offshore corporations wire transferred about $14 million over five years to American University in Washington, D.C., to pay for consulting services related to the development of a Nigerian university founded by Mr. Atiku Abubakar.\n\n\u201cAmerican University accepted the wire transfers without asking about the identity of the offshore corporations or the source of their funds, because under current law, the University had no legal obligation to inquire.\n\n\u201cCombating corruption is a key U.S. value and goal, due to its corrosive effects on the rule of law, economic development, and democratic principles.

          "text": "A report on how former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, was the subject of a probe 11 years ago by the United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs chaired by Senator Carl Levin has been obtained by SaharaReporters.\n\nThe report detailed how Atiku as Vice President of Nigeria used offshore companies to siphon millions of dollars between 2000 and 2008 to his fourth wife in the United States, Jennifer Iwenjiora Douglas Abubakar.\n\nJennifer, originally an indigene of Onitsha, Anambra State, and a Nigerian Television Authority News correspondent in the 1980s later moved to and became a citizen of the United States.\n\nAccording to the report submitted to the US Senate by the committee on February 10, 2010, the illegally transferred money made Atiku an \u201cemployer of labor\u201d and a proud owner of American University of Nigeria (AUN), a school, whose tuition fees more than 99% of Nigerian students cannot afford.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain established AUN at a time when public universities were collapsing under him and Obasanjo and poor Nigerian students were languishing at home due to strike action by lectures over poor funding.\n\nFormer President George Bush had in 2004 barred Atiku and other corrupt politically exposed persons from being issued visas to the US.\n\nDocuments Expose How Ex-Vice President, Atiku Used Wife To Launder $40million To US For Eight Years by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\nThe US Senate probe indicting the former Nigerian Vice President was motivated by US government concern about corruption in the Third World and its corrosive effects on the development of honest government, democratic principles, and the rule of law.\n\nThe report partly reads, \u201cFrom 2000 to 2008, Jennifer Douglas, a U.S. citizen and the fourth wife of Atiku Abubakar, former Vice President and former candidate for President of Nigeria, helped her husband bring over $40 million in suspect funds into the United States through wire transfers sent by offshore corporations to U.S. bank accounts.\n\n\u201cIn a 2008 civil complaint, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that Ms. Douglas received over $2 million in bribe payments in 2001 and 2002, from Siemens AG, a major German corporation.\n\n\u201cWhile Ms. Douglas denies wrongdoing, Siemens has already pleaded guilty to U.S. criminal charges and settled civil charges related to bribery and told the Subcommittee that it sent the payments to one of her U.S. accounts.\n\n\u201cIn 2007, Mr. Atiku was the subject of corruption allegations in Nigeria related to the Petroleum Technology Development Fund. Of the $40 million in suspect funds, $25 million was wire transferred by offshore corporations into more than 30 U.S. bank accounts opened by Ms. Douglas, primarily by Guernsey Trust Company Nigeria Ltd., LetsGo Ltd. Inc., and Sima Holding Ltd.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. banks maintaining those accounts were, at times, unaware of her PEP status, and they allowed multiple, large offshore wire transfers into her accounts.

          "text": "A group of elders and politicians from Kano State has asked a court to compel the Senate President, Ahmed Lawan and Speaker of the House of Representatives, Olufemi Gbajabiamila to hasten the exit of the South-East from Nigeria before concluding ongoing amendment to the country\u2019s constitution.\n\nThe request formed one of the three prayers sought in a suit marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/538/2021 instituted at the Federal High Court in Abuja.\n\nThe politicians include Nastura Ashir Shariff, Balarabe Rufa\u2019I, Abdul-Aziz Sulaiman and Aminu Adam.\n\nThey averred in a supporting affidavit that their action was informed by the need to stem the tide of violence and destruction allegedly occasioned by the agitation for secession, championed by the Nnamdi Kanu-led Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).\n\nListed as defendants in the suit are the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) (Abubakar Malami), the Senate President (Lawan), the Speaker of the House of Representatives (Gbajabiamila) and the National Assembly.\n\nThe plaintiffs prayed the court for the following reliefs: \u201cA declaration that, by the combined effect of the provisions of Section 4 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended), and Articles 1, 2, and 20(1) of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights (Ratification and Enforcement) Act 2004, the 4th defendant (the National Assembly) is empowered to set in motion a framework for a referendum to allow the South-eastern region of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to decide on their bid for self-determination.\n\n\u201cA declaration that in view of the provisions of Articles 1, 2, 4, 14 and 20(1) of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights (Ratification and Enforcement) Act 2004, the 2nd and 3rd defendants (the Senate President and House of Reps Speaker) have the power to call for a joint session of both Chambers of the 4th defendant to deliberate on the agitation for self-determination by the Southeastern states of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAn order directing the 2nd, 3rd and 4th defendants to provide a framework that will pave the way for the self-determination of the South-eastern states so as to leave the geographical entity called Nigeria before any further step is taken to further amend the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cEven before the emergence of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), there was a group at the south-eastern part of Nigeria known as the Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) under the leadership of one, Chief Ralph Uwazuruike.\n\n\u201cThe main objective of the group mentioned in the immediately preceding paragraph is also the creation of the Independent State of Biafra, away from the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cLong before the emergence of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and the Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB), there was a move by the people of the south-eastern part of Nigeria formerly Eastern Region led by the late Col. Odumegwu Ojukwu to secede from the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe secession attempt by the people of the then Eastern Region under the leadership of the late Col. Ojukwu was directly responsible for the first Nigerian Civil War between 1967 and 1970. The said civil war had claimed many innocent lives from both sides of the divide as well as destruction of properties worth billions of naira which was detrimental to the growth and development of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe lessons of the civil war have faded in the minds of many Nigerians and a repeat of the carnage of the civil war is not necessary, going forward. The IPOB\u2019s agitation for self-determination has turned violent against both the people of the south-east who are against their agitations and other Nigerians carrying out their lawful businesses within the south-eastern states of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe IPOB through its militant arm \u2014 Eastern Security Network (ESN) \u2014 is responsible for the killings, expulsions and destruction of properties of other Nigerians not belonging to the Igbo tribe. Resolving, with finality, the existential question of self-determination of any part of Nigeria is now more urgent, imperative and prevails over and above the issue of amending the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria can be further amended at any time after the question of self-determination must have been resolved by Nigerians.\u201d\n\nThe case has been assigned to Justice Inyang Eden Ekwo and has been fixed for November 1, 2021 for hearing.",

          "title": "MTN finally repatriates 2020 dividend from Nigeria after forex crisis",
          "text": "South Africa\u2019s MTN Group has repatriated its last year\u2019s dividend of around $280 million (R4.2 billion) from its local unit in Nigeria. The company reported the payout on Monday during the release of preliminary financial results for the six months to June 30, 2021.\n\nThe funds from Nigeria are part of approximately $650 million (R9.3 billion) in cash the pan-African telecoms giant returned from its subsidiaries.\n\nThe Johannesburg-based group had been struggling to get dividends out of its subsidiaries due to the challenges of securing foreign currency in Nigeria and some other markets where it operates.\n\nAs a result, MTN was forced to suspend dividend payout for the 2020 financial year. The company also cited other reasons for the suspension, such as the timing of proceeds from an ongoing asset realisation programme (ARP) and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAnnounced in March 2019, the ARP seeks to simplify the group\u2019s portfolio, reduce debt and improve returns. Over a three-year period, the programme is expected to bring in proceeds of at least R15 billion ($1 billion).\n\n\u201cCash upstreaming from Nigeria remained challenging in terms of securing foreign currency in the market. During 2020, we upstreamed the equivalent of approximately R286 million from Nigeria, with approximately R4.2 billion yet to be repatriated as of 31 December 2020,\u201d the company said back in March.\n\nThe group has now fully secured its cash dividend from Nigeria, in what is one of the two positive developments concerning MTN that will come as a relief to shareholders.\n\nRespite in U.S. court case\n\nIn addition to the news from Nigeria, MTN also revealed \u201cpositive developments\u201d in a United States court case related to the group and its subsidiaries, MTN Afghanistan and MTN Dubai.\n\nAccording to the company, the magistrate assessing complaints of alleged violations of U.S. anti-terrorism regulation had recommended the dismissal of the case.\n\nThe Group had argued that the court has no jurisdiction over the company given it does not operate in the U.S. It also claims the complaint \u201cdoes not allege any conduct by MTN defendants that violated the Anti-Terrorism Act.\u201d\n\nAfter the news of repatriating money from Nigeria and progress in the U.S. court case, MTN shares reportedly finished 6% higher on Monday at R111.30 (around $7).\n\nThe group\u2019s complete half-year results are expected to be released on August 12 and it has told investors to expect between 75% to 85% drop in profit or earnings per share (EPS). This is due to an impairment charge involving its Yemeni business and the decoupling of its operation in Syria.\n\nThe sale of MTN Group\u2019s 75% stake in MTN Syria is part of ongoing attempts to exit markets in the Middle East over the next three to five years, with a plan to fully focus on core African markets.\n\nMTN plans to raise about R15 billion ($1 billion) from shareholding sales in markets outside Africa, proceeds which will be used to reduce its huge debt of nearly R50 billion ($3.5 billion) for the year to December 2020 as well as allocate more capital investments in Africa by 2025.\n\nIn Nigeria, MTN, through its local unit, has earmarked \u20a6600 billion ($1.5 billion) over the next three years to expand broadband access in Africa\u2019s most populous economy.\n\nMobile subscribers decline in Nigeria\n\nFor MTN Nigeria, results for the past half-year showed that service revenue increased by 24.1% year-on-year, despite the number of its mobile subscribers declining by 7.6 million (nearly 10%).\n\nIn December 2020, Nigerian authorities ordered telecom companies to suspend the sale of SIM cards (until April this year). The directive was part of efforts to verify the identities of all mobile subscribers, who were asked to link their phone numbers with national identity numbers.\n\n\u201cOperationally, our mobile subscribers closed H1 at 68.9 million, down 9.9% from December 2020. This was due to the regulatory restrictions on new SIM sales and activations, which was lifted on 19 April 2021,\u201d MTN Nigeria\u2019s CEO, Karl Toriola, said on an analyst call.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nWhile user numbers fell, MTN Nigeria company managed to increase service revenue to \u20a6790.3 billion (about R27 billion, $1.9 billion) driven by a surge in data usage.\n\nEarnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 27.6% to \u20a6417.2 billion ($1 billion) while transaction volume for mobile money increased by 280.8% year-on-year to 55.6 million. Its total MoMo active subscribers reached 6.1 million.\n\nMTN Nigeria aims to sustain \u201cdouble-digit service revenue growth ahead of inflation, driving 4G and rural network expansion,\u201d Toriola said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Can mobile applications help solve Africa's healthcare access problem?",
          "text": "In 2019, Abubakar Yusuf saw his medical condition deteriorate rapidly. The 43-year old carpenter in Nigeria\u2019s Borno State has been suffering from Malaria and experiencing a deadly mix of fever, chills, headache, nausea, and vomiting.\n\n\u201cI would go to the only public health centre in the area but I just don\u2019t think I can wait. There\u2019s likely going to be 20 or 30 people before me and they often attend those that arrived first. So there\u2019s no guarantee I will even see a doctor on time.\u201d\n\nAfter staying indoors for days, the bedridden Yusuf was visited by one of his closest clients who eventually told him about a mobile app that can help him find a doctor and get easy access to treatment.\n\nHe downloaded Zuri Health, booked an appointment for the day after with one of the doctors listed on the platform, and received confirmation by SMS. Through the app, Yusuf was instructed to take some initial measures to help alleviate his condition after which he met with the doctor with a wait time of just 10 minutes. He recovered fully a week later.\n\nYusuf is a fictional figure but his predicament is as real \u2013 for many Africans \u2013 as Zuri Health is. Without discovering the mobile app, he could easily have been one of the more than 400,000 Africans malaria killed in 2019.\n\nAfrica carries a disproportionately high share of the global burden of deaths from diseases: in the same year, the continent accounted for a troubling 94% of all malaria cases and deaths. Approximately 1.6 million Africans died of tuberculosis, malaria, or HIV-related illnesses in 2015 alone.\n\nWhat is even more worrisome is the fact that with proper medication, these diseases can be prevented, treated, or even cured. But there\u2019s a well-documented lack of access to healthcare in Africa.\n\nLess than 50% of people in Africa can access modern health facilities and 80% rely on the chronically underfunded public health services, which suffer from a shortage of everything from drugs to power blackouts.\n\nZuri Health mobile app.\n\nMobile-based healthcare to the rescue\n\nA number of startups have come up with innovative ways to solve the key challenge of accessing healthcare in Africa using technology. One such is Zuri Health, a relatively new player in the continent\u2019s nascent telemedicine (the use of digital devices such as mobile devices and computers to deliver health care) space.\n\nZuri Health is a mobile application that gives patients the opportunity to chat with a doctor, buy medication from a pharmacy, book labs and diagnostic tests or have a doctor visit them at home.\n\nThe company launched in Kenya earlier this year and aims to provide affordable and accessible healthcare solutions via mobile technology with dedicated apps, wap, and SMS services.\n\n\u201cZuri Health is very personal to me,\u201d said founder and CEO Ikechukwu Anoke, in an interview with TechCabal. \u201cThe app is named after my daughter, Zuri, who was born in 2012. Despite being at one of the best hospitals in Kenya, we could not get a doctor to attend to my wife on time while she was in labour.\u201d\n\nThe incident made Ikechukwu realise that even if an individual could afford medical care, the distribution and logistics of healthcare in the country still posed a challenge. But it wasn\u2019t until eight years later, when he himself had a life-threatening experience in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, that he started working on Zuri.\n\n\u201cI had personal health issues before the pandemic which made me even more vulnerable to the virus. With an underlying health problem in a Covid environment, it was vital to think about the provision of healthcare in a different way,\u201d Ikechukwu recalled.\n\nWith most hospitals shut and doctors unavailable in the heat of the pandemic, he says telemedicine and remote care became extremely important at that point.\n\n\u201cIt made sense to build an app through which people could get basic tests done without leaving the comfort of their home and further risk their lives. If we had known earlier, maybe we would have built apps and launched them during the pandemic. The experience of Covid helped what we\u2019ve built today.\u201d\n\nZuri Health launched a beta version in November 2020 and rolled out officially in Nairobi two months later. Since January, Zuri has onboarded more than 250 doctors, who earn extra income from the service they provide, onto its platform.\n\nArthur Ikechukwu Anoke and Daisy Isiaho, co-founders of the mobile app, Zuri Health.\n\nThe opportunity to chat with a doctor and receive diagnoses remotely helps thousands of subscribers that currently use the application save transportation and other logistical costs while receiving necessary medical care.\n\n\u201cZuri Health gives doctors a wider and easier platform to reach patients who need them while the underserved populace can now access affordable and sustainable healthcare,\u201d Ikechukwu said.\n\nThe company, at the end of July, launched an updated version of its app, called Zuri 2.0, which comes with improved features.\n\nZuri Health has also secured partnerships in multiple African countries, which is expected to pave the way for a planned continental expansion. Over the next few months, Zuri wants to enter other markets \u2013 including Nigeria, Ghana, Tanzania, Zambia, Cote D\u00cdvoire, Mozambique, Angola, and Senegal.\n\nAfrica\u2019s e-health industry on the rise\n\nIncreasing mobile penetration and a thriving tech startup scene give hopes that technology can make a big impact in improving access to medical care in Africa.\n\nThe continent is slowly witnessing a proliferation of healthcare apps, which include South Africa\u2019s Hello Doctor, ChanjoPlus and M-Tiba in Kenya, Benin Republic\u2019s GoMedical, and mTrac in Uganda; and more recently, Zuri Health.\n\nThere are clear signs of a coming explosion in the use of mobile technologies in African healthcare similar to the one that\u2019s been seen in financial services. However, recurring key challenges still need to be addressed.\n\nPrevailing issues such as prohibitive smartphone costs for Africans, the majority of which live on less than $1.90 a day, could pose as barriers to the uptake of digital health. Phone penetration in the region stands at just 44% compared to the global average of 66%.\n\nThere is also a large rural-urban digital divide with the greater part of rural Africa suffering from low connectivity and low levels of digital literacy among dwellers in such areas.\n\nFixing healthcare is beyond just tech\n\nHealth sectors in Africa stand to benefit hugely from digital solutions. But more than just the technology is needed for these innovations to scale and make a significant impact across the continent.\n\nThe increasing number of apps that aim to make healthcare widely accessible have to be integrated into public healthcare systems and national health strategies. This is where support from the government is needed.\n\nBeyond just funding, public authorities have to come up with inclusive telemedicine or mobile health (mHealth) policies that address regulatory and data governance issues. Governmental policies will help hold digital healthcare companies accountable and protect the information and data of citizens that use the technologies.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAs the field of mHealth matures, effective policy will become increasingly important, according to a World Health Organisation report.\n\n\u201cThere is an urgent need to drive more meaningful conversations in relation to frameworks around telemedicine because in Africa very few countries have these. Yet it\u2019s fundamental if we should achieve the Sustainable Development Goals,\u201d said Daisy Isiaho, Zuri Health Co-founder and Chief Product Officer.\n\nWhile thousands of Africans like Yusuf continue to have their lives saved by mobile health applications, going forward, governments will have to \u201cplay an active role through regulation and setting up legal frameworks in the growing telemedicine space.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Inconsistent policies are killing African startups",
          "text": "Policies & African startups is a monthly series written by Titi Akinsanmi. All musings are hers and not attributable to TechCabal or any organisations she is serving, working or affiliated with.\n\nFirst of all, introduction\n\nIt has taken many years for me to put pen to paper \u2013 in this form. Why? Well I focused and hoped \u2018those\u2019 who have the expertise, the skills to write etc, etc, etc would get round to doing this. But\u2026the impactful change one seeks truly does begin with one. So here goes\u2026\n\nI write as I speak \u2013 painting pictures with words, sometimes rambling and stopping at bus stops to share an extra nugget, insight or to detour completely. And sometimes I will enter the rabbit hole of writing in formal academic language to address a specific issue.\n\nYou see, this \u2018column\u2019, my writing is not your typical treatise or intellectual exposition on the what, why and how of policy making in the digital economy. It\u2019s a peek into my perfectly imperfect policy wonk mind. A sharing of my thoughts in progress around shenanigans in this space \u2013 the good, bad and ugly.\n\nMusings.\n\nMy goal? Tripartite (that means in three parts!). First is to let the words out of my head beyond when I take the \u2018stage\u2019 and speak to a select few who know; second is to normalize conversations on policy implications of all the innovations happening \u2013 and if just 0.1%, get more innovators thinking on this before and when they hit the market! Third, and for me the most important is to bring this discourse to you \u2013 the end user, the customer, the target of all these innovations. So you understand, get it \u2013 and use the power to influence in an informed way. You see that latter? Well You have the power to be the instigator of the change you want to see.\n\nSo here goes: this first piece is like a get to know you more, more information gathering before a possible first date (I hope we make it to the latter ;-))\n\nBefore we go on though \u2013 what is Policy making? Again no assumptions made right?\n\nSee, Policy making is far from \u2018sexzy\u2019 work \u2013 except for wonks like me :-). It is typically a long and arduous \u2018figuring out\u2019, drafting, negotiations, convincing and consensus building. In plain english: It takes a good amount of time to get close to having the right policy backed by law \u2013 from development to influencing process to adoption, influencing, implementation and then impact tracking (and its measurement).\n\nThe policy making process\n\nIt can seem like it\u2019s overnight, that hardly the case \u2013 but it does happen. [For instance, the Murambatsvina policy and the \u2018look East\u2019 policy in Zimbabwe]. The thing you don\u2019t know, having not paid attention or invested time, resources or built a network, is that it\u2019s likely been brewing under the surface (think lava, volcano eruption; or an underlying like that catches you unawares). Or you have done all this yet still\u2026\n\nLet\u2019s make this practical\u2026use our imaginations (for some reading this is a reality I know).\n\nImagine: You are a startup in some city or town in a tier 2 African country. You practice some solid frugal innovation and come up with a needed product and or service. You worked hard (alone or with a small team) and hit the market. You have a frugal marketing and reputation building strategy that harnesses the power of social media across jurisdictions. You begin to see a return on investment, just a trickle at first and then it steadily (or maybe not \u2013 dips are normal!) and then wham! The government \u2018sees\u2019 you.\n\nJisoos!\n\nWell that imaginning is a reality lived by many businesses across our continent \u2013 in these times seemingly targeting Tech enabled StartUps. The world more than ever before is at terms with the fact that digitisation is important for the growth of the economy and society. For the economically disparate economies on our continent however it seems players are working in different directions \u2013 albeit looking to reach the same goal of a thriving digital economy, apart. With the Covid-enabled growth of the last 18 months these \u2018high IQ toddler\u2019 businesses have faced stiff regulatory actions and inconsistent policies, \u2013 regardless of the intentions behind them. This at a time when African startup ecosystem is garnering global recognition and investor confidence.\n\nHere are a few examples of shifts in policy based on laws (sometimes not!) across our continent in the last 18 months.\n\nFintech in Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya\n\nNigeria\u2019s technology sector was its second-fastest-growing sector from Q1 2018 to Q4 2019. A look at the well appraised Nigerian fintech sector reveals the recently released regulatory directory of the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which states that \u201cby the provisions of Sections 67-70 of the Investments and Securities Act (ISA), 2007 and Rules 414 & 415 of the SEC Rules and Regulations, only foreign securities listed on any Exchange registered in Nigeria may be issued, sold or offered for sale or subscription to the Nigerian public. Accordingly, CMOs who work in concert with the referenced online platforms are hereby notified of the Commission\u2019s position and advised to desist henceforth.\u201d\n\nThe South African Reserve Bank\u2019s (SARB) cautious attitude towards virtual currencies like Bitcoin, as stated in Article 5.1 in its Position Paper on Virtual Currencies NPS 02/2014 that \u2018the Bank does not oversee, supervise or regulate the VC (virtual currencies) landscape, systems or intermediaries for effectiveness, soundness, integrity or robustness. Consequently, any and all activities related to the acquisition, trading or use of VCs (particularly DCVCs) are performed at the end-user\u2019s sole and independent risk and have no recourse to the Bank.\u2019\n\nIn 2015 Central Bank of Kenya(CBK) with regard to the legal status of virtual currencies, issued a public notice cautioning the public that \u201cBitcoin and similar products are not legal tender nor are they regulated in Kenya. The public should therefore desist from transacting in Bitcoin and similar products\u201d. On 18 December, 2015 the CBK again issued Banking Circular No 14 of 2015, which cautioned, \u2018all financial institutions against dealing in virtual currencies or transacting with entities that are engaged in virtual currencies. Financial institutions are expressly advised not to open accounts for any person dealing in virtual currencies such as Bitcoin. Failure to comply with this directive would lead to appropriate remedial action from the Central Bank\u2019.\n\nJust like South Africa, Kenya also has no specific legal framework tailored specially for its Fintech sector. One therefore sees the fintech sphere being regulated by a variety of statutes and rules governing various financial products, services and market participants, as well as other provisions of more general application.\n\nThe lack of specifically tailored regulations to govern the fintech sector, seen in Kenya and South AFrica, leaves regulators at each point, responding to issues that arise individually. This leaves a gap for potential conflicts in regulating fintech, and reveals a situation where the regulatory environment would keep lagging behind technology.\n\nThe ban by the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) negatively impacted thousands of Nigerians who have lately been drawn by technology to investing in foreign securities. Untoward hardship to fintech platforms such as Bamboo, Trove, and Risevest who work with local and foreign brokerage firms in allowing Nigerians to invest and trade in stocks listed on the Nigerian and foreign stock exchanges.\n\nLogistics policies in Nigeria\n\nThe Lagos State Government on 27 January 2020 enforced a regulatory ban which restricted the operation of commercial bikes and tricycles on major roads within the state, stating that \u201cafter consultations with stakeholders, the State Security Council, in compliance with the extant Transport Sector Reform Law 2018, has decided to commence enforcement of the law which bans the operation of Okada and Keke in six Local Government Areas and nine Local Council Development Areas (LCDAs)\u201d. This ban forced unplanned pivots and total shutdowns of services for hitherto thriving local organisations like Gokada and ORide. The regulatory blizz also extended to the regulation of online ride-hailing companies like Uber and Bolt with the enforcement of the requirement for a service entity regulatory permit provisional application/renewal \u2013 \u20a610 million licence fee for service entities with 1,000 units of e-hailing taxi; \u20a625 million for those with more than 1,000 units of e-hailing taxi; with the provisional license subject to an annual renewal with a renewable fee of \u20a65 million for every 1000 and \u20a610 million for every 1001 and above unit of e-hailing taxi. It also mandated that 10% of every transaction by the passenger to the ride-hailing operators must be paid to the state government. At the national level the new guideline for the regulation of logistics and courier companies which increased the license fees for logistics companies and courier services was also approved on July 23, 2020. The amount mandated as licensing and renewal fees is shocking, as it creates an impediment for most players in the sector, who are mostly struggling MSMEs without the economic wherewithal to afford the fees.\n\nAn immediate implication of the ban of commercial bikes and tricycles was the drastic unemployment it resulted in across a broad base of lagos. Unemployment directly correlates to an upsurge in crimes and insecurity.\n\nData and Infrastructure in South Africa and Kenya\n\nThe draft National Policy on Data and Cloud which is generally aimed at \u201cexploiting opportunities presented by the digital economy, through the development of policy frameworks that harness the economic and social potential of data and cloud computing\u201d was recently released (April 1 2021) .\n\nThe Draft Data Protection (General) Regulations 2021 of Kenya also introduces data localisation, while among other provisions, requiring countries or territories to which personal data is transferred, to have ratified the African Union Convention on CyberSecurity and Personal Data Protection. This provision apart from restricting the free flow of data needed for a digital economy to thrive, includes a requirement for ratification of a convention which Kenya itself is yet to ratify.\n\nAlthough the goal of the policies might be applauded, their restriction on cross-border transfer of data through local storage and processing of data is capable of affecting productivity and innovation, and ousting the countries\u2019 startups.\n\nDigital Tax policies in South Africa, Nigeria, Uganda and Kenya\n\nSouth Africa was the first, in 2014, to tax digital services by imposing a 14% value added tax (VAT) on digital imports. Several African countries have since followed its steps.\n\nThe Nigerian Finance Act for instance imposes 5% VAT on online transactions.\n\nIn Uganda 74% of businesses reported a reduction in earnings following the imposition of digital tax \u2013 excise duty on over-the-top services over the internet \u2013 in the country. This same proposal for digital tax was only shut down by the Benin Government after a peaceful protest was staged by its people.\n\nIn 2013, the National Treasury of Kenya introduced a 10% excise duty on money transfer services.\n\nGovernments rightly claim taxing digital services helps to raise revenue for ailing economies \u2013 totally plausible IF funds raised were channeled into providing infrastructure and enabling more innovation. This has not been the case however \u2013 digital tax policies and laws have mainly been used to restrict digital activity of citizens, infringing on their digital rights.\n\nSo why should YOU care, I hear you ask? This long story, we know all about it \u2013 it\u2019s not stopping bread from getting to my table.\n\nQuestion is: is it not?\n\nFrom an increased cost in basic services you have come to take for granted \u2013 from hailing a bike by app, phone call or on the side of the road to the inability to afford to continue to feed your family with premium turkey or listen to your favourite artiste due to new Copyright rules that don\u2019t support Fair Use principles.\n\nWhy? Because hey you can no longer ride uber at an affordable rate (Hi, Hackney permit), through to it getting harder to shop for that item from Senegal since the taxes on it are higher (that\u2019s if the customs barriers are surmounted by AfCFTA) and it becoming significantly harder (if at all possible) for you to get timely help by raising a social media cry for help.\n\nSo you see, it matters. It touches you. Not just the \u2018big businesses\u2019 or the start ups \u2013 You. As Nigerians like to say, \u201c\u2026 o di kwa serious?!\u201c\n\nOver the next few \u2018musings\u2019 I will ponder on what we should be prioritising and why. If the data allows and my brain strings the words I will project on the impact \u2013 possibly speak to the future.\n\nTill next time \u2013 keep musing \ud83d\ude09\n\nShare this article\n\nThe Cabal | Author @techcabal",

          "text": "Nigerian fintech startup, Kuda Bank, has raised $55 million in a Series B round at a valuation of $500 million. This comes after a recent Series A of $25 million announced by the company just a little over four months ago.\n\nThe latest round was co-led by existing investors Target Global and Valar Ventures, the firm co-founded and backed by PayPal co-founder, Peter Thiel. SBI Investment and other previous angels also participated.\n\nKuda plans to use the funds to build on its new services for Nigeria as well as prepare for a continental expansion. According to Co-founder and CEO Babs Ogundeyi, Kuda aims to build a new take on banking services for \u201cevery African on the planet.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing a lot of resource deployment in our operational entity, in Nigeria. But now we are doubling down on expansion and the idea is to build a strong team for the expansion plans for Kuda,\u201d Ogundeyi told TechCrunch, without disclosing which countries Kuda is eyeing.\n\n\u201cFor Babs and Musty, it was always about building a pan-African bank, not just a Nigerian leader,\u201d said Ricardo Sch\u00e4fer, the partner at Target Global. \u201cThe prospect of banking over 1 billion people from day one really stood out for me at the beginning.\u201d\n\nOgundeyi co-founded Kuda with the now CTO, Musty Mustapha, in the second half of 2019. The startup launched in Nigeria as a no-fees, digital-only bank with $1.6 million pre-seed funding. It has since witnessed significant growth.\n\nAs of November 2020, Kuda had 300,000 customers and was processing an average of $500 million worth of transactions per month.\n\nBy March this year, Kuda\u2019s registered users had more than doubled to 650,000, after the startup processed $2.2 billion a month earlier. Presently, Kuda has 1.4 million people in its user base.\n\nBeyond just basic financial services, Kuda now offers credit to its users by way of an overdraft allowance, which the company pre-qualifies the most active users for.\n\nIn the second quarter of the year, Kuda disbursed $20 million worth of credit to over 200,000 qualified users, with a 30-day repayment period.\n\nAccording to Ogundeyi, Kuda has seen \u201cminimal\u201d default because of its approach. \u201cWe use all the data we have for a customer and allocate the overdraft proportion based on the customer\u2019s activities, aiming for it not to be a burden to repay,\u201d he said.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\n\u201cKuda is our first investment in Africa and our initial confidence in the team has been upheld by its rapid growth in the past four months,\u201d said Andrew McCormack, a general partner at Valar Ventures.\n\n\u201cWith a youthful population eager to adopt digital financial services in the region, we believe that Kuda\u2019s transformative effect on banking will scale across Africa and we\u2019re proud to continue supporting them.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Per The Guardian, the platform\u2019s Business Development Consultant, Sameer Yeshwanth, said the social media platform would be the first to do so.\n\n\u201cWe are going to register with the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC); Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC), and comply with all relevant local content laws of the country through the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA).\u201d\n\nWhat does this mean? A formal registration by Koo means it\u2019ll pay taxes. Recently, the Federal Government of Nigeria announced plans to tax profits made by tech firms \u2014 Google, Twitter, and Facebook \u2014 not based in the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKoo\u2019s announcement is coming after a ban on Twitter was announced on Friday, June 4, 2021.\n\nInterestingly, the Nigerian government created an account on Koo two weeks after the Twitter ban.\n\nAnother interesting fact: According to Republic TV, the Koo app was created at the AatmaNirbhar App Innovation Challenge \u2014 an event hosted by the Indian government.\n\nLike Nigeria, India has had a falling out with Twitter. What do you think this means?\n\n$10,000 per month for YouTube creators\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: The Verge\n\nWhat\u2019s going on? YouTube wants to start paying YouTube Shorts creators $10,000 monthly.\n\nWhat\u2019s YouTube Shorts? YouTube Shorts, is in simple terms, TikTok on YouTube. It\u2019s a feature that allows you to scroll through short videos. It was launched in the US in March as TikTok\u2019s competition.\n\nSo you earn $10k monthly for being a creator? Not so fast. According to The Verge, monthly payments will be made, but this is not guaranteed. YouTube has terms and conditions for eligible creators.\n\nTerms and conditions? Yes, your videos need a certain number of views. Although YouTube was not specific, it said the amount of the views required to be eligibl will be based on how much people use the feature.\n\nBased on viewership, creators can earn between $100 and $10,000. The videos also need to be original, meaning you cannot make a video on TikTok and post it on YouTube.\n\nThis is part of YouTube\u2019s $100 million Shorts fund that will be paid to creators throughout next year. However, the video streaming platform will start the first round of payments this month.\n\nSign me up! Sadly, the payout is only available in ten countries for now. Per Variety, the countries include the US, UK, Nigeria, South Africa, and Japan.\n\nShort-form videos: YouTube isn\u2019t the only platform with short-form videos. Since TikTok started it in 2017, Instagram rivalled it with Reels and Snapchat with Spotlight.\n\nWhat does this mean? We might see some cross-carpeting. Would TikTok creators turn to YouTube to get a piece of the $100 million?\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading/watching\n\nWhat If You Could Do It All Over? Read\n\nWhy Apple Employees Are Quitting.

          "text": "This article is part of Techpoint Africa\u2019s The Experts series, a bi-weekly where tech career specialists take us on their journey from newbie to expert, and how they became successful in the industry. to get email updates.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow much does it cost to educate a girl child? This is one of the questions that come to mind when trying to make sense of why there are more out-of-school girls than there are in school globally.\n\nConfirmed in findings by the United Nations, it is prominent in sub-Saharan Africa, where many people expect girl children to sacrifice their education to get married early.\n\nWith such expectations, girls are almost always deprived of opportunities for higher education, much less a career. However, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) says the situation is getting better, although the pace is slow.\n\nBut for a father willing to go against the norm in the 1990s, Nigerian-founded Patricia Technologies would not have the amazing brand manager it currently has.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the three years and six months since Rachael Akalia joined Patricia Technologies, she has taken on seven roles at the company, something she considers challenging but worth it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve come to a point where I\u2019ve realised what I love, that I want to grow where I\u2019m at. I\u2019m someone that always wants to fix a problem and being a brand manager helps me do that. But I don\u2019t fix the problem when it\u2019s a problem, I prevent it from becoming a problem. It\u2019s more of being proactive,\u201d Rachael revealed during a recent conversation at Patricia Technologies\u2019 HQ in Lekki, Lagos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRachael Akalia\n\nLiving across the river, aiming for the skies\n\nOne of nine children from Anambra State, Nigeria, Rachael spent her primary and secondary school years in Ikom, Cross River State with her mom and late dad. Before heading for the university, she spent her post-secondary school years with her older brother in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria.\n\nBut, she almost missed out on a tertiary education.\n\nBeing the eighth child at a time when younger siblings were not permitted to be ahead of their older ones in school \u2014 and in some cases, marriage \u2014 Rachael had to wait two years before going to the university. And it didn\u2019t come easy.\n\n\u201cIn 2011, I told them, \u2018just register me for the exam, I promise, I won\u2019t pass it.\u2019 But I knew I was tricking them because there was no way I would not pass it. While I was home, I was studying and solving JAMB past questions. I also did a six-month training in basic computer knowledge and got a certificate.\u201d\n\nShe faced another hurdle when she got admitted to study economics at the Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, and her older sister, who took the same exams, didn\u2019t. The family decided that Rachael would go to school five months after school resumed.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t slow her down; she caught up on five months of work. Such was her resolve that she set a first-class honours target for herself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll the while, she had a nudge.\n\n\u201cI had this quote, \u2018Aim for the moon, and if you miss it, you land among the stars.\u2019 So, in my head, if I missed First Class, I\u2019d get a Second Class Upper. But I wasn\u2019t going home with anything less than that because I needed to show them that the investment was worth it.\u201d\n\nSeizing opportunities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRachael knew that an education would open doors for her. And it did.\n\nThe entrepreneur in her was awakened when she took on the responsibility for some of her financial needs during her four years at the university.\n\n\u201cFor other dues, apart from my school fees which my brother took up, I taught tutorial classes. In my department, they knew me as the \u2018Summary girl.\u2019 I would summarise big textbooks into five pages without missing out on any important details. This was all thanks to my English teacher in secondary school whose summary and comprehension lessons came in handy.\u201d\n\nWith time, she became the go-to person for detailed study and exam prep materials. Rachael, who says her handwriting is hard to miss, kept this up for a long time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t her only shot at entrepreneurship.\n\nDuring her mandatory National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) year at a secondary school in Enugu State, where she taught accounting, commerce, and economics, she sold pastries and organised classes for the students. Realising that most students didn\u2019t understand why they were in school, she says she focused on making an impact, not on money.\n\n\u201cThey had this mentality that they didn\u2019t need to study. They were actually forced to go to school. The boys wanted to farm, and the girls wanted to get married. But I had to tell them that inasmuch as you want to do all those things, it is really important to get vital knowledge first. I encouraged them with my story, and it was a reorientation for them.\u201d\n\nSimilar stories of motivation do not always achieve desired results, but her efforts were not futile. The school recorded its first year of excellent West African Examination Council (WAEC) results in the subjects she taught, ending five years of abysmal results. This remains one of the high points of her life.\n\nMoving up at Patricia Technologies\n\nAfter her NYSC, Rachael got an unsatisfactory sales and marketing job in Port Harcourt. In her quest for a new challenge, she moved to Lagos after being invited for an interview following numerous applications.\n\n\u201cI was writing nothing less than 25 applications daily. I was following job sites, and whether I was qualified or not, I applied immediately I got a job notification. And I did this on my phone because I didn\u2019t have a laptop.\u201d\n\nWith seven interview invites in her inbox, she made her way to Lagos. She got three offers, the first of which she took. Rachael eventually discovered that the marketing job came with a lot of pressure and unrealistic targets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, she had turned down an offer from Patricia Technologies in February 2018 because the startup was only a few months old, and she didn\u2019t understand its operations.\n\nJust when she decided to begin her search for a new job, Patricia reached out, asking why she turned down the offer. Hiding her excitement after a contract review, she accepted a role in the operations team and resumed on February 5, 2018.\n\n\u201cI knew that I would be excellent wherever I worked, but the only factor that might hold me back was a lack of experience. I just wanted to get experience. So, I was willing to take any role to start, figure out what I wanted to do, and start getting skills in that area. I believed that I would figure out a career path to follow within one year.\u201d\n\nAfter a few months in the operations team, she moved to the gifts department. That was where CEO, Hanu Fejiro Agbodje, discovered she had skills in complaint resolution, customer handling, and digital marketing. She was better suited for relationship-based tasks with such a skillset, so Agbodje asked her to become the startup\u2019s customer service representative and social media manager.\n\nShortly after, the media department was created to handle graphics designing, content creation, and digital marketing. And after 11 months at the startup, Rachael became the head of the media team, but she knew there were more responsibilities ahead; Agbodje thought so too.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this thing my boss does at the beginning of the year; he weighs people\u2019s strengths and puts them in positions where they can magnify these strengths and better work on their skills. He said, \u2018Rachael, I have watched you for a while, and I think you have great customer service skills. I want to start a proper customer service team, which you will head.\u2019\u201d\n\nLeading a team of ten was a new challenge that came with greater responsibility which prompted her to take customer service courses on Udemy. She also read widely and followed successful companies. And this is her modus operandi for every new role she finds herself occupying.\n\nBy June 2019, the growth of the Patricia team necessitated the expansion of the customer service team to 35 people. Rachael promptly stepped into the role of supervisor, and a professional customer service lead came in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring a reshuffle in January 2020, Rachael chose to be on the marketing team.\n\nFor Rachael, a recurrent theme with these changes in roles was how well they aligned with her life goals and how she often leaves a role more knowledgeable than she came in. But the management saw beyond that.\n\n\u201cI had a conversation with Chika, the Chief People Officer, about why I was moved to the marketing team. She said I was a growth facilitator and that I build whatever team I\u2019m in. And they needed to build the marketing team.\u201d\n\nRachael had a month to put creatives in the startup together under a team in preparation for a head of marketing who would soon come in. As a marketing executive, she worked directly with Ogunwede Rotimi, who she reveals also played an integral role in her growth.\n\nThis path led her to become the brand manager in June 2020.\n\n\u201cAnd this was more challenging because I have to embody the brand. I have to know what is good for the brand whenever I speak for the brand. I have to be the brand and make decisions that will affect the brand. So, I can\u2019t falter.\u201d\n\nRachael acknowledges how important bringing in experienced hires is in a business, and holding her current role for over a year, she has exceeded her growth expectations. She attributes this to being in an environment that facilitates growth.\n\nLife hacks and aspirations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRachael believes building habits takes consistency, and she constantly makes an effort to replace unhealthy habits with good ones. One way she does this is by setting alarms due to the management and organisational skills she picked up at a young age.\n\n\u201cI get to remind myself to do things. I have a reminder that tells me to sleep, drink water, call my friends, see a movie, call my mom, pay my tithe, take a stroll, and every other thing.\u201d\n\nA typical workday sees her responding to internal and external emails, setting up tasks to achieve weekly goals, liaising with other team leads to carry out their tasks, and having meetings. Essentially, she works with every team in the company depending on the startup\u2019s needs per time.\n\nOutside work, Rachael likes reading \u2014 or doing anything that increases her knowledge \u2014 travelling, eating, and writing.\n\nWhile she continues to embody the Patricia brand, Rachael ultimately plans to go back to school, something she has put on hold for a few years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom interpersonal communication to business transactions, technology is fast changing the conventional way of doing most things. And Africa has not been left out in the wave of groundbreaking innovations.\n\nMany young Africans are joining in the development of novel tech infrastructure and building products that cut across various fields.\n\nNonetheless, Africa\u2019s young population \u2014 aged 15 to 24 \u2014 make up more than 200 million of her over 1 billion populace. These youth account for a large chunk of the unemployed. Interestingly, of the 20 countries with the youngest population in the world, 19 are African.\n\nCombine this with the continent\u2019s worryingly low number of upskilled developers and a limited tech talent pool, and you have a situation that can hinder Africa\u2019s technological advancement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDissatisfied with this situation, Dauda Barry, a London-based Senegalese serial entrepreneur, was propelled to start Alida School in March 2021, an online coding school for Africans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlida School\u2019s Co-founder and CEO, Dauda Barry\n\nAfter getting a degree in computer science from the Queen Mary University of London, he founded Adama Robotics in 2016, an AI company that builds and sells educational robotic kits.\n\n\u201cBuilding up Adama Robotics, being part of the startup ecosystem in London, I began hearing about Lambda School. I liked the model; the fact that it shifts the risk from the students to the organisation. Then I thought, \u2018why not build a Lambda for Africa?\u2019\n\nFor context, Lambda is a US-based online coding school that offers a six-month training course with tuition deducted as a certain percentage from students\u2019 income when they land their first jobs.\n\nReports reveal that 60% of Africa\u2019s unemployed population are youth, a statistic that Mthuli Ncube, former Chief Economist at the African Development Bank (AfDB), describes as \u201c\u2026unacceptable for a continent with such an impressive pool of youth, talent and creativity.\u201d\n\nAnd Barry shares this view.\n\n\u201cYou know, we have the young, the growing, and the innovative in the continent; mobile Internet penetration is rising, while its cost is falling a bit. There are many tech startups in Africa, yet we produce fewer computer scientists and developers than the rest of the world. So I thought, \u2018how can we bridge this gap?\u2019\u201d\n\nA Statista report states that as of 2019, only 7.7% of households in Africa were estimated to have a computer at home. As Barry thought about building a Lambda for Africa, he wondered how students in the African market would access stable Internet and computers for classes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis question was answered when he paid a visit to Senegal in February 2021.\n\n\u201cI was in Dakar, and I noticed my cousin who was running a degree in computer science taking most of his classes remotely. Then later, he took me to the community centre, where they had computers and Internet for people to use. Then I thought, \u2018Oh! A Lambda School for Africa can work in Senegal.'\u201d\n\nRealising the feasibility, Barry began building Alida School upon his return to London in March 2021.\n\nThe initial plan was to teach young Senegalese how to code. However, upon announcing application openings for the first cohort on Twitter, things took a surprising turn.\n\n\u201cWe started to receive applications from Kenya, Nigeria, and Guinea Bissau. In fact, our current students in this first cohort are mainly from Kenya and Nigeria.\u201d\n\nSo, the focus moved from Senegal to the rest of Africa.\n\nAnd by \u2018we\u2019, he\u2019s referring to himself and his co-founder. While searching for good tutors, he met his co-founder, George Chinedu Ikwegbu, a computer engineering graduate of Michael Okpara University, Umudike, Abia State, Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorge Chinedu Ikwegbu\n\n\u201cThere I was on Twitter, reading through and learning from insightful threads as usual, when Dauda sent me a DM, introducing me to his plans for Alida School and asking if it was something I\u2019d like to join,\u201d Ikwegbu recounts.\n\nIkwegbu, who has a flair for teaching, didn\u2019t hesitate to jump on the offer.\n\n\u201cI have always loved teaching, and so I told him yes. We then talked about my proficiency in programming languages. After a series of tests and virtual coffee conversations, I became a partner and coding tutor at Alida School.\u201d\n\nA sustainable model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, Alida School is cohort-based, with each cohort running for 12 weeks. Alida School provides schooling in mainly front-end web development, Git, and Vue.js, and the first cohort is currently eleven weeks into the programme. Classes are held virtually, from 7-9 p.m. on weekdays.\n\nBefore students are enrolled, they are interviewed. Barry believes this helps to filter out those who might not be committed to the course.\n\n\u201cOnline course completion is at 52-53% rate in the world today, and so George and I monitor the attendance and check for accountability tightly. During the interview, we make it clear that attendance is at least 90%,\u201d Barry says.\n\nTuition is paid via a hybrid model. Students make a part payment upfront, and then the rest is paid using an income share agreement (ISA) when they land their first jobs.\n\n\u201cSome of the students prefer paying the tuition upfront because to them, it helps with consistency. Knowing that they have paid for the classes, they can\u2019t afford to miss any,\u201d Barry adds.\n\nThe hybrid payment model is similar to that of Decagon Institute, a Lagos-based coding school that offers a six-month training for software engineers, using upfront payment or the ISA method.\n\nWhile the current fee of $180 is seemingly steep, Barry says it was reached after a lot of deliberation.\n\n\u201cCompared to our competitors in the West, who charge as much as $9,000, ours is somewhat fair. I\u2019m a big advocate of a business being sustainable. Initially, we wanted to charge higher, but we went and asked for feedback from Senegalese people, based on their monthly and average salaries, and $180 was the highest we could go.\u201d\n\nFor the time being, Alida School\u2019s primary means of revenue is from its paying customers, and Barry discloses that there are plans to apply for funding.\n\n\u201cEventually, we\u2019ll apply for funding, but for now, we\u2019re dependent on tuition. We\u2019re still a small team, and I think small teams are good. We\u2019ll be faster, and with time, extend our runway.\u201d\n\nChallenges so far\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIkwegbu says that a major challenge so far has been poor Internet connectivity.\n\n\u201cSometimes, I\u2019m taking a class, and suddenly the network cuts and students can\u2019t follow any more until after a while. This greatly affects us,\u201d he says.\n\nCommenting on the issue, Barry reveals that plans are underway for the school to partner with telcos and get subsidised data bundles for students.\n\n\u201cWe have maybe 60 to 70% of good Internet. So far, I\u2019ll rate it 8 or 9 out of 10, which actually is not great, but it could be worse. Hopefully, things improve with time. The plan is to partner with telcos to get a stable source of data for our students at subsidised rates.\u201d\n\nAlso, Barry shares that the startup has challenges with payments and transactions made to countries outside Africa. There are usually many glitches when students are trying to pay their fees.\n\n\u201cAs much as a lot of fintechs in Africa are really putting in the work, there\u2019s still a lot that can be done with getting funds across to bank accounts outside the continent.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhat does the future hold for Alida School?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShort term plans include adding more courses to the school\u2019s curriculum and expansion into more African countries.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re currently recruiting tutors for back-end so that we can raise more full-stack developers. For the next cohort, new courses will be integrated into the platform like back-end, app development (iOS and Android) and Data Science,\u201d says Barry\n\nAlso adding that the big picture is to reduce the unemployment and poverty gap while raising the next generation of tech talent in Africa, Barry says, \u201cThere is a big need to raise local talents in Africa. A lot of companies are outsourcing their talent needs to European developers to carry out projects.\u201d\n\nAnother goal for the second cohort is a remote and physical expansion to cities in other African countries.\n\n\u201cOur long term plans include foraying into major tech growing cities in Ghana, South Africa, and Rwanda, and also establishing a physical school in Africa, where we can teach people in person,\u201d Barry reveals.\n\nAnd because the school currently runs an English speaking teaching method, most Senegalese students usually do not want to enrol.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re worried that they won\u2019t be able to follow through because of their English, so we\u2019re looking to employ someone who can teach coding in French, so we can get more applications from Francophone African countries,\u201d Barry shares.\n\nWith the various challenges that Africa\u2019s burgeoning tech scene faces, startups like Alida School will go a long way in creating and refining talents to bolster the growth of technological innovations on the continent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoy Matthew Website Out here, trying so hard to maintain my faculty of wonder in a fast-changing world.

          "text": "Controversy over whether or the National Chairman of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), Prince Uche Secondus, should continue in office, has torn the party apart ahead of the 2023 election.\n\nThis even as four members of the National Working Committee, NWC, were said to be contemplating resignation, yesterday like seven deputy national officers, who resigned on Tuesday over Secondus\u2019 alleged poor leadership.\n\nThose said to be considering quitting their positions include Senator Ibrahim Tsauri, National Secretary; Senator Sulaiman Nazif, Deputy National Chairman (North); Sunday Ude-Okoye, National Youth leader, and Adamu Mustapha, national auditor of the PDP.\n\nOne of the national officers who tendered his resignation earlier in the week told Vanguard that having exhausted their patience, \u201cthe secretary, youth leader, auditor and deputy national chairman will walk away from their positions because they have come to realise that indeed, the national chairman has nothing to offer the party going forward.\u201d\n\nWhile noting that the embattled chairman is \u201cliving in delusion because of the support of a handful of governors,\u201d he called on the state chief executives to keep personal relationship aside and save the party from further implosion, Vanguard reported.\n\nAccording to him, PDP governors are split over Secondus\u2019 fate.\n\n\u201cGovernors Nyesom Wike (Rivers), Seyi Makinde (Oyo) and Ahmadu Fintiri (Adamawa) are really convinced that the PDP would struggle to record electoral success in 2023 if Secondus is allowed to stay in charge of the affairs of the PDP,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI can tell you today that they will be happy to see the chairman take the honourable step of resigning to enable the party prepare for the next election cycle on a clean slate.\u201d\n\nAlthough, some governors elected on the party\u2019s platform have taken the boldness to pitch their tent where they think the interest of the party will be well protected; same cannot be said of Governors Aminu Tambuwal, Udom Emmanuel and Samuel Ortom of Sokoto, Akwa Ibom and Benue states respectively, who are gathered to be sitting on the fence.\n\nThey are yet to decide whether to jump out of the Secondus\u2019 ship or stay put, hoping that things will turn around.Although, these are testy times for Secondus, a good number of governors still believe in his leadership of the party.\n\nOkezie Ikpeazu (Abia), Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi (Enugu), Ifeanyi Okowa (Delta) Douye Diri (Bayelsa), Godwin Obaseki (Edo), Darius Ishaku (Taraba) and Bala Mohammed of Bauchi states remain pro-Secondus even as those desirous of seeing him quit are determined to go about their mission nonetheless.\n\nThe pro-Secondus group also got a strong pillar of support yesterday in Senator Seriake Dickson (PDP, Bayelsa West), who apart from kicking against the plot to have a national caretaker committee in place, paid the chairman a solidarity visit at the Wadata Plaza, national secretariat of the PDP.\n\nMeanwhile, Secondus, yesterday, accused an unnamed PDP chieftain of moves to dent his image so as to pave way for him to hijack the structures of the party.\n\nThe PDP boss, speaking through his Media Adviser, Ike Abonyi asked: \u201cWhy the recent disquiet in the PDP a few months to the national convention and why is somebody rooting for a caretaker committee to run the affairs of the party?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe media office of the national chairman is privy to an intelligence that the strong party chieftain bent on hijacking the party structure for destruction is still on the loose with the main agenda of denting the image of Prince Uche Secondus.\n\n\u201cReports reaching this office show clearly that this character is deploying all devious means to try and diminish the person and character of the national chairman with a view to having his way of ultimately hijacking the structure for his disproportionately large ambition.\n\n\u201cWe therefore wish to alert the general public particularly media houses and party stakeholders to look out for strange deployment of luring gifts from this destructive \u2018Father Christmas\u2019 all aimed at having a grip on the soul of our party by having a caretaker commit-tee.\n\n\u201cWhat continues to shock many party observers is the real reason behind the desperation of this man to get at the national chairman and the quantum of public funds being expended to achieve this illicit goal few months to the national convention.\u201d\n\nAttempt to hijack party four months to convention \u2018ll lead to implosion \u2014 Dickson\n\nBacking Secondus to remain in office, Senator Seriake Dickson warned that attempts by some people to hijack the party will lead to implosion, adding that the party cannot afford the grave danger of a caretaker committee.\n\nAccording to Dickson, the PDP should learn from the challenge the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC has found itself with the appointment of a caretaker committee which he said was still unfolding, adding that with only four months to the end of the tenure of Prince Uche Secondus-led National Working Committee, it does not make sense to either push for and force a resignation or call for the appointment of a caretaker committee on a party with officers who have a constitutionally guaranteed tenure.\n\nDickson, who noted that some members of the NWC resigned on Tuesday, said that the PDP should thank them for their services if their throwing in the towel was for good, but if on the contrary it was designed to destroy the party, the act and those behind it should be lampooned in all its ramifications.\n\nHe, however, cautioned the masterminds of the crisis not to leave any opening to the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, to exploit with their control of the resources and machinery of government.\n\nIn a statement yesterday in Abuja, Senator Dickson who was chairman of the PDP Reconciliation Committee from 2013 to 2020 and chairman, PDP Governors\u2019 Forum, however said that if there is any member of the NWC who wants to resign, he or she should consider the overall interest of the party and have a rethink, adding that if such a person insists, the party should, in line with the constitution, make appropriate consultations at the state and zonal levels to replace the NWC member that have resigned.\n\nAccording to him, as part of the way forward, the PDP should as a matter of urgency, convene an emergency National Executive Committee, NEC, meeting that will take appropriate decisions to stabilize the party.\n\nThe statement read in part: \u201cWe have observed for some time the growing tension, recriminations and outright attack on the National Chairman and members of the National Working Committee by some leaders of the party.\n\n\u201cOne has refrained from making statements because we believe that the party has internal mechanisms and levels of leadership that will handle it and I was in fact aware that BOT members, governors and other elders, reconciliation committee, collectively and individually, have been making efforts to resolve some of these disputes and challenges affecting the stability of the party.\n\n\u201cAs we are all aware, some officers of our party, resigned yesterday and we should thank them for their services but if their resignation is aimed at causing crisis in the party then we should all condemn it and those behind it.\n\n\u201cBy the party\u2019s constitution the appropriate authority, the NWC, is empowered to make replacements. I therefore call on the National Chairman and other members of the NWC in accordance with the constitution of the party to immediately make appropriate consultations from the states and zones from which these officers have resigned and forthwith, make those replacements subject to ratification by the NEC.\n\n\u201cAn emergency NEC meeting should be convened which should take appropriate decisions to stabilize the party.\n\nAnd if there is any member of the working committee who wants to resign, such a person should consider the overall interest of the party and have a rethink.\n\nIf however, any NWC members goes ahead to resign, the resignation should be accepted and consultations be made by the Chairman and NWC to fill those positions as temporary vacancies subject to ratification.\u201d\u201cI call on our governors to close ranks and stop the unnecessary battles among themselves, support one another and work with other leaders to strengthen and support the party, rather than weakening it.\n\nI am of the view that governors should be supported in their respective states and the party at the national level should not over- ride their decisions and judgments but to guide and advise when necessary.\u201d\n\nNo hand in Secondus\u2019 ordeal \u2014 Atiku\n\nMeanwhile, former Vice President, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, yesterday dismissed speculations that his recent meeting with Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State in Port Harcourt fuelled calls for the removal of Prince Uche Secondus.\n\nAtiku who stated this through his Media Adviser, Paul Ibe, said he is only interested in peace and stability of the PDP, and not what will endanger the interest of the party.\n\n\u201cIt is a beer parlour talk, it is also mischievous. Why will a former Vice President be behind the plot to sack PDP national chairman, Prince Uche Secondus? What will be his interest?\n\n\u201cThis is someone who has commenced the process of having conversations with stakeholders of the party on reconciliation, a man who has encouraged processes aimed at ensuring peace and stability in the party.\u201cThe trip he made to Port Harcourt came after the one in Delta. And he has more in the offing.\n\nWhy will he promote peace and stability in the party and be behind moves to sack Secondus? It\u2019s ridiculous for anyone to talk about this.\u201cAtiku understands the Constitution of the PDP and what the party says about tenure for party leadership.\n\nSo he cannot be working against something that he understands and promotes.\u201d\n\nSecondus meets aggrieved party officers, sue for peace\n\nMeanwhile, Secondus, yesterday, met with the aggrieved deputy national officers who resigned their positions earlier in the week and appealed for calm.\n\nSeven deputy national officers had on Tuesday resigned their appointments.\n\nThe officers are: Diran Odeyemi, Deputy National Publicity Secretary; Ahmed Bello, Deputy National Legal Adviser; Umoru Hadizat, Deputy National Women Leader; Divine Amina Arong, Deputy National Auditor; Hassan Yakubu, Deputy National Organizing Secretary; and Irona Alphonsus, deputy National Financial Secretary.The officers, who cited \u201cbad treatment\u201d exhibited by the party National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, since the election that brought the current leadership of the party to power in 2017, also alleged that there is a lack of financial transparency in the leadership.\n\nSecondus appealed to the national officers to sheathe their swords, adding that life of the National Working Committee, NWC, led by him will end in the next four months.\n\nA source at the meeting, which was held at the party\u2019s national secretariat, told our correspondent that some of the aggrieved members, promised to continue in office.\n\nAccording to the source, Secondus told the aggrieved national officers that \u201cwe started together and there is the need to end together in peace.\u201d\n\nIn their meeting on Tuesday night, Vanguard gathered that the NWC members, who met with party stakeholders and some Board of Trustees members, resolved to go back to their constituents to find ways of resolving the impasse.\n\nCrisis worsens as Joy Emordi defects to APC\n\nThe crisis in PDP worsened as Senator Joy Emordi, a member of the party\u2019s Board of Trustees, BOT dumped the party for the ruling APC, barely 24 hours after seven members of the NWC resigned their positions.\n\nEmordi represented Anambra North when she was in the Senate.\n\nMamman Mohammed, spokesperson of the APC caretaker committee chairman, and governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni , in a statement, confirmed the exit of Emordi from the PDP to the ruling party, yesterday.\n\nMs Emordi reportedly said she left the PDP because she is convinced that the \u201cfuture of a prosperous and united Nigeria lies in the APC\u201d, whose leadership she described as sincere and genuine in its commitment to a united Nigeria.\n\nBuni said he was delighted about the decision of Ms Emordi and other politicians from the South East to join the ruling party.\n\nHe acknowledged the defection as a strong move to have to national cohesion.\n\n\u201cThere is a need for us to join hands for the political stability and national unity of our dear country.\n\n\u201cThe South-East is a strong political block and very crucial to the unity of the country.\n\nThis will, no doubt, add to national cohesion,\u201d the APC interim chairman said.\n\nReport credit to Vanguard",

Wike and others, who are opposed to Secondus strongly believe that if he is allowed to convene and preside over the NEC meeting, where the national convention/election committee members will be chosen, he will ensure that his supporters are members, thus his re-emergence as the national chairman will be easy.

I so hold,\u201d Justice Soladoye said.\n\nNAN reported that on May 15, 2019, the 24-year-old complainant had testified that she had gone with the defendants to Kabaal nightclub located in Ikoyi, Lagos to celebrate the birthday of George who was her friend.\n\nWhile at a nightclub, the defendants allegedly mixed the her drink with a substance which after some moments, rendered her unconscious.\n\nShe alleged that she was taken to a room at George\u2019s father\u2019s hotel where the defendants took turns to rape her and record their actions on a mobile phone.\n\nThe complainant has so far been the sole witness presented by the prosecution in the case.\n\nThe offence, the prosecution said, contravened the provisions of sections 258 and 409 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015.",

          "text": "Precious Chikwendu, a former beauty queen and estranged wife of Femi Fani-Kayode, the former Minister of Aviation, has been arrested and held by police in the Federal Capital Territory, according to reports.\n\nPrecious was detained after accepting an invitation from the Force CID, Area 10 in Abuja, according to a human rights activist, Harrison Gwamnishu, in a Facebook post on Wednesday nights.\n\nAccording to the police invitation letter seen by NEWS DIRECT, Fani-Kayode was accused of criminal intimidation, extortion, deflation of character, and malicious publishing against his ex-wife.\n\nGwamnishu wrote, \u201cI spoke to Precious Chikwendu this morning and she told me she\u2019s going to honor Police invitation. I immediately reached out to Tracy Mcwary to follow up and ensure she get (sic) all necessary support.\n\n\u201cShe has been detained by police, courtesy Femi Fani-Kayode who has continued to deny her access to her kids. For those of you saying back off, Precious is my friend and there is no way Harrison will back off.\n\n\u201cA mother needs her children and that\u2019s all seek #FreePrecious.\u201d\n\nPrecious on Wednesday in an Instagram post accused Fani-Kayode and a close friend of his, Senator Grace Bent, of using the police to intimidate her.\n\nThe former beauty queen also shared a photo of a letter from the police inviting her for questioning at the Force Criminal Investigation Department Abuja.\n\n\u201cSo these two, think they would use the police that is meant for all of us to intimidate me? Jokers. Mr Fani-Kayode and Grace Bent, you would tell me what this show of power is all about if not for my kids. If you had any shame, you would sit with my lawyers and straighten issues. It\u2019s a shame we got to this bridge,\u201d she said.\n\nPrecious and the former Minister have been locked in a child-custody battle following their break-up in August 2020.\n\nFani-Kayode, who had had a hat-trick of marriages before meeting Precious with whom he has four sons, including a set of two-year-old triplets, accused her of infidelity.\n\nSources told report that the former Minister started physically abusing Precious from the first year of their marriage \u2014 the same fate that befell her three predecessors.\n\nThe violence, it was gathered, increased as the years went by.\n\nFFK as the ex-minister is often referred to, was said to have ordered Precious to abort her last pregnancy, claiming it did not belong to him.\n\nThe sources said Precious ignored him but got savage beating, including on her belly for the recalcitrance.\n\nA source said Fani-Kayode always hit the woman violently in presence of their homehelps and sometimes threatened her with a gun by sticking the weapon in her mouth to warn her against squealing.\n\nHe sometimes instructed his bodyguard to hit the ex-beauty queen.\n\nFani-Kayode\u2019s first wife, Saratu Attah, whom he married when he was 22, was also regularly pummeled by him.\n\nSources said the woman, daughter of the late Adamu Attah, was viciously beaten for requesting a swimming pool in their home on Marine Road in Apapa, Lagos. FFK\u2019s next marriage was to Yemisi Odesanya, daughter of a judge. She is now known as Yemisi Wada after remarrying.\n\nIn newspaper interviews, the woman told stories of Fani-Kayode\u2019s viciousness and lack of care for their daughters, the reason for which he was excluded from the marriage of one of them, Temitope, in 2014.\n\nDespite the disconnect between him and the children, FFK never fails to advertise his \u201clove\u201d for them on Facebook on their birthdays.\n\nPrecious recently told the Court of Appeal in Abuja that her former husband lacks the capacity to cater for their four children.\n\nPrecious alleged the oldest among their children had stopped school, and that their young triplets had yet to start schooling.\n\nThe plaintiff, who demands a monthly payment of N3.5 million for the upkeep of their four sons, had alleged in her suit before an Abuja High Court that Fani-Kayode, \u201cbeat her up on several occasions even while she was pregnant.\u201d",

          "text": "The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate in 2019 general elections and former Vice President Atiku Abubakar has explained his recent meeting with Rivers state Governor Nyesom Wike in Port Harcourt.\n\nSpecifically, he said it was not targeted at removing the Prince Uche Secondus-led National Working Committee (NWC) but a move to mend fences within the party.\n\nAtiku spoke against the backdrop of speculations that Wike and himself met in Port Harcourt on strategies to get the NWC members sacked.\n\nThe position followed the rumbling within the major opposition party, culminating in the resignation of its national officers Tuesday.\n\nPrior to that time, three governors namely Dave Umahi of Ebonyi, Ben Ayade of Cross River and Mohammad Bello Matawalle of Zamfara, had dumped the PDP for the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nAtiku denies rumour\n\nBut speaking to journalists in a telephone interview, Atiku described the insinuation as \u201cbeer parlour talk.\u201d\n\nSpeaking Wednesday through his media adviser, Paul Ibe, the former vice president said: \u201cIt is a beer parlour talk, it is also mischief. Why will a former vice president be behind the plot to sack PDP National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus? What will be his interest? Someone who has commenced the process of having conversations with stakeholders of the party on reconciliation, a man who has encouraged processes aimed at ensuring peace and stability in the party.\u201d\n\nHe explained that \u201cthe trip he made to Port Harcourt, he made a similar one to Delta. And he has more in the offing. Why will he promote peace and stability in the party and be behind moves to sack Secondus? It\u2019s ridiculous for anyone to talk about this.\n\n\u201cAtiku understands the Constitution of the PDP and what the party says about tenure for party leadership. So he cannot be working against something that he understands. That is not how democrats behave, those are anti-democratic behaviour and that is not who he is. Whoever is saying this, should know it is beer parlour talk and unnecessary mischief.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further on his principal\u2019s efforts to resolve the crisis, Ibe said: \u201cThe crisis is related, we cannot isolate one from the other. He recognizes that there are issues, like in every party administration. When you have more than two persons, people will have different positions, so the important thing is how to resolve them. And he has commenced the movement to resolve the issues.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, PDP stakeholders met late Tuesday night and agreed that everyone should go back to their zone to consult on the state of the party.\n\nA reliable source who spoke to Blueprint in confidence said \u201csome National Working Committee (NWC) members, members of the party\u2019s Board of Trustees (BoT) and stakeholders met Tuesday night, at party\u2019s Legacy Office, Maitama in Abuja to discuss the state of the party.\n\n\u201cParty stakeholders that attended the meeting, which lasted till about 3 am of Wednesday, agreed that everyone should go back to their zone and consult other party chieftains on the state of the party.\u201d\n\nSecondus begs\n\nIn a related development, the PDP National Chairman, Prince Secondus met with the seven national officers of the party, who resigned from office, Tuesday, over what they described as poor leadership.\n\nBlueprint correspondent gathered that four representatives of those national officers who resigned met with the embattled national chairman at the party\u2019s national headquarters in Abuja Wednesday.\n\nA top party source who spoke under anonymity revealed that Secondus begged the aggrieved seven to allow all of them finish peacefully and not to rubbish all the successes the team had achieved so far.\n\nThe representatives, Blueprint gathered, told the chairman they would convey his message to the aggrieved national officers and revert to him.\n\nDickson wants emergency NEC\n\nMeanwhile, former Bayelsa state governor and lawmaker representing Bayelsa West senatorial district in the National Assembly, Senator Henry Seriake Dickson urged the NWC to summon an emergency National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting, adding that their powers under the constitution should be utilised to discipline erring members involved in the nefarious plot to destroy the party\n\nIn a statement, Wednesday, Dickson said: \u201cWe have observed for some time the growing tension, recriminations and outright attack on the National Chairman and members of the National Working Committee by some leaders of the party.\n\n\u201cBy the party\u2019s constitution the appropriate authority, the NWC is empowered to make replacements. I, therefore, call on the National Chairman and other members of the NWC in accordance with the constitution of the party to immediately make appropriate consultations from the states and zones from which these officers have resigned and forthwith, make those replacements subject to ratification by the NEC.\n\n\u201cAn emergency NEC meeting should be convened which should take appropriate decisions to stabilise the party. And if there is any member of the working committee who wants to resign, such a person should consider the overall interest of the party and have a rethink. If however, any NWC members goes ahead to resign, the resignation should be accepted and consultations be made by the Chairman and NWC to fill those positions as temporary vacancies subject to ratification.\n\n\u201cThe National Chairman and NWC members should utilise their powers under the constitution to discipline erring members involved in the nefarious plot to destroy the party. PDP is bigger than any individual and should no longer tolerate people with inordinate ambitions to destroy the party which belongs to all Nigerians. People with ambition must know that unless the party is stabilized and strengthened, their ambition will be of no consequence even if they pocket it\u201d.\n\nBut in all of this, Chairman of the PDP Reconciliation and Strategy Committee, Senator Bukola Saraki has maintained silence since the party crisis broke out.\n\nSaraki who was contacted through his Media Adviser, Yusuf Olaniyonu, did not answer his calls nor reply to messages.",

          "text": "Seven years after, a former student, who was part of the over 200 abducted girls from Government Secondary School, Chibok in Borno state, has reportedly surrendered alongside her Boko Haram-ISWAP terrorist husband to Nigerian troops.\n\nAccording to a report by PR Nigeria, an online newspaper with close ties with security agencies, they surrendered and presented themselves to troops at an unknown location, within the Lake Chad region.\n\nOver 200 girls were kidnapped from the secondary school in Chibok in April 14, 2014.\n\nAbout 100 girls are still believed to be with the terror group with most of the others released after negotiation with the government.\n\nAccording to the report, credible intelligence source in Maiduguri revealed that some other Boko Haram-ISWAP insurgents voluntarily reached out to the military, indicating their interests to surrender and lay down their arms.\n\n\u201cThe terrorists\u2019 resolve to surrender may not be unconnected with the destruction of their enclaves and camps by the Nigerian military airstrikes and ground bombardment; and the outbreak of killer diseases together with food scarcity, which have badly hit the terrorists.\n\n\u201cIn fact, there are many ISWAP and Boko Haram members that are willing to surrender as soon as possible but the military and other security services will ensure the needful is done for national security,\u201d the officer said.\n\nArmy spokesperson, Onyema Nwachukwu, was not available for comments as he did not respond to calls and SMS.\n\nThe mass kidnapping of students from their schools is becoming a norm in Nigeria, particularly in the northern part of the country.\n\nThe country has witnessed several cases of kidnapping of pupils and students from their schools since 2014.\n\nTimeline of attack on schools\n\nOver 700 students and pupils were believed to have been kidnapped since December 2020.\n\nRecently gunmen attacked a Baptist Secondary School in Kaduna and abducted dozens of students from their dormitories.\n\nThe armed bandits also stormed a federal college in Kebbi and killed a police officer and kidnapped at least 80 students and five teachers during a separate attack.\n\nThree of the students are dead, according to the BBC Hausa.\n\nSecurity forces continued their search and, by Sunday morning, authorities were still counting the missing.\n\nLess than a quarter of the kidnapped students have since been freed by security operatives in shootouts with the bandits.\n\nThe attack occurred just over three weeks after 169 students were abducted by armed bandits from an Islamic school in Niger State. The abducted pupils are yet to be released at the time of this report.\n\nSome states have shut down schools as a result of the state of kidnappings.\n\nTerrorists, women, children surrender\n\nIn a related development, the Nigerian Army Wednesday said 19 terrorists and their families surrendered to troops of Operation HADIN KAI (OPHK) in Bama, Borno state.\n\nA statement by Army spokesperson Brigadier-General Onyema Nwachukwu, said the terrorists who surrendered comprised 19 male fighters, 19 adult females and 49 children from Njimia village and environs.\n\nHe said several assorted weapons and cash in the sum of fifty five thousand Naira (N55, 000:00) were recovered from the terrorists.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cIn continuation of the ongoing intensive clearance operations across the theatre of Operation HADIN KAI (OPHK), more Boko Haram Terrorists (BHTs) and elements of Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) and their families, who have hitherto hibernated around the fringes of Sambisa forest have yielded to troops\u2019 heavy artillery and air bombardments and surrendered to troops at Forward Operational Base (FOB) Banki Junction/BOCOBS in Bama, Borno state on 2 August, 2021.\n\n\u201cThe terrorists, who also surrendered several assorted weapons and incendiaries, comprised 19 male fighters, 19 adult females and 49 children from Njimia village and environs.\n\n\u201cThe terrorists lamented that the ground and condition in the forest have become untenable, hence their surrendering.\n\n\u201cThe fire arms and incendiaries recovered from the terrorists include, 8 AK 47 rifles, 1General Purpose Machine Gun (GPMG), 2 Fabrique Nationale (FN) Rifles, 1 Dane Gun, 1Makarov Pistol, 89 rounds of 7.62mm (Special) ammunition, 89 rounds of 12.7mm ammunition, 66 rounds of 7.62mm (NATO) ammunition, 5 x 9mm rounds of ammunition, 2 Hand Grenades, 27 AK 47 Rifle magazines and 2 FN Rifle magazines.\n\n\u201cOthers are 1 pistol magazine, 1 x 60mm Mortar Bomb, 10 x14.5mm empty cases, 2 primed suicide vests, 72 trigger switches, 10 primed Improvised Explosive Devices (IED), 5 Electric Detonating Chords, 6 packs of Water Gel Explosives, 6 Mobile Phones, 1 Camel Pack, 1 Camouflage bag, 2 Hard drives, 1 Plier, 2 Unserviceable Hand held Radios, 2 Scissors, and needles, 2 Match boxes and the sum of Fifty Five Thousand Naira (N55,000:00) only.\n\n\u201cThe terrorists and their families are currently undergoing comprehensive security profiling and preliminary investigations, while the children have been administered with oral polio vaccines.\n\n\u201cThe Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Faruk Yahaya has commended the troops for the sustained offensive and clearance operations conducted in the theatre.

We talked about what is happening in our party, what is happening in the nation and just to say to him that all is well,\u201d Sanwo-Olu said.\n\n\u201cYou saw him (Tinubu). Yes, indeed, I am the one you saw in the picture that I took when I visited our leader in London just to dispel all of the rumours that were flying around that he was sick and hospitalised.\n\n\u201cI went to see things for myself.

It is his call. Is he coming here to do Governor\u2019s work? Can\u2019t you see the picture we took together? The picture doesn\u2019t lie.\u201d\n\nThe governor\u2019s reaction comes four days after Tinubu\u2019s spokesman, Tunde Rahman, said his principal does not have any medical problem requiring hospitalisation.\n\nIn a statement he issued on July 31, he warned those he described as mischief makers to desist from spreading fake news, noting that those who wish Tinubu dead should be careful.\n\n\u201cAnytime he travels out of the country, the next thing some mischievous people would say is he is sick, hospitalized, or has died. It is shameful that perpetrators of this evil are not deterred by the fact that each time this fake news has been propagated, they have been proven wrong.\n\n\u201cWho really is afraid of Asiwaju Tinubu? Those wishing Asiwaju Tinubu evil or dead should be careful. They should know the matter of life and death is in the hand of only God Almighty,\u201d Tinubu\u2019s spokesman said.",
