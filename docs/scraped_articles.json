          "title": "CONVENTION: APC must get it right!",
          "text": "The intrigues surrounding the All Progressives Congress, APC, Convention slated for June 6 and 7, 2022, have generated divergent views among party members and other stakeholders.\n\nThe opposition People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) is through with its convention, which produced former Vice President Atiku Abubakar as the presidential candidate.\n\nWith Atiku as PDP\u2019s standard bearer for the 2023 general elections, the APC must be apt and get its acts right in the selection of a sellable presidential standard bearer.\n\nWith the large number of the aspirants interested in occupying the position, one thing is sure in this contest, every aspirant must be considered based on his or her track records and political antecedence. Every factor must be put into considerations, like religion, ethnicity, leadership skill, humility and political affiliations by our delegates.\n\nIt could be recalled that President Muhammadu Buhari met with progressive governors to chart a way forward on how to unify the party ahead of the convention.\n\nThough, he did not openly declare his interest for a particular aspirant but how the party can come together to have one voice in the selection of the presidential candidate without rancour and acrimony was the crux of the meeting. He urged the governors to cooperate with him in the selection process.\n\nAmong the aspirants that purchased the nomination and expression of interest forms, I crave the indulgence of the All Progressive Governors to allow Mr. President to recommend someone whom he strongly believed that can fly the ticket.\n\nBased on my findings, an average northerner feels much more at home with the former President Goodluck Jonathan. Most of them said Jonathan is the only man they trust that can defeat Atiku Abubakar because of his antecedent and what he did in the region. The average northerner is waiting for APC to see who they will field, that once Goodluck Jonathan is totally out of the game, they will all go for Atiku Abubakar of the PDP.\n\nBased on the research, I came to understand that if APC features Goodluck Jonathan through his track record generally he will dislodge Atiku and the entire PDP.\n\nFor equity and fairness, power must shift to the South in other to have a balance of power and to maintain the social contract between the south and northern Nigeria. Jonathan has only four years to rule and within this period so many agitations will be addressed.\n\nJonathan made Nigeria to witness a free, fair and credible election. It is time to pay him back in other to continue the good job.\n\nWe must understand that he gave the APC and President Muhammadu Buhari the opportunity to come to power, that is a man that contested for three consecutive times and failed. We know how the system used to be.\n\nProf. Yemi Osinbajo is another credible person that has wide acceptability within the Nigerian political space. If Jonathan, who, I believe most elites will prefer is not considered, Vice President Osinbajo should be considered by the delegates as the nearest alternative to fly the party\u2019s flag as anything less than these options might spell doom for the party.\n\nIn conclusion, I urge the party leadership to put Nigeria and Nigerians first in making their choice. The situation where people sell their votes for money should be discountenanced in choosing who should steer the ship of our country to the promise land.\n\nChristian Chime, a social commentator, writes in from Delta State.\n\nchukwunweikechristian3 @gmail.com",

          "title": "Men who compete with their babies over breast milk!",
          "text": "Some years back, when I first learnt of \u2018adult nursing\u2019 I was greatly amused. Was there no depth these men would not sink in their fixation with boobs? Now they\u2019d carried it off to a ridiculous extent. \u201cAdult nursing\u201d is the term used for men who enjoy being breastfed by a nursing mother! According to James, one of these rare (is it really rare, I wonder) breed of men: \u201cI once tried adult nursing with my ex-girlfriend and loved the intimacy and comfort it gave me. I sought this woman who offered her milk for a fee out to experience the same feeding.\n\nI know adult nursing is often sexual but I personally don\u2019t get a sexual thrill from it\u2026\u201d\n\nSome few months after this, I mentioned this particular habit to a male discussant on a different topic entirely but he let me into his experience. \u201cWhen my wife was breast-feeding our first child\u201d, he said, \u201cshe looked so erotic with her boobs dripping milk that I felt aroused. As soon as she finished nursing our child, I latched on to a nipple but I nearly gagged.\n\nThe thing wasn\u2019t as delicious as I thought.\u201d Now, it seems adult nursing could be a real money spinner. Carol, a 27-year old single mother who couldn\u2019t afford to pay her rent said, she was introduced to adult nursing by a friend when she hit rock-bottom. She lives in Britain but it could have been anywhere in the world. This friend who seemed so normal and nice and who\u2019d been a bundle of help in my grapple with single parenthood told me she charged men a lot of money an hour to let them drink her baby milk\u201d, she said.\n\n\u201cI was disgusted, it was the most perverted thing I\u2019d ever heard. What did these men get out of it? Sexual kicks? Didn\u2019t that make my friend some sort of prostitute? She said she\u2019d been really struggling for money and discovered there was a market for adult nursing. It wasn\u2019t sexual, she assured me. The guys who came to her do it to feel mothered. It still sounded gross, but I now felt differently about it. With her help, I was able to get a list of men who would happily pay for the privilege. I nervously range them and requested they send photo Ids and recent test results showing they\u2019d no sexually transmitted infections. I was surprised to hear they all sound friendly. But I was still worried, so I asked an open-minded male friend to act as my bodyguard.\n\n\u201cMy first client was a 28 years old computer analyst who told me he\u2019d tried it once and liked it. He booked a local hotel room and left instructions at reception that I should be taken to the room as soon as I arrived. I waited anxiously for him and it all felt seedy and weird. When he arrived, he seemed friendly and relaxed.\n\nHe paid me up-front and gave me something extra for my \u201cbodyguard\u201d. I then positioned myself on the bed, pulled up my top, unclipped my front-fastening maternity bra and gave him my left breast. I was sure he could hear my heart thumping against my ribs, in shame at what I was doing.\n\nIf he did, he didn\u2019t give any indication. He just lay across me like a big baby and I cradled his head. He was silent, didn\u2019t seem aroused. Yet his large lips and strong suction felt so wrong. It was strange and unnatural compared to feeding my little girl, and it felt as if I was betraying her. I was on the verge of tears and tried not to look at him. After 10 minutes, I asked him to swap breasts and he sucked my right for a further 10. Then he sat up. I cleaned my breasts with disinfectant wipes before pulling down my top.\n\n\u201cHow was it? I asked awkwardly. \u201cGreat,\u201d he said. \u2018Can we do it again this week?\u2019 Lured by money, I agreed. I was just glad it was over. Three days later, I saw him again and this time, it was easier. After I got to know him better, he started coming to my house.\n\n\u201cInitially, I felt guilty depriving my little girl \u2013 I\u2019d planned to feed her myself for the first few months, at least. But the reason I was doing this was to keep a roof over our heads.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how I squared it with myself. Over the following months, I developed a business-like approach to the whole process. Now I regularly see other clients too. I no longer look down on these men \u2013 adult nursing seems a relatively harmless desire. My daughter is eight months now and my milk is slowly drying up. Still, I\u2019ve made more than enough money to keep food on the table regularly and a roof over our heads\u2026.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I had my third child\u201d, said Emily in a newspaper interview, \u201cI started milk banking\u201d, donating excess breast milk to premature babies at my local hospital. My husband and I had been blessed with three healthy kids and wanted to help give poorly babies the best chance of survival. When Emily was six months, I felt I\u2019d given the best of my milk to help sick babies, so I stored the extra in my freezer and searched online to see if anyone would buy it. I imagined there\u2019d be men with adult nursing fantasies, but that didn\u2019t bother me. I just wanted to make money.\n\n\u201cI soon found a site with all sorts of people looking to buy breast milk. So I added my details.\u201d Breast milk available, price depends on quantity\u201d. The first sale was to a woman wanting some for her four month-old baby. She couldn\u2019t produce enough herself and I sold her 11 pints for about N22,000. I delivered them in person bottled wrapped in cool bags. When a man contacted me a month later, I was more cautious and used a special refrigerator courier services to deliver a pint. I\u2019d upped my price too, realising I could sell a pint for as much as N10,000.\n\n\u201cA Multiple sclerosis sufferer bought a pint believing the protein could help his symptoms. A cancer sufferer hoped it would boost his immune system. Neither theory has been medically proven, but I liked to think I was helping. Several months later, a local couple e-mailed, asking if I could provide two pints. I was delighted with the generous fee, didn\u2019t asked what they planned to do with it. Two months on, they still buy two pints every week.\n\n\u201cI hope to find proper work when the children are older. But for now, selling my milk means I can choose my hours and make time for the kids.\u201d",

          "text": "Nigeria COVID-19 Action Recovery and Economic Stimulus (NG-CARES) yesterday gave Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State a pat on the back for his administration\u2019s prudent management of public resources in the state.\n\nThe Federal Government body, saddled with the responsibility of expanding access to livelihood support and food security services, and grants for poor and vulnerable households and firms, also applauded Gov. Ugwuanyi\u2019s administration for observing due process in the management of resources and other administrative engagements.\n\nThey lauded Gov. Ugwuanyi for enthroning prudence, probity and accountability in the state.\n\nAddressing newsmen when the Management Team of NG-CARES paid an advocacy visit to Gov. Ugwuanyi at the Government House, Enugu, which culminated in a meeting with the State Executive Council (EXCO), the National Coordinator of NG-CARES, Dr. Abdulkarim Obaje, disclosed that they were impressed with what they observed in Enugu State in terms of due process and prudent management of public resources by the state government as well as its commitment to the success of the programme in the state.\n\nDr. Obaje explained that the NG-CARES programme \u201cis a 750 million dollars credit facility from the World Bank to cushion the negative impact of COVID-19 on the poor and the vulnerable in Nigeria\u201d.\n\nHe added that all the 36 states of the federation are participating in the programme, disclosing that \u201ceach state is entitled to a sum of N20 million dollars at the end of the programme in June 2023\u2033.\n\nSpeaking on the outcome of their meeting with the State EXCO, NG-CARES National Coordinator disclosed that the \u201cEXCO has given wonderful approval not only for the budget implementation but has also empowered the Chairman of the State-Cares Steering Committee, the Commissioner for Finance and Economic Development, Mrs. Adaonah Kene-Uyanwune, to continue to paddle the boat of NG-CARES in the state without necessarily resorting to the EXCO\u201d.\n\nDescribing the EXCO approval as \u201cspectacular\u201d, Dr. Obaje pointed out that it would ensure that the activities of the body are fast-tracked, saying: \u201cWe want to commend His Excellency (Ugwuanyi) and of course the State Executive Council (EXCO) for the quality of prudence in management of public resources which we witnessed during this visit\u201d.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe are very impressed to note that funds are released only after State EXCO has deliberated on it, and there is due process. The World Bank is an institution that respects due diligence in management of resources and we saw that exemplified in Enugu State.\n\n\u201cThis is going into our records as one of the best practices in management of resources. The process put in place here (Enugu) is commendable and we must put that in our records.\n\n\u201cWe are also impressed with the quality of understanding of the processes involved in NG-CARES implementation in Enugu State. And this emboldens the Chairman of the State-Cares Steering Committee, Mrs. Adaonah Kene-Uyanwune. She is here and we are really impressed with the knowledge that has been exhibited and her leadership\u201d.\n\nDr. Obaje expressed confidence that Enugu will be one of the states in Nigeria that will have the highest amounts of resources from the World Bank through the Federal Government, stressing: \u201cAs far as World Bank portfolios under Enugu State is concerned, the finances of Enugu State is in safe hands and we are very comfortable with the process that has been put in place and we commend His Excellency for enthroning prudence, probity and accountability in the state\u201d.\n\nEarlier, NG-CARES Team Leader, Dr. Martina Nwordu, explained that the delegation was in Enugu State on advocacy visit to evaluate what the state government has done so far on the programme and to encourage it to do more towards the full actualization of the set objectives of the programme aimed at impacting the lives of the poor and the vulnerable, positively.\n\nOn the outcome of their deliberations with Gov. Ugwuanyi and members of the State EXCO, Dr. Nwordu said: \u201cWe are absolutely impressed because this is the first time it is happening. EXCO gave approvals to the Chairman of the State-CARES Steering Committee on delivery platforms, and this is a very big achievement for Enugu State as regards this programme\u201d.\n\nIn her remarks, the Chairman of the State-CARES Steering Committee and Commissioner for Finance and Economic Development, Mrs. Kene-Uyanwune, listed the delivery platforms identified by the Enugu State government to assist the poor and the vulnerable in the society to include Ministry of Agriculture, Community and Social Development Agency (CSDA) and Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs).\n\nShe explained that the state government chose the platforms, which are already in existence in the state as requested by World Bank, because of their direct impact on the lives of the poor and the vulnerable in terms of fast disbursement of funds and other resources.\n\nThe Commissioner assured the delegation that the Enugu State government remains committed to transparency, accountability and due process in the management of the resources, revealing that the state government did match the available funds from the World Bank, which will cut across the delivery platforms to ameliorate the wellbeing of the beneficiaries in the state.\n\nThe Special Adviser to the Governor on Agriculture, Engr. Michael Ogbuekwe, his SMEs counterpart, Arinze Chilo-Offaih, the Board Chairman, CSDA, Enugu, Comrade Ibuchukwu Ezike and the Permanent Secretary, State Ministry of Finance, Dr. Benedict Ezema were also at the press briefing.",

          "text": "By Vincent Ujumadu, Awka\n\nTHE former national chairman of All Progressives Grand Alliance, APGA, and the senator that represented Anambra Central in the 8th national assembly, Chief Victor Umeh, has lamented the circumstances that led to his defection to the Labour Party, LP, saying that it was obvious that some highly placed people currently controlling the party did not want him to return to the red chambers on the platform of APGA in 2023.\n\nSpeaking in an interview in Awka, Umeh said the good thing, however, is that the electorate would not be handpicked and induced with the kind of money that exchanged hands during the primaries, adding that it is the voters that would determine every candidate\u2019s fate during the election.\n\nHe also said that what happened during the APGA primaries had given him the opportunity to reconcile with former Governor Peter Obi, who is the presidential candidate of the Labour Party for the 2023 general elections.\n\nUmeh said: \u201cIt is very sad to leave APGA because I fought very hard for over 20 years to sustain the party. But from the way everything played out during the primaries, it was obvious that they didn\u2019t want me there anymore.\n\n\u201cBut I didn\u2019t want them to cut short my passion for service to our people. The senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria is a very important place to advance the cause of the people. That was what motivated me to join the race on the platform of LP.\n\n\u201cI consulted widely and the stakeholders gave me the nod before I declared. The momentum was huge and when those who didn\u2019t want me there knew that they won\u2019t be able to stop me, they resorted to all kinds of antics.\n\n\u201cThe primaries could not have been transparent when important people outside were calling delegates not to vote for me. With the situation in Nigeria, you won\u2019t expect people who are hungry to differentiate between the mission and ambition of some people. \u201cBut I was satisfied with the delegates as 151 of them voted for me despite the intimidation. I lost the primary by only 11 votes by their declaration and after the declaration, some of delegates suggested that I should insist on a recount because there were obvious anomalies, but I said it was over and I moved on.\n\n\u201cThe good thing is that it is the electorate that will determine who goes to the senate and not a handful of people that were given money to nominate a candidate.\n\n\u201cAs a Christian, I wish them good luck and I will continue to do what God has destined that I should be doing for our people.\n\n\u201cThis APGA that people are revering today was the handwork of Mr. Peter Obi and myself and when Obi left, I remained behind to sustain the party up to the governorship election in November last year.\n\n\u201cSo I don\u2019t know what informed their decision to hatch this plot against me. I feel I don\u2019t deserve it and the public has said so. If I win the forthcoming election, the 10th senate will know that somebody who stayed for only 17months in the 8th senate will do something that all Nigerians will appreciate in terms of allocations for infrastructural development, appointment at all levels and anything government is expected to do for the people.\n\n\u201cI will help to fashion a new Nigeria in the process of lawmaking. In the 8th Senate, I was chairman of Labour Committee that fashioned out the new minimum wage bill and coming to Labour Party, therefore, has brought me to a familiar terrain\u201d.\n\nOn how he was able to mend fence with Obi after years of bickering between them, Umeh added: \u201cOn Sunday after the primaries, Obi called to sympathize with me on the outcome of the APGA primaries and asked me to engage Labour Party leadership to see if I could have the opportunity to emerge as a candidate of the party.\n\n\u201cI reached out to the leadership of LP and they were excited to hear that I am interested in their party. I immediately resigned from APGA on 30th of May and joined LP on 31st of May. And they have unanimously made me their candidate for Anambra Central. I will put all my weight, experience and knowledge in advancing the cause of this party.\n\n\u201cLP is a progressive party and I am happy to be coming from a progressive party into another formidable progressive party. My major objective is to see a South Easterner emerge the president of Nigeria in 2023.\n\n\u201cOur duty is to follow Peter Obi to campaign in all parts of the country and campaign for LP candidates in Anambra in all the constituencies so that we can win.\n\n\u201cThis is a divine mission and God has destined it, I consulted widely and with all the critical stakeholders and they asked me to go ahead to join Obi in LP and contest this election because our people have so much to gain from my representation.\n\n\u201cWhen it seemed like there was no more hope for me to continue this journey, a call came from an unusual quarter, my estranged brother, Peter Obi and that call made peace between us and we decided to put our difference apart in the interest of our people. I am therefore grateful to His Excellency, Mr. Peter Obi and the national leadership of Labour Party\u201d.",
          "summary": "Umeh said: \u201cIt is very sad to leave APGA because I fought very hard for over 20 years to sustain the party.\nI immediately resigned from APGA on 30th of May and joined LP on 31st of May.\n\u201cLP is a progressive party and I am happy to be coming from a progressive party into another formidable progressive party.\n\u201cOur duty is to follow Peter Obi to campaign in all parts of the country and campaign for LP candidates in Anambra in all the constituencies so that we can win.\nI am therefore grateful to His Excellency, Mr. Peter Obi and the national leadership of Labour Party\u201d.",

          "title": "Primaries: SERAP, 185 Nigerians sue INEC over failure to extend voter registration",
          "text": "Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) and 185 concerned Nigerians have filed a lawsuit against the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), asking the court to \u201cdeclare unconstitutional, illegal, and incompatible with international standards the failure of the electoral body to extend the deadline for voter registration to allow eligible Nigerians to exercise their rights.\u201d\n\nAgainst its earlier stance, INEC recently extended the deadline for the conduct of primaries by political parties by six days, from June 3 to June 9. But the commission has failed to also extend the online pre-registration which ended May 30 2022 and the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) ending 30 June 2022.\n\nIn the suit number FHC/L/CS/1034/2022 filed last Friday at the Federal High Court, Lagos, SERAP is asking the court to determine \u201cwhether the failure of INEC to extend the deadline for voter registration is not a violation of Nigerian Constitution, 1999 [as amended], the Electoral Act, and international standards.\u201d\n\nSERAP is asking the court for \u201ca declaration that the failure of INEC to extend the deadline for voter registration is a violation of eligible Nigerians\u2019 rights to participate freely in their own government, equality and equal protection.\u201d\n\nSERAP is also asking the court for \u201can order of mandamus to direct and compel INEC to extend voter registration by a minimum of three months and take effective measures to ensure that eligible Nigerians are able to register to exercise their right to vote in the 2023 general elections.\u201d\n\nIn the suit, SERAP is arguing that: \u201cEnforcing unrealistic voter registration deadline while extending the deadline for party primaries would deny and abridge the constitutional and international human rights of eligible voters.\u201d\n\nSERAP is also arguing that, \u201cINEC mandates ought to be exercised in a fair, just and non-discriminatory manner. The extension of voter registration would ensure that Nigerian voters are treated equally and fairly. The future of Nigeria\u2019s democracy depends on it.\u201d\n\nSERAP is arguing that, \u201cVoters are also critical stakeholders in the electoral process. Treating all eligible Nigerian voters fairly would advance the people\u2019s right to vote and to participate in their own government.\u201d\n\nAccording to SERAP, \u201cINEC must not only be independent and impartial in the exercise of its constitutional and statutory responsibilities, but must also be seen to be independent and impartial.\u201d\n\nSERAP is also asking the court for \u201can order restraining INEC, its agents, privies, assigns, or any other person(s) claiming through it from discontinuing the continuous voters\u2019 registration exercise from the 30th June 2022 or any other date pending the hearing and determination of this suit.\u201d\n\nThe suit filed on behalf of SERAP by its lawyers Kolawole Oluwadare and Opeyemi Owolabi, read in part: \u201cExtending the voter registration exercise would also bolster voter confidence in the electoral process.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the people\u2019s most sacred rights is the right to vote. The commission has a constitutional and statutory responsibility to ensure the effective exercise of the right of all eligible voters to participate in their own government.\u201d\n\n\u201cExtending the deadline for party primaries without providing adequate time and opportunity for eligible voters to register and participate in the 2023 general elections would amount to an unfair and discriminatory treatment of Nigerian voters, and violate other human rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cExtending the voter registration deadline would provide more time for eligible voters, including young people, the elderly, people living with disability, as well as those resident in states facing security challenges and living in IDP camps to participate in the 2023 elections.\u201d\n\n\u201cExtending the deadline for voter registration would be entirely consistent with constitutional and international standards, and the Electoral Act. Any such extension would also not impact negatively on INEC\u2019s election calendar and activities.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe public perception of the independence and impartiality of INEC is essential for building public confidence in the electoral process, and ensuring the credibility and legitimacy of the 2023 elections.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere Nigerians have doubts about the independence and impartiality of INEC, they are more likely to have less confidence in the electoral process thereby undermining democracy.\u201d\n\n\u201cExtending the deadline for voter registration would also be justified, given reports of challenges in the voter registration exercise, especially for young people, the elderly, persons living with disabilities, and those resident in states facing security challenges and living in internally displaced persons (IDP) camps.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe will of the people is expressed through democratic elections. This requires that people should be afforded adequate time and opportunity to register to vote. Extending the voter registration deadline is crucial for promoting the independence and impartiality of INEC and building public confidence in the electoral process.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Constitution 1999 (as amended) provides in Section 14(1)(c) that, \u2018the participation by the people in their government shall be ensured in accordance with the provisions of this Constitution.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cSection 9(6) of the Electoral Act 2022 provides that \u2018the registration of voters, updating and revision of the Register of Voters under this section shall not stop not later than 90 days before any election covered by this Act.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights, and the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance guarantee the right to political participation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese human rights treaties also require states parties including Nigeria to ensure the independence and impartiality of national electoral bodies responsible for the management of elections, as well as to promote the establishment of the necessary conditions to foster citizen participation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe right of people to participate in their government is a fundamental feature of any democratic society, and any undue restriction of the right would strike at the heart of representative government.\u201d\n\nNo date has been fixed for the hearing of the suit.",

We enjoin other aspirants such as the Senate President Ahmad Lawan, Governor Yahaya Bello and former Governor Ahmed Rufai Sani Yerima to also bow out of the race. History will be kind to them all.\n\nOnanuga noted that the APC can now go into its national convention which will be open to only presidential aspirants from the South to seek the mandate of party members through their elected delegates without acrimony and suspicions.\n\nRead Also: Tinubu presents Bisi is the Boss\n\n\u201cWe salute the courage of the APC Governors from the North for their patriotic decision to sustain the unity of the country and that of the party. The decision of the Northern APC Governors has once again confirmed that our country will make tremendous progress when the bond of our unity is strengthened and preserved.\n\n\u201c Our APC Northern governors have shown that the APC believes in power rotation in the true spirit of national equity and justice, unlike the opposition Peoples Democratic Party that abandoned its zoning policy for hegemonic political expediency, ethnic and religious calculations, that grossly undermined the party\u2019s commitment to the 1999 constitution.\n\n\u201c Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu believes that our country does better when leaders across the country rise above personal, ethnic and religious sentiments to uphold justice and fairness. The 11 Northern APC Governors have restored the confidence of millions of Nigerians and party members in the greatness and unity of our country.\n\n\u201cThese Governors are patriots and honourable men who will be remembered for acting to save Nigeria from potential political crisis and another round of national distrust and mistrust.\n\n\u201cWith this decision, the future of APC as the governing party in Nigeria is very bright as a true national party. The party can now proceed to hold the Convention as a united, strong and viable political platform by electing a capable presidential flag bearer in whom the Nigerian people can invest their trust by supporting him to win the general election.\n\n\u201cWe are confident that the delegates will make the right choice by giving Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu the honour of flying the flag of APC as our presidential candidate in line with the expectation of President Muhammadu Buhari that the candidate of our party must be one who can win election, who is acceptable to all Nigerians and one who can give Nigerians a sense of confidence and victory.\n\n\u201cAsiwaju Tinubu is the most prepared and capable of all the aspirants. He has shown this with his track record in Lagos. He has comprehensive development plan that will build on the success of the Buhari-led administration and create greater prosperity for Nigerians,\u201d Onanuga said in the statement.",

          "title": "Ogun outburst: APC moves to sanction Tinubu",
          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nThe chances of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu clinching the presidential ticket of the All Progressives Congress (APC) narrowed yesterday, following the resolution of the National Chairman of the ruling party, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, that the former governor of Lagos State will face sanctions over his utterances in Ogun State.\n\nThe APC national leader and presidential aspirant was involved in an outburst in Ogun when he visited the state to campaign to the delegates for votes ahead of the presidential primary scheduled for Monday.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nAlthough Tinubu has apologised and retracted his comments in the state, the ruling party chairman hinted that the apology was not enough, insisting that he would be facing a disciplinary action.\n\nSpeaking to newsmen in Abuja yesterday, specifically on the Ogun outburst, Adamu said: \u201cHe (Tinubu) went as far as saying how General Muhammadu Buhari went to him, citing instances of even prostrating in tears begging him to endorse him and to support him for the presidency. He claimed Buhari went to him.\n\n\u201cHis utterances are very, very insulting. It\u2019s very, very unbecoming for a person of that standing to do what he did to the sitting president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the president produced by the votes of the APC. Though as the president he belongs to everybody, it is amazing how a fellow APC person would make that kind of comment in that kind of circumstances about the president. We take exception to this. It has shown that he does not show any appreciable level of respect for the office of Mr. President.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we want to make it public that we are saddened by what we saw in the video, in that reportage and we condemn it in the strongest of terms. We do hope that he would never say that kind of thing again, particularly of the APC extraction to make such kinds of comments.\n\n\u201cYes, yesterday we saw some part of a retraction, but that effort is not adequate. It is not sincere. It is not indepth enough. It doesn\u2019t wipe out the impression that event has left in our minds.\u201d\n\nAsked if there will be punitive measures against him, he replied: \u201cAt the time this event took place, the screening committee has not presented their report to us at all; and was trying to suggest that anybody was under any threat. So, there was no justification for the time that this thing happened.\n\n\u201cThis morning we saw some traces of withdrawal of those statements. You see these are statements that are his intention of actual action. Yes, we can\u2019t say we refuse not seeing on the papers. It happened. He said he has the greatest respect for the president. You see in Hausa there is a proverb that once you take hold of any amount of grass from a thatched house and you pulled it off from the roof, you can\u2019t replace the same number of grass.\n\n\u201cWhat is out is out. What he did say was not an apology. It\u2019s just like trying to retract and you say I didn\u2019t mean this. It\u2019s a problem of misinterpretation. It is not a regret. If there is the need to penalize any member of the party, not just Bola Tinubu, anybody we will bring him to the party book. Anybody as we watch events as they unfold,\u201d he warned.\n\nThe former governor of Nasarawa State also spoke on the status of the statutory delegates, stressing: \u201cServe notice of appeal. Matter in court. Convention statutory delegates are excluded.\u201d\n\nOn disqualified aspirants, he said: \u201cI want to say very clearly that no aspirant has been disqualified. It\u2019s like sitting in an exam. Even if you pass there is grading from first-class to ordinary pass. So, no aspirant was disqualified. Incidentally, the president has invited all of them to a dinner today (Saturday).\u201d\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nThe stage is set for the All Progressives Congress (APC) Special Convention scheduled for Monday June 6, in Abuja to pick the candidate of the party for the 2023 presidential election.\n\nAlready, the 23 aspirants who bought forms have been screened and reduced to a manageable number of 13, while the relevant committees have been constituted.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nBaring any last minute change in plan, the issue of zoning and consensus arrangement would have been sorted and resolved during the planned meeting between the Progressive Governors and President Muhammadu Buhari scheduled today.\n\nThe aspirants have also crisscrossed the entire length and breadth of the country to solicit the vote of the delegates in addition to networking with the relevant stakeholders that would brighten their chances of clinching the party\u2019s presidential ticket tomorrow.\n\nInterestingly, the screening committee in the recommendation contained in their report submitted to the party\u2019s leadership tried to separate the pretenders from the contenders through the criteria of contributions to the party and national development, security report from the anti-graft agencies and other sundry issues.\n\nAt the end, according to the committee, 13 aspirants got a clean bill of health after going through the burning furnace of the screening while urging the national leadership of the party to further trim down the list.\n\nFrom the trending reports, those that emerged frontline contenders include, the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan; former Minister of Education (State), Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, Vice President, Prof Yemi Osinbajo; APC national leader, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu; Governors of Kogi, Yahaya Bello; Ebonyi, Dave Umahi; Ekiti, Kayode Fayemi; Jigawa, Mohammad Badaru Abubakar.\n\nOthers are former governors of Rivers State, Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi; Abia, Ogbonnaya Onu; Akwa-Ibom, Godswill Akpabio; Ogun, Ibikunle Amosun; and Jack-Rich Tein, among others.\n\nThe recommendation of the screening panel read: \u201cWe would also want to advise that should any aspirant not be ready for consensus arrangement, then the party should proceed to conduct elective primaries in strict compliance with the provision of Electoral Act.\u201d\n\nThe aspirants have in reality transverse the country, but many of them like other Nigerians are not convinced that their future and fortune would rest on the magnanimity of the elected delegates, as it is believed that President Buhari\u2019s anointment will be the decider.\n\nFaced with that stark realities, many believe that the appeal from President Buhari to the Progressive Governors to permit him to chose his successor did not only confirm the worst fears, but has also left almost all of them in the state of confusion and anxiety.\n\nCuriously, the aspirants\u2019 names have been peddled as the anointed by the president at one point or the other. Among the aspirants touted to have the backing of President Buhari are former Minister of Education (State), Nwajiuba; Vice President Osinbajo; Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi; his former Science and Technology counterpart, Onu, among others.\n\nFor Osinbajo, he has always told every ear that cares to listen that beyond the speculated endorsement by Mr President, he would bank on his administrative experiences gathered in the last seven years as the vice president to edge out others.\n\nHowever, despite the advantage the power of incumbency may have conferred on him, many still nurture the impression that his strained relationship with his godfather, Tinubu, will certainly count against him.\n\nHow he maneuvers and manipulates the hurdles and odds against him to his advantage, especially in convincing the Yoruba nation that he was not on a \u2018satanic\u2019 mission to sabotage the collective resolve to front and support his godfather to clinch the position.\n\nIn the build up to the activities to resolve who picks the ticket, the pendulum has equally at one time or the other swung towards Nwajiuba.\n\nAccording to his apostles, his perceived closeness to President Buhari in a political journey dating many years placed him shoulder and head above other anointed aspirants.\n\nThose that have interacted with Nwajiuba can testify that he is a man of capacity and competence, but his detractors feel that what would count against him was the inability to resolve the lingering ASUU strike before resigning from the ministry.\n\nMinister of Transportation, Amaechi, to those close to the seat of power, can testify that he is among those with the ear of President Buhari. Perhaps because of his performing ministry, especially in the area of railway exploit, he has an unfettered access to Mr President to be the anointed one.\n\nHis contributions to President Buhari emerging the President in 2015 made him the aspirant to receive Buhari\u2019s endorsement ahead of others.\n\nHowever, the speculation that he may not have met up with the resignation deadline in accordance with the Electoral guidelines may certainly count against him.\n\nAnother aspirant with rising profile is the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan.\n\nHe has so many things working for him, including the mundane issue of zoning the ticket to the Northeast believed to have been marginalised in the presidential power rotation equation.\n\nBeyond that, apostles of tribal politics believe that he remains a sentimental northern force to counter the moving train of the PDP candidate, Atiku Abubakar during the presidential election.\n\nHowever, in the calculations of many political watchers, he lacks the political antecedent, general acceptability and ardent backing of the northern oligarchy.\n\nApparently, former governor of Lagos State, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, certainly deserves the ticket if his claims that he contributed more than every other person in making Buhari the president is anything to go by.\n\nThere is no doubt about his capability and competence, his administrative experiences is not also in short demand just as he has enough war chest to march any other candidate from the opposition party, force for force, and money for money.\n\nBut he is one aspirant touted to be endorsed by President whose ambition has been marred in controversy. Beyond the doubt over his health status, his recent outburst in Ogun State on sundry issues will certainly count against him.\n\nAnother aspirant whose profile looks good to fly the flag of the APC is Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State. Bello had indicated his interest for the job about two years ago, even when the agitation for power shift to the South was thick in the air and no northern contender dared to buy the idea.\n\nThus, he was in the forefront of the champion of the narrative that zoning was not in the ruling party\u2019s constitution and was almost like a lone voice in that struggle. At that time, even key northern governors were vocal in their call for power to shift to the South based on what they termed a \u2018gentleman agreement.\u2019\n\nWhen it dawned on northern stakeholders that a few weeks to the beginning of the real race, Yahaya Bello was the only aspirant standing in the North, the race to puncture that began with some of them rushing to pay for the presidential nomination forms thereby making them to copy the Kogi governor.\n\nYahaya Bello\u2019s campaign has also taken the whole political and media space by surprise and his media outing adjudged the best in the current political season. An independent manifesto review of key aspirants across parties by Channels TV also rated his manifesto the best amongst others, tying him only with Vice President Yemi Osinbajo.\n\nAlso to his advantage is the clamour by many youth groups for a youthful president, which the Kogi governor is savouring at the moment and hopes to utilize fully if his party gives him the ticket.\n\nIndeed, the huge simultaneous rallies by youths across more than 24 states on a single day showed a kind of capacity that had not been seen before in recent history.\n\nSimilarly, he has massive women support following the many strategic positions he has given to women in his cabinet and campaign organisation. These two demographics are key to winning elections and decision makers in the APC may fall for these.\n\nNot many people knew how much work he had done in Kogi until his media team began to put the projects in the faces of Nigerians, making many to argue the the presidential race should not be about the highest bidder, but who can effectively build on the successes of President Buhari and tackle the challenges.\n\nBeyond the individual strengths and weaknesses of the aspirants, the build up to the primary has not been a smooth sail considering the twin issue of leadership crisis rocking the party and the perception of President Buhari on how the candidate of the party would eventually emerge.\n\nIn the past one week, instead of collectively planning the Special Convention, the leadership of the party, the National Working Committee (NWC) have been enmeshed in one controversy or the other, especially against the National Chairman, Abdulahi Adamu, who they accused of high handedness.\n\nApart from the unending attacks on the chairman, the factional NWC members equally spoke against the appeal from President Buhari to allow him anoint his successor.\n\nThe ruling party may be pretending to be a house that is in order, but in reality, it is gradually becoming a house of commotion.\n\nUnless the attackers are prevailed upon, the ruling party is seriously facing the risk of fielding a presidential candidate, following the rejection of certain committees, they claimed, Abdullahi Adamu constituted singlehandedly.\n\nAlthough the screening panel made a recommendation f reducing the aspirants to a manageable size of 13, if measures are not put in place to manage the fallout, it may escalate to litigations by those that might seek legal redress to their disqualifications.\n\nThe John Odigie-Oyegun-led Screening Committee may have denied that they did not disqualify any aspirant, but only made recommendation to the leadership of the party. But suggesting that only 13 aspirants should go into the poll, many believe, could rightly be interpreted as disqualification.\n\nSpeaking while submitting the report, Oyegun said: \u201cFirst, we had 23 aspirants that we interacted with and my first comment is that indeed we are very lucky party. Those 23 that presented themselves were prominent Nigerians both within the country and outside the country that applied.\n\n\u201cBut for what ever reasons could not proceed with their applications. The point I want to make is the quality of the people that want to govern this country. The second point I want to make is that; we were surprised with the active participation of the youthful members of the party. Some of them really surprised us as to what they have accomplished in life, their understanding of the situation of the country and how they want to have the privilege of governing this country.\n\n\u201cSo, what was important was that they so believed in the country and the party that they were able to pay the sums, which I considered as ransom, to participate in the process. Our report is basically simple. We don\u2019t want to beat around the bush. There were two aspects to it; the basic constitutional qualifications for you to aspire to be a president of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAppraising the special convention to produce the party\u2019s candidate, a chieftain of the party told Sunday Sun that the meeting between President Buhari and the aspirants today (Saturday) would be the decider, stressing that the primary may be reduced to a mere carnival instead of the contest to pick the candidate.\n\n\u201cYes, so many forces may be at play ahead of our presidential primary on Monday, but it will be milestone and far much better than the one conducted by the opposition recently. In any case, I don\u2019t want to undermine the gravity of the build up crisis ahead of the primary, but it will end up a storm in a tea cup. What is happening now is expected of a new leadership, especially the division or crack among the NWC members.\n\n\u201cWhat I also know is that these issues will be sorted out before moving to the Special Convention ground. And I can assure you that it will start on Saturday (yesterday) when the aspirants will meet with Mr President. I saw a repeat of what happened during our last national convention which confirmed Abdullahi Adamu as the national chairman of the party hours to the convention.\u201d\n\nXXX\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

          "text": "\n\n*Governor Badaru withdraws from race\n\n*Southern govs hail northern colleagues on zoning\n\n*Buhari urges aspirants to build consensus and come up with formidable candidate\n\n*APC may punish Tinubu over outburst against Buhari, says Adamu\n\n*Insists statutory delegates won\u2019t vote in primary\n\nEjiofor Alike in Lagos, Deji Elumoye and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nHopes for the emergence of a southerner as the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) have been rekindled as 11 northern governors elected on the platform of the ruling party and other political leaders from the region, yesterday resolved that the presidential ticket of the party should be zoned to the South.\n\n\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari who met over dinner last night with all the 23 presidential aspirants of the party at the State House, Abuja, was said to have supported the decision of the APC northern governors to back a southern presidential aspirant.\n\n\n\nHe urged the presidential aspirants to hold consultations, build consensus and come up with formidable candidate before the party holds its primary election from June 6 to 8, 2022.\n\nIn line with the decision of the governors and other leaders, the Jigawa State Governor, Mr. Mohammed Abubakar Badaru, has withdrawn from the presidential race, just as the party\u2019s screening committee has recommended 13 presidential aspirants.\n\n\n\nBadaru\u2019s counterpart in Ebonyi State, Mr. Dave Umahi, has, however, denied stepping down from the race.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Chairman of the ruling party, Senator Abdullahi Adamu has hinted that the party may punish a frontline presidential aspirant and National Leader of the party, Senator Bola Tinubu, for his recent outburst against President Buhari.\n\n\n\nHowever, in a swift response, the National Vice Chairman of the party, North-west, Dr. Salihu Lukman, said Adamu\u2019s comment on the recent outburst of Tinubu did not represent the position of the party.\n\nIn a statement issued yesterday after a meeting of the northern APC governors and political leaders from the northern states, the leaders noted that they welcomed President Buhari\u2019s invitation to them and other stakeholders to contribute to the emergence of a strong presidential candidate for the party.\n\n\n\nThe statement was signed by Governors Aminu Masari (Katsina); Abubakar Sani Bello (Niger); Abdullahi Sule (Nasarawa); Babagana Zulum (Borno); Nasir El-Rufai (Kaduna); Muhammad Inuwa Yahaya (Gombe); Bello Matawalle (Zamfara); Simon Lalong (Plateau); Abdullahi Ganduje (Kano); Abubakar Atiku Bagudu (Kebbi) and former Governor of Sokoto State, Senator Aliyu Wamakko.\n\nKwara State Governor, Mr AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, who was not at the meeting, has also thrown his weight behind the decision of his northern colleagues, saying it was a perfect decision taken in the overall interest of the country.\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter careful deliberation, we wish to state our firm conviction that after eight years in the office of President Buhari, the presidential candidate of the APC for the 2023 elections should be one of our teeming members from the southern states of Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is a question of honour for the APC, an obligation that is not in any way affected by the decisions taken by another political party. We affirm that upholding this principle is in the interest of building a stronger, more united and more progressive country.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, wish to strongly recommend to President Buhari that the search for a successor as the APC\u2019s presidential candidate be limited to our compatriots from the southern states. We appeal to all aspirants from the northern states to withdraw in the national interest and allow only the aspirants from the south to proceed to the primaries.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are delighted by the decision of our esteemed colleague, His Excellency, Governor Abubakar Badaru to contribute to this patriotic quest by withdrawing his presidential aspiration,\u201d the statement explained.\n\nThe northern governors argued that the ruling party has to ensure that the 2023 elections offer a nation-building moment, reaffirming that a democratic pathway to power exists for all who value cooperation and build national platforms.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis moment calls for the most sober and inclusive approach to selecting our party\u2019s candidate, and we call on all APC leaders to fulfil their responsibility in this regard,\u201d the statement added.\n\nAPC May Punish Tinubu over Outburst against Buhari, Says Adamu\n\nThe National Chairman of the APC, Adamu has hinted that the party may punish a frontline presidential aspirant, Tinubu, for his recent outburst against President Buhari.\n\nAddressing journalists in Abuja yesterday, Adamu described Tinubu\u2019s utterances as insulting, unbecoming, and a mark of lack of respect for the president\n\n\n\nAdamu stated categorically that the party would henceforth be on the lookout to punish Tinubu or any other aspirant that makes a similar statement as the event unfolds.\n\n\n\nTinubu had while addressing delegates in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, said he made Buhari president in 2015.\n\nThough the former Lagos State governor had in a statement issued on Friday clarified that he has the utmost respect for President Buhari, the APC National Chairman insisted that what the presidential hopeful did was not an apology, but a retraction of his statement.\n\n\n\nAdamu argued that Tinubu\u2019s utterances did not wipe out the impression that his comments had created in people\u2019s minds.\n\n\n\nHis words: \u201cWithin the last three days, the country, and the world of the social media have been undaunted by the report of one of our leaders, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, former Governor of Lagos State when he went for his campaign in Ogun \u2013Abeokuta. In the course of his address, he went as far as to mention what happened between him and President Muhamadu Buhari.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe went as far as to tell his audience how President Buhari went to him; even prostrating in tears, begging him to endorse him for the presidency. He claimed that Buhari went to him. The words in Yoruba\u2026 the interpretation was very insulting, very unbecoming of a person of that standing to do what he did to a sitting president produced by the votes of APC.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is amazing how a fellow APC person can make that kind of comment about the president. We take exception to this and this doesn\u2019t show any appreciable level of respect for the office of Mr. President and the person of Mr. President.\n\n\n\n\u201cTherefore, we want to make it public that we are saddened about the audio and video in that reportage and we condemn it in the strongest terms. We do hope he will never say that kind of thing again \u2013 especially those of APC extraction to make that kind of unbecoming comments.\n\n\n\n\u201cBetween yesterday and this morning, it was retracted but that effort is not adequate. It doesn\u2019t wipe out the impression that event has left in our minds. This is our position. I, as chairman of the ruling party, have the duty to come out and stand by our government, to stand by our president,\u201d Adamu explained.\n\n\n\nAsked if punitive measures would be taken against Tinubu, the APC national chairman said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to take this together because they are mischief-laden. I don\u2019t want to take the primary screening to answer this question because doing so is finding a way to justify, and give some reasons that may have caused what he did. For one thing, I know at the time this event took place the screening committee had not made the report to us at all.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe question of punitive measures is yes and no! This morning we saw some traces of withdrawal statements. You see, these are statements that can emerge not with the intention of the actual actions. So yes, we can\u2019t say we don\u2019t see in the papers what was reported. It happened. What is out is out. It is not an apology, it is trying to retract. We will be on the watch for us to penalise any member of the party not just Bola Tinubu, anybody. We will watch events as they unfold,\u201d Adamu added.\n\n\n\nHowever, in a swift reaction, the National Vice Chairman of APC, North-west, Lukman has said that Adamu\u2019s comment did not represent the position of the party.\n\nIn a telephone interview with journalists, Lukman said while Tinubu, as well as other members of the party had acknowledged that the statement was unfortunate, it could not be used against him until the appropriate organ of the party deliberates and takes a decision on it.\n\n\n\nThe party chieftain said Adamu\u2019s position at the moment remained his personal opinion and did not represent the decision of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party.\n\nHis words: \u201cWe all, including Asiwaju himself, acknowledged that it was unfortunate he made those statements and it is his right to express his frustration, it should be recognised as such.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut nobody, no matter the position of the person, can use it against him unless the party follows the due process through the rightful organs of the party to discuss it.\n\n\u201cSo, the opinion expressed by Abdullahi Adamu was his personal opinion and it is his right to present it to any organ of the party for consideration.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut until that opinion is adopted by the organ of the party, it cannot be considered as the position of the party. It is not the position of APC, it is his personal opinion,\u201d Lukman added.\n\nIn a related development, Adamu has stated categorically that statutory delegates are excluded from the special convention of the party, adding that the party has already served an appeal for the judgment given by a Federal High Court in Kano.\n\n\n\nA Federal High Court in Kano had on Friday ruled that Section 84 of the Electoral Act did not prevent statutory delegates from voting.\n\nReacting to the judgment, Adamu noted: \u201cWell, I am a lawyer, we have served notice of appeal and matter is in the court and as far as we are concerned, this convention is concerned, statutory delegates are excluded.\u201d\n\nAPC Screening Panel Recommends 13 Aspirants\n\nIn a related development, the John Odigie-Oyegun panel that screened the party\u2019s 23 presidential aspirants has recommended 13 aspirants to the party. The recommended aspirants include Governor Badaru of Kebbi State; Senator Godswill Akpabio; Mr Chibuike Amaechi; Senator Ibikunle Amosun; Mr Yahaya Bello; Ekiti State Governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi; Senate President, Dr Ahmad Lawan; Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; Senator Bola Tinubu; Mr Tein Jack-Rich; Mr Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba; Dr Christopher Onu and Ebonyi State Governor, Mr Dave Umahi.\n\nThe National Chairman of the party, Adamu, has however, clarified that no presidential aspirant has been disqualified.\n\n\n\n\u201cI want to say very clearly that no aspirant has been disqualified. Interestingly, President Muhamadu Buhari has invited them to the villa for dinner today (yesterday). He will be interacting with all of them today,\u201d Adamu told journalists in Abuja.\n\nMeanwhile, ahead of the party\u2019s presidential primary, the Ondo State Governor, Mr Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, has promised that the APC will have a hitch-free event on Monday.\n\n\n\nAkeredolu said this in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Richard Olatunde in Akure.\n\nThe governor, who is the Chairman of, Sub-committee on Security and Compliance for the APC Special Convention and Presidential Primary Election, said that the party was ready for the election.\n\nBuhari Urges Aspirants to Come up With Formidable Candidate\n\nAt last night\u2019s meeting with all the 23 APC aspirants, President Buhari urged them to hold consultations, and come up with a formidable candidate before the party holds its primary election from June 6 to 8, 2022.\n\nThe president, according to a statement issued last night by his Media Adviser, Mr Femi Adesina, said the meeting was a continuation of the ongoing consultative process aimed at ensuring a smooth and strategic emergence of a standard-bearer, who will lead the APC to a resounding victory in the upcoming presidential polls.\n\n\n\nThe president added: \u201cOur party, the APC, has won two successive presidential elections in 2015, first when we were in the opposition and 2019 when I sought re-election. Both processes were achieved through unity of purpose, strategic alignment, consultation, fairness, determination and effective leadership. In both instances, national and party interests were overriding factors in our deliberations and decision-making.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe 2023 elections are fast approaching in a global, regional and national environment that is constantly changing and challenging. This demands that our party should become more aware of the changing environment, be responsive to the yearnings of our citizens, re-evaluate our strategy and strengthen our internal mechanism so that we would sustain the electoral successes.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am pleased to note that the party, recognising the significance of all these demands, has over time developed several democratically acceptable processes and policies, that promote consultation, internal cohesion and leadership to facilitate victories at the polls.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe president recalled the consultation he had held with stakeholders \u201cthat would help the electoral fortunes of our party, beginning with the state governors. This is the second in the series and I still look forward to meeting with party stakeholders. \u201cThese steps are being taken to ensure that the unity and cohesion of the party are sustained and to provide direction.\n\n\n\n\u201cAmongst other things, I reminded the APC governors of the need for the party to proceed to the 2023 presidential elections with strength, unity of purpose and to present a flag bearer who will give Nigerians a sense of hope and confidence while ensuring victory for our party. I extend a similar reminder to all of you distinguished aspirants.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari said he was aware that there is anxiety among party members about the outcome of the process.\n\n\u201cGiven these circumstances, I charge you to recognise the importance of the stability and unity of the party, which cannot be overemphasised.\n\n\n\n\u201cSimilarly, I wish to remind you that our choice of flag bearer must be formidable, appealing to the electorate across the board and should command such ability to unify the country and capacity to address our critical challenges.\n\n\n\n\u201cAhead of the convention, the party machinery has screened and found all aspirants eminently qualified. Recognising this fact, the Screening Committee has, amongst others, recommended that consensus building through consultation, be intensified.\n\n\n\n\u201cWithout prejudice to your qualifications, I urge all of you to hold consultations amongst yourselves and with the party, to build a consensus in a manner that would help the party reduce the number of aspirants, bring up a formidable candidate and scale down the anxiety of party members.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe president assured that in the interest of the nation and the party, he would continue to provide effective leadership during the transition processes and ongoing consultations, \u201cuntil we successfully choose the candidate that will fly the flag of our party for the presidential elections and make the party stronger. I seek your support in this all-important responsibility.\u201d\n\n\n\nEarlier, in his speech, the National Chairman of the party, Senator Abdullahi Adamu had promised that all stakeholders of the party would be reached in the consultation process.\n\n\n\nResponding on behalf of the aspirants, former Governor of the old Abia State and immediate past Minister of Science, Technology and Innovations, Dr, Ogbonnaya Onu, Governor Abubakar Badaru of Jigawa State, and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, thanked the president for his leadership and guidance, pledging that they would hold the consultations as counselled \u201cfor the unity and strength of our party, the APC.\u201d\n\nSouthern govs hail northern colleagues on zoning\n\nMeanwhile, the Southern Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum has hailed their northern counterparts on the decision to zone the APC presidential ticket to the South.\n\nIn a statement issued last night, the Chairman of the forum and Governor of Ondo State, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu, said the southern governors did not expect anything short of the heart-warming decision from their northern colleagues whom he described as great patriots and reliable partners in the collaborative efforts geared towards the attainment of nationhood for the country.\n\n\u201cThis is indeed another landmark achievement in our quest for understanding, rapprochement and continual engagements for mutual beneficence.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe acknowledge this courageous stance for equity and moral rectitude. We applaud the zeal and determination of our brothers to engage realistically and honestly. We salute this uncommon resolve to confront issues militating against the march towards nationhood and ultimate greatness. By this gesture, we are convinced of the seriousness of our colleagues to join other patriots in ensuring that the ascendant march towards stability, progress and prosperity is not truncated by indiscretion,\u201d the statement explained.\n\nThe southern governors lauded Jigawa Governor, Badaru, for his exemplary conduct, stressing that posterity will remember him for good.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe thank the leadership of the Northern Governors\u2019 Forum for the patriotic zest displayed at this crucial moment. We look forward to conducting a hitch-free convention which will culminate in the election of a suitable candidate who will hoist the flag of the party with a sense of mission,\u201d the statement added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Atiku\u2019s Candidacy and Nigeria\u2019s Delicate Balance",
          "text": "SIMONKOLAWOLELIVE!\n\nIf power does not go to the south in 2023, the pivotal role of Alhaji Atiku Abubakar will have to be scrutinised. His life ambition is to be president of Nigeria and his influence on the leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) effectively ensured that the main opposition party did not zone presidency to the south. With Rt Hon Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, governor of Sokoto state, dropping out at the last minute and handing over his votes to Atiku, a fellow northerner, there was going to be only one outcome. Atiku secured 371 delegate votes, outscoring Governor Nyesom Wike who got 237. The margin of 134 is attributed to the Tambuwal effect, to the chagrin of many southerners.\n\nDr Iyorchia Ayu, the PDP chairman and Atiku\u2019s long-time associate, was caught on video celebrating Tambuwal as a \u201chero\u201d. The immediate implication is that the All Progressives Congress (APC) will now have to take a decision: to zone its ticket to the north to counter Atiku or zone to the south for the sake of national sensitives. The easiest way to achieve rotation was for the two leading parties to zone to the south. Head or tail, presidential power would have gone to the south. However, the choice of Atiku as PDP\u2019s flagbearer will test APC\u2019s fidelity to the political understanding on rotation. Senator Abdullahi Adamu, the APC chairman, has been telling us there is no decision yet on zoning.\n\nTo refresh our memories, next year will mark the 30th anniversary of Atiku\u2019s presidential ambition. His first attempt was in 1993 under the now-defunct Social Democratic Party (SDP). With the Option A4 experiment performed by the electoral commission, there were four stages to become a presidential candidate. Hence the name: Option A4. The first was at ward level, the second at local government, the third at state and the fourth at national. Every state had a presidential flagbearer, and since Nigeria had 30 states then, there were 30 contestants in each of the two parties. The SDP presidential convention was held at the Jos Township Stadium, Plateau state, on March 27-29.\n\nAtiku was the SDP candidate from Adamawa, Bashorun MKO Abiola from Ogun and Alhaji Babagana Kingibe, former SDP chairman, from Borno. These were the top contenders. Kingibe had most of the SDP governors on his side, Atiku had Maj-Gen Shehu Musa Yar\u2019Adia (rtd) and his political machinery, while Abiola had name recognition and widespread goodwill. At the end of the first round of voting in which delegates had to pick three contestants in order of preference, Abiola came tops with 3,617 votes, Kingibe second with 3,225 and Atiku third with 2,066. There was no clear majority. That meant there was going to be a run-off where delegates were limited to picking only one choice.\n\nAbiola went into intense negotiations with Yar\u2019Adua/Atiku, reportedly promising to make Atiku his running mate if they jointly fended off Kingibe. With deal sealed, Atiku informed his supporters just before the second round of voting that he was quitting the race. \u201cDistinguished national delegates, I very much appreciate your endorsement last night\u2026 But in order to ensure a rancour-free election tonight, I beg and I plead with you to allow me to discontinue the race,\u201d he said. Abiola polled 2,683 votes to Kingibe\u2019s 2,456 and was crowned the presidential candidate. He ended up picking Kingibe, and not Atiku, as his running mate and went on to win the June 12, 1993 poll. It was sadly annulled.\n\nMeanwhile, Atiku kept nurturing his ambition. After winning the 1999 governorship in Adamawa on the platform of the PDP, he was picked as VP candidate by President Olusegun Obasanjo. But since he had his eyes on the presidency, he set up campaign structures ahead of 2003 \u2014 despite Obasanjo being eligible for second term. He said he had three options: to support Obasanjo, to go with Dr Alex Ekwueme, and to contest himself. He later pulled back but Obasanjo still blocked him in the PDP in 2007. He defected to the Action Congress (AC), ran for president and came third behind Alhaji Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua (PDP), sibling of his mentor, and Maj-Gen Muhammadu Buhari (ANPP).\n\nWith Yar\u2019Adua terminally ill, Atiku returned to the PDP to pursue his ambition, insisting that it was the north\u2019s turn after the south had done eight years through Obasanjo. President Goodluck Jonathan, a southerner who became president after Yar\u2019Adua\u2019s death in May 2010, also wanted to run in 2011 and disingenuously denied the existence of power rotation in the PDP. Atiku rallied the north to produce a \u201cconsensus candidate\u201d to face Jonathan at the primary, with Gen Ibrahim Babangida, Dr Bukola Saraki and Gen Aliyu Gusau all showing interest. The Northern Political Leaders Forum (NPLF), led by Mallam Adamu Ciroma, picked Atiku but he still lost the ticket to Jonathan.\n\nIn a sense, the bitterness over power rotation in 2011, not ameliorated in any way by Atiku\u2019s bid to get PDP\u2019s ticket, gravely poisoned the geo-political atmosphere and I am of the opinion that we are still suffering from the consequences. Jonathan went ahead to win the presidential election in 2011, claiming 16 out of the 17 southern states and seven of the 19 northern states. Some key northern politicians supported him, allegedly with the pact that he would do only one term. Atiku stayed behind until it became clear Jonathan would run again in 2015. He walked out on the party, teamed up with the newly formed APC \u2014 an amalgam of four opposition parties \u2014 to help crush PDP.\n\nAtiku re-launched his presidential quest in APC, but he could only come third in the primary as Buhari got the ticket with 3,430 votes. Dr Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso came second with 974 votes, while the former vice-president scored 954. In 2017, with the message quite clear that Buhari would seek a second term, Atiku returned to PDP yet again to continue the pursuit of his life ambition of being president. He was promoted as the best northerner to tackle Buhari in the 2019 presidential poll and he did not do his chances any harm by winning PDP\u2019s primary, getting 1,532 delegate votes and pushing Tambuwal, who was heavily backed by Wike, to a very distant second with 693 votes.\n\nHaving lost the election to Buhari in 2019, Atiku was assumed to have ended his Aso Rock pursuit. It was expected that with Buhari in power from 2015 to 2023, it was only logical for PDP and APC to pick candidates from the south next. But Atiku would have none of it. He came back on the scene and has now won the PDP ticket, in the process kicking against the power rotation he had vehemently stood for in 2011. \u201cThe PDP, of which I am a founding member, should focus on winning, not on zoning,\u201d he said in an interview. I recall arguing in 2010 that Atiku was only interested in actualising his lifelong ambition and not particularly keen on the rotation policy.\n\nBy now spitting on power rotation, Atiku has somehow vindicated my perception of him: that all he wants is power. He has participated in every presidential primary since 2007 \u2014 zoning or no zoning. The Atiku I know is not an ethnic champion or bigot, contrary to the impression he created in 2011 when he wanted the PDP ticket by any means necessary, even dangerously invoking John F. Kennedy\u2019s quote about \u201cthose who make peaceful change impossible make violent change inevitable\u201d. I testify that he is a broadminded Nigerian with friends and associates across every tribe and tongue, but he was so desperate for the ticket in 2011 he gleefully played the regional game.\n\nFinally, I want to be clear: I believe Atiku has every right to contest and has not broken any law by doing so. I also believe he is competent and has the experience to lead the country. However, he has proved not to be much of a statesman. His life-long ambition has the potential to upset Nigeria\u2019s fragile balance at a time there is so much discontent with the union. Moreover, there are equally competent and experienced southerners. Our nationhood is constantly under threat because of our fault lines and sensitivities. I worry deeply that we are threading this divisive path yet again. If he wins the presidential election, power could be in the north for 12, or even 16, years non-stop.\n\nIt is particularly worrisome because of the inevitable scenarios. Whatever the APC does at its presidential convention this week will come with challenges. One, if the ruling party goes ahead to field a southerner, our troubling fault lines may be magnified. It may be cast as North vs South, as we saw in previous elections in parts of the country with the attendant consequences that we are still having to live with. I am one of those who believe that regional tensions are a major distraction to Nigeria\u2019s development as sectional groups and ethnic champions continue to heat up the polity and make parts of the country ungovernable just to score a point. We can\u2019t progress like this.\n\nTwo, if the APC decides to go north so as to snuff out any potential advantage that fielding Atiku can confer on the PDP, that would even be more problematic. We are going to be left having to pick between six and half a dozen, or between and betwixt. The majority of southerners may be left with a feeling of being edged out of the game, and this can only further widen and deepen our fault lines and create a hostile polity for several years to come. It is glaring that there will always be consequences either direction APC faces: north or south. Unfortunately, when the deed has been done, it is the rest of us, who are neither APC nor PDP, that will have to live with the consequences.\n\nThere is a third scenario: if APC/PDP decide to field northerners, the possibility of a third force \u2014 which will unfortunately further divide us along regional lines \u2014 may be stronger than ever. A possible southern solidary forged with some northern states may upset the APC/PDP duopoly and redraw our electoral map. I am not saying it is a certainty, but we have eight months to the elections and there is enough time for planning, realignment and mobilisation of forces. There will be unpalatable dynamics as regional tensions will become well pronounced again. All these scenarios because the PDP, in a bid to help the northern aspirants, did not do the rational thing on zoning.\n\nAND FOUR OTHER THINGS\u2026\n\nTINUBU\u2019S OUTBURST\n\nAsiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu broke the internet on Thursday and Friday following his series of outbursts in Abeokuta, Ogun state, while addressing delegates to the APC presidential convention. The former governor of Lagos state, who is seeking his party\u2019s presidential ticket, outlined how he has been betrayed by the people he toiled for day and night to help get into positions of power. While I cannot judge him for feeling the way he does (I think every human being will feel bitter about betrayals), I am amazed that he said all that in a public place, on camera and at a time no candidate had been openly endorsed by President Buhari. I think Tinubu needs to be calming down. Tact.\n\nUNIFORMED KIDNAPPERS?\n\nSamuel Kanu Uche, the head of the Methodist Church Nigeria (MCN), is arguably the most prominent victim of kidnap-for-ransom in recent times. He was abducted by gunmen along the Enugu-Port Harcourt expressway in Umunneochi LGA of Abia state on Sunday. He said it took a N100 million ransom to get him and two other clerics freed. He made serious allegations against soldiers whom he said were involved in the dastardly crime. Although I flinched when he described them as \u201cFulani and non-Christians\u201d because it sounds like the profiling that has become the order of the day, the military authorities will do Nigerians a world of good by investigating this diligently. Creepy.\n\nDREAM KILLERS\n\nYou can never make up some things about this our country. D\u2019Tigress, our enterprising and inspirational female basketball team, fought tooth and nail to qualify for the 2022 International Basketball Federation (FIBA) Women\u2019s World Cup in Australia. We were still clinking glasses to celebrate the feat when the Nigerian government announced that we were withdrawing from international basketball for two years \u201cto revamp the sport from the grassroots\u201d. There is apparently a power tussle in the Nigeria Basketball Federation (NBBF) and the best way to resolve it is to slice off our nose to spite our face. We are killing the spirit of these athletes. What a country. Senseless.\n\nAND FINALLY\u2026\n\nMr Tanko Sabo, from Kaduna state, became an instant sensation on Wednesday when he disclosed that he had reinvested the money he made as a delegate in the welfare of his people. He did not reveal exactly how much he made but said he paid N6.9 million as WAEC and NECO fees for 150 orphans and the underprivileged, spent N3.2 million to buy 42 customised football jerseys for youths in his community, and another N350,000 to support elders, women and \u201cexecutive beggars\u201d. The economics of electioneering can be seen in the trickle-down effect in Sabo\u2019s case. It is like wealth redistribution, although we would be overstretching things by saying he is Robin Hood. Amusing.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Four rising sectors in African tech",
          "text": "The African tech ecosystem had its best year ever in 2021 when it raised $5.2 billion (per Partech data), and it was predicted by investment tracking platform, Africa: The Big Deal, that the continent is on its way to raising $7 billion in 2022. It is not a surprise that fintech dominated last year\u2019s total funding, accounting for 63% or $3 billion of the funding that went to African startups. This year, so far, African startups have raised $2.1 billion, according to data from TechCabal\u2019s funding tracker, with fintech still leading the way with $660 million.\n\nWhile it doesn\u2019t look like fintech\u2019s dominance will wane anytime soon in Africa, there are other sectors on the continent getting significant funding, and you should be paying attention to them.\n\n1. AI\n\nBefore this year, African startups struggled to be involved in the AI conversation. In 2020, when AI companies globally attracted $36 billion, AI companies on the continent could only raise $11.63 million. There were concerns that Africa would be left behind in the Fourth Industrial Revolution due to this slow pace in catching up with AI development, which threatens the future of Africans in an increasingly digital world. But one startup was all it took to bring Africa\u2019s AI industry to prominence. InstaDeep.\n\nCompany to watch: InstaDeep\n\nFounded in 2014 in the Tunisian city of Tataouine, InstaDeep\u2019s decision-making AI design allows it to boost productivity across a wide range of companies and industries. In the global AI race, dominated by the US and China, InstaDeep is the only African startup involved in shaping the evolution of the technology.\n\nIn January, it raised $100 million\u2014the only record funding into the African AI industry this year\u2014solidifying hopes that Africa can play on the global AI scene. It is being primed to take on massive projects such as creating an early-warning system for COVID-19 and a predictive railway timing system.\n\n2. Edtech\n\nAfter the pandemic disrupted education, the world turned to edtech solutions to continue learning in an efficient and effective way. While many edtech companies around the world benefited from this, as the industry attracted an influx of funding, African edtech companies struggled to tap into this opportunity. In 2021, when edtech globally raised $20 billion, African edtech companies raised less than $40 million. But Africa has an education crisis, which sees over 100 million children out of school across different educational levels on the continent. While there isn\u2019t a funding boom yet in edtech in Africa, there is a huge market here. There have been impressive efforts by African companies to solve the continent\u2019s educational problems.\n\nCompany to watch: Ulesson and FoondaMate\n\nUlesson\n\nNigerian startup, Ulesson was Africa\u2019s most funded edtech platform last year, raising $22.5 million across 2 funding rounds. Ulesson\u2019s work can be seen as pioneering for the edtech space; it brought Tencent and Owl Ventures, some of the world\u2019s biggest edtech investors, to the continent through its funding rounds.\n\nFoondaMate\n\nSouth African startup, FoondaMate teaches high school students using a WhatsApp bot that looks like 2 friends chit-chatting. Last month, FoondaMate raised $2 million to expand its unorthodox solution to more high school students in the country. WhatsApp is the most popular social media app in Africa, with 192 million users, as of 2018. In Foondamate\u2019s country of primary operation, South Africa, 95% of South Africans say they use their WhatsApp every month. FoondaMate told TechCabal that it has helped over 400,000 students cutting across more than 10 languages from over 30 countries, including Colombia, Mexico, Brazil, and Indonesia, targets 50 million users in the next few years and is willing to expand to achieve that.\n\n3. Cleantech\n\nSeventy-five percent of the world\u2019s population without access to electricity and renewable energy sources reside in Africa. Increased funding in clean energy by investors will help Africa fill this deficit. This has also made cleantech the closest industry to upsetting fintech this year, if the current momentum is maintained. The biggest funding ticket on the continent so far went to a cleantech company, making it the second most funded industry so far, this year.\n\nCompany to watch: Sun King\n\nSolar company, Sun King, raised $260 million in a Series D round to expand access to off-grid power to customers in Africa and Asia. It reported that it reached 18 million people in a decade of operations in Kenya, and is tripling its customers in Nigeria, Uganda, Zambia, and Tanzania. Sun King said it will use $100 million to expand its pay-as-you-go solution and allow users to power bigger home appliances in the markets it operates in.\n\n4. Agritech\n\nAfrica is facing its worst food crisis in 10 years, with 27 million people experiencing extreme hunger in Nigeria, Chad, Mali, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya; and there are fears that 11 million more could become hungry in 3 months if nothing is done. This food crisis is exacerbated by the high cost of food, recurring droughts, conflicts on the continent, and the Ukraine-Russia war. More than ever Africa needs to be food-sufficient because, for the most part, it has had to rely on humanitarian efforts to feed its citizens. So far, this year, African agritech companies have raised $115 million per TechCabal\u2019s funding tracker.\n\nCompany to watch: ThriveAgric\n\nFounded in 2017, ThriveAgric started as an agricultural technology startup that provided access to finance, premium markets, and data-driven advisory for smallholder farmers through financing received from crowdfunders. Then it joined Y Combinator and other notable accelerators, and it looked like it was going to be a happily-ever-after story. But things got bad in 2020 when it couldn\u2019t pay back its crowdfunders; apparently, the pandemic had affected its business model. It survived the turbulence through resilience, a characteristic that is admirable in solving hard problems, especially in Africa, and bounced back when it raised $56.4 million in debt financing to expand to Zambia, Kenya, and Ghana. Since ThriveAgric didn\u2019t go away in 2020, it seems it never will\u2014at least not without putting up a fight.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Founder of Babymigo speaks on reducing maternal deaths in Africa",
          "text": "Kemi is the co-founder of Babymigo, a Nigerian femtech startup founded in 2017 to expand access to quality information on pregnancy and parenthood. It works by providing a digital platform where expectant, pregnant, and nursing mothers can connect with their peers and experts as well as find local health and welfare services. Overall, it creates an inclusive support system for new and expecting parents to help make informed decisions during pregnancy and parenthood.\n\nTechCabal had a conversation with Kemi about Babymigo\u2019s background, challenges, motivation, and future plans.\n\nBabymigo website\n\nBabymigo\u2019s background\n\nHannatu Asheolge: How did the idea of Babymigo come about?\n\nKemi Olawoye: As a physiotherapist, I worked at a hospital where it was my job to lead antenatal classes, which included exercise. In my interactions with the pregnant women there, I discovered that a lot of them were misinformed on maternal health issues and were also subscribed to harmful cultural beliefs. When I met my co-founder, who also worked in the health sector, we decided to do something to combat this misinformation.\n\nHA: It\u2019s been 4 to 5 years since your company launched, and it has accomplished a lot. As CEO and co-founder, what have your key achievements been?\n\nKO: We\u2019ve seen a steady increase in the number of users since our launch. Now, we have up to 250,000 users on our platform, including pregnant women and new parents. We also raised our pre-seed in this period, which led to a lot of international partnerships and recognitions. Some notable ones include the Google Black Founders Fund and the GIST Initiative by the US Department of State.\n\nHA: What are some of your biggest challenges?\n\nKO: There are two major challenges we\u2019ve faced. The first one is human resources. Finding the right people who are committed to our vision of reducing maternal and child mortality rates was quite difficult, but I believe we\u2019ve managed to get past that. We now have built a team of passionate people.\n\nThe second challenge was more about an error in our initial plan. We didn\u2019t involve our users in our solutions, and this led to some dissonance between what we were working on and what our users actually needed us to work on.\n\nHA: What motivates you?\n\nKO: The statistics on child and mother mortality rates in Nigeria are my biggest motivation. Nigeria is currently one of the worst places in the world to have a child. Statistics show that 1 in 22 women that will get pregnant in Nigeria will most likely die from pregnancy-related complications due to misinformation and lack of adequate support.\n\nKemi Olawoye\n\nThe role of tech in improving maternal healthcare\n\nHA: How big of a role do you think tech can play in improving maternal health in Nigeria?\n\nKO: There\u2019s a growing number of people in Africa now with access to the internet. We can leverage this internet access to spread healthy information to them. Also, providing a community with millions of other moms is a great way to counter harmful cultural beliefs around pregnancy. It\u2019s easier to learn and believe something when there are millions of other women who are learning with you and confirming these beliefs.\n\nHA: What singular aspect of maternal healthcare in Nigeria do you think needs the most urgent intervention?\n\nKO: If I had to pick one, I\u2019d say addressing the inaccurate information on these cultural beliefs.\n\nHA: If you could describe the Nigerian femtech sector in one word, what would it be?\n\nKO: I\u2019d pick \u201cunderdeveloped\u201d.\n\nHA: What are the things you believe will accelerate the growth of the maternal health sector in Nigeria?\n\nKO: The first thing will be to identify policies and interventions that affect outcomes in terms of maternal and child health. The second thing will be restructuring or improving our current healthcare system. About 50% of Nigerians are already living below the average income level. This means that more than half of the female population cannot afford to pay for antenatal care in a regular hospital. The government needs to provide quality healthcare for free or at affordable rates for these women in order to lower the child and maternal mortality rates.\n\nHA: You\u2019ve mentioned quite a number of solutions. How do we incorporate technology into these solutions? How can tech help?\n\n\n\nKO: There can be digitising of some routine healthcare services. These can be in the form of online consultations or even digital classes which can go a long way. For a number of women, visiting a clinic is time-consuming and being able to reach a doctor online will go a long way to help women gain access to health services.\n\nNew services and future plans\n\nHA: Babymigo recently launched the Mamacare plan. Can you tell us more about that?\n\nKO: Mamacare is a maternity plan that allows mums to access antenatal child delivery and baby care services in about 120 multi-partner hospitals across Nigeria.\n\nHA: What are some of the things to expect from Babymigo in the next 5 years?\n\nKO: The plan is definitely to continue empowering more mums across Africa. In the next 3 years, we hope to provide healthcare services to 10 million mums across the African continent.\n\nWe\u2019re also looking at geographical expansion, as maternal health issues are not peculiar to Nigeria. We\u2019re looking at expanding to Ghana and Kenya within the next 5 years. Another thing we\u2019re looking at is expanding our services. We hope to be able to partner with telecom service providers to provide information via SMS for mums in rural areas who do not have access to the internet.\n\nShare this article",

Okorie, spokesperson for the delegates who addressed a press conference on Saturday, accused those involved in the repeat primaries as engaging in \u201cimpersonation of the authentic delegates,\u201d stating that the exercise was a \u201ccharade and a mockery of democracy\u201d.\n\nOkorie said that the first primaries was conducted in a peaceful atmosphere with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) monitoring the exercise with the presence of security agencies and the press.\n\n\u201cThe primaries were covered and beamed live Nationwide by AIT and Channels TV and was transparently conducted and we saw no reason for it\u2019s cancellation,\u201d Okorie added.\n\n\u201cIf they were people who had complaints about the outcome of the primaries, they should have gone to court to challenge the outcome as provided for in the Electoral Act of 2022\u201d.\n\n\u201cFor the party to unilaterally annul a primary election which was properly conducted is an act of impunity and an affront on our democratic rights as elected delegates\u201d.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari, on, Saturday night met with all the aspirants for President on the platform of All Progressives Congress (APC), at State House, Abuja, urging them to hold consultations, and come up with a formidable candidate before the party holds its primary election between June 6-8, 2022.\n\nThe President said the meeting was a continuation of the on-going consultative process aimed at ensuring a smooth and strategic emergence of a standard bearer, who will lead the APC to a resounding victory in the upcoming presidential polls.\n\n\u201cLooking at this assemblage of personalities and considering your rich pedigree of accomplishments in life, I have come to the conclusion that our party, the APC, is rich in human resources and also that our nation is blessed with capable people that can successfully steer the ship of state into the future,\u201d President Buhari said.\n\nThe president, according to a statement from Femi Adesina, his spokesperson, added that with his first-hand knowledge of the demands of the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the expectations of the citizens, \u201cI must salute your courage and your selfless spirit, in volunteering to serve in the highest office of the land.\u201d\n\nThe President added: \u201cOur party, the APC, has won two successive presidential elections in 2015, first when we were in the opposition and in 2019 when I sought re-election. Both processes were achieved through unity of purpose, strategic alignment, consultation, fairness, determination and effective leadership. In both instances, national and party interests were overriding factors in our deliberations and decision-making.\n\n\u201cThe 2023 General Elections are fast approaching in a global, regional and national environment that is constantly changing and challenging. This demands that our party should become more aware of the changing environment, be responsive to the yearnings of our citizens, re-evaluate our strategy and strengthen our internal mechanism so that we would sustain the electoral successes.\n\n\u201cI am pleased to note that the party, recognizing the significance of all these demands, has over time developed several democratically acceptable processes and policies, that promote consultation, internal cohesion and leadership to facilitate victories at the polls.\u201d\n\nThe President recalled the consultation he had held with stakeholders \u201cthat would help the electoral fortunes of our party, beginning with the State Governors. This is the second in the series and I still look forward to meeting with party stakeholders. These steps are being taken to ensure that the unity and cohesion of the party are sustained and to provide direction.\n\n\u201cAmongst others things, I reminded the APC Governors of the need for the party to proceed to the 2023 Presidential elections with strength, unity of purpose and to present a flag bearer who will give Nigerians a sense of hope and confidence, while ensuring victory for our party. I extend a similar reminder to all of you distinguished aspirants.\u201d\n\nSaying the APC will on Monday June 6, 2022 commence its national convention during which one candidate will be picked by delegates to fly the flag of the party for the 2023 Presidential Election, President Buhari said he was aware that there is anxiety among party members about the outcome of the process.\n\n\u201cGiven these circumstances, I charge you to recognize the importance of the stability and unity of the party, which cannot be overemphasized.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, I wish to remind you that our choice of flag bearer must be formidable, appealing to the electorate across the board and should command such ability to unify the country and capacity to address our critical challenges.\n\n\u201cAhead of the Convention, the party machinery has screened and found all aspirants eminently qualified. Recognizing this fact, the Screening Committee has, amongst others, recommended that consensus building through consultation, be intensified.\n\n\u201cWithout prejudice to your qualifications, I urge all of you to hold consultations amongst yourselves and with the party, with a view to building a consensus in a manner that would help the party reduce the number of aspirants, bring up a formidable candidate and scale down the anxiety of party members.\u201d\n\nThe President assured that in the interest of the nation and the party, he would continue to provide effective leadership during the transition processes and on-going consultations, \u201cuntil we successfully make the choice on the candidate that will fly the flag of our party for the presidential elections and make the party stronger. I seek your support in this all important responsibility.\u201d\n\nEarlier, National Chairman of the party, Senator Abdullahi Adamu had promised that all stakeholders of the party would be reached in the consultation process.\n\nResponding on behalf of the aspirants, former Governor of old Abia State and immediate past Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, Dr Ogbonnaya Onu, Governor Abubakar Badaru of Jigawa State, and Vice President, \u2018Yemi Osinbajo, thanked the President for his leadership and guidance, pledging that they would hold the consultations as counseled \u201cfor the unity and strength of our party, the APC.\u201d",

          "title": "Primaries: SERAP, 185 Nigerians sue INEC over failure to extend voter registration",
          "text": "The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) and 185 concerned Nigerians have filed a lawsuit against the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), asking the court to declare unconstitutional, illegal, and incompatible with international standards the failure of the electoral body to extend the deadline for voter registration to allow eligible Nigerians to exercise their rights.\n\nAgainst its earlier stance, INEC recently extended the deadline for the conduct of primaries by political parties by six days, from June 3 to June 9.\n\nBut the commission has failed to also extend the online pre-registration which ended May 30 2022 and the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) ending 30 June 2022.\n\nIn the suit number FHC/L/CS/1034/2022 filed last Friday at the Federal High Court, Lagos, SERAP is asking the court to determine \u201cwhether the failure of INEC to extend the deadline for voter registration is not a violation of Nigerian Constitution, 1999 [as amended], the Electoral Act, and international standards.\u201d\n\nSERAP is asking the court for \u201ca declaration that the failure of INEC to extend the deadline for voter registration is a violation of eligible Nigerians\u2019 rights to participate freely in their own government, equality and equal protection.\u201d\n\nSERAP is also asking the court for \u201can order of mandamus to direct and compel INEC to extend voter registration by a minimum of three months and take effective measures to ensure that eligible Nigerians are able to register to exercise their right to vote in the 2023 general elections.\u201d\n\nIn the suit, SERAP is arguing that: \u201cEnforcing unrealistic voter registration deadline while extending the deadline for party primaries would deny and abridge the constitutional and international human rights of eligible voters.\u201d\n\nSERAP is also arguing that, \u201cINEC mandates ought to be exercised in a fair, just and non-discriminatory manner. The extension of voter registration would ensure that Nigerian voters are treated equally and fairly. The future of Nigeria\u2019s democracy depends on it.\u201d\n\nSERAP is arguing that, \u201cVoters are also critical stakeholders in the electoral process. Treating all eligible Nigerian voters fairly would advance the people\u2019s right to vote and to participate in their own government.\u201d\n\nAccording to SERAP, \u201cINEC must not only be independent and impartial in the exercise of its constitutional and statutory responsibilities, but must also be seen to be independent and impartial.\u201d\n\nSERAP is also asking the court for \u201can order restraining INEC, its agents, privies, assigns, or any other person(s) claiming through it from discontinuing the continuous voters\u2019 registration exercise from the 30th June 2022 or any other date pending the hearing and determination of this suit.\u201d\n\nThe suit filed on behalf of SERAP by its lawyers Kolawole Oluwadare and Opeyemi Owolabi, read in part: \u201cExtending the voter registration exercise would also bolster voter confidence in the electoral process.\n\n\u201cOne of the people\u2019s most sacred rights is the right to vote. The commission has a constitutional and statutory responsibility to ensure the effective exercise of the right of all eligible voters to participate in their own government.\n\n\u201cExtending the deadline for party primaries without providing adequate time and opportunity for eligible voters to register and participate in the 2023 general elections would amount to an unfair and discriminatory treatment of Nigerian voters, and violate other human rights.\n\n\u201cExtending the voter registration deadline would provide more time for eligible voters, including young people, the elderly, people living with disability, as well as those resident in states facing security challenges and living in IDP camps to participate in the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cExtending the deadline for voter registration would be entirely consistent with constitutional and international standards, and the Electoral Act. Any such extension would also not impact negatively on INEC\u2019s election calendar and activities.\n\n\u201cThe public perception of the independence and impartiality of INEC is essential for building public confidence in the electoral process, and ensuring the credibility and legitimacy of the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cWhere Nigerians have doubts about the independence and impartiality of INEC, they are more likely to have less confidence in the electoral process thereby undermining democracy.\n\n\u201cExtending the deadline for voter registration would also be justified, given reports of challenges in the voter registration exercise, especially for young people, the elderly, persons living with disabilities, and those resident in states facing security challenges and living in internally displaced persons (IDP) camps.\n\n\u201cThe will of the people is expressed through democratic elections. This requires that people should be afforded adequate time and opportunity to register to vote. Extending the voter registration deadline is crucial for promoting the independence and impartiality of INEC and building public confidence in the electoral process.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Constitution 1999 (as amended) provides in Section 14(1)(c) that, \u2018the participation by the people in their government shall be ensured in accordance with the provisions of this Constitution.\u2019\n\n\u201cSection 9(6) of the Electoral Act 2022 provides that \u2018the registration of voters, updating and revision of the Register of Voters under this section shall not stop not later than 90 days before any election covered by this Act.\u2019\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights, and the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance guarantee the right to political participation.\n\n\u201cThese human rights treaties also require states parties including Nigeria to ensure the independence and impartiality of national electoral bodies responsible for the management of elections, as well as to promote the establishment of the necessary conditions to foster citizen participation.\n\n\u201cThe right of people to participate in their government is a fundamental feature of any democratic society, and any undue restriction of the right would strike at the heart of representative government.\u201d\n\nNo date has been fixed for the hearing of the suit.",

          "text": "A regional group, Northern Interests Coalition, has faulted the 10 Northern governors of the All Progressives Congress (APC) who threw their weight behind power returning to the South in 2023.\n\nThe APC Northern Governors Forum had backed the South to produce the next president of Nigeria at a meeting on Saturday.\n\nMembers of the NGF include Governors Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna state, Sule Abdullahi of Nasarawa State, Babagana Zulum of Borno, Masari of Katsina, Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano, Solomon Lalong of Plateau, Abubakar Bello of Niger, Muhammad Inuwa of Gombe, Bello Matawalle of Zamfara, Abubakar Bagudu of Kebbi and former Governor of Sokoto, Aliyu Wamako.\n\nChairman of the Northern Interests Coalition, Malam Umar Gazali, declared that people in the North have rejected the decision of the governors for betraying the north.\n\nIn a statement issued on Saturday, Gazali accused the governors of conspiring against the North for their selfish interests.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt has come to our notice the desperate activities of some Northern governors who, because of their selfish interests to emerge as Vice President, have decided to pressure President Muhammadu Buhari to endorse a Southern presidential candidate for the APC. This is a direct assault against Northern interests and these governors must be stopped fast.\n\n\u201cAfter power has been in the South that produced president for 14 years and Vice President for 11 years which is cumulatively 25 years. It is not only unjust but also unjustifiable that our governors will be conspiring against the North to lose power after only 8 years of the Buhari presidency.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the governors have ganged up to pressure the president, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to endorse their self-centred agenda.\n\nWhile disclosing that the North disowns their bad intentions, he vowed the coalition and its supporters across the region shall resist them.\n\n\u201cThe only thing is that we advise the governors allegedly involved in this evil plot to desist immediately. The president must not only ignore them but refuse to be confused by these betrayers of the North.\n\n\u201cThe eleven Northern Governors have betrayed the North for their selfish interests. We condemn their actions in the strongest possible terms and once again we urge the president to ignore them completely.\n\n\u201cThis is not a mere allegation. The statement made by these eleven betrayers of Northern interests in this respect is in the public domain as released and signed by them today recommending to the president that the search for his successor be limited to the South.

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari Saturday night met with all the aspirants for President on the platform of All Progressives Congress, at State House, Abuja, urging them to hold consultations, and come up with a formidable candidate before the party holds its primary election between June 6-8, 2022.\n\nThe President said the meeting was a continuation of the on-going consultative process aimed at ensuring a smooth and strategic emergence of a standard bearer, who will lead the APC to a resounding victory in the upcoming presidential polls.\n\n\u201cLooking at this assemblage of personalities and considering your rich pedigree of accomplishments in life, I have come to the conclusion that our party, the APC, is rich in human resources and also that our nation is blessed with capable people that can successfully steer the ship of state into the future,\u201d President Buhari said.\n\nHe added that with his first-hand knowledge of the demands of the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the expectations of the citizens, \u201cI must salute your courage and your selfless spirit, in volunteering to serve in the highest office of the land.\u201d\n\nThe President added: \u201cOur party, the APC, has won two successive presidential elections in 2015, first when we were in the opposition and in 2019 when I sought re-election. Both processes were achieved through unity of purpose, strategic alignment, consultation, fairness, determination and effective leadership. In both instances, national and party interests were overriding factors in our deliberations and decision-making.\n\n\u201cThe 2023 General Elections are fast approaching in a global, regional and national environment that is constantly changing and challenging. This demands that our party should become more aware of the changing environment, be responsive to the yearnings of our citizens, re-evaluate our strategy and strengthen our internal mechanism so that we would sustain the electoral successes.\n\n\u201cI am pleased to note that the party, recognizing the significance of all these demands, has over time developed several democratically acceptable processes and policies, that promote consultation, internal cohesion and leadership to facilitate victories at the polls.\u201d\n\nThe President recalled the consultation he had held with stakeholders \u201cthat would help the electoral fortunes of our party, beginning with the State Governors. This is the second in the series and I still look forward to meeting with party stakeholders. These steps are being taken to ensure that the unity and cohesion of the party are sustained and to provide direction.\n\n\u201cAmongst others things, I reminded the APC Governors of the need for the party to proceed to the 2023 Presidential elections with strength, unity of purpose and to present a flag bearer who will give Nigerians a sense of hope and confidence, while ensuring victory for our party. I extend a similar reminder to all of you distinguished aspirants.\u201d\n\nSaying the APC will on Monday June 6, 2022 commence its national convention during which one candidate will be picked by delegates to fly the flag of the party for the 2023 Presidential Election, President Buhari said he was aware that there is anxiety among party members about the outcome of the process.\n\n\u201cGiven these circumstances, I charge you to recognize the importance of the stability and unity of the party, which cannot be overemphasized.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, I wish to remind you that our choice of flag bearer must be formidable, appealing to the electorate across the board and should command such ability to unify the country and capacity to address our critical challenges.\n\n\u201cAhead of the Convention, the party machinery has screened and found all aspirants eminently qualified. Recognizing this fact, the Screening Committee has, amongst others, recommended that consensus building through consultation, be intensified.\n\n\u201cWithout prejudice to your qualifications, I urge all of you to hold consultations amongst yourselves and with the party, with a view to building a consensus in a manner that would help the party reduce the number of aspirants, bring up a formidable candidate and scale down the anxiety of party members.\u201d\n\nThe President assured that in the interest of the nation and the party, he would continue to provide effective leadership during the transition processes and on-going consultations, \u201cuntil we successfully make the choice on the candidate that will fly the flag of our party for the presidential elections and make the party stronger. I seek your support in this all important responsibility.\u201d\n\nEarlier, National Chairman of the party, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, had promised that all stakeholders of the party would be reached in the consultation process.\n\nResponding on behalf of the aspirants, former Governor of old Abia State and immediate past Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, Dr Ogbonnaya Onu, Governor Abubakar Badaru of Jigawa State, and Vice President, \u2018Yemi Osinbajo, thanked the President for his leadership and guidance, pledging that they would hold the consultations as counseled \u201cfor the unity and strength of our party, the APC.\u201d\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

Besides, our company also focuses on hybrid rice research.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the event was to draw the attention of government and farmers to the successes the company has recorded in its Rice research with GAWAL R1 exchange ideas and take the opportunity to boost food security in Nigeria.\n\nOn its research activities he noted that the company is expanding.\n\n\u201cThis year our company established four trial locations across Nigeria for the experiment and comparison of three elite rice varieties, which are Faro 44, GAWAL R1 and Mayun 1(hybrid rice variety), with one location in Abuja. Based on our yield measurement of 66 m2 for each variety in Abuja, the calculated yields per hectare of Faro 44, GAWAL R1 and Mayun 1 are 5.6 mt, 7.0 mt and 8.7 mt respectively with the transplanting method. GAWAL R1\u2019s yield is 25% higher than that of Faro 44 and Mayun 1 is 55% higher than Faro 44\u201d.\n\nHe said the company was also looking at the establishment of rice extension system and improvement of rice research system in collaboration with the agriculture research institutes such as National Cereal Research Institute (NCRI), National Agricultural Seeds Council (NASC), IITA, Bwari Area Council and agricultural research and extension services in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe are aiming to introduce and register many more good quality and high-yield new rice varieties to Nigerian rice farmers\u201d, he said.\n\nHe said that apart from the traditional rice transplanting technique, the company has also been promoting the new technique of broadcasting rice production for large and small-scale farming and the result shows that the rice yield is relatively high as well.\n\nHe said the company was a professional seed company that not only sold seed but taught farmers advanced planting techniques for optimum yield.",

          "text": "Nigeria is hosting the maiden edition of the \u2018Nigeria-Africa Natural Resources and Energy Investment Summit\u2019, a three-day Summit with the theme \u2018Towards a Greener Africa\u2019, in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nSpeaking in his keynote address at the event, President Muhammadu Buhari represented by the Hon. Minister of mine and steel Arc Olamilekan Adegbite on Wednesday said Africa needs to join the rest of the world\u2019s shift from fossil fuel to renewable energy sources.\n\nArc Olamilekan Adegbite, pointed that Africa requires a huge amount of energy generation to drive its development.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s convention is indeed important. Africa requires a huge amount of energy generation to drive its development, even as the world shifts away from fossil fuel to clean and renewable energy sources, in the fight against climate change. In the midst of this energy transition lies many challenges and opportunities for a continent yearning for development.\n\n\u201cI believe this should spur us as a continent of diverse people to co-operate and collaborate more, initiate innovative solutions to the challenges that are peculiar to us, come up with technologies and products that will lead to the growth and industrialization of Africa in a more environment friendly manner while encouraging the development and financing of green energy projects.\n\n\u201cOur meeting today provides the opportunity to share views on natural resources and energy market developments. Additionally, the morning session will focus on Maximizing Mineral Potentials and Attracting Private Investments. Our esteemed speakers will discuss the opportunities within the Nigerian Mining Sector, the underexplored minerals which are key to clean renewable energy, the success stories and the strides towards driving Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into the Sector.\n\n\u201cParticipating countries in the Declaration of Cooperation would strengthen their cooperation, through joint assessment and viewpoints, with the aim to financing sustainable African Natural Resources and Energy Projects that are key to the transition, for the benefit of producers and consumers and to regularly review at technical and ministerial levels the status of our cooperation,\u201d he noted.\n\nOn policies and framework, Buhari stated that, \u201cOur joint meetings and activities will support us in formulating favorable policy and strategy development for the natural resource sector as the world looks towards a greener future. A policy that is less subject to extremes, both today and in the future.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Group Managing Director, African Industries Group, Alok Gupta, who was represented by Partha Ghosh spoke on opportunities on Nigeria\u2019s mining sector. African Natural Resources and Mines Limited, ANRML, is a group company of the African Industries Group.\n\n\u201cNigeria is heavily endowed with solid minerals with 44 minerals found in over 500 locations including all 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, have more than one mineral type which indeed is a rare occurrence.\n\n\u201cWith the view of maximizing these opportunities, to create wealth, grow the GDP and expand opportunities available to Nigerians. The mining sector is the backbone of industrialization of the economy.\n\n\u201cHe also pointed various incentives rolled out n the Buhari-led administration to promote ease of doing business in the sector.\n\n\u201cThe mining implementation and stability is strategically focusing on steel. Nigeria has the 12th largest steel deposits in the world with more than 3 billion tonnes resources in Kogi, Enugu, Zamfara and Kaduna States.\n\n\u201cAnnually $3.3 billion is still spent on steel imports which impact the economy.

          "title": "Nigeria Committed to Energy Transition, Reducing Gas Emission \u2013 Silva",
          "text": "Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, HE Chief Timipre Sylva has disclosed that Nigeria made a strong commitment to embracing energy transition while pledging to significantly reduce its greenhouse gas emissions under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.\n\nThe Minister stated this yesterday at the Nigeria-Africa natural resource and energy summit in Abuja\n\nHe said that that was in addition to the commitment Nigeria made through President Muhammadu Buhari, at COP 26 in 2021 to attain carbon net-zero by 2060.\n\nSylva who explained that Nigeria is following a transition pathway that combines technology, investment, business strategies, and government policy that will enable Nigeria to transit from its current energy system to a low-carbon energy system with natural gas playing a pivotal role, added that the country needs affordable, reliable and sustainable energy resources to eradicate the prevalent energy poverty in the shortest time possible, and propel economic growth.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe only viable option currently on the table is natural gas, considering vast proven gas endowments, put at 209 TCF, with 600 TCF potential reserves. We cannot ignore this resource, especially when energy poverty is viciously starring at us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe goal of Nigeria\u2019s gas policy is to ensure that gas development is undertaken in accordance with our socio-economic development priorities. The aim is to guarantee long-term energy security in the country, and boost the domestic gas market, hence the declaration of 2021-to-2030 as the \u2018Decade of Gas\u2019 by Mr. President. We have embarked on a critical pathway to ensuring that our abundant Natural gas resources are marshalled to engender domestic economic growth and development.\u201d\n\nHe also said that the Ministry of Petroleum Resources has launched the National Gas Expansion Programme NGEP as part of the National Gas Policy to expand Nigeria\u2019s Domestic gas utilization; the National Gas Flare Commercialization Programme; as well as specific provisions in the new Petroleum Industry Act PIA that elevates LPG as the fuel of choice compared to other competing fuels and the usage of solar energy is already being vigorously promoted across the country, while the use of hydro, wind and other natural resources are also being expanded.\n\nThe Minister who lauded the theme of the Summit \u2018Towards a Greener Africa\u2019 observed that it is very apt and timely at this challenging time in the energy industry globally. However, he explained that at the core of this challenge is the issue of climate change that is eliciting clamour for transition to greener energy sources to reduce carbon emission.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative that every nation and region comes up with a green initiative to foster a collective combat against the incessant threat to the planet caused by CO2 emission. Such initiatives must be bold, decisive and on target.\n\n\u201cIt should however be borne in mind that such initiatives should reflect the realities and conditions prevailing in these places, particularly the socio-economic development and energy needs.\n\n\u201cThe key consideration in every country\u2019s energy policy should be pivoted on energy security. This constitutes a very high priority goal for nations all over the globe. The reason is not far-fetched: Energy propels economic growth.\n\n\u201cThat makes energy security synonymous with optimum and sustainable economic growth. Energy is an indispensable ingredient for human development and socio-economic prosperity. It is central to jobs creation, security, health, and other challenges facing humans.\n\n\u201cThis is why access to energy is prominently addressed in the UN Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development Goals. In particular, SDG 7 focuses on access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all, as a fundamental right.\n\nHe said that as at today, energy poverty is still much prevalent in the world, especially in Africa where millions of people still do not have access to electricity or clean cooking fuels.\n\nBased on the UN data, about 760 million people lack access to electricity worldwide, with three out of four of them living in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nFurthermore, one-third of the world\u2019s population \u2013 about 2.6 billion people \u2013 have no access to clean cooking fuels, with over 900 million of these in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nOn the average, only 48% of sub-Saharan Africa population have access to electricity, while only 18% have access to clean cooking fuels, compared with a global average of 90% and 70%, respectively.\n\nIn relation to CO2 emission, World Bank statistics shows that the world average of CO2 emissions was 4.48 metric tons per capita in 2018, with some regions and individual countries recording five to seven times this value. Emission by sub-Saharan Africa in total was only 0.76 metric tons per capita.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe implication of the above is that the issues surrounding energy poverty, climate and sustainable development are not mutually exclusive. Consequently, the approaches to attending to these issues should not be disconnected.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Sylva admitted that climate change is definitely of serious concern to Africa. But of equal concern is the alarming level of energy poverty. Both must be addressed in a sustainable manner. It must be a win-win situation.\n\nEnergy transition is about providing clean energy, and not about discriminating between energy sources. In the face of the current high level of energy poverty worldwide, especially in Africa, all energy sources will be required to achieve the sustainable development goal of providing access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.",

Recognizing this fact, the Screening Committee has, amongst others, recommended that consensus building through consultation, be intensified.\n\n\u201cWithout prejudice to your qualifications, I urge all of you to hold consultations amongst yourselves and with the party, with a view to building a consensus in a manner that would help the party reduce the number of aspirants, bring up a formidable candidate and scale down the anxiety of party members.\u201d\n\nThe meeting was held behind closed-doors.\n\nFocus on victory\n\nThe President said the meeting was a continuation of the on-going consultative process aimed at ensuring a smooth and strategic emergence of a standard bearer, who will lead the APC to a resounding victory in the upcoming presidential polls.\n\n\u201cLooking at this assemblage of personalities and considering your rich pedigree of accomplishments in life, I have come to the conclusion that our party, the APC, is rich in human resources and also that our nation is blessed with capable people that can successfully steer the ship of state into the future,\u201d President Buhari said.\n\nHe added that with his first-hand knowledge of the demands of the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the expectations of the citizens, \u201cI must salute your courage and your selfless spirit, in volunteering to serve in the highest office of the land.\u201d\n\nThe President added: \u201cOur party, the APC, has won two successive presidential elections in 2015, first when we were in the opposition and in 2019 when I sought re-election. Both processes were achieved through unity of purpose, strategic alignment, consultation, fairness, determination and effective leadership. In both instances, national and party interests were overriding factors in our deliberations and decision-making.\n\n\u201cThe 2023 General Elections are fast approaching in a global, regional and national environment that is constantly changing and challenging. This demands that our party should become more aware of the changing environment, be responsive to the yearnings of our citizens, re-evaluate our strategy and strengthen our internal mechanism so that we would sustain the electoral successes.\n\n\u201cI am pleased to note that the party, recognizing the significance of all these demands, has over time developed several democratically acceptable processes and policies, that promote consultation, internal cohesion and leadership to facilitate victories at the polls.\u201d\n\nThe President recalled the consultation he had held with stakeholders \u201cthat would help the electoral fortunes of our party, beginning with the State Governors. This is the second in the series and I still look forward to meeting with party stakeholders. These steps are being taken to ensure that the unity and cohesion of the party are sustained and to provide direction.\n\n\u201cAmongst others things, I reminded the APC Governors of the need for the party to proceed to the 2023 Presidential elections with strength, unity of purpose and to present a flag bearer who will give Nigerians a sense of hope and confidence, while ensuring victory for our party. I extend a similar reminder to all of you distinguished aspirants.\u201d\n\nSaying the APC will on Monday June 6, 2022 commence its national convention during which one candidate will be picked by delegates to fly the flag of the party for the 2023 Presidential Election, President Buhari said he was aware that there is anxiety among party members about the outcome of the process.\n\n\u201cGiven these circumstances, I charge you to recognize the importance of the stability and unity of the party, which cannot be overemphasized,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President assured that in the interest of the nation and the party, he would continue to provide effective leadership during the transition processes and on-going consultations, \u201cuntil we successfully make the choice on the candidate that will fly the flag of our party for the presidential elections and make the party stronger. I seek your support in this all important responsibility.\u201d\n\nEarlier, National Chairman of the party, Senator Abdullahi Adamu had promised that all stakeholders of the party would be reached in the consultation process.\n\nResponding on behalf of the aspirants, former Governor of old Abia State and immediate past Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, Dr Ogbonnaya Onu, Governor Abubakar Badaru of Jigawa State, and Vice President, \u2018Yemi Osinbajo, thanked the President for his leadership and guidance, pledging that they would hold the consultations as counseled \u201cfor the unity and strength of our party, the APC.\u201d",

          "text": "The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has disclosed that the ballot papers for the 2023 elections would be printed locally because it has more than 180 days before the 2023 general election.\n\nThe electoral umpire has also confirmed that it would not keep sensitive electoral materials for the upcoming Ekiti State governorship election with the apex bank.\n\nChairman of INEC, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, stated these in Abuja while responding to questions at a dialogue on elections.\n\nHe further said that the ballot papers for the 2023 elections would be printed locally because it has much time more than 180 days before the 2023 general election.\n\nYakubu said that the ballot papers were printed outside Nigeria in the past elections because of the exigencies of time.\n\nHe disclosed because of the availability of time, the materials for the future elections would be printed locally.\n\nAccording to him, this decision is to guarantee that electoral materials for the lined-up elections are not compromised.\n\nFollowing the revelation that the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr Godwin Emefiele is a card-carrying member of the All Progressives Congress (APC), concerns had been raised about the sanctity of elections materials kept with the apex bank.\n\nBut Yakubu said: \u201cLogistics in an election is much wider than the movement of sensitive material for the election. Take the case of Ekiti for instance, all non-sensitive materials have been delivered to Ado-Ekiti and they are in all the LGAs of the state.\n\n\u201cBut sensitive materials are usually delivered on behalf of the commission by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), which are inspected in the presence of the bank and then moved out by our officials.\n\n\u201cI want to say that since INEC started this collaboration with the CBN, we have never experienced a single issue with the movement of materials. The agency has been such a good partner to the commission.\n\nAccording to the INEC chairman\u2019 chairman, \u201cbut we appreciate the current circumstances, and it is for that reason, pending the time we find an alternative, the materials for the Ekiti election will not be routed through the CBN.\n\n\u201cWe will move the material to the airport in Akure and move the material to our office in Ado Ekiti and do the distribution from there. We are not going to use CBN. And when it comes to the general election, we have to look for an alternative way of doing it.\u201d, the INEC chairman stated.\n\nINEC Gives EFCC Accounts Details of APC, PDP\n\nThe INEC chairman also disclosed that the electoral body has given the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) the accounts details of the APC and the PDP.\n\nOn the continuous voter registration, the INEC chairman said that it is only the online registration of voters that was suspended as the transfer and physical registration are still ongoing.\n\nThe INEC chairman acknowledged the receipt of the letter from the EFCC to the commission and stated that it has replied to the anti-graft letter and provided all the information needed.\n\nEFCC had in a letter under sections 38(1) and (2) of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (Establishment) Act, 2004, demanded access to the accounts of the two leading political parties.\n\nThe EFCC in another letter, also signed by the Head of Operations, informed the managing directors of Access Bank and Polaris Bank in Abuja that it was investigating 14 accounts of the two dominant parties.\n\nINEC said that apart from submitting to the EFCC all it required, accounts of political parties are usually audited six months after the general election\n\nINEC Detects 47,633 Voters\u2019 Double Registration in Ekiti\n\nMeanwhile, as Ekiti State prepares for its June 18 governorship election, INEC has stated that it detected 47,633 voters\u2019 double registration on its portal.\n\nThe commission averred that such people have had their registration invalidated to prevent double-voting during the election, with the aid of the Bimodal Voter Authentication System (BVAS) invented by INEC to sanitise its registers.\n\nThe INEC\u2019s Head of Department, Information and Communication Technology, Titilayo Oderinde, made the revelation in Ado Ekiti Saturday during a one-day training workshop organised for Ekiti journalists in preparation for the impending governorship poll.\n\nOderinde, who elucidated on the BVAS application and its significance to the credibility of elections, said no individual can exercise double franchise during the election with the help of the ICT innovation.\n\nHe said: \u201cDuring the just-concluded Continuous Voter Registration exercise declared by INEC for intending voters to update their registration, a total of 124,963 persons registered in Ekiti.\n\n\u201cBut it will marvel you that when the number was subjected to BVAS scrutiny, a total of 47,633 were discovered to have registered twice and got expunged from the register.\n\n\u201cThough, the commission was so lenient that one of the double registrations was struck out leaving one for the voter to exercise his franchise. It does not apply to a gender, the offence was committed by both genders.\n\n\u201cBut I see no reason why people should be doing this when they can approach the commission for migration of their polling units, even if they leave their environment for another location.\u201d\n\nAlso addressing the participants, the Resident Electoral Commissioner, Ekiti State, Dr Adeniran Tella, appealed to voters not to treat their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) as instruments for mere identification, saying they are to be deployed to vote on election day.\n\n\u201cPVCs are not designed as an identification card, it is for voting. We want to do away with this voter apathy and we are starting with the Ekiti election. I salute our women for participating well in registration. 71 per cent of them had also collected their PVCs.\n\n\u201cWe are assuring the People Living with Disabilities that their interests will be protected by the commission. They are Nigerians with inalienable rights to vote and we shall provide enabling environment for them to vote in this election, we have made adequate provision for them,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe INEC\u2019s National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Mr Festus Okoye, added that part of the constitutional frameworks designed for the success of any election, is freedom of the press, warning that this shouldn\u2019t be abused to prevent violence during the election.\n\nCommission to Deploy 10,269 Personnel for Ekiti Guber Poll\n\nIn a related development, INEC has said that it is making plans to deploy a total of 10,269 personnel for the conduct of the Ekiti State governorship election.\n\nSpeaking at the INEC- Civil Society dialogue session on the Ekiti State Governorship Election organised by the Civil Society Situation Coalition, the Resident Electoral Commissioner for Ekiti State, Mr. Adeniran Tella said that preparations for the exercise is proceeding smoothly.\n\nAt the event held on Saturday in Abuja, Tella said that adequate arrangements are being made for logistics and election security, taking into consideration the challenges of the past.\n\nOn the engagement of personnel including the Adhoc staff, the REC said that members of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) has been put through training on the rudiments of the new BVAS technology being deployed by the commission for the election.\n\nChuks Okocha Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja and Victor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti",

It was gathered that three persons were shot during the violence.\n\nThe victim allegedly sought refuge at the office of the local vigilance group but could not be saved from the wrath of the attackers, who outnumbered the security outfit before handing summary punishment to their victim said to be 30 years old.\n\nWhen THISDAY visited the scene of the incident, thick smoke from firewood and burnt tyres enveloped the spot where he was set ablaze.\n\nThe incident forced many traders at the Tipper Garage to hurriedly lock their shops for fear that the hoodlums would capitalise on the violence to burn and loot shops as was the case recently during the riot at Dei-Dei International Market.\n\nIn a statement, Saturday, signed by Police Public Relations Officer, FCT Police Command, DSP Josephine Adeh, the deceased was said to have got into an argument with a Cleric whose identity was yet unknown.\n\nThe police said the heated argument degenerated into an outbreak of violence that led to the murder and setting ablaze of Ahmad Usman by the enraged mob mobilised numbering about 200, who were mobilised by the cleric.\n\nThe police spokesperson said that upon the receipt of the information, a quick intervention team comprising of the Surveillance and Ambush team of the Command attached to the Lugbe Divisional Police Headquarters was drafted to the scene where the enflamed victim was rescued suffering severe degrees of burn and taken immediately to the hospital where he was confirmed dead by a doctor on call.\n\n\u201cNormalcy has since been restored to the situation, while monitoring and surveillance of the area continues. Residents are therefore urged to go about their lawful duties without fear or apprehension of any kind from any quarters as the discrete investigation continues to unravel facts surrounding the ugly incident and to effect the arrest of the perpetrators therein.\n\n\u201cThe Commissioner of Police CP Babaji Sunday while warning against the indiscriminate act of self-help in obtaining justice known as jungle justice, stated that adequate sanctions will be meted on subscribers of this crude and dastardly act,\u201d Adeh explained.\n\nOlawale Ajimotokan in Abuja",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government has suspended plans to raise about $950 million in overseas bonds, as a result of unfavourable market conditions during the timeframe approved for the fundraising, the Minister of Finance, Budget, and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed has said.\n\nIt also responded to the forecast by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that the country could be spending 100 per cent of its revenues on debt servicing by 2026, saying the prediction was based on wrong parameters.\n\nThis is as the Debt Management Office (DMO) has listed two new Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) savings bonds for subscription at N1,000 per unit.\n\nAhmed had in April disclosed that Nigeria planned to sell in May its second external debt this year to help plug fiscal deficits. The planned $950 million bond sale would account for the balance of $6.1 billion in overseas borrowings planned for 2021 after it raised the second tranche of $1.25 billion in March.\n\nHowever, the minister, who spoke on the sidelines of Islamic Development Bank meetings in Egypt, was quoted by Bloomberg on Saturday as saying \u201cwe were not able to do that because the market pricing was not good and also the approval period for us has closed. She added that \u201cthe approval period was up to May 31, 2022; so, we are not going to be able to take that one anymore.\u201d\n\nNigeria was one of the first sovereigns to tap the Eurobond market after the start in late February of Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine, which stoked commodity prices and inflation just as the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates. Nigeria\u2019s seven-year bond in March was priced to yield 8.375 per cent, compared to a similar maturity raised about eight months ago with a coupon of 6.125 per cent.\n\nThe federal government plans to curb borrowing costs this year by using the International Monetary Fund\u2019s general allocation of reserves known as special drawing rights to fund projects, then reducing external borrowings, Ahmed said. It projects N17.3 trillion ($41.6 billion) budget spending this year, with forecast deficits of N7.35 trillion.\n\n\u201cWhat we are doing now is to plan on managing our situation such that we are not exposed to increased costs in 2022,\u201d Ahmed said. \u201cWe are hoping that in 2023 things will be much better than what we are projecting in 2022.\u201d\n\nAnalysts said Nigeria\u2019s return to the market at a time when investors are wary of volatility across financial markets shows the urgent need for Nigeria\u2019s government to narrow its budget deficit. The IMF forecasts the gap will widen to 6.4 per cent of gross domestic product this year from a pre-pandemic average of 4.3 per cent, due to the rising cost of fuel subsidies.\n\nBorrowers have been on the sidelines since Russia\u2019s invasion pushed up funding costs. Turkey was the second sovereign to announce an overseas bond sale in April.\n\nNigeria\u2019s deficit is expected to widen to 6.4 per cent of gross domestic product this year from a pre-pandemic average of 4.3 per cent due to the rising cost of fuel subsidies, according to IMF forecasts.\n\nMeanwhile, Ahmed has also disclosed that the recent forecasts by the IMF that the country could be spending 100 per cent of its revenues on debt servicing by 2026 was based on wrong parameters.\n\nShe argued that the organisation\u2019s assumption was hinged on the prediction that the country\u2019s revenues would remain stagnant, explaining that it had indeed been improving.\n\nAhmed stated that Nigeria was confident that it would beat this year\u2019s non-oil revenue target based on collections made in the first three months of the year.\n\nThe Bretton Wood institution had raised concerns over Nigeria\u2019s fiscal conditions, adding that the nation spends 89 per cent of its revenue on debt.\n\nThe IMF\u2019s Resident Representative for Nigeria, Ari Aisen, who spoke while presenting the fund\u2019s latest Sub-Saharan Africa Regional Economic Outlook report, also warned that with fuel subsidy payments averaging N500 billion monthly, total expenditure on subsidy could hit a record N6 trillion by the end of the year.\n\nBut Ahmed said on the sidelines of the IDB meetings in Egypt that the rise in non-oil revenues would help the country avoid the prediction by the IMF that debt service would swallow all of the country\u2019s income by 2026.\n\n\u201cThe IMF projection is predicated on the assumption that revenue levels will stay the same as they are right now up to 2026,\u201d Ahmed said.\n\nShe argued that non-oil revenues were outperforming income from crude oil, adding that taxes collected last year even exceeded projections.\n\n\u201cIn 2021, our non-oil revenues outperformed our budget by an aggregate of 15 per cent.\n\n\u201cIn 2022, our first quarter shows that already, the company income tax and Value Added Tax (VAT) are slightly above the projected target,\u201d she added.\n\nFG Lists Two New FGN Savings Bonds for Subscription\n\nMeanwhile, the DMO has listed two new FGN savings bonds for subscription at N1,000 per unit.\n\nAccording to the DMO, the first one is a two-year savings bond maturing on June 15, 2024, at an interest rate of 8.20 per cent per annum.\n\nThe second is a three-year savings bond due maturing on June 15, 2025, at a 9.20 per cent per annum interest rate.\n\n\u201cOffer opens on Monday, June 6, and closes on Friday, June 10; settlement date is June 15.\n\n\u201cThey are offered at N1,000 per unit, subject to a minimum subscription of N5000, and in multiples of N1000 thereafter, subject to a maximum subscription of N50 million.\n\nFestus Akanbi in Lagos and Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja",
