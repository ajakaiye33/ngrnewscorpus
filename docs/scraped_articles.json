          "text": "The Media Adviser to the Minister of Interior, Sola Fasure, has said Nigeria has not experienced any successful jailbreak recently.\n\nHe added that a total of 78 correctional officers were facing disciplinary actions for various offences.\n\nFasure, disclosed these to our correspondent in an interview on Sunday.\n\nHe explained that what the country had experienced was external attacks and not jailbreaks.\n\n\u201cLet me state that we don\u2019t have jailbreaks but external attacks. Jailbreak is different from external attacks. Jailbreak is when internal insurrection leads to breach and escape.\n\n\u201cWhat we have had recently were external attacks. There were insurrection attempts in Kaduna and Lagos last year but were quickly put down.\n\n\u201cThe ones that happened in Owerri, Benin and Kabba are external attacks and not jailbreaks. Although, there were two unsuccessful jailbreak attempts in Kaduna and Lagos, it didn\u2019t succeed because the officers rose to the occasion.\u201d\n\nAccording to Fasure, 29 of disciplinary cases in 2020 led to the dismissal of 17 officers, adding that 49 disciplinary cases were being investigated in 2021.\n\nOur correspondent had sought to know why nobody had been punished despite the increasing number of jailbreak in the country.\n\nHe was reminded that the minister at some occasions stated that few officials were conniving with criminals.\n\nFasure, however said the minister statement was not directed at a specific officer.\n\nHe said, \u201cHe has never indicted any official of the correctional service for aiding all forms of criminalities. He has wondered though if it is possible for jailbreak to be possible without some support. There was a recent case of an official trying to smuggle a mobile phone to an inmate. It was foiled by other vigilant officials. The matter is being handled in-house.\n\n\u201cWhere an official is found guilty of compromising his or her position, appropriate sanctions have always been handed down, without fail.\n\n\u201cThe minister would rather than all officials are as clean as a whistle. It is unfortunate there will be cases. But the system has zero tolerance for erring officials. Some have been dismissed; some have had their ranks reduced.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, there were 29 disciplinary cases out of which 17 were outright dismissal. In 2021, we have 49 disciplinary cases so far.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

This lecture means a lot to us because this is an opportunity to share experiences, interact with the University community which we believe will be beneficial to the people as it will pass information, knowledge and experience to the people and the entire university community\u2019\u2019.\n\nSpeaking on the contributions of the University towards nation-building, Governor Emmanuel maintained that Nigeria can surmount its challenges if there is a re-awakening of a moral rebirth in the minds of the people to take up their responsibilities, the country will be better off.\n\nHear him, \u201cWe need to pass a message that we can fix it, we must rejig the system and get things done, we should not allow many things to decay in our land and the only to do that is to pass information where we try to rebuild a moral rebirth in our people and the confidence in our people that we must forge ahead and if we don\u2019t fix it nobody will do it for us\u2019\u2019.\n\nSpeaking earlier, the Chairman, UNN Senate Ceremonials Committee, Professor Bennett Nwanguma, who led the delegation, said the Founder Day Ceremony was an annual event at which founders of the prestigious institution are remembered and honoured, with a particular tribute to Nigeria\u2019s first President, Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe and his generation of Nigerian leaders. He affirmed that the 2021 edition of the ceremony, being the 61st in the series, is scheduled for Thursday, 7th of October.\n\nProf. Nwanguma thanked Governor Udom Emmanuel and members of his cabinet for the warm reception and hospitality accorded him and his team and expressed the gratitude of the UNN community for the governor\u2019s acceptance to feature at the event.\n\nHe said two reasons informed the choice of Governor Emmanuel as Guest Speaker for the year\u2019s event. Firstly, that Mr Udom Emmanuel, with his record of performance as Governor of Akwa Ibom State, has gained the credence of the University of Nigeria community as one from whom they would draw inspiration and motivation. Secondly, that the University of Nigeria enjoys a historical relationship with Akwa Ibom State because the motion for its establishment was moved by Chief Ibanga Akpabio in May 1955, he added",

Many informants to the bandits were arrested, investigated and prosecuted.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, over 200 kidnapped victims were rescued at various locations, debriefed and reunited with their families.\n\n\u201cApart from the achievements of other security agencies in the state, the following arrests and recoveries, mostly from bandits\u2019 collaborators, were made by the Zamfara police command and will be showcased to the press for onward dissemination to members of the public.\u201d\n\nThe PPRO added that firearms, including AK47 guns, Dane guns, ammunition, machetes, charms, foodstuff, drugs, fuel, as well as motorcycles and money were recovered from the suspects during the period.\n\nInvestigations are presently on to ascertain the level of involvement of each of the suspects, after which they would be arraigned for prosecution in various courts.\n\nShehu appealed to residents to exercise patience and give the security agencies the needed support to rid the state of all criminal elements and restore law and order.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

It behoves of all Nigerians to say, \u2018we must work together to salvage our country and we must work together to move this country forward.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t matter where you come from. Because poverty does not know Fulani, does not know Hausa, the Igbo, it does not know Yoruba, it does not know other ethnic groups.\u201d\n\nWike said Rivers State would continue to be a place where every Nigerian can reside and consider as home. He, however, said it was also obligatory on all residents in the state to conduct their affairs within the confines of the law and be orderly.\n\nThe governor said it was the place of government to provide development for its people and ensure safety of all residents.\n\nHe also noted it is wrong for some residents to view government\u2019s development policy and efforts to provide security from the prism of religion or ethnicity.\n\n\u201cRivers State, for me, is a place for all Nigerians. Wherever you come from, whether you\u2019re from the East, North, West, or you\u2019re from the South. Whatever your religion, it is immaterial to me. All of us are Nigerians and we do things in common. The only thing I have always crave for is law and order and for people to understand that no society can progress without behaving orderly and without obeying the law.Wike enjoined the former Emir to advice his followers in the state to obey the law and live orderly.\u201d\n\nSanusi said he was on familiarisation tour to leaders and members of Tjjaniyya Order who are resident in Rivers State because he is their Grand Khaleefa.\n\nHe noted with delight the quality of leadership demonstrated by Governor Wike in making Rivers home for all Nigerians.\n\nHe also acknowledged the quality of public infrastructure, the development strides and security provided for all residents by the Wike\u2019s administration.\n\nHe assured the governor that the order does not tolerate extremism, but advocates peace, brotherhood, togetherness, solidarity and progress of the country.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja and Tony Osauzo, Benin\n\nCrisis is brewing in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) over zoning of offices for the October 30 national convention as stakeholders dissatisfied with the proposed zoning formula are warming up for a showdown with the party.\n\nThe PDP Zoning Committee headed by Enugu State Governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, had last Thursday, announced the zoning of the chairmanship of the party to the north.\n\nThe committee also disclosed that the North and South would swap all offices they currently occupy. The party National Executive Committee (NEC) is expected to ratify the zoning formula on Thursday, at a meeting in Abuja.\n\nDaily Sun, however, gathered that ahead of the NEC meeting, me aggrieved members of the party, including current members of the National Working Committee were against the zoning formula.\n\nA member of NEC, who does not want his name in print, told journalists at the weekend, that most of the NWC members see the zoning as a ploy by the governors to stop them from seeking reelection.\n\nThe PDP Governors Forum, in their earlier intervention in the party crisis, had mooted the idea of barring NWC members from seeking reelection in the forthcoming convention. However, the plan had not sailed through, as it was opposed in one of the NEC meeting held recently.\n\nThe source said the proposed zoning formula runs contrary to section 47(1) of the Constitution of the PDP, which allows elected officials to seek a second term, if they so desired.\n\nAccording to Section 47(1) of the PDP constitution: \u201cAll National, Zonal, State, Local Government Area and Ward Officers of the party shall hold office for a term of four years and shall be eligible for re-election for another term and no more.\u201d\n\nThe source said: \u201cWhat the governors are trying to do is a serious breach of PDP\u2019s constitution which guarantees the right to seek re-election for every serving member of the NWC. They raised this at one of the meetings of NEC, but it was seriously opposed and defeated. By suggesting that NWC positions currently held held by persons from the north be swapped for positions in the south, they have automatically prevented all serving NWC members from seeking re-election. For instance, what if the serving national chairman wants to seek re-election to the same position?\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Edo State PDP stakeholders meeting called by Governor Godwin Obaseki for harmonisation ahead of the national convention slated to hold at the end of October 2021 is generating controversy.\n\nThe meeting was held last Saturday at Government House, Benin City, but some leaders of the party have openly disagreed with the meeting and its outcome.\n\nSecretary of the party in the state, Hillary Otsu, had released a list of 233 selected leaders for the meeting, but several of those invited to attend were said to have been left out.\n\nOtsu in a statement said a list was compiled by himself and the Secretary to Government, based on defined categories, but that the list which was circulated before the meeting did not represent the full list as compiled.\n\n\u201cSome names were left out, despite belonging to the categories of invitees that were identified. Essentially, the final list was not endorsed by me before it was circulated,\u201d he said.\n\nConsequently, it was learnt that some prominent leaders of the PDP, including the secretary, Chief Dan Orbih, and others did not attend the meeting.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

Ibrahim Babangida (rtd); a former National Security Adviser (NSA), Gen. Aliyu Gusau, and some other elders.\n\nOne of the northern elders privy to the intrigues told THISDAY last night that zoning the party\u2019s chairmanship position to the North-central would ensure the emergence of the vice-presidential candidate from the North-west.\n\n\u201cNorthern elders in the party want the chairmanship zoned to the North-central to enable a vice presidential candidate to a southern presidential candidate come from the North-west, given the power bloc.\n\n\u201cTo that extent, some are looking at David Mark and or Ibrahim Shema. Sule Lamido is also being considered. But most of the elders are saying that if Shema or Lamido runs, it could stop the North-west from bringing the vice presidential candidate to a southern presidential candidate because the southern governors in the party are determined that the presidency should go to the South, in line with the resolutions of the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum, and they are looking at one of their own as a candidate, despite all the blackmail,\u201d the source explained.\n\nHowever, the source added that the loyalists of former Vice President Atiku Abubakar and former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki are moving to use the court to return Secondus.\n\n\u201cIf they return Secondus, they can take control of the party, and retain the presidency in the North in 2023,\u201d the source added.\n\nNEC Meets Thursday to Consider Zoning Report\n\nMeanwhile, the PDP has summoned an emergency NEC meeting for Thursday, October 7, at its national headquarters, to consider the report of the zoning of the offices of the NWC.\n\nAccording to a statement issued yesterday by the National Secretary of the party, Senator Umaru Ibrahim Tsauri, all members of the National Executive Committee are invited to the emergency NEC meeting.\n\nZamfara Deputy Governor Clarifies Zoning of Offices\n\nIn a related development, the Secretary of the NCZC and Deputy Governor of Zamfara State, Mr. Mahdi Aliyu Gusau has clarified the zoning of offices in the party.\n\nIn an interview with journalists in Abuja on Friday, he debunked speculations that the presidential ambition of Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal of Sokoto State; Atiku; Saraki, and a former Governor of Kano State, Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, had been foreclosed.\n\n\u201cAfter our meeting, some mischief makers started spreading false stories that our committee has zoned the Presidency to the South.\n\n\u201cThis is not true. Our committee was mandated to decide on those that would seek party positions. This does not include those who want to seek the positions of president, vice president, governors, and the like.\n\n\u201cAb initio, it was made clear that our committee does not have the mandate on any other matter regarding zoning or otherwise, except that which regards the party at the federal level.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

What we are calling for is a safe environment and for everyone to support the ongoing operation by the security agents\u201d.\n\nHe accused some communities of harbouring bandits because of fear that they could be attacked, warning that \u201cvery soon we will tag those communities as same elements as bandits. If you are harbouring any bandits and you know, you are one even if you don\u2019t carry a gun because you are risking the lives of our security agents\u201d.\n\nIn a related development, suspected bandits operating in the Eastern Senatorial District of Sokoto State have allegedly written a letter to a monarch in Burkusuma demanding ransom to secure the release of 20 persons kidnapped from two communities in Sabon Birni Local Government Area of the state.\n\nThe letter was allegedly written in the Hausa language by one of the victims kidnapped by the bandits and addressed to Sarkin Rafin Burkusuma, the district head of the area.\n\nThe bandits informed the monarch that the victims kidnapped from Gatawa and Burkusuma are all in good health.\n\nThey thereafter demanded the sum of N20 million to be paid for the release of their victims.\n\nThe kidnapped victims, whose names were all written in the letter, consist of nine males, eight females and two children.\n\nOne of the victims was released to deliver the letter to Gatawa through the Sarkin Rakin Burkusuma.\n\nChannels TV reported that the bandits have resorted to sending letters to families of kidnapped victims since the shutdown of telecommunication services in the area.\n\nAn effort by the TV station to reach the Sokoto State Police Command for confirmation was unsuccessful as the mobile line of the Police Public Relations Officer, Sanusi Abubakar, could not be reached at the time of filing this report.\n\nIn another development, the Zamfara State Police Command has said it has arrested one of the notorious commanders of bandits, Bello Ruga.\n\nThe Commissioner for Police in Zamfara, Ayuba Elkana, who disclosed this to reporters, said Bello, also known as Bello Dan Malankara, was apprehended at a bandits\u2019 camp in Gummi Local Government Area of the state.\n\n\u201cOn October 1, 2021, police tactical operatives on anti-banditry operations around Gummi axis acted on intelligence report and stormed Gidan Bita, Malankare, and Kagara forest in search of one notorious bandit known as Bello Rugga,\u201d he said during a briefing on Friday at the Police Headquarters in Gusau.\n\n\u201cThe bandit who happens to be one of the Turji\u2019s commanders was the one in charge of Gummi, Gidan Bita, Malankare, and Kagara forest in Gummi LGA.\n\n\u201cHe has been commanding a series of attacks and kidnaps in Gummi that led to the unwarranted killing of innocent people, and the kidnapping of many persons where ransoms were paid. The suspect who has many bandits under him also is in possession of AK-47 rifles.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Elkana announced that all vehicles with unauthorised tinted glass should be immediately removed.\n\nHe also directed the police to arrest and prosecute owners of vehicles without plate numbers on all roads in the state.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

She was one of a few media chiefs who quickly noted that the growing movement of young people against police brutality would become a global campaign for change.\n\n\u201cShe rallied her organisation to provide uninterrupted coverage of history in the making, as most major cities in Nigeria were at a standstill. ARISE NEWS moved from a middle-of-the-road player into a news juggernaut, with its digital news gathering, generating tens of millions of views and comments from young Nigerians becoming politically conscious for the first time. Nwogwugwu brings to journalism something rare but not impossible- a combination of traditional journalistic pedigree on the one hand and strong appeal to Generation Z on the other.\u201d\n\nNwogwugwu, who was the former Editor of THISDAY Newspapers, was listed among 24 others in WIJAfrica\u2019s list of \u201c25 Most Powerful\u201d women in journalism for 2020, where she emerged top of the list.\n\nShe was chosen because she \u201cbrings to journalism a wealth of experience across private and public sectors.\u201d\n\nApart from the top 25 list, a number of other journalists were also nominated as worthy of mentions.\n\nThey are: Editor, Vanguard Allure, Jemi Ekunkunbor; Editor, THISDAYStyle Online, Konye Nwabogor; Acting Editor, The Will Downtown, Onah Nwachukwu; Editor, Punch Online/New Media, Adesola Ayo-Adenrele; Group Features Editor, THISDAY Newspapers, Chiemelie Ezeobi; Sharon Ijasan of Television Continental (TVC); and Nike Sotade, a veteran journalist.\n\nWIJAfrica is the annual gathering of women working in the field of journalism and the media across Africa. The award is organised by WIJAfrica, supported by local and international partners to advance conversations around the practice of journalism in Africa, promote best practices, and supporting innovation in professionalism.\n\nThe first WIJAfrica conference was held in 2014 at the Civic Centre in Lagos, with the CEO of Thomson Reuters Foundation, Monique Villa as the Keynote Speaker. Since then, notable speeches have been delivered at subsequent conferences by Rhodes University\u2019s Professor Anthea Garman; Courage in Journalism Winner, Chris Anyanwu, and award-winning international journalist, Anna Cunningham in October 2019.\n\nWIJAfrica has also seen extensive collaboration with the Nigerian Association of Women Journalists (NAWOJ), the Nigerian Institute of Journalism (NIJ), UNESCO, the School of Media and Communication at the Pan-Atlantic University, and the Mass Communications Department of the University of Lagos.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The criminal elements who attack police stations and seize weapons to attack innocent people are terrorists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe criminal elements who attack correctional centres and release inmates therein are terrorists. The criminal elements who destroy government properties or public facilities are terrorists. But the Federal Government has deliberately refused to declare the bandits terrorists and prosecute them.\n\n\u201cIn August 2019, the State Security Service arrested and detain Mr. Omoyele Sowore for planning a peaceful rally against the Buhari administration. While he was in detention the SSS secretly applied for an ex parte order to have Sowore detained for 90 days for the purpose of investigating his alleged terrorist activities. Even though there was no evidence to support the application the Federal High Court ordered that Sowore be detained for 45 days. At the end of the investigation the SSS confirmed that there was no scintilla of evidence linking Sowore to terrorism.\n\n\u201cRecently, the Kaduna State High Court dismissed the charge of culpable homicide against Sheikh Ibrahim Elzakzaky and his wife. Completely dissatisfied with the verdict the Kaduna State Government has charged them with terrorism.\n\n\u201cAnd sequel to the proscription of the MIN the police and the army engage in routine extrajudicial execution of scores of Shiites for embarking on peaceful protests in Abuja and other states in the North. However, while the Federal Government is waging a full scale war against the Shiites, IPOB members and journalists it has continued to treat the so called bandits with kid glove.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe human rights lawyer said federal lawmakers had also asked President Muhammadu Buhari to declare bandits as terrorists, but the federal government had ignored the resolution.\n\nFalana called on the media and Nigerians to \u201cstop referring to terrorists as bandits\u201d.",

The state\u2019s decision to ban Twitter triggered widespread criticism as online-based businesses recorded huge losses; lawsuits; and national assembly hearings meant to probe the circumstances leading to the ban.\n\nAccording to the president, a committee constituted to engage Twitter to explore the possibility of resolving the issue that led to the suspension of its activities in Nigeria had successfully addressed a number of key issues, including \u201cnational security and cohesion; registration of physical presence and representation; fair taxation; dispute resolution; and local content.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have directed that the suspension be lifted but only if the conditions are met to allow our citizens continue the use of the platform for business and positive engagements,\u201d he said.\n\nThe committee, which was set up in July, is led by the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, who revealed in August that the ban would be lifted in \u201ca matter of days\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe ban on Twitter will soon be lifted as we are getting close to reaching full agreement,\u201d the minister said. \u201cWe have agreed on some areas, hopefully in the next few days or weeks, we will conclude.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe Nigerian government has insisted the suspension is a matter of national security and not related to the president\u2019s tweet.

Its mission is to facilitate investment in Lagos-based entrepreneurs and their early-stage businesses and give them access to networks and mentoring.\n\nSince its launch in 2012, the LAN community of Angels claims to have mentored, advised, and invested in over a hundred Nigerian startups.\n\nLAN has also birthed several Angel groups such as Rising Tide Africa (RTA), South South-East Angels Network (SSEAN), Abuja Angels Network (AAN), and the Diaspora Angels Network (DAN).\n\n\u201cAngel investors are very important to any thriving ecosystem and LAN can play a pivotal role in that regard to drive policy and education,\u201d the new Chair, Aina tells TechCabal. \u201cUnder our dispensation, we will focus on ensuring LAN is even more relevant and perceived as the desired source of capital and advocacy.\u201d\n\nAina adds that the new BoG will prioritise angel investor recruitment and education, policy advocacy, and deal pipeline and matching.\n\n\u201cAs the founding velocity in our market has ballooned, we will work to ensure that the LAN membership and various syndicates within LAN play a leading role in providing the earliest and most hassle-free risk capital in Nigeria and Africa at large over the next decade.\u201d\n\nThe new board will be taking over from the leadership of co-founders, Tomi Davies and Dotun Sulaiman, and the current Board of Directors, Collins Onuegbu, Segun Olukoya, Yemi Keri, Dipo Adebo, David Richards, and Bunmi Lawson.\n\n\u201cDuring this our first decade as Lagos Angels, we\u2019ve seen the good, the bad, and the unexpected in the Nigerian early-stage entrepreneurship ecosystem, and it\u2019s been an incredibly worthwhile journey,\u201d Davies says in the statement.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the Lagos startup ecosystem grow significantly bigger than when we started LAN 10 years ago and need to do more. We\u2019ve seen what\u2019s possible, and now it\u2019s time to take Angel investing in Nigeria to the next level,\u201d Sulaiman adds.\n\nWhile other directors of the old Board will be stepping down, Davies, Sulaiman, and Keri will remain as guarantors of LAN, a company limited by guarantee under the laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI want to thank the founding LAN Board whose achievements cannot be overstated, and their legacy is visible for all to see,\u201d Aina says. \u201cOur appointment to serve the LAN community in this capacity is humbling.

          "text": "Apple released the iOS 15 on September 20, 2021, and it\u2019s a super-smart operating system.\n\nWe think Apple is taking a minimalist approach to building a more effective operating system. Unlike the flashy update that happened from iOS 6 to iOS 7, iOS 15 debuts with subtle updates that form a more significant upgrade of iOS 14. iOS 15 is the perfect example of being loud without screaming: the new operating system improves your overall experience without altering your phone visually.\n\niOS 15 has a lot of hidden updates that are easy to miss and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve compiled some of our favourite features below:\n\nFocus mode in iOS 15 is a gift to humanity\n\nHow setting Focus on iOS 15 looks like\n\nThis has to come first because it is transformative and will make the human race more productive. Sounds dramatic, but you can quote us on that.\n\niOS 15 Focus mode lets you filter notifications based on your current engagement. It arranges apps and widget pages on your home screen to align with your activity.\n\nSetting up or editing a Focus can be done in your iPhone\u2019s Settings. You can edit your Focus to be anything \u2013 work, exercise, study, or game night. You can also schedule a Focus for a particular time of the day or when you enter a location. For instance, you can set Work Focus mode to start by 10 a.m., or when you enter your office.\n\nOnce you enable Focus mode, it automatically displays your status for friends to see so they know not to disturb or interrupt you. Deep work just got better. You can also set your Focus not to notify anybody like you\u2019d turn off a new job update on LinkedIn.\n\nIn iOS 15, third-party apps like WhatsApp and Slack can integrate Focus status in their messaging apps if they choose. So when your boss scolds you for not meeting deadlines, you can just tell them to provide you with an iOS 15-enabled iPhone.\n\nYour iPhone\u2019s camera can now copy text off images\n\nHow many times have you wished your camera could scan letters off an image and turn them into editable text? Well, iOS 15 says, \u201cWish no more!\u201d\n\niOS 15 allows you to point your camera at an image or piece of paper and have its text automatically identified and copied into an email or a document.\n\nHow to use the new Scan Text tool:\n\nLong-press inside a text field as though you want to copy and paste. You\u2019ll see a Scan Text button. You may also see a button that uses just the scan icon, which looks like a piece of paper with brackets around it. Tap the button, which will replace your keyboard with your iPhone camera\u2019s viewfinder. Point your camera at the material you want to scan, and then follow the prompts on the screen. Wait for the best part. If you\u2019re moving the camera too fast, you\u2019ll see a Slow Down message flash on the screen. Cool? As you try to fit the camera and text, a live preview of the text your iPhone is identifying will be displayed. Tap the Insert button when you\u2019re ready.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nNotification Summary removes constant beeping noise\n\nManaging notifications is almost impossible; you either receive them or you don\u2019t. But iOS 15 gives you control by gathering your notifications in one place where you can view them at your own convenience.\n\nInstead of constantly being distracted by beeps or pop-ups, Notification Summary collects notifications from apps or websites you\u2019re interested in and delivers them to you at a time you\u2019ve chosen.\n\nPortrait mode for FaceTime is a beauty\n\niOS 15 is taking portrait mode monopoly away from pictures. It then lets you turn on the mode for your FaceTime calls, bringing with it the ability to place an artistic blurry background behind you.\n\nSay bye to annoying backgrounds! Your pictures can now appear as though you\u2019ve just had them taken with a professional mirrorless camera and fast lens.\n\nSafari\u2019s address bar can be at the bottom or top of the screen\n\nYour Safari\u2019s address bar can live at the bottom or top of the screen\n\nSince 2007, Safari\u2019s address bar has stayed up there on the screen. But that\u2019s changed now because, why only up? Why not down, too? The whole idea of freedom is to have options and Apple is giving us that.\n\niOS 15 now allows the Safari address bar to be moved to the bottom of your phone\u2019s screen to make it easier for your thumbs to reach. If you want that tab bar back at the top, you can tap the AA button and select Show Top Address Bar.\n\nYou can now add a background image to Safari\n\nAdding background image to Safari\n\nSafari has gotten a really nice facelift in this new iOS 15, and one of them is the ability to add backgrounds to the Safari app on your iPhone. This feature was first added to macOS Big Sur but was limited to only the macOS. Not anymore.\n\nNot only can you customise the Start page, you can also select a background image to use as well as choose new sections to display on the Start page.\n\nHow to use this feature\n\nLaunch Safari on your iPhone. Open a new tab in Safari. Scroll down and tap Edit. Tap the toggle for Background Image to ON. Select one of the preset images or tap the large plus (+) button to choose an image from your Photo Library.\n\nChange the size of text used in specific apps\n\nCurrently, you can set the preferred font size to be used across your iPhone. With iOS 15, there\u2019s a tool that lets you have different font sizes for different apps on your phone. That means you can have your WhatsApp and TikTok in different font sizes.\n\nTo use this new feature:\n\nOpen your iPhone Settings Go to Control Centre Scroll down until you find the option labelled Text Size. Tap on the green plus sign before it.\n\nIf you want to adjust the size from the app:\n\nOpen Control Centre (swipe down from the top right corner of the screen, on an iPhone with Face ID; or up from the bottom of the screen, on an iPhone with Touch ID). Tap the Text Size button. Slide the button at the bottom of the screen to the left side of the toggle to indicate that you only want your changes applied to the app you\u2019re currently using, and then adjust the font size up or down.\n\nThere are a few features that weren\u2019t launched with the new operating system but will be added later. One example is SharePlay, a feature that lets you listen to music or watch a video in sync with your friends on FaceTime calls. You could say movie night just got better as it allows you to broadcast SharePlay media from your phone to a TV equipped with an AppleTV device.\n\nThough it\u2019s only the newly launched iPhone 13 series that comes with the new operating system, iPhone users with models starting from iPhone 6S can upgrade to iOS 15 by downloading the software.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "text": "Naira crosses the N412/$1 threshold, first time in 6 months\n\nFor most of the trading session last week the Naira appreciated the I & E FX window, which continued at the end of the week. On a week-on-week basis, the Naira appreciated by +0.37% to N413.38/US$ at the close of trading on Friday.\n\nThe Naira for the first time in 6 months closed the week at $/N413.38 at the I&E FX window, at the NAFEX (spot market) it closed at $/N413.53.\n\nHowever, the Naira is anticipated to hover around N410/$1-N415/$1 threshold in the NAFEX window in the week ahead.\n\nOPEC oil output rose to its highest since April 2020\n\nBrent had a weekly growth of 0.76%. A Reuters survey on Friday found that OPEC oil output rose in September to its highest since April 2020, as Nigerian output recovered from involuntary losses and OPEC\u2019s top producers further eased supply curbs under a pact with its allies.\n\nOil prices rose for a fifth straight day on Monday with Brent heading for $80 amid supply concerns as parts of the world see demand pick up with the easing of pandemic conditions.\n\nGoldman Sachs raised its year-end forecast for Brent crude oil prices to $90 per barrel from $80, as rapid fuel demand recovers from the Delta variant and Hurricane Ida\u2019s disruption in productions led to tight global supplies.\n\nRead also: Akunyili \u2013 Let\u2019s quit the pretence, our lives don\u2019t matter\n\nMany gas stations on Monday ran dry of gasoline in Britain and vendors rationed sales due to shortages of truckers which led to a break in the supply chains. British Government on Tuesday said it has put military tanker drivers on standby to supply gas stations if needed.\n\nOil prices fell on Thursday, as higher U.S. crude oil inventories and a strong dollar outweighed bullishness from supply deficit forecasts.\n\nIn the coming week, oil prices are expected to grow marginally supported by global output disruptions and swelling inventories.\n\nMoney Market\n\nMultiple SLF inflows supported system liquidity last week causing money market rates to trade lower, for the most part.\n\nHowever, at the close of the session on Friday, money market rates closed in double digits, at 15.00% and 15.75% for open buy-back and overnight rates respectively. On a W-o-W basis, OBB fell by -6.25% while O/N also dropped by -8.70%.\n\nFunding rates are expected to trade in double digits trend in the coming week in the absence of any inflow.\n\nTreasury Bills Market\n\nThe Nigerian Treasury Bills was active last week and had a bullish trend for most of the trading in the week\n\nAt the close of the market on Friday, average benchmark yields for T-bills closed at 5.29%, OMO bills at 6.32% while the average benchmark for CBN\u2019s special bills closed at 6.03%. Which Indicates a W-o-W fall of -5.70% for the T-bills, -1.71%, and -0.17% for OMO bills and the special bills respectively.\n\nThe DMO sold N115.41 billion worth of notes against N111.87 billion offered at its NTB auction last week. The 91-day, 182-day & 364-day notes were allotted at 2.50%, 3.50%, and 7.50%, respectively. Compared to the previous auction, rates on the 91-day & 182-day were unchanged while the 364-day paper rose by 30bps.\n\nWe expect activity next week to be dictated by the market liquidity situation.\n\nFGN BOND and EUROBOND market\n\nSentiment in the bond market was mixed last week, at the close of trading on Friday bulls dominated as we saw buying interest at the shot and mid-end of the curve.\n\nThe overall average benchmark yields closed at 8.13% at the close of trading at the end of the week, which rose W-o-W by +4.76%.\n\nThe Eurobond market was bullish on Thursday, as investors moved into the market to take advantage of the attractive yield level, we saw buying interest at the mid to long end of the curve. Average benchmark yields fell by 3bps to 6.18%\n\nMarket sentiment is expected to be mixed as inflation concerns dampen.\n\nNigerian Capital Market\n\nThe equity market saw a bullish dominance last week, as savvy investors and bargain hunters strategically picked up large-cap stocks across various sectors. Activity on the local bourse started the week on a weak note but the benchmark index experienced a reversal mid-week. The NGXASI closed the week with an uptick of +3.23%. The Nigerian Stock Exchange gained N655.89bn, year-to-date return moderated to -0.12%, while the market capitalization settled at N20.96trillion.\n\nThe volume and value of stocks traded on the exchange last week advanced by +69.46% and +16.25% respectively.\n\nSectoral performance across sectors tracked was positive last week as the NGX-IND was the highest gainer for the week with +6.65%. NGX Insurance recorded the highest weekly loss with -7.58%. NGX Consumer Goods, NGX Oil and Gas, and NGX Banking closed positive with +3.35%, +0.92% and +0.60% respectively.",

          "text": "THERE are enough grounds to suspect that President Muhammadu Buhari is content with specious media statements that are made once a prominent Nigerian is killed. The trite retorts of \u201cthis is one death too many\u201d, \u201cthe perpetrators would face justice\u201d, \u201csecurity agents would fish them out\u201d have long been meaningless but to the President.\n\nNigerians should feel insulted again that the only reaction the President has to the pervading insecurity in the land is mere stringing of words, the same words.\n\nDr. Chike Akunyili and the thousands that gunmen \u2013 known and unknown \u2013 have killed deserve silence from the President since he has exhausted his best shots firing at nothing. What could be more insulting than recounting how Buhari had a great working relationship with Prof Dora Akunyili, the earlier departed wife of the man gunned down on the street on Tuesday? Will the working relationship punish the killers of the doctor?\n\nRead Also: Gunmen kill Chike Akunyili, husband to late NAFDAC DG\n\nDo lives matter to Buhari?\n\nIf Buhari has lost his feelings about lives he should not be so gallant in telling us. He certainly does not realise that security of Nigerians is his responsibility though he glibly quoted it during Friday\u2019s speech.\n\nWill his sympathies address the deaths of prominent and not so prominent people in Adamawa, Enugu, Benue, Kaduna, Katsina, Kogi, Oyo, Plateau, Yobe, Zamfara? Where else are people not being killed?\n\nShould the President bother with reacting to the deaths? He issues the same nothingness as responses to the bold fact that Nigeria is shrinking.\n\nDoes he have another answer to gunmen on rampage all over the country, daring him to stop them? Only the high profile cases make the headlines. The presumed angst at the incidents do not last more than a few hours before something worse happens.\n\nAkunyili had an armed police escort. Soldiers were reportedly within the vicinity of the incident that claimed eight other lives, including Akunyili\u2019s police escort.\n\nWill the President be shocked to action beyond claiming the death pained him? Is it not shameful that the President thinks his job is done by issuing statements that signal a surrender to anarchy?\n\nBuhari has come a long way in this abdication of responsibility, blaming foes, everyone, for the collapse in Nigeria\u2019s security.\n\nHis native Katsina has some of the worst cases. What has he done about them? The incidents are persistent, enduring, and the attackers daring.\n\nMusa Umar, Buhari\u2019s in-law and a traditional ruler in Daura, was kidnapped on 2 May 2019, at his home in Buhari\u2019s hometown of Daura. He regained his freedom after two months.\n\nMore recently, school children are kidnapped, farmers chased from their occupation, body counts have become the pre-occupation of most communities. These do not bother the President whose concentration, we are told is on \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d.\n\nBuhari is engagingly animated only when he speaks of cattle and cattle routes. If he had paid a fraction of the attention he deploys to grazing routes to insecurity, the matter would have long been addressed.\n\nWhen will he, the police, and the security chiefs quit the pretence to concerns about protecting Nigerians? Why do we still think the President is interested in securing Nigerians?\n\nAre we not expecting too much from a President who ignored the two most recent assaults from terrorists? When they shot down a military jet, there was no anger from the President. They invaded NDA, our military academy, killed, kidnapped an officer, nothing proved the President was angry except one of those meaningless statements.\n\nGovernors in the South East are suddenly alive, condemning Akunyili\u2019s killing in voices they lost long ago. Their joint statement is their best idea of accounting for their security votes.\n\nNone of the statements will translate into more actions than more harassment of more innocent people. Already IPOB is being held responsible for the killing, foreclosing investigations, no need to know if groups or individuals other than IPOB killed Akunyili.\n\nThe public is more interested in actions that would stem insecurity than government\u2019s finger pointing. The answer to insecurity is to deal with those behind it. Government has no such inclinations.\n\nA 61st independence anniversary speech was another platform for Buhari to trade in divisiveness and hate speech. Our President talks of Nigeria\u2019s unity being sacrosanct yet he knows those financing Sunday Igboho, and Nnamdi Kanu, but not a single sponsor of the terrorists ravaging the North. The President tells us thousands of the terrorists of the North have repented.\n\nWe should note his consistency in taking decisive steps to side with criminals if they are from the North. How has his softness on terrorists of the North helped that part of Nigeria?\n\nIf those who thread Buhari narratives had not completely opted to deceive themselves, they would not have returned from the UN General Assembly gloating over a new role the global body assigned Buhari. He was nicely told in New York to fix his country.\n\nDr. Akunyili would not have died in vain if his killing would incense Buhari to treat terrorists as they deserve not minding their tribe, tongue or thought. From his 1 October speech Buhari has climaxed with a lofty attainment \u2013 lifting the ban on Twitter. We should applaud.\n\nFINALLY\u2026\n\nNIGERIA has \u201cfood system focused development agenda that prioritises healthy diets and affordable nutrition, inclusive, efficient, resilient and sustainable, which will contribute to rebuilding our economy, create jobs and spur growth across sectors, while sustaining our ecosystems,\u201d Buhari told the UN. If you do not understand this, be consoled that he was addressing the UN, not you.\n\nTHE biggest move of Nigeria\u2019s security agencies last week was to disrupt the peaceful march of the Shittes in Abuja. Lives were lost and tension in the city rose. How did the annual religious procession disturb anyone?\n\nGREAT news out of Maiduguri was that NNPC was building power plants to restore electricity in the State. Borno has been without electricity for nine months after terrorists blew up two power plants. Why would this be priority for NNPC when most parts of Niger Delta, whose resources sustain NNPC has no electricity? Who will save the new facility from terrorists?\n\nDID you hear the Nigerian government allegedly paid some homeless Americans to counter a protest at the UN? It could be the global test run of TraderMoni, Buhari\u2019s social security scheme that has technically defeated poverty in Nigeria.\n\nIsiguzo is a major commentator on minor issues",

          "text": "Nigerians have said that what the country marked last Friday should not be said to be real freedom, as they were still in servitude in all respects.\n\nSpeaking with BusinessDay, a number of Nigerians said their lives were worse off now than a few years ago by every standard.\n\nA commercial motorcycle operator was livid with anger Friday, when our correspondent said to him, \u201cHappy Independence anniversary.\u201d In response, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you are talking about. I am not part of the celebration and I do not have any reason to be. For me, there is nothing like Independence. I graduated from a college of education in Ekiti State some years ago, and I ended up as an Okada rider, and you want me to be happy that I am a Nigerian?\u201d\n\nSome others who spoke to BusinessDay pointed to the escalating insecurity across the country, forcing some state governments to shut down telecoms network and outlawed some businesses in their domain.\n\nSpeaking on the dire economic implication of such decision in 21st century Nigeria, Aliyu Umar Babangida, a retired Army captain, noted that one of the main triggers of insecurity is poverty. According to him, when telecoms services are shut down, poverty increases.\n\n\u201cWe must understand something here; you can\u2019t give what you don\u2019t have. The problems that led to the shutting down telecoms services did not start with a snap of the finger, but they started very small and morphed into an inferno. If you look at it, the biggest fire has to start with a spark. Your fire safety and fire prevention policies will determine whether you get an inferno or hell fire. So, when you see an entire state being shut down, and you know that everything you can think of today has to depend on the network. People are earning their livelihood from there; families need it for communication with loved ones,\u201d Aliyu said.\n\n\u201cWhat they have done is like saying let\u2019s shut all the forests down without thinking about the ecological implications; the green house effect; God knows what next we are going to shut down,\u201d he said.\n\nMany Nigerians have indeed not known real freedom despite the country attaining political independence in 1960. Sixty-one years after independence the country is still tied to the apron string of the West.\n\nRead Also: How flawed elections cripple democracy in Nigeria since independence\n\nIt has continued to depend on foreign countries for everything. While the country marked 61 years of Independence last Friday, many citizens were in various categories of slavery and captivity.\n\nMany were being held in kidnappers\u2019 den. Some were being held in bandit\u2019s dungeon where some hefty ransom was being demanded for their freedom. Many were being held in ritualists\u2019 dens. It cannot be truly said that Nigerians are free.\n\nSpeaking in separate interviews with BusinessDay, they noted that Nigeria must reform the electoral process to aid the recruitment of credible leaders who are ready to serve.\n\nAmid the spate of insecurity, increasing country debt profile and worsening standard of living which has resulted in the country being ranked as the poverty capital of the world, many Nigerians are determined that there has to be a change.\n\nFemi Pedro, Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), said the country may be free from foreign domination and control, but stressed that leaders have to be ready to think outside the box, and listen to advice for the country to make any meaningful progress.\n\n\u201cNigeria may be a free country now because we don\u2019t have any foreign domination in any part of the country. Sixty-one years after independence we all agreed that leadership is a problem, governance has failed. I do not support what is going on now.\n\n\u201cOur leaders have to think outside the box. At 61 obviously, we are not where we should be presently. The problem is leadership, and the leadership recruitment process has to change,\u201d Pedro said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cLeaders have to listen to advice from elders; it is poor people that are hard hit with bad governance. They should think of the way forward, the future of the country and what should be done.\u201d\n\nPedro added that Nigeria\u2019s situation had aggravated because the wealth of the county had been wasted over the years.\n\n\u201cThings are really terrible now, in my own profession we have seen a Justice of the Supreme Court, taking plates to beg for food. We pray things don\u2019t get worse. We have oil but we have not been able to manage our revenue well and you can see us going to beg. The money has been siphoned for personal pockets, which is the main issue here.\u201d\n\nThe SAN also pointed out that \u201cGoing forward we have to change socially and economically. Our leaders have to think outside the box for governance to impact on the people.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in similar vein, former National Publicity Secretary of the Action Democratic Party (ADP), Adelaja Adeoye also carpeted President Muhammadu Buhari for leading Nigeria into a generational debt trap, saying what Nigerians needed to do last Friday was not celebration but sober reflection.\n\nHe said that the controversy regarding the collection of Value Added Tax (VAT) between the states and federal government should not be what should cause rancor, adding that President Buhari should focus on tackling rising poverty in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing to celebrate about the independence; check round the country, people are crying of hunger. No work, no food; even when government is borrowing heavily.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, most of the borrowed funds end up in the pockets of the powerful, through one means or the other, which leaves the country to be fully exposed to her lenders,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWhen President Olusegun Obasanjo came to power in 1999, one of his efforts was to get our huge loans, which were accumulated by the Military regimes forgiven, and he achieved that.\n\n\u201cThe country started on a clean note again after 1999, but it is so worrisome that between that time and now, our country is now in debt to the tune of N33.107 trillion, which is not reflective in our national development, be it human or infrastructural development.\n\n\u201cThe report from Debt Management Office noted that, Nigeria\u2019s Public Debt Stock as at March 31, 2021. The Total Public Debt Stock which comprises the Debt Stock of the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN), thirty-six (36) State Governments and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) stood at N33.107 trillion or USD87.239 billion.\u201d\n\nHe further pointed out that \u201cThe Debt Stock also includes Promissory Notes in the sum of N940.220 billion issued to settle the inherited arrears of the FGN to State Governments, Oil Marketing Companies, Exporters and Local Contractors. Compared to the Total Public Debt Stock of N32.916 trillion as at December 31, 2020, the increase in the Debt Stock was marginal at 0.58percent.\n\n\u201cWorrisomely, when President Buhari came to power, he told the entire world that he met an empty treasury, but shortly after, some states were given what they termed as bailout funds. Nigerians also witnessed that when an election is closer in some APC controlled states, a bail out grant of N10 billion was also extended to them.\u201d",
          "summary": "Nigerians have said that what the country marked last Friday should not be said to be real freedom, as they were still in servitude in all respects.\nSpeaking with BusinessDay, a number of Nigerians said their lives were worse off now than a few years ago by every standard.\nMany Nigerians have indeed not known real freedom despite the country attaining political independence in 1960.\n\u201cThe report from Debt Management Office noted that, Nigeria\u2019s Public Debt Stock as at March 31, 2021.\nCompared to the Total Public Debt Stock of N32.916 trillion as at December 31, 2020, the increase in the Debt Stock was marginal at 0.58percent.",

          "title": "Pandora Papers: Global investigation exposes secrets of some of Nigeria\u2019s rich and powerful",
          "text": "A new global investigation exposing the offshore hideaways of some of the world\u2019s most powerful personalities is launching today after two years of discreet work by investigative journalists around the world.\n\nThe project, known as Pandora Papers, is facilitated by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), which obtained a trove of 11.9 million confidential files. The reporting, which is still ongoing, involves more than 600 journalists from 150 news organisations around the world.\n\nThe journalists spent two years studying and sorting files, contextualising information, tracking down sources and analysing public records and other documents.\n\nThe collaboration has so far revealed the financial secrets of not less than 35 current and former world leaders, more than 330 public officials in more than 91 countries and territories.\n\nThe leaked files were retrieved from 14 offshore services firms around the world that set up shell companies and other offshore entities for clients, many of them influential politicians, businesspersons and criminals, seeking to conceal their financial dealings.\n\nPREMIUM TIMES is the only Nigerian newspaper participating in what has now been dubbed the biggest journalism partnership in history.\n\nThe stories we will publish in the days to come will reveal how some of the most influential Nigerians \u2013 a former Chief Justice of Nigeria, current and former state governors, past and present lawmakers, businesspeople, a popular pastor and many others \u2013 set up shell companies, and sometimes warehouse huge financial assets, in notorious secrecy jurisdictions.\n\nOur stories will also show how some of these individuals flout extant laws and legislations as they hide these assets, some of which have attracted the interest of law enforcement agencies in the UK and elsewhere.\n\nIn an era of widening authoritarianism and inequality, ICIJ said \u201cthe Pandora Papers investigation provides an unequalled perspective on how money and power operate in the 21st century \u2014 and how the rule of law has been bent and broken around the world by a system of financial secrecy enabled by the U.S. and other wealthy nations.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\n\u201cIn popular imagination, the offshore system is often seen as a far-flung scattering of palm-shaded islands. The Pandora Papers show that the offshore money machine operates in every corner of the world, including financial capitals of the richest and most powerful economies,\u201d the ICIJ added.\n\nGlobally, the Pandora Papers investigation will reveal the secret owners of offshore companies, anonymous bank accounts, private jets, yachts, mansions, and artworks by Picasso, Banksy, and other masters.\n\n\u201cIt provides more information than what\u2019s usually available to law enforcement agencies and cash-strapped governments,\u201d the ICIJ said.\n\n\u201cLarge numbers of public officials and mega-wealthy individuals \u2014 who in some cases are one and the same \u2014 use the offshore system to manage, move and, often, hide their wealth. They play by different rules from the rest of humanity, in a game of intrigue and privilege that fuels crime and corruption and entrenches the power of the world\u2019s economic and political elites.\n\n\u201cThe Pandora Papers investigation is larger and more global than even ICIJ\u2019s landmark Panama Papers investigation, which rocked the world in 2016, spawning police raids and new laws in dozens of countries and the fall of prime ministers in Iceland and Pakistan.\n\n\u201cThe Panama Papers came from the files of a single offshore services provider: the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca. The Pandora Papers shine a light on a far wider cross-section of the lawyers, middlemen and fixers who are at the heart of the offshore industry.\n\n\u201cThe Pandora Papers lay bare the finances of many more country leaders and public officials than did the Panama Papers and provide more than twice as much information about the ownership of offshore companies. In all, the new leaks uncover the real owners of more than 29,000 offshore companies the owners come from more than 200 countries, with the largest contingents from Russia, the U.K., Argentina, China and Brazil.\u201d\n\nThe Pandora Papers Vs Panama Papers\n\nThe Pandora Papers series is launching more than five years after the Panama Papers revelations, which were published in 2016. That investigation exposed offshore companies linked to more than 140 politicians in more than 50 countries \u2013 including 14 world leaders.\n\nIt also uncovered offshore hideaways tied to mega-banks, corporate bribery scandals, drug kingpins, Syria\u2019s air war on its own citizens and a network of people close to Russian President Vladimir Putin who shuffled as much as $2 billion around the world.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn the course of that investigation in Nigeria, PREMIUM TIMES published more than 30 stories, with damning details revealing the secret offshore asset of many prominent Nigerians.\n\nIt is not illegal for Nigerians who are not public officers to own offshore accounts, and many prominent businesses do have them. However, some public officials found to have accounts did not disclose them as expected by law.\n\nThis newspaper\u2019s investigations revealed the secret offshore assets of Senate President Bukola Saraki and his wife Toyin; as well as those of Mr Saraki\u2019s predecessor, David Mark.\n\nIt also revealed how the late governor of Bayelsa State, Diepreye Alamieyeseigha, began looting his state and hiding public funds in offshore structures and how a former governor of Delta State, James Ibori, organised the stealing of the oil-rich state\u2019s fund via offshore companies.\n\nThe investigations also revealed a network of shell companies in offshore tax havens linked to Africa\u2019s richest man, Aliko Dangote, and his brother, Sayyu Dantata; as well as the offshore companies of Wale Tinubu, the chief executive of Nigeria\u2019s biggest indigenous oil company, Oando Plc, among others.\n\nSimilarly, the stories also exposed the secret offshore company of one of Africa\u2019s most influential televangelists, Temitope Joshua, popularly called T.B Joshua, who died in June.\n\nOther prominent Nigerians named in the investigations were former Minister of Defence and billionaire businessman, Theophilus Danjuma; Businessman, Hakeem Bello Osaigie; Globacom CEO, Mike Adenuga; Governor Abubakar Sadiq Sani Bello of Niger State; the late Ooni of Ife, Okunade Sijuwade; former Arik Air Chairman, Joseph Arumemi-Johnson and his wife, Mary, as well as two then-serving senators \u2013 Andy Uba (Anambra) and Ibrahim Gobir (Sokoto).\n\nOther top business persons, politicians, and their family members were also found in the infamous database, including those who were then holding public offices.\n\nThe revelations sparked outrage across Nigeria, with activists, civil society organisations, the labour movement and the general public calling for extensive probes of those mentioned. But none of the violators has so far been prosecuted or sanctioned.\n\n\u201cThe Pandora Papers series will be even more revealing,\u201d Nicholas Ibekwe, PREMIUM TIMES head of investigations, said. \u201cWe hope the Nigerian authorities will take appropriate actions this time around to sanction those proven to have violated our laws.\u201d",

          "text": "Bishop of Sokoto Catholic Diocese, Matthew Hassan Kukah, has asked President Muhammadu Buhari why he has refused to release names of identified sponsors of Boko Haram terrorists, noting that the administration is not sincere in dealing with the terror group.\n\nBishop Kukah who spoke in a sermon at the Priestly Ordination of Five Deacons at the Holy Family Cathedral, wondered why it is difficult for the government to release names of sponsors of Boko Haram, regretting that \u201cNigeria is decomposing from within.\u201d\n\nKukah said, \u201cNigeria is a broken country. It is decomposing from within. Our heart is broken and lives are hemorrhaging by the day. We cannot go on like this. The country and people have become so traumatised and sedated by horrible news, that have now become comfortable in \u2018this swamp of evil.\n\n\u201cNo number of horrific deaths, murders, sexual violence and kidnapping of children or adults can make us stop our life of debauchery. Life goes in Nigeria! We become experts at burying the dead, but refuse to ask why the killings continue.\n\n\u201cMorally, we cannot tell what time it is. We cannot overstate the reality. It is clear that neither politics nor economic models can fix the country. The political class is in the state of inebriation with the drug of power and loot.\n\n\u201cWe neither know what is wrong nor who is wrong. We are hiding under the belief that the proponents or the apostles of this culture of death that has turned our country into an inferno have neither name or address.\n\n\u201cThe federal government has told us it is not ready to publicise the names of those funding Boko Haram. We cannot go on like this. Interrogating, questioning these existential threats to our common humanity is the apostolate that we Priests are called to.\n\n\u201cWe know that this road is dangerous, it is rocky, it is treacherous, it takes lives, but it is all too familiar. We Christians know its name: it is metaphorically called Golgotha. If Golgotha was a footpath, the resurrection blasted a high way to redemption on it.\u201d\n\nContinuing, he lamented that \u201cEverywhere we turn, the bodies and the emotions of men and women are irretrievably broken.\n\n\u201cOur people, fleeing their homes after over ten years have now turned Refugee camps into their habitats. Our identity as citizens is being traded for the status of migrants and refugees.\n\n\u201cThe civic space is slowly closing as citizens are losing ordinary freedoms to the crippling hands of totalitarianism.\u201d\n\nKukah urged priests to offer a clearer path for the nation, ensuring that even when the Lord sleeps, He is awake and that the boat will not sink. We only need to banish our fears and trust in Him.\n\n\u201cLet us reaffirm our commitment to the fact that, as the holy book says, There is a time for everything under the sun. A time for corona and a time for ending corona.\n\n\u201cA time for kidnapping and a time for stopping kidnapping. A time for living and a time for dying. It is for a time like this that the priesthood was instituted.\n\n\u201cTimes like these compel us to rethink why the Lord instituted the priesthood. We then pause and thank Him for this wonderful gift.\n\n\u201cWe must encourage our people to return to the silent sacredness of the Blessed Sacrament and avoid the BetNaija mentality that believes that everything simply depends on magic and luck. Faith is not based on luck. It is, as the Catechism says a gift of God which enables us to believe.\u201d",

          "title": "$1.4 Million Malabu largesse: How Aliyu Gusau\u2019s man, Umar Bature was arrested in London",
          "text": "Details have emerged of how Umar Bature, a former member of Nigeria\u2019s House of Representatives, was arrested in London while distributing suspicious funds suspected to have been meant for a former Nigerian National Security Adviser (NSA), Aliyu Mohammed Gusau.\n\nMr Bature, an ally of Mr Gusau, was arrested after he met Jeffrey Tesler, a British businessman previously involved in the case of international corruption known as the \u201cBonny Island\u201d Halliburton scandal. Mr Tesler also doubles as a friend and ally of Mr Gusau.\n\nThe money is suspected to be among the slush funds distributed in connection with the Malabu scandal.\n\nThe new details are found in documents obtained exclusively by PREMIUM TIMES from exhibits submitted in a case filed in the United States by oil giant, ENI.\n\nMr Tesler is a British citizen already implicated in the Halliburton-Bonny Island scandal regarding the bribery of Nigerian public officials, which also involved SAIPEM, a company that was until 2016 a subsidiary of ENI.\n\nMr Gusau, easily one of the most influential figures in Nigeria\u2019s military intelligence circles, was head of the secret military service in Nigeria between 1988 and 1989. He later became director of national security for former presidents Olusegun Obasanjo and Goodluck Jonathan. He also served briefly as Minister of Defence under Mr Jonathan.\n\nMr Bature was a member of the House of Representatives, where he represented Sokoto North/South Federal Constituency. He had earlier served in the Nigerian Armed Forces until he retired in 2003 and joined partisan politics. He is said to have become a \u201cprotegee\u201d of Mr Gusau during his days in the Armed Forces. He is currently serving as Commissioner for Water Resources in Sokoto State.\n\nThe Malabu Backstory\n\nThe Malabu scandal involved the transfer of about $1.1 billion by Shell and ENI through the Nigerian government to accounts controlled by Dan Etete, a former Nigerian oil minister.\n\nFrom the former minister\u2019s accounts, prosecutors say about half the money went to accounts of companies controlled by Aliyu Abubakar, a middleman popularly known in Nigeria as the owner of AA oil. Anti-corruption investigators and activists suspect he fronted for top officials of the Goodluck Jonathan administration as well of officials of Shell and ENI. He denied wrongdoing.\n\nThe Malabu transaction was authorised in 2011 by former President Goodluck Jonathan through some of his cabinet ministers and the money was payment for OPL 245, one of Nigeria\u2019s richest oil blocks.\n\nThe oil resources of the OPL 245 license have remained undeveloped since the controversies began. ENI initiated international arbitration proceedings against Nigeria last September, alleging the government had breached its obligations by refusing to let the firm develop the license.\n\nFresh Details\n\nFresh details seen in documents reviewed by PREMIUM TIMES have provided insights into the roles of other Nigerians in the long-running Malabu scandal.\n\nIn one of the exhibits submitted by Eni, Mr Tesler explained the role of Mr Bature in the scandal. Until now, Mr Bature\u2019s name and alleged roles have never been reported in the controversial deal.\n\nOn January 9, 2014, details showed that Mr Tesler went into a police station in London, handed over a bag containing the sum of \u00a3378,670 in cash, and made statements about the circumstances under which he came into possession of the money.\n\nIn summary, Mr Tesler reported that he had entered into a cooperation agreement with the government of the United States, ostensibly regarding investigations on the Halliburton scandal, thus obtaining a type of immunity in exchange for his activities as an informant.\n\nFor this reason, through his lawyers in New York, he advised the US government of his meeting, on November 15, 2013, with a man of Nigerian nationality, who introduced himself as \u201cUmar Bature\u201d, who had informed him that Dan Etete, former Nigerian oil minister, intended to transfer to him the sum of $2 million at a foreign exchange office in Abuja.\n\n\u24d8\n\nMr Bature had, therefore, asked him to provide bank details so as to credit the money to him. In response to his answer of not having an account that could be used for such purpose, Mr Bature said that the money, net of commissions for the transfer, could be collected by him in London in several tranches.\n\n\u201cAccording to Tesler, at that first meeting, he had not been told the origin of the money, nor the reason for which he was the beneficiary,\u201d the document said.\n\n\u201cIn the performance of the agreement entered into with the Department of Justice of the United States, he had drafted a memo summarising the content of the meeting with Bature, and had sent it to his lawyers, so that they could inform the United States legal authorities.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further in his account to the British police officers, Mr Tesler stated that he had not had further news of Mr Etete and the money until the evening of January 8, 2014, when he received a phone call from General Mohammed Aliyu Gusau, who informed him that within a few minutes he would receive another phone call.\n\n\u201cIndeed, at 7:15 p.m., Umar Bature phoned him, presenting himself as the person he met on a previous occasion and asked if they could meet so that he could give him something,\u201d the document said.\n\n\u201cThey made an appointment to meet at 8:00 p.m. at the Cavendish Hotel on German Street in Piccadilly, where Bature stated he was staying. He immediately informed his lawyer, who told him the instructions received from the United States to collect the money and not spend it.\n\n\u201cTherefore, he went to the appointment, meeting with Bature in his room, and there received a very heavy suitcase, extracted from a case, inside which, according to Bature, there was the sum of GBP 378,000 in small bills. Bature asked him to return the following day to receive another suitcase and to discuss the commissions to be paid.\n\n\u201cAfter the meeting was finished, he immediately informed his lawyer of the events, who told him a few hours later that he would be contacted by an FBI agent. Indeed, the day after, at noon, he received a phone call from a certain John Coushad, who told him that he had already informed the police authorities of the United Kingdom and to not go to the next appointment with Bature.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on how he met Mr Gusau, Mr Tesler explained that he had had a long relationship of continuous visits with him, meeting him whenever he came to London, which normally happened once every 4- 6 weeks, and speaking on these occasions of the political-economic events of Nigeria.\n\nHe added that he met Mr Bature in November 2013 and January 8, 2014, adding that he had not asked questions on the origin of the money and the reasons for which Mr Etete had sent it to him so as to not place himself in danger.\n\nWhen asked by the English police agent whether he knew the reason why Mr Etete had sent him the money, he said, according to details of the exhibit: \u201c\u2026two million is a drop in the ocean compared to the amount of money which he collected from Shell and Agip \u2026\u201d The document added that Mr Tesler, therefore, \u201clinks the sum of money in cash given to him by Umar Bature on behalf of Dan Etete to the price received by the latter from ENI and Shell for OPL 245.\u201d\n\n\u24d8\n\nThe documents further explained that Mr Bature had had a role in the negotiation for the sale of OPL 245 because, since 2009, he has participated in meetings between Messrs Etete, Agaev, and employees of Shell. He was also serially identified as \u201cGusau man\u201d.\n\nThe next day, the document showed, Mr Bature was arrested and interrogated by an agent of the anti-money laundering team of New Scotland Yard.\n\nDuring interrogation, the document said, Mr Bature admitted to having been commissioned to take the amount of $1.4 million to Mr Tesler, a friend of his \u201cboss\u201d.\n\nHe also reportedly admitted to having gone along with his \u201cboss\u201d to currency exchange offices that were legally recognised in Nigeria to check how to transfer this sum of money to the United Kingdom and, indeed, agreed on the transfer to the United Kingdom in exchange for a commission of 7.8 per cent.\n\nThe document said that Mr Bature also confirmed that his \u201cboss\u201d, from whom he received the assignment, is General Aliyu Mohammed Gusau, a Nigerian minister at the time. He also added that he flew to London from Dubai at the request of the General to deliver the money to Mr Tesler.\n\nMr Bature also claimed, according to the documents, to have handed over to Mr Tesler, who he had already met previously several times, the sum of GBP 374,000, as the first tranche of a total sum of 1.3 million allocated to him. He added that he received the money, in turn, from a Nigerian citizen, who was also arrested, named Gabriel Oziegbe.\n\n\u201cIn actual fact, the money given by Tesler and seized by the British authorities amounted to GBP 378,670. Also, Gabriel Oziegbe was interrogated by the English police and confirmed Bature\u2019s story. A considerable further amount of money in cash, for a total amount of $50,000 and GBP 82,173, was seized from him,\u201d the document reads in part.\n\n\u201cThe general Aliyu Mohammed, to whom Bature refers, is certainly the General Aliyu Mohamed Gusau, given that he held a variety of positions in the Nigerian Armed Forces up to the highest levels of the secret services of that country, and was then national security adviser to two presidents of the republic.\n\n\u201cGusau has been a friend of Tesler for years, as stated by the latter; it was Gusau who told Tesler in advance, on the same day, about Bature\u2019s telephone call pre-announcing the delivery of the money. Bature was already indicated in 2009 as \u201ca man of Gusau\u201d by Copleston, who, by collecting information on the field in Nigeria on behalf of Shell on the strength of his previous experience as an MI6 agent, probably came to know about the relationship between the two, dating back to their common past of belonging to the Nigerian Armed Forces.\u201d\n\nThe document claimed that the revelation reflects the statements of Ednan Agaev, an ex-Russian diplomat, regarding the fact that in relation to the deal of OPL 245, \u201cGusau was expecting a commission from Etete\u201d. The revelation also finds confirmation in the statements made to the investigators by Jonathan Benton, the former head of the Corruption Unit of the Metropolitan Police of London, which had investigated the OPL 245 Malabu saga, it added.\n\nMessrs Etete and Gusau are believed to be close allies. In one of his disclosures in 2019, Mr Agaev claimed that he was introduced to Mr Etete by Mr Gusau in 2008.\n\nWhen contacted Thursday night, Mr Bature told PREMIUM TIMES he had nothing to say about the matter.\n\nMr Gusau, on his part, did not return telephone calls and text messages seeking comments from him.\n\nIn March, PREMIUM TIMES reported how an Italian court in Milan acquitted Shell, Eni and their managers in the long-drawn Malabu trial. But prosecutors reportedly lodged appeals against the verdict. An Italian newspaper quoted a Milan prosecutor as describing the acquittal judgment as \u201cthin and illogical\u201d.\n\nAnti-corruption groups monitoring the case in Nigeria and across Europe, including the Human and Environmental Development Agenda, (HEDA), Corner House and Re: Common, also criticised the acquittal judgement which they said distorted and ignored vital evidence.\n\n\u201cOur own analysis suggests that the Milan judgment was deeply flawed,\u201d Lanre Suraj, chair of HEDA, was quoted as saying in a joint statement in August.

Until now, Mr Bature\u2019s name and alleged roles have never been reported in the controversial deal.\n\nOn January 9, 2014, details showed that Mr Tesler went into a police station in London, handed over a bag containing the sum of \u00a3378,670 in cash, and made statements about the circumstances under which he came into possession of the money.\n\nIn summary, Mr Tesler reported that he had entered into a cooperation agreement with the government of the United States, ostensibly regarding investigations on the Halliburton scandal, thus obtaining a type of immunity in exchange for his activities as an informant.\n\nFor this reason, through his lawyers in New York, he advised the US government of his meeting, on November 15, 2013, with a man of Nigerian nationality, who introduced himself as \u201cUmar Bature\u201d, who had informed him that Dan Etete, former Nigerian oil minister, intended to transfer to him the sum of $2 million at a foreign exchange office in Abuja.\n\n\u24d8\n\nMr Bature had, therefore, asked him to provide bank details so as to credit the money to him. In response to his answer of not having an account that could be used for such purpose, Mr Bature said that the money, net of commissions for the transfer, could be collected by him in London in several tranches.\n\n\u201cAccording to Tesler, at that first meeting, he had not been told the origin of the money, nor the reason for which he was the beneficiary,\u201d the document said.\n\n\u201cIn the performance of the agreement entered into with the Department of Justice of the United States, he had drafted a memo summarising the content of the meeting with Bature, and had sent it to his lawyers, so that they could inform the United States legal authorities.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further in his account to the British police officers, Mr Tesler stated that he had not had further news of Mr Etete and the money until the evening of January 8, 2014, when he received a phone call from General Mohammed Aliyu Gusau, who informed him that within a few minutes he would receive another phone call.\n\n\u201cIndeed, at 7:15 p.m., Umar Bature phoned him, presenting himself as the person he met on a previous occasion and asked if they could meet so that he could give him something,\u201d the document said.\n\n\u201cThey made an appointment to meet at 8:00 p.m. at the Cavendish Hotel on German Street in Piccadilly, where Bature stated he was staying. He immediately informed his lawyer, who told him the instructions received from the United States to collect the money and not spend it.\n\n\u201cTherefore, he went to the appointment, meeting with Bature in his room, and there received a very heavy suitcase, extracted from a case, inside which, according to Bature, there was the sum of GBP 378,000 in small bills. Bature asked him to return the following day to receive another suitcase and to discuss the commissions to be paid.\n\n\u201cAfter the meeting was finished, he immediately informed his lawyer of the events, who told him a few hours later that he would be contacted by an FBI agent. Indeed, the day after, at noon, he received a phone call from a certain John Coushad, who told him that he had already informed the police authorities of the United Kingdom and to not go to the next appointment with Bature.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on how he met Mr Gusau, Mr Tesler explained that he had had a long relationship of continuous visits with him, meeting him whenever he came to London, which normally happened once every 4- 6 weeks, and speaking on these occasions of the political-economic events of Nigeria.\n\nHe added that he met Mr Bature in November 2013 and January 8, 2014, adding that he had not asked questions on the origin of the money and the reasons for which Mr Etete had sent it to him so as to not place himself in danger.\n\nWhen asked by the English police agent whether he knew the reason why Mr Etete had sent him the money, he said, according to details of the exhibit: \u201c\u2026two million is a drop in the ocean compared to the amount of money which he collected from Shell and Agip \u2026\u201d The document added that Mr Tesler, therefore, \u201clinks the sum of money in cash given to him by Umar Bature on behalf of Dan Etete to the price received by the latter from ENI and Shell for OPL 245.\u201d\n\n\u24d8\n\nThe documents further explained that Mr Bature had had a role in the negotiation for the sale of OPL 245 because, since 2009, he has participated in meetings between Messrs Etete, Agaev, and employees of Shell. He was also serially identified as \u201cGusau man\u201d.\n\nThe next day, the document showed, Mr Bature was arrested and interrogated by an agent of the anti-money laundering team of New Scotland Yard.\n\nDuring interrogation, the document said, Mr Bature admitted to having been commissioned to take the amount of $1.4 million to Mr Tesler, a friend of his \u201cboss\u201d.\n\nHe also reportedly admitted to having gone along with his \u201cboss\u201d to currency exchange offices that were legally recognised in Nigeria to check how to transfer this sum of money to the United Kingdom and, indeed, agreed on the transfer to the United Kingdom in exchange for a commission of 7.8 per cent.\n\nThe document said that Mr Bature also confirmed that his \u201cboss\u201d, from whom he received the assignment, is General Aliyu Mohammed Gusau, a Nigerian minister at the time. He also added that he flew to London from Dubai at the request of the General to deliver the money to Mr Tesler.\n\nMr Bature also claimed, according to the documents, to have handed over to Mr Tesler, who he had already met previously several times, the sum of GBP 374,000, as the first tranche of a total sum of 1.3 million allocated to him. He added that he received the money, in turn, from a Nigerian citizen, who was also arrested, named Gabriel Oziegbe.\n\n\u201cIn actual fact, the money given by Tesler and seized by the British authorities amounted to GBP 378,670. Also, Gabriel Oziegbe was interrogated by the English police and confirmed Bature\u2019s story. A considerable further amount of money in cash, for a total amount of $50,000 and GBP 82,173, was seized from him,\u201d the document reads in part.\n\n\u201cThe general Aliyu Mohammed, to whom Bature refers, is certainly the General Aliyu Mohamed Gusau, given that he held a variety of positions in the Nigerian Armed Forces up to the highest levels of the secret services of that country, and was then national security adviser to two presidents of the republic.\n\n\u201cGusau has been a friend of Tesler for years, as stated by the latter; it was Gusau who told Tesler in advance, on the same day, about Bature\u2019s telephone call pre-announcing the delivery of the money. Bature was already indicated in 2009 as \u201ca man of Gusau\u201d by Copleston, who, by collecting information on the field in Nigeria on behalf of Shell on the strength of his previous experience as an MI6 agent, probably came to know about the relationship between the two, dating back to their common past of belonging to the Nigerian Armed Forces.\u201d\n\nThe document claimed that the revelation reflects the statements of Ednan Agaev, an ex-Russian diplomat, regarding the fact that in relation to the deal of OPL 245, \u201cGusau was expecting a commission from Etete\u201d. The revelation also finds confirmation in the statements made to the investigators by Jonathan Benton, the former head of the Corruption Unit of the Metropolitan Police of London, which had investigated the OPL 245 Malabu saga, it added.\n\nMessrs Etete and Gusau are believed to be close allies. In one of his disclosures in 2019, Mr Agaev claimed that he was introduced to Mr Etete by Mr Gusau in 2008.\n\nWhen contacted Thursday night, Mr Bature told PREMIUM TIMES he had nothing to say about the matter.\n\nMr Gusau, on his part, did not return telephone calls and text messages seeking comments from him.\n\nIn March, PREMIUM TIMES reported how an Italian court in Milan acquitted Shell, Eni and their managers in the long-drawn Malabu trial. But prosecutors reportedly lodged appeals against the verdict. An Italian newspaper quoted a Milan prosecutor as describing the acquittal judgment as \u201cthin and illogical\u201d.\n\nAnti-corruption groups monitoring the case in Nigeria and across Europe, including the Human and Environmental Development Agenda, (HEDA), Corner House and Re: Common, also criticised the acquittal judgement which they said distorted and ignored vital evidence.\n\n\u201cOur own analysis suggests that the Milan judgment was deeply flawed,\u201d Lanre Suraj, chair of HEDA, was quoted as saying in a joint statement in August.

It is therefore important to make clarifications regarding the air interdiction mission conducted in the general area. For the records, it is pertinent to state that the Air Component of Operation HADIN KAI on 26 September 2021, acting on credible actionable intelligence on the activities of terrorists in an identified ISWAP Camp at the said location, conducted air strikes on the target.\n\n\u201cThis was after careful Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance missions revealed the activities of ISWAP elements in the location. Consequently, the intelligence gathered was processed and carefully analyzed between the period of 19 August and 23 September 2021. Persons wearing combat vests and uniforms identified as ISWAP-styled uniforms were seen within the camp. Furthermore, neither women nor children were noticed in or around the camp, just as no fishing activities were seen. Instead, canoes loaded with unidentified items were seen parked but not engaged in any fishing activity, an indication that they were to be ferried to another location. Having carefully ascertained that nearby civilian settlements were not in the line of fire and a precision strike would disrupt ISWAP logistics movement and neutralize them; a decision was made to conduct a strike on the ISWAP camp. Although casualty figures could not be ascertained, the strike was verified to be successful in disrupting ISWAP logistics movement and foot soldiers\u201d.\n\nThe statement added that, \u201cIt is important to state that the location is a well-known ISWAP enclave and there is an existing ban on fishing activities within the area. Additionally, the general area is known as a gateway for movement of logistics by ISWAP elements especially from Kirta and Wulgo locations. Therefore, the Nigerian Military wishes to state categorically that necessary steps were taken to ensure that the presence of the terrorists was ascertained and the strike was precise and professionally executed\u201d.\n\nThe Military High Command said it will continue to ensure that its troops safe guard lives and properties of innocent citizens.\n\nWhile appreciating the general public for their continuous support, the High Command further encouraged all to avail the military with credible and timely information that will facilitate its proactive engagements in the fight against terrorism.",

          "text": "The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to \u201curgently withdraw the impermissible conditions imposed on Twitter pending the final determination of the suit at the ECOWAS Court of Justice in Abuja challenging the legality\u201d of suspending the microblogging platform.\n\nAccording to a statement on Sunday by its Deputy Director, Kolawole Oluwadare, SERAP urged the president to withdraw the clauses in a bid to allow the court render a decision on the central issues in the case, and protect the plaintiffs\u2019 rights and interests.\n\nPresident Buhari had stated in his address to mark Nigeria\u2019s 61th independence anniversary, that the Federal Government would only lift the suspension of Twitter in Nigeria if certain conditions, including concerns around national security, are met.\n\nThe address also seems to suggest that even when the suspension is lifted, Nigerians will only be allowed to use Twitter \u201cfor business and positive engagements.\u201d\n\nRead Also: Abducted Zamfara Speaker\u2019s Father Reportedly Dies In Kidnappers\u2019 Den\n\nHowever, in an open letter dated 2 October 2021, SERAP said: \u201cThe conditions imposed on Twitter while the ECOWAS case is pending constitute an interference with the right of SERAP and other plaintiffs to fairly and effectively pursue a judicial challenge to the decision by your government to suspend Twitter in Nigeria.\n\nThe organization said: \u201cThe conditions make a mockery of the case pending before the ECOWAS court, and create a risk that the course of justice will be seriously impeded or prejudiced in this case. Protecting the right to a judicial recourse and due administration of justice is of utmost importance, being the cornerstone of an ordered society.\u201d\n\nAccording to SERAP: \u201cImposing impermissible conditions on Twitter would undermine the rights and interests of the Plaintiffs in the ECOWAS Court case filed against your government, as the conditions directly touch on the central issues of freedom of expression and access to information, which the court is set to determine and rule upon.\u201d\n\nThe letter, read in part: \u201cPushing conditions on Twitter while the ECOWAS case is pending would prejudice the interests of the Plaintiffs, undermine the ability of ECOWAS court to do justice in the case, damage public confidence in the court, and prejudice the outcome of the case.\n\n\u201cIt is in the public interest to keep the streams of justice clear and pure, and to maintain the authority of the ECOWAS court in the case. If not immediately withdrawn, the conditions would seriously undermine Nigeria\u2019s international human rights obligations including under ECOWAS treaties and protocols, and have serious consequences for the public interest.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven that the only way in which SERAP and other plaintiffs can have a fair and effective access to justice is to allow the court to decide on the merits of the case before it, fairness and justice must, on the facts of the ECOWAS case, outweigh any stated national security conditions.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour government should allow the ECOWAS Court to decide these issues, especially as the Federal Government has made the arguments on national security before the court.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe core of the principle of judicial independence is the complete liberty of the judge to hear and decide the cases before them on the basis of facts and in accordance with the law, without any improper interference, direct or indirect.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe principle of the independence of the judiciary has also been enshrined in the Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary, endorsed by the General Assembly in 1985.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Principles provide, inter alia, that it is the duty of all governmental and other institutions to respect and observe the independence of the judiciary (principle 1); that judges shall decide matters before them impartially without any restrictions or interferences, direct or indirect, from any quarter or for any reason (principle 2); and that there shall not be any inappropriate or unwarranted interference with the judicial process (principle 4).\u201d\n\nSERAP, therefore, urged the president to urgently withdraw the conditions imposed on Twitter, and to allow the ECOWAS court to decide on the suit brought by the organization and other plaintiffs challenging the legality of the suspension of Twitter in Nigeria, as judgment in the suit is fixed for 20th, January 2022.",

For 61 years, we have existed and lived together as one independent nation with our destiny in our hands,\u201d Governor Wike stated.\n\n\u201cBut at 61, it does not seem to me that there is anything worthy of our celebration except, perhaps, the fact that we have remained independent and managed to struggle with our existence for all these years.\u201d\n\nHe lamented that the country, which was charted by patriotic and visionary leaders to be the greatest black nation with quality human and capital assets, has rather derailed in that vision due to bad leadership, especially in the past six years of the All Progressive Congress-led Federal Government.\n\nAccording to the governor, the hope of Nigerians for the political leadership to harness the country\u2019s resources to drive economic growth, promote national unity, and protect lives and property is now a mirage, as the Federal Government has weakened the governance structure of the country and its institutions.",

Items recovered include 21 RLA 7.45mm ammo concealed in a water bottle, 16 packs of new two-way radio (Walkie talkie), four army coloured head masks, a wallet with an army ID card, 1USD, 2 FCMB, 1 First Bank, 1 Ecobank, 1 UBA, 1 Skye Bank ATM cards, and cannabis sativa; tablets of tramadol; three MTN, two 9mobile and one airtel simcards packs; one iPhone 12 pro; one Samsung A31; and one Nokia phones; seven NA pass letters; five handbags and one bagco bag containing personal belongings, as well as a gallon of palm oil.\n\nThey indicated that they were taking the exhibits to Kaduna and Kano, while Hayatu Galadima claimed to be a Lance Corporal serving in Ibadan.\n\nA statement released on Sunday by the Director, Media and Advocacy, Femi Babafemi said the suspects may have had contact with bandits in the North West and were possibly transporting ammunition and two-way radios to bandits who are currently excommunicated due to the suspension of telecommunications services in Zamfara, Sokoto, and Kaduna states, according to preliminary investigation.\n\nBrig. Gen. Mohamed Buba Marwa (Retd), Chairman/Chief Executive of the NDLEA, has directed the FCT Command of the Agency, which made the arrest, to hand over the suspects to the Nigerian Army and another intelligence agency, which had previously placed the two men on its watch list for further investigation.\n\nIn Rivers state, a final year student of Fine Arts and Design, University of Port Harcourt, Mario Okiwelu has been arrested for importing from the US five variants of liquid cannabis weighing 49.6grams. He was arrested through controlled delivery along with his accomplice, Precious Awuse on Monday 27th Sept, 2021 around NIPOST area, Port Harcourt.\n\nSimilarly, narcotic officers attached to some courier firms in Lagos have seized various sizes of illicit drugs, including 40 grams of cocaine hidden in a University of Uyo degree certificate bound for Australia; 280 grams of cannabis hidden in body cream bottles bound for Cyprus; 400 grams of tramadol tucked in plastic bottles bound for Australia; and 1 kilogram of methamphetamine hidden in a bottle bound for Australia.\n\nAttempts by some traffickers to also import into Nigeria 20 cartons of khat weighing 126.900 kilograms through the NAHCO import shed of the Murtala Mohammed International Airport, MMIA, Lagos, were thwarted and the consignment seized. Similarly, on Wednesday 29th Sept, one Ibrahim Kale Sulyman was arrested during cargo search operations at SAHCO export shed and sachets of tramadol weighing 76grams concealed inside black soap heading to Dubai, UAE, recovered from him.\n\nIn Kaduna, operatives arrested a widow, Aliya Idris on Saturday 25th September in the house of a wanted drug dealer, Shamsu Boda at Joji road, Tudun Wada Zaria. She was arrested during an operation at Shamsu Boda\u2019s house. Found in her possession were 30 bottles of cough syrup with codeine and 20 sachets of rophynol with gross weight of 4.2kg and 77.5 grams respectively.\n\nIn raids across Lagos state on Wednesday, 29th Sept, at least two drug dealers were arrested and over 1,213.2kg drugs seized.\n\nAt Ikosi, Ketu, Kosofe L.G.A, 22-year-old Peter Prosper Onome from Isoko, Delta State was arrested with 442 grams of different types of drugs including: 426 grams of Cannabis Sativa; 15 grams of Colorado; 6 grams of Cocaine; 4 grams of Rohypnol and 1 gram of Methamphetamine.

Also on the same day, officers of the Lagos Command of the Agency raided another notorious hideout in Petti, Lagos Island where they recovered an abandoned 1,213.2kg of Cannabis Sativa.\n\nIn his response, Gen. Marwa commended officers and soldiers from the Agency\u2019s FCT, Rivers, DOGI, MMIA, Kaduna, and Lagos Commands for exceptional performance in their respective areas of responsibility over the last week.

          "text": "Positive clinical trial results for Merck & Co\u2019s experimental antiviral COVID-19 pill reverberated through the healthcare sector on Friday, sending the drugmaker\u2019s stock price soaring while denting high-flying shares of vaccine companies and makers of other coronavirus therapies.\n\nMerck shares jumped as much as 12.3% and hit their highest level since February 2020 after data showed the company\u2019s pill molnupiravir could halve the chances of dying or being hospitalized for those most at risk of contracting severe COVID-19. Experts hailed the news as potentially a huge advance in the fight against COVID-19.\n\nAt the same time, shares of vaccine makers such as Moderna Inc, Pfizer Inc and partner BioNTech SE were hit, with some analysts saying the promise of an oral drug that can be taken at home could change the public perception of risks associated with COVID-19.\n\n\u201cWe see modest perceived headwind to vaccine stocks such as MRNA (Moderna) if the market thinks people will be less afraid of COVID-19 and less inclined to get vaccines, if there is a simple pill that can treat COVID-19,\u201d Jefferies analyst Michael Yee said in a client note.\n\nModerna shares tumbled 13% in midday trading, while Pfizer, which is developing a COVID-19 pill of its own, fell 1.3%. U.S. shares of BioNTech dropped 11%.\n\nFor Moderna investors, the Merck news presented an opportunity to lock in gains after an already stunning run.\n\nShares of Moderna, which were added to the S&P 500 in mid July, remain up some 220% in 2021 despite Friday\u2019s declines. BioNTech\u2019s shares were also still up about 200% for the year, even with Friday\u2019s fall.\n\nThe Merck news is a \u201cgreat reason for folks to be taking profits off the table\u201d in Moderna and BioNTech shares, said Sahak Manuelian, head of equity trading at Wedbush Securities.\n\n\u201cThese moves can get exacerbated to the downside given the momentum they have had to the upside.\u201d\n\nShares of other companies with COVID-19 vaccines also fell, with AstraZeneca down 2% and Novavax falling 16%.\n\nCompanies with other COVID-19 therapies that are administered intravenously or through injection also traded lower, with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals down nearly 5% and Gilead Sciences Inc off about 2%.\n\nHealthcare was the only one of the 11 S&P 500 sectors in negative territory in mid-day trading, falling 0.5%.\n\n\u201cWe see molnupiravir, with its oral format as a clear game changer that is likely to meaningfully impact not just the treatment paradigm for COVID-19 but also has potential utility in the prevention setting,\u201d Piper Sandler analyst Christopher Raymond said in a research note.\n\nMerck is conducting a late-stage trial to see if its antiviral pill can prevent COVID-19 infection, in addition to the study that showed it can significantly cut hospitalization and death in those already infected.\n\nMerck, whose shares were last up about 9%, leads the race in developing the first oral antiviral medication for COVID-19. Rivals such as Pfizer and Swiss drugmaker Roche Holding AG with partner Atea Pharmaceuticals Inc are running late-stage trials of their pills. Atea shares were up 19%.\n\nMerck, which discontinued its own COVID-19 vaccine program, had seen its shares fall about 4% for the year through Thursday, before they moved into positive territory for 2021 on Friday.\n\n\u201cMerck has kind of been dead in the water to investors for the past couple of quarters,\u201d said Kevin Gade, portfolio manager with Bahl & Gaynor, which owns Merck shares.\n\n\u201cThis shows their R&D engine is not dead and they were first \u2026 in what could be a multi-billion dollar opportunity.\u201d",

The measure, which went into effect last month, is the most restrictive in the country.\n\n\u201cNo matter where you live, no matter where you are, this moment is dark,\u201d Alexis McGill Johnson, president of Planned Parenthood, told the crowd at the \u201cRally for Abortion Justice\u201d in Washington.\n\nIn the Texas capital of Austin, hundreds gathered in sweltering heat to denounce the so-called \u201cheartbeat\u201d law signed by Governor Greg Abbott. It bans abortion after cardiac activity is detected in the embryo, usually around six weeks. That is before most women know they are pregnant and earlier than 85% to 90% of all abortions are carried out, experts say.\n\nThe law relies on ordinary citizens to enforce the ban, which makes no exceptions for rape or incest, rewarding them at least $10,000 if they successfully sue anyone who helped provide an illegal abortion.\n\nSome of the demonstrators said the law would backfire on legislators. \u201cI think more people believe in the issue of providing safe abortions than our legislature realizes,\u201d said Andrea Roberts, 49, an Austin preschool director.",

          "text": "Globacom, the second-largest telecoms operator in Nigeria by subscriber number and market share, has signed a deal with Eutelsat of France for satellite deployment in the Nigerian market.\n\nThe business deal, which was signed between the two companies at the Elysee Palace in Paris recently, was witnessed by the French President, Mr. Emmanuel Macron.\n\nThe Chairman of Globacom, Chief Mike Adenuga, signed on behalf of Globacom, while Eutelsat CEO, Rodolphe Belmer, signed on behalf of Eutelsat of France.\n\nThe partnership deal is coming at a time when the federal government has approved the rollout of the 5G network in Nigeria, which will boost internet connectivity in urban and rural communities.\n\nThe partnership between the two companies is expected to enhance the deployment of 500 Wi-Fi relay stations to far-flung rural areas, for connection to a Eutelsat satellite.\n\nLikewise, French group, Vocalcom, which already manages the software for Glo telecom\u2019s call centres in Nigeria, is hoping to open a new deal in the mobile-money sphere with Globacom.\n\nAccording to Adenuga, his franchise\u2019s relationship with the French telecoms giant has been a long and extremely beneficial one.\n\n\u201cThe genesis and bedrock of that relationship was the energy team at the Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) Paris office, led by Guillaume Leenhardt. A great deal of our early success can be attributed to the professionalism, customer orientation, and creativity of that team,\u201d Adenuga said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cwe worked extremely hard and well together to meet some ridiculously tight deadlines \u2013 working through the night till 6 a.m. only to resume work again at 8 a.m. after a quick nap and shower. Those are days I remember with a lot of fondness.\n\n\u201cSoon after the award of our telecommunications licence in 2003, our relationship with another prominent French company, Alcatel, led at the time by Serge Tchuruk, enabled us to fast-track the roll-out of our infrastructure and close the gap on the competition, which had had a 15-month head start.\u201d\n\nBack in 2017, the French government, in homage to Adenuga\u2019s humanity and relentless strides at rewriting the African business narrative, invested him with a Knight of the Legion of Honour (Chevalier de la Legion d Honneur), the highest French decoration and one of the most famous in the world.\n\nAdenuga became the only Nigerian to have received the award since its inception.\n\nHe was honoured for his remarkable contribution to the development of French-Nigerian relations and his appreciation of French culture.\n\nFollowing the honour accorded him, Adenuga later relocated and rebuilt the Alliance Fran\u00e7aise, which for several decades was located in Yaba, Lagos.\n\nThe Alliance Fran\u00e7aise is committed to promoting French culture and teaching French as a second language around the world and has been named Mike Adenuga Centre, immediately after the relocation.

          "text": "As the world moves to tackle climate change, the International Oil Companies (IOCs), which insist on ramping up production of fossil fuels in Africa may face the risk of regulatory action from the United States, the country\u2019s Deputy Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, Jonathan Pershing, has said.\n\nIf the US makes good its threat, it will be a major blow to Nigeria, Angola, Congo and other oil-producing countries in Africa, which have intensified efforts to attract foreign investors to fund major hydrocarbons projects on the continent.\n\nThis is coming as the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, OPEC+, are considering going beyond the existing deal to boost production by 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) when it meets tomorrow (Monday).\n\nIn August, President Muhammadu Buhari finally signed the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) to spur competition in the sector as well as attract foreign investments.\n\nBut with the position of the US, many of the expected funding for Nigeria\u2019s fossil fuels may be stranded since oil companies would be circumspect about putting their dollars in the upcoming projects.\n\nWestern fossil fuel companies planning to develop new projects in Africa would then need to consider the significant risk of regulatory action vis-\u00e0-vis the returns on investment in Africa.\n\nSpeaking from South Africa, the US envoy urged western investors to consider whether fossil fuels were a good commercial opportunity anymore in Africa or anywhere else.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a risk of regulatory \u2026 and financial activities, and I believe that\u2019s getting more and more explicit. If you are a company looking to invest in oil and gas, you have to ask yourself\u2026\u2018am I going to be left with a stranded asset?\u2019 I would not bet very strongly on a fossil fuel future,\u201d he said.\n\nPershing, who was speaking at a virtual media briefing, after being asked about the current rush by western oil and gas companies to develop deposits in Africa, noted that even China had committed to stop building overseas coal plants.\n\nAfrica accounts for just 3.8 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions, according to the non-profit Carbon Disclosure Project, but Pershing noted it was the fastest-growing continent.\n\nIt could, he said: \u201cleapfrog\u201d older carbon-based technologies and embrace renewables, just as it skipped wired telecoms in many places and went straight for wireless.\n\n\u201cAfrica doesn\u2019t need to move in the direction of the West\u2019s high-carbon intensity. It can move directly beyond that,\u201d he said.\n\nHis comments came despite the United States itself being a major producer and exporter of oil and gas, with recent growth driven by output from shale fields, a Reuters report said.\n\nThe US envoy is visiting several African countries as part of efforts to raise global climate ambition ahead of the United Nations COP26 Climate Summit in Glasgow, Scotland next month.\n\nAfrican nations are seeking financial assistance from the West to switch to renewables.\n\nOn Tuesday, South Africa, the continent\u2019s biggest greenhouse gas emitter and the world\u2019s 12th largest, owing to its reliance on coal-fired power, told the envoy that it needed major support for its energy transition.\n\nIn the new PIA, Nigeria is devoting as much as 30 per cent of the proposed Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) Limited\u2019s profit oil and profit gas, to crude exploration in the frontier basins.\n\nSpeaking recently on why Nigeria continued to focus on a seemingly irrelevant resource, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva as well as the NNPC Group Managing Director, Mallam Mele Kyari, had noted that the idea was to get as much oil as possible from beneath the ground before it becomes useless.\n\nMost of the big IOCs like Royal Dutch Shell, Mobil, Chevron which operates in the United States also have major investments in Nigeria and could withdraw funding for Nigerian hydrocarbons if threatened in that country.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",

          "text": "Following the zoning of the position of the National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the North by the National Convention Zoning Committee (NCZC) of the party led by Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State, northern elders in the main opposition party have commenced search for a suitable candidate to fill the position, THISDAY has learnt.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that in their latest permutation, the northern elders have zeroed in on a former President of the Senate, Senator David Mark; a former Governor of Katsina State, Alhaji Ibrahim Shema, and a former Governor of Jigawa State, Mr. Sule Lamido for the position of the party\u2019s national chairman.\n\nThe intrigues have however deepened as the loyalists of former Vice President Atiku Abubakar and a former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki have intensified moves to use the Appeal Court to return the embattled National Chairman of the party, Prince Uche Secondus, and truncate the bid for a southern presidency in 2023.\n\nThe party has, however, summoned an emergency National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting for Thursday, October 7, to consider the report of the Ugwuanyi-led zoning committee.\n\nInvestigation revealed that the North-central, where Mark hails from is highly favoured by the majority of the northern elders in the party for the chairmanship position.\n\nThese elders, it was learnt, want the North-west where Shema and Lamido hail from to produce the vice-presidential candidate to a possible southern presidential candidate in the 2023 general election.\n\nWhile Shema\u2019s chairmanship bid is said to be backed by some of the governors, Lamido is believed to be backed by the loyalists of former President Olusegun Obasanjo.\n\nMark is said to be supported by the loyalists of former Military President, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida (rtd); a former National Security Adviser (NSA), Gen. Aliyu Gusau, and some other elders.\n\nOne of the northern elders privy to the intrigues told THISDAY last night that zoning the party\u2019s chairmanship position to the North-central would ensure the emergence of the vice-presidential candidate from the North-west.\n\n\u201cNorthern elders in the party want the chairmanship zoned to the North-central to enable a vice presidential candidate to a southern presidential candidate come from the North-west, given the power bloc.\n\n\u201cTo that extent, some are looking at David Mark and or Ibrahim Shema. Sule Lamido is also being considered. But most of the elders are saying that if Shema or Lamido runs, it could stop the North-west from bringing the vice presidential candidate to a southern presidential candidate because the southern governors in the party are determined that the presidency should go to the South, in line with the resolutions of the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum, and they are looking at one of their own as a candidate, despite all the blackmail,\u201d the source explained.\n\nHowever, the source added that the loyalists of former Vice President Atiku Abubakar and former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki are moving to use the court to return Secondus.\n\n\u201cIf they return Secondus, they can take control of the party, and retain the presidency in the North in 2023,\u201d the source added.\n\nMeanwhile, the PDP has summoned an emergency NEC meeting for Thursday, October 7, at its national headquarters, to consider the report of the zoning of the offices of the NWC.\n\nAccording to a statement issued yesterday by the National Secretary of the party, Senator Umaru Ibrahim Tsauri, all members of the National Executive Committee are invited to the emergency NEC meeting.\n\nEjiofor Alike in Lagos and Chuks Okocha in Abuja",
