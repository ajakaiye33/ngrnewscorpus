          "title": "22 govs apply as FG begins model ranch fund\u2019s disbursement next week",
          "text": "No fewer than 22 states have written to the Federal Government to indicate interest in the National Livestock Transformation Programme.\n\nThe Senior Special Assistant to the President on Agriculture, Andrew Kwasari, who also coordinates the NLTP, disclosed this in an interview with The PUNCH on Tuesday, adding that the Federal Government would start disbursing funds for model ranches in the next one week.\n\nAccording to him, states whose governors have written the Federal Government include, Kaduna, Benue, Taraba, Adamawa, Plateau, Zamfara, Kano, Ondo, Katsina, Bauchi, Yobe, Borno, Gombe, Nasarawa, Niger, Sokoto, Ekiti, Kogi, Ebonyi and Kwara.\n\nFollowing incessant clashes between farmers and herders, the Federal Government in 2018 came up with various ranching models, including Ruga and the NLTP, to settle nomadic herdsmen, who are mostly Fulani.\n\nOn Sunday, the President\u2019s spokesman, Garba Shehu, in a write-up in response to a story published by The Economist of London, said the Federal Government\u2019s ranching programme had reduced insecurity in the country in the last 12 months.\n\nHe, therefore, urged state governors, who had not embraced the scheme, to do so\n\nKwasari said, \u201cI have the list of all the governors, who have written to participate in the NLTP. There are 22 governors, who wrote to express interest in the NLTP.\n\n\u201cThat is the first condition in the NLTP document. This project is not just something that is done on paper. There are guidelines as approved by the National Economic Council.\u201d\n\nAlthough he did not specify the amount that would be disbursed, the presidential aide said two of the states, Nasarawa and Plateau, would be getting financial support from the Federal Government for the establishment of model ranches in about a week.\n\nHe stated, \u201cIn fact, this morning (Tuesday), I was following up with the accountant-general\u2019s office concerning the pilot money to Nasarawa and Plateau.\n\n\u201cWe are expecting the Federal Government to credit Nasarawa and Plateau\u2019s accounts; their sites are ready for take-off to build the first ranch and to train pastoralists in how to build ranches.\u201d\n\nKwasari said Adamawa and Kaduna states were among the 10 states that had established offices and prepared for the programme.\n\n\u201cThe government will support them, but they have their own contributions to make. We are also working with the Dutch Government, which has also given some support,\u201d he added.\n\nThe presidential aide explained that the model ranches would be used to train pastoralists and help them build their own ranches.\n\nHe noted that some people had described the NLTP as another Ruga project.\n\nHe stated, \u201cBut the bottom-line is that the NLTP is an ecosystem approach. It has six pillars that address all the things that have gone wrong with our livestock production system.\n\n\u201cI just spoke with the office of the accountant-general and by Friday or in a week\u2019s time, I should be able to tell you that the money has been credited to the Nasarawa and Plateau NLTP accounts.\n\n\u201cI will also be able to tell you when work will start on the model projects; to me, that is the most important thing.\u201d\n\nKwasari added that states like Nasarawa, Adamawa, Plateau, Taraba, Gombe, Kogi, Kwara and Ondo, which had met the NLTP conditions, should be supported by the Federal Government in establishing model ranches.\n\nAsked how much the Federal Government would give as support, he stated, \u201cTo build a pilot ranch for the training of pastoralists and crop farmers costs about N400m.\n\n\u201cHowever, some states have counterpart funding; for instance, Nasarawa has counterpart funding of up to 50 per cent from the Dutch Government. So, to build the ranch and run it for three years will cost about N400m.\u201d\n\nAnimals in the ranches will not be allowed to leave the facility all year round, while households will send in representatives, who will be trained in the model ranches in the pilot states.\n\nKwasari noted that once the pastoralists were able to get feed and water for their livestock, they would have no business moving cattle from one state to another.\n\nWe\u2019ve submitted business plan, says Ondo\n\nWhen contacted, the Ondo State Government confirmed that it had submitted its business plan to the NLTP.\n\nThe Special Adviser to Governor Rotimi Akeredolu on Agriculture and Agric-business, Mr Akin Olotu, said the decision was in response to the Presidency asking the governors to provide land for ranching.\n\nOlotu, however, did not say if the state would give land for ranching or not, but noted that Ondo was waiting for the NLTP\u2019s action on the business plan.\n\n\u201cWe have submitted our business plan to the National Livestock Transformation Programme since last year and we are still waiting for action on their part,\u201d he simply stated.\n\nAnimal production a private venture \u2013 Enugu\n\nBut the Enugu State Government said that rearing cattle was a private venture like every other livestock production business.\n\nThe state Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr Matthew Idu, stated this in an interview with one of our correspondents.\n\nWhen asked if the state government would provide land for ranching, Idu asked, \u201cIs it the Federal Government that is rearing the cattle? There are questions you people shouldn\u2019t be asking; cattle rearing is an individual business, just as you have people rearing fish and other livestock.\u201d\n\nEkiti has keyed into FG\u2019s NLTP \u2013 Commissioner\n\nOn his part, the Ekiti State Commissioner for Agriculture, Dr Olabode Adetoyi, said the state already had a ranch at Ikun Ekiti in the Moba Local Government Area of the state.\n\nAdetoyi, who said there had been no discussion on the Federal Government\u2019s appeal to states for land, said, \u201cWe already have a ranch at the Ikun Dairy Farm. There is no farm without a ranching facility there. For now, that is what we have on the ground.\n\n\u201cWe have keyed into the National Livestock Transformation Plan. The Ikun Dairy Farm is the best ranch that any government can have in the country. It is a public-private partnership between the Ekiti State Government and Promasidor, the makers of Cowbell Milk, where we target the production of 10,000 litres of milk per day. At present, we are producing more than 100,000 litres per month.\u201d\n\nHerdsmen should buy land, Delta insists\n\nThe Delta State Government says it supports ranching as a panacea for the herders-farmers\u2019 crises in the country.\n\nThe state Commissioner for Information, Charles Aniagwu, stated this in an interview with The PUNCH in Asaba.\n\nHe said, \u201cDelta is in total support of ranching, but we do not have land to give. Without ranching, there can\u2019t be any reasonable solution.\n\n\u201cCattle rearing is a private business and anybody who engages in the business should look for land and acquire it.\n\n\u201cIt is not the duty of the government to do so. If we begin to get land for cattle rearing, we should also get land for those who are into poultry and other businesses.\u201d\n\nKatsina earmarks 122,000 hectares for cattle grazing\n\nIn Katsina State, there are over 122,000 hectares of land for grazing sites out of which 7,000 hectares are currently being utilised for ranching.\n\nIt was also found out that ranching was being executed in 10 local government areas of Batsari, Jibia, Kurfi, Dutsin-ma, Safana, Danmusa, Kankara, Faskari, Sabuwa and Dandume.\n\nOyo rules out building ranches for herders\n\nThe Chief Press Secretary to the Oyo State Governor, Taiwo Adisa, stated that the anti-grazing law enacted by the Seyi Makinde administration would strictly guide livestock production in the state.\n\nHe stated, \u201cOyo State has an anti-open grazing law, which was signed into law in 2019. This has comprehensively spelt out the processes for the establishment of ranches by any intending livestock farmer.\n\n\u201cThe Oyo State anti-open grazing law sees ranching as a personal business. Herdsmen are free to apply for land for that purpose.\n\n\u201cThe disposition of the Oyo State Government is not in support of giving land for grazing reserves. The grazing control law does not give land, but for the herder to rent and renew land at intervals. The landowner too cannot sell land to any herdsman.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "A former Senate President Dr. Olubukola Saraki has said the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) will soon be hit by massive defections as a former Governor and some bigwigs are set to dump the party for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)\n\nThe APC however said the former Kwara Governor must be engrossed by his imagination, dismissing his claim as \u201cmere wishful thinking\u201d, insisting the party has never been so strong.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nSaraki, in an interview on Arise TV on Tuesday, said APC members were concluding plans to defect to the opposition PDP ahead of the 2023 general elections across the country.\n\nSaraki, who debunked the insinuation that he may defect to the APC, said the reverse was the case as the ruling party will witness a gale of defection this week.\n\nThe former Senate President noted that the recent defection of some PDP Governors to APC was not surprising, as the party was aware of their moves.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nHe however said the defection of the Governors has brought huge political fortune for his party.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cThere were certain Governors that we already know that they will leave. And we were not surprised that they defected to the APC. Since then, we have had some bigwigs that joined us. Also in this week, there is a former governor that is going to join our party, PDP.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cAside from that, we know that some of the leaders in the ruling party will not defect early, rather they do it late. And you saw that during the 2015 election. So, keep watching, And Nigerians will not be surprised when they begin to see some defections from the ruling party to the PDP.\u201d\n\nRead Also: #EndSARS Memorial: Time to reform police, justice system \u2013 Saraki\n\nHe blamed the current crisis in the country on what he described as bad leadership of the ruling APC and assured the PDP will change the narratives come 2023.\n\n\u201cWe (PDP) have the potentials to turn the country around and that is why I believe with the right leadership, things can change in the country.\n\n\u201cI often say that no one can give whatever he does not have. In 2023, we have to get it right, and to do that, we needed the right kind of leadership,\u201d he stated.\n\nBut the APC Caretaker Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committer (APC) Secretary, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, said the former Senate President was only playing to the gallery.\n\nHe maintained that the ruling party has never been so solid, insisting that the defection theory of Saraki was nothing but his imagination.\n\n\u201cAs a political party, we don\u2019t play to the gallery with opposition. We always speak the truth, especially when we are replying to a friend who can still join our party. Mind you he (Senator Saraki) was one of the founding members of our party, who left for PDP because of power struggle.\u201d\n\nThrowing Saraki\u2019s statement to the winds, Akpanudoedehe said: \u201cI want Nigerians to wait and see if what he says will come to pass. Some politicians are forum seekers, who jump from one place to another. All I will say, Nigerians should watch and see if his (Saraki) prophesy will come to pass or not.\n\n\u201cAPC is solid. The speculation of the gale of defection is best described as his (Saraki) imagination.\u201d\n\nThe APC scribe advised the opposition not to delude itself over winning power in 2023.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cI want to remind Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) that Nigerians will not forget in a hurry the party that put us in the trouble we facing now in this country. Nigerians will not forget that PDP put us in the mess we are now.\n\n\u201cThe irony of it is that if you put APC and PDP side-by-side, it is a known fact that Nigerians will continue to choose APC because Nigerians will not forget the bad governance of PDP in a hurry.\u201d",

He attached both documents to this press statement made available to Daily Sun.\n\nAccording to the statement, in particular, the said urgent appeals stated in part that the United Nations is \u201calarmed by the alleged torture and ill-treatment Mr. Kanu has been subjected to during his illegal custody in Kenya. If confirmed, these allegations would constitute prima facie violations of fundamental human rights, including the right not to be arbitrarily deprived of liberty, and the absolute and non-derogable prohibition of torture and other ill-treatment under the International Covenant on Political and Civil Rights (ICCPR)\u201d.\n\nFurther, the urgent appeals stated that: \u201cThe allegations in the case of Mr. Kanu raise serious violations of international human rights law and may cause irreparable damage to his life or personal integrity, which we believe warrants prompt attention. In this regard, we are considering to publicly express our concerns in this case in the near future, believing that the wider public should be informed about the implications of these allegations for the enjoyment and exercise of human rights in Kenya and Nigeria. Any public expression of concern in this regard, will indicate that we have been in contact with your Excellency\u2019s Government to clarify the issue/s in question\u201d.\n\nContinuing, the United Nations stated that \u201cWhile awaiting a reply, we urge that all necessary interim measures be taken to prevent any irreparable damage to the life or personal integrity of Mr. Kanu, halt the alleged violations and prevent their re-occurrence and in the event that the investigations support or suggest the allegations to be correct, to ensure the accountability of any person responsible of the alleged violations\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is important to emphasize that this is just the beginning of more United Nations and other global strong actions that would be seen in the coming weeks.

          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Enugu, Aidoghie Paulinus, Abuja, Paul Osuyi Asaba, Tony John, Port Harcourt, Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan, Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri, Geoffrey Anyanwu, Enugu, Tony Osauzo, Benin and Sunday Ani\n\nControversial Islamic cleric and former army officer, Sheikh Abubakar Gumi, has stirred the hornet\u2019s nest with his recent comment that Nigeria would disintegrate if the Federal Government declared bandits as terrorists.\n\nThe statement has drawn anger and condemnations with some tagging him a terrorist or strong supporter of terrorism while others called for his immediate arrest.\n\nIn a Facebook post, Gumi had admitted that the devastation inflicted by rampaging bandits in the North West amounted to terrorism but warned that President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s labelling them as such would invite additional consequences that would consume the entire country.\n\nUSA companies need customer service reps to work from home, hourly pay in $13 per hour, must have a quiet environment to work, internet access.Click here to apply .\n\n\u201cThe acts the bandits are committing now in NW have gradually over time become tantamount to terrorism because wherever innocent people are fatal victims it\u2019s pure terrorism.\u201d\n\nHe warned that the moment bandits are designated as terrorists, \u201cIslamic for that matter, the direct foreign Jihadist movements will set in in force.\n\n\u201cMany teaming unemployed youths may find it palatable and attractive. Shouting \u2018Allahu Akbar\u2019 plus AK47 against a \u2018secular\u2019 immoral society where impunity reigns are the magnet for extremists and downtrodden \u2013 the majority of our youth. Already these deadly terrorist groups are fighting for the soul of these bandits.\n\n\u201cThis will give criminality a spiritual cover and remove the stigma of discrediting them with such crimes since now they are fighting a \u2018Jihad\u2019 as they will claim.\u201d\n\nGumi argued that since Boko Haram has already gripped the North-East, separatist agitators in the South-East and South-West would easily seize on the lawlessness sweeping the northern regions.\n\n\u201cNE is already and is still devastated by this madness for over 12 years. If we allow, terror, to set in into these raw na\u00efve unexposed bandits, NW will be in ruins sooner than later.\n\n\u201cAlready IPOB are destroying SE, and Igboho has set the ball of confusion rolling in SW. For those who want to destroy the NW, it\u2019s a good recipe.\u201d\n\nReacting, the Ohanaeze Ndigbo advised that the earlier Nigeria recognised Sheikh Gumi as a security threat, the better for everybody in Nigeria.\n\nThe apex-Igbo group, which spoke through its National Publicity Secretary, Chief Alex Chiedozie Ogbonnia, argued that what Gumi professes as an Islamic cleric is contrary to most of his public statements, especially as it affects the country\u2019s security situation.\n\n\u201cIn the first place, he professes Islam but Islam in itself, is supposed to be a symbol of peace. As an Islamic cleric, his descriptions are sometimes at variance with the role he plays in the society. So, his role is in contradiction to his faith as an Islamic cleric and such a person is more dangerous.\u201d\n\nHe also likened Gumi to a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing, saying such persons were more dangerous.\n\nFor the Middle Belt Forum (MBF), which spoke through Dogo Isuwa, its national publicity secretary, if government failed to declare the bandits as terrorists, and treat them as such and bring an end to their evil activities, Nigeria would cease.\n\n\u201cIf the Governor of Kaduna State, where Gumi lives, is asking the Federal Government to declare bandits as terrorists, who is Gumi to say otherwise? And if the government of Kaduna State is serious, then Gumi should not be walking free because he is either a terrorist or supporter of terrorism,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also called on government to, as a matter of urgency, arrest Sheikh Gumi.\n\nThe Nigerian Indigenous Nationalities Alliance for Self-Determination (NINAS), the umbrella body for self-determination groups in the South and Middle-Belt of Nigeria with Ilana Omo Oodua representing the Yoruba Land, Lower Niger Congress representing the South South and South East and Middle-Belt Rennaissance Movement representing the Middle Belt region, also insisted that bandits should be declared as terrorists.\n\nIn a telephone interview, leader of NINAS, Prof Banji Akintoye, said: \u201cThe same set of people that see Igboho as an enemy of Nigeria are the same people supporting terrorists, masquerading as bandits. You can see that all their claim to national unity is fake.\n\n\u201cWe do not speak for IPOB and we do not have any association with IPOB. Then, IPOB without shooting a gun and without kidnapping anyone, was declared a terrorists\u2019 group, just for staging protests. How much more a group of people that have kidnapped a sitting senator, killed scores of both young and old people. But today, we are being told they should not be declared as terrorists.\n\n\u201cOur position is that the current administration has demonstrated that it is only meant to protect the North. They are planning to ensure that the South serves the North. They are planning to use the resources of the South to develop the North. But they will fail.\n\n\u201cSo, our position under NINAS, which Ilana Omo Oodua is part of is that the bandits, the criminal herders or whatever they called themselves, is a terrorists\u2019 organisation, and should be declared as so. Sheikh Gumi entitled to his own opinion. This is a democracy.\u201d\n\nAlso reacting, the Igbo National Council (INC) described Gumi\u2019s utterance as disturbing and a threat to national security.\n\nPresident of INC, Chilos Godsent, in a statement called for the immediate arrest and prosecution of the Islamic cleric on his comment.\n\n\u2022Gumi worse than terrorists\n\nTwo Igbo groups, Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF) and Oke Ndigbo, also hit Gumi, describing him as a known terrorist being pamperd by the Federal Government.\n\nADF\u2019s spokesman, Abia Onyike, said: \u201cA spade must be called by its name. The bandits are terrorists and should be addressed as such. The threat by Sheik Gumni does not hold water. Let the foreign Jihadists come, but let them be isolated in the North where they belong.\u201d\n\nNational Secretary of Igbo rights group, Oke Ndigbo, Damian Udemba said the likes of Gumi should have been questioned by now by the security agencies and possibly isolated and prosecuted for romancing with terrorists.\n\nIn fact, it said that \u201cGumi is promoting terrorism by openly serving as their emissary\u201d.\n\n\u2022CAN, PDP, Kaigama, Mogekwu, Kokori, Wechie fume\n\nWhile cautioning the Sheik to remove sentiments over the issue of designating bandits as terrorists, the Metropolitan Catholic Archbishop of Abuja, Ignatius Kaigama, said whether called bandits or terrorists, the fact remained that they are engaged in anti-human crimes and are putting the citizens to great risk and destabilising the nation by creating a terrible situation of insecurity.\n\n\u201cWhat I think Sheikh Gumi and many good Nigerians should do is how do we conquer the situation? How do we fight these terrible crimes? And if he brings good suggestions and other Nigerians bring their own, there will be a solution. But when we begin to appear as if we are taking sides, the problem remains unsolved and I think we shall continue to suffer.\u201d\n\nKaigama further said he hoped that if Sheikh Gumi knew how to get to the bandits and convince them to stop their criminal activities, it would be of great service to the nation.\n\nSimilarly, Bishop of Asaba Diocese of the Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion), Most Rev. Justus Mogekwu told Daily Sun in Asaba, Delta State, that no matter what anybody painted them, they (bandits), remained terrorists.\n\n\u201cBandits are terrorists whether the president declares them as such or not, they are terrorists. It also shows the level of hypocrisy among some of our leaders.\n\n\u201cHow can declaring bandits as terrorists would break up Nigeria? I do not understand, as if they are a component part of our existence.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that we have a government that do have the welfare of Nigerians, they are more concerned about the foreign jihadist than Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIf the government is waiting for anything to declare them what they are, it means the government is behind them. Nigeria has been under this siege for many years it is only now we are seeing the manifestation of it,\u201d Mogekwu said.\n\nAlso, the Delta State chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Apostle Sylvanus Okorote said Gumi\u2019s statement only revealed what was already obvious, adding that he (Gumi) should stop deceiving himself.\n\n\u201cIf banditry is what united Nigeria, then they can break Nigeria but if banditry is not what united Nigeria, if Nigeria was united as a sovereign nation by God, no matter who is declared a terrorist or declared saint, the country will continue to be.\n\n\u201cSo if he wishes to declare bandits as saints, let him continue to do so. Let the president declare them saints if that is his advice; advising the president to declare bandits as saints. Let him speak up and tell the president to declare them as saints. It is obvious to everybody, the entire world is aware of what the bandits are doing,\u201d he said.\n\nFormer publicity secretary of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Rivers State, and Chairman of Ikwerre Local Government Area, Samuel Nwanosike, and a prominent public analyst, Mr. Livingstone Wechie, saw Gumi\u2019s comment as conspiratorial compromise by the Nigeria state and its security agencies.\n\n\u201cSheikh Gumi has for a period been developing a groundswell of felonious influence that seems to be legitimising terrorism and banditry in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is most disturbing that such a person with his background as a retired military Captain should be using religious blackmail to promote such dangerous and criminal ideology.\n\n\u201cThe comments credited to Sheikh Gumi warning that the categorisation of bandits as terrorists will mean the end of Nigeria smacks of conspiratorial compromise by the Nigerian state and its forces. It indicates that the Federal Government may have surrendered to the antics of the self-made ambassador of terrorists and bandits.\n\n\u201cIt is very surprising that Gumi who now enjoys unfettered communication access to the insurgents to the point of middle-manning for the release of abductees, has acquired the ultimate right to dictate the paradigm on the war on insecurity and remains untouchable, whether advertently or otherwise, by the Nigerian government.\n\nFormer General Secretary of the National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG), Chief Frank Kokori, advised Nigerians to ignore Gumi, and see him as a religious fundamentalist. \u201cWho is Gumi? He is just a religious fundamentalist, whose views are always at the extreme and at variance with the views held by the liberal Islamists,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022Okorie, Uwazuruike, Ehikhamenor react\n\nOne of the stalwarts of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the South East zone, Chief Chekwas Okorie said it was baffling why Nigerian government was allowing him (Gumi) to make such reckless statements without being question or brought to book.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what gives Sheikh Gumi the confidence to talk the way he talks and sometimes threatens the stability of Nigeria and government will allow him to continue to behave and talk recklessly.\n\nFormer president of Aka Ikenga, Chief Goddy Uwazuruike said he was not surprised by Gumi\u2019s statement.\n\nHe said the only way for Nigeria to understand the trajectory of what the bandits are is to classify them as terrorists and that it was tomfoolery not to do so.\n\nIn his reaction, professor at the University of Benin, Prof. Edeaghe Ehikhamenor, expressed surprise that Sheik Gumi could speak with audacity with nobody cautioning him.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection. Click here .\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t understand the audacity and nobody is saying anything. Some people feel they have monopoly of everything in this country. For his age and exposure, I expected him to be more cautious in his use of words,\u201d Prof. Ehikhamenor said.",
          "summary": "\u201cIf the Governor of Kaduna State, where Gumi lives, is asking the Federal Government to declare bandits as terrorists, who is Gumi to say otherwise?\nHe also called on government to, as a matter of urgency, arrest Sheikh Gumi.\n\u201cWhat I think Sheikh Gumi and many good Nigerians should do is how do we conquer the situation?\n\u201cSo if he wishes to declare bandits as saints, let him continue to do so.\nLet the president declare them saints if that is his advice; advising the president to declare bandits as saints.",

          "text": "From Tony John, Port Harcourt\n\nRivers State Governor Nyesom Wike, and the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Tanko Mohammed, have flayed the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) for keeping silent on the crisis confronting the nation and assault on judiciary.\n\nThey spoke at the opening ceremony of the 2021 annual general conference of the NBA with the theme: \u201cTake the Lead,\u201d going in Port Harcourt, Rivers State.\n\nGovernor Wike wondered why NBA had remained silent when economic, social and political rights, including the rights to personal security, freedom of speech, association, dissent and peaceful protests, as well as the rights to personal liberty, were being violated with impunity by the present central administration and its security agencies.\n\nWike said: \u201cProfession and as a pluralistic assemblage of learned men, the NBA has greater responsibility to promote and protect the rights of Nigerians at all times and in all circumstances.\n\nUSA companies need customer service reps to work from home, hourly pay in $13 per hour, must have a quiet environment to work, internet access.Click here to apply .\n\n\u201cBut, the central question is whether the NBA has been living up to its credo and responsibility? While I would leave us to be the judge, my own personal conclusion is that, for years now, the NBA has focused less on promoting and fighting for the values of good governance, democracy, judicial independence, human rights and the rule of law.\n\n\u201cThese are some of the concerning facts. Never in our political history has Nigeria been so badly governed and denied of good governance with the Federal Government woefully failing in its basic duties to provide for the wellbeing and security of its own citizens, as we have experienced in the last six years.\n\n\u201cOn daily basis, the economic, social and political rights, including the rights to personal security, freedom of speech, association, dissent and peaceful protests, as well as the right to personal liberty are being violated with impunity by the present central administration and its security apparatus.\n\n\u201cThe invasion on personal liberty has been brazen and indiscriminate, such that even judges of the superior courts, including Supreme Court justices, have in the recent past, been victims of midnight assaults on their premises and subjection to unlawful arrests and imprisonments.\n\n\u201cLately, the new devious trend is to tag security risks to innocent Nigerians and opposition elements and use the immigration authority to seize their international passports without a prior court order.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, the chief justice, who was represented by a Justice of the Supreme Court, Mary Peter-Odili, said it was regrettable that some members of the Bar join litigants to assault the institution of the judiciary when their cases were not met.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs head of the judiciary, I have tasked all our justices and judges to take up the challenge pushed at us by the times. At various fora, I have encouraged my brother judges and justices to see the administration of justice and one of the fundamental solutions to some of the nation\u2019s crisis.\n\n\u201cThe peace of the nation rests on the balance of scale of justice, and our courts must ensure justice is served at all times irrespective of the pressures from within. This is not to say there are no challenges plaguing the administration of justice in the country.\n\n\u201cI must state that all challenges of the judiciary can be internally addressed; some demand the support of the Bar for their actualisation. One of them is the poor condition of service for national judicial officers. Members of the Bar and various arms of government must see the urgency of leading a crusade to address the issue as a matter of urgency.\n\n\u201cAnother challenge being faced by the judiciary is the assault by litigants against the institution of the judiciary when their cases are not met. Unfortunately, some members of the Bar also join them in ridiculing our courts in their private discussions and on national dailies.\n\n\u201cThe institution of our courts is sacred and the respect that people have for it is the one that ministers in the temple of justice have made the people realise must be accorded to it. When the judges, who do not have a right of reply are subjected to dispiriting and humiliating comments in the media, it silently kills their moral and dedication to the cause of justice. I, therefore, urge the Bar to rise in defence of the Bench at all times.\u201d\n\nDeputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege, said there would be no meaningful development of the laws of the country without collaboration between the Bar and lawmakers at all levels in the country.\n\nOmo-Agege said: \u201cThe NBA should take the lead in promoting and protecting human rights, the rule of law and good governance in Nigeria, as well as promoting the welfare, security and professional advancement of legal practitioners in Nigeria. I wish, therefore, on behalf of the Senate and, in deed, the National Assembly thank the NBA for organising this conference.\n\n\u201cThis is indeed the era when legal practitioners ought to be at the forefront of the development of this nation for the benefit of all. The National Assembly has taken the lead in enacting laws to give legal teeth to some provisions of fundamental objectives and directing principles of state policies.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, our attention has been focused on enthronement of free and fair electoral process to good and accountable governance. The National Assembly is also in the process of concluding work on far-reaching proposals to alter the 1999 Constitution to meet the yearnings and aspirations of Nigerians\u2026.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "title": "Politicians Still Influencing Judges to Use Court against Democracy",
          "text": "Alexander Enumah\n\nWeeks after the Chief Justice of Nigeria (NJC), Justice Ibrahim Muhammad, who was angered by conflicting orders from courts of coordinate jurisdictions, issued a stern warning to judges on the need to act right in nation\u2019s interest, it appears an end is not in sight yet to the impunity of some of the judges and justices in the country.\n\nUnfortunately, the unsavoury dispositions of some of the justices and judges to democratic concerns, have continued to decimate the gains of the nation\u2019s 23 years of unbroken civil rule. Even when they know full well they lack the jurisdiction to entertain the matters, they still go ahead to hear and pronounce ruling, which becomes an albatross on the neck of the party it was obtained against.\n\nThe submission of a majority of the people is that if the trend persisted, the fourth republic, which prides itself as the longest in the history of Nigeria\u2019s democracy, might come to an abrupt end going by the recent activities of desperate politicians and their cohorts in the judiciary.\n\nOne of the recent indicators to this unending judicial rascality could be located in how some individuals had rushed to court to stop the forthcoming national convention of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the manner the courts have been encouraging the resort to destabilisation.\n\nNational Convention Organising Committee (NCOC) of the PDP raised the alarm about a suit filed at the Kaduna High Court, ostensibly to derail the October 30 and 31 national convention and advised party members to be wary of such disgruntled and misguided members of the party.\n\nAlthough details of the suit have remained sketchy, it was allegedly filed by an aide to a former Vice President, Namadi Sambo. But the aide, said to be close to Secondus, has however denied having anything to do with the suit.\n\nSecretary of the NCOC and Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, said, \u201cNotwithstanding their right to approach a court of competent jurisdiction to air their grievances, we maintain that the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the PDP has acted in good faith in fixing our convention for October 30 and 31. It is not meant to witch-hunt anyone or to truncate anyone\u2019s mandate.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we call on all members and supporters of the PDP to ignore this distraction as we prepare to host a convention that will send a clear signal to Nigerians that the PDP is the only party that has the will and the might to rescue Nigeria from the catastrophe that we have been enduring for the past six years.\u201d\n\nBut Secondus had through his lawyer, Mr Tayo Oyetiba, SAN, asked the PDP to shelve the planned convention slated for October 30 and 31, pending the determination of Secondus\u2019 appeal.\n\nThe appeal with the number CA/PH/341/2021, is seeking to quash his suspension and applied for \u201cAn order of injunction restraining the Peoples Democratic Party, the 6 respondent herein, whether by itself, its officers, servants, agents and or representatives from holding or conducting its National Convention scheduled for 30th and 31st October 2021 or any other date, pending the hearing and final determination of this appeal.\u201d\n\nThe hearing of the appeal as well as the motion for interlocutory injunction comes up today, Tuesday, October 26, at the Port Harcourt Division of the Court of Appeal.\n\nWhether the appellate court would accede to the demand or not is another, particularly, taking into consideration the recent position of appellate court justices with respect to exparte granted by High Court judges.\n\nIt is worthy of mention that the appellate court and even the Supreme Court had descended heavily on the High Court judges particularly, in the Anambra governorship suits.\n\nJustice Chioma Nwosu-Iheme of the Court of Appeal had in a ruling on August 2, in the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), governorship tussle, called for sanction against two judges in the Jigawa and Imo States High Court for what she described as professional misconduct. She also called for sanctions for lawyers, who aided politicians in the filing of all such applications that had brought the court to ridicule.\n\nSimilarly, Justice Hamma Zamani of the Kano Division of the Court of Appeal had on August 10 in his judgment, set aside the judgment of a Jigawa State High Court, which had earlier declared Jude Okeke and Chukwuma Umeoji as the APGA national chairman and governorship candidate respectively.\n\nThe appellate court claimed that the trial court erred by entertaining a suit wherein it lacked jurisdiction. The Supreme Court, also in a judgment on October 14, 2021, upheld the decision of Justice Zamani of the Kano division of the Appeal Court for nullifying the judgment of the High Court for want of jurisdiction.\n\nThe apex court in a unanimous judgment held that the internal issue of political parties\u2019 was outside the jurisdiction of courts and consequently upheld the judgment of the Court of Appeal, which resolved the leadership tussle in APGA in favour of Victor Oye and also upheld the primary election conducted by his leadership, which produced Professor Chukwuma Soludo as APGA\u2019s governorship candidate for the November 6 governorship election.\n\nSoludo was nominated candidate of APGA in the forthcoming governorship poll by the Oye faction and his nomination was accepted by INEC. But Okeke challenged the authenticity of the Oye leadership at a Federal High Court in Jigawa State, where judgment was given in his favour.\n\nHowever, the Jigawa Judgment was set aside by the Appeal Court leading him to proceed to the apex court to upturn the appellate court\u2019s decision.\n\nThe seven member panel of the apex court in the judgment delivered by Justice Mary Odili, held that it was clear that the appellant engaged in abuse of judicial process, because the subject matter of the suit was not justiciable as it bordered on the internal matters of a political party.\n\nWhile the panel berated lawyers to the appellant for engaging in unethical conduct by filing such suit in the first place, it blamed the Jigawa High Court judge for accepting to hear the suit that was outside his jurisdiction. The panel went on to slam a fine of N1 million against the appellant for abuse of court process.\n\nAside the judges, the umbrella body for lawyers, the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), had also condemned the development and promised to deal with lawyers engaging in acts capable of bringing the judiciary to disrepute.\n\nA statement by its National President in September, Mr. Olumide Akpata, described as unfortunate, the recurring trend of contradictory court orders especially amongst courts of coordinate jurisdiction. He cited the recent cases involving the Anambra State forthcoming election and the PDP leadership crisis, which according to him \u201cevokes memories of those eerie and unwanted dark days.\n\n\u201cWhile the NBA will continue to stay away from the political ramifications and machinations involved in these matters, it is self-evident that these developments in our courts are antithetical to the actualisation of the just society and independent judiciary that we all aspire to, and they run contrary to everything we teach and hold dear as a profession.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a swirling belief that of the three judges under probe, one or two were involved in the PDP leadership crisis suit. While Justice O. Gbasam of a High Court of Rivers State, had on August 23, 2021 issued an order of interim injunction restraining Secondus from carrying on as Chairman of the PDP, pending the hearing and determination of a suit challenging his continued stay in office, Justice Nusirat Umar of the Kebbi State High Court, issued another order on Secondus to return to his position as the National Chairman on August 26.\n\nThe judge made the order while delivering ruling in a suit marked KB/AC/M. 170/2021, filed by three concerned members of the party, Yahaya Usman, Abubakar mohammed and Bashar Suleman.\n\nJustice Umar said she was satisfied after reading the affavidit of the respondents that an interim order should be granted on the purported suspension of Secondus pending the determination of the case.\n\nBut before Secondus could carry out the order, Justice Edem Kooffreh of a Cross River State High Court on August 28, restrained him from resuming.\n\nThe amusing thing about all the orders is that they were not only issued by courts of coordinate jurisdiction, but were all based on exparte applications.\n\nAttempt to rid the judiciary of bad eggs started, when the National Judicial Council (NJC) under the chairmanship of the CJN, constituted an investigative panel to probe the three High Court judges over their alleged indiscriminate issuance of court orders, an act perceived as detrimental to the nation\u2019s democracy.\n\nA statement by the Director of Information, NJC, Mr Soji Oye, read, \u201cThe National Judicial Council under the Chairmanship of the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice I. T. Muhammad, at its 95th Meeting held on September 15 and 16, 2021, in line with the principles of fair hearing, has directed the three Judges of coordinate jurisdiction, who granted Exparte Orders over the same case with the same subject matter to appear before a special Investigation Committee constituted by the Council in order to show cause why disciplinary action should not be taken against them for such act\u201d.\n\nAlthough, the names of the judges and the jurisdiction they operated were not made public, they were however believed to be amongst the six jurisdictions of the High Court whose heads were summoned by the CJN in August, to explain the rationale behind the issuance of conflicting others by judges in their jurisdiction.\n\nThe letter dated August 30, read in part: \u201cMy attention has been drawn to media reports to the effect that some Courts of coordinate jurisdiction were granting conflicting Exparte Orders on the same subject matter.\n\n\u201cIt has become expedient for me to invite you for a detailed briefing on the development. This is even more compelling having regard to earlier NJC Warning to judicial officers on the need to be circumspect in granting Ex-parte applications\u201d.\n\nFrom the tone of the letter, it was obvious that the CJN was not only worried but also bitter over the development, which sources around the CJN noted was a huge embarrassment tothe Nigerian judiciary and the country at large.\n\nSpeaking on the ongoing probe of the three judges on Monday in Abuja, an official of the NJC, who did not want his name mentioned, said the probe was ongoing and once the committee concluded its job, which he believed was in no distant time, the council would look into it and take critical decisions to serve as a warning to others if the said judges were guilty of the allegations.\n\n\u201cThe committee is still sitting, you know they have to give them fair hearing, they will bring their lawyers to defend them, afterwards the committee will now recommend them to the plenary of the NJC. It is the NEC meeting that will determine, whatever the plenary agrees is the final decision,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile it is difficult to comprehend what would make a judge assume jurisdiction in a case he knew he lacked any, the level of condemnation and fines against politicians and their lawyers by the appellate and Supreme Courts, have yet to abate the obnoxious situation in the judiciary.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022President says with digital currency, GDP will rise by $29bn in 10 years\n\n\u2022Nigeria first country to launch electronic money in Africa\n\n\u2022Emefiele: new intervention will jumpstart productive base of economy \u2022Reiterates Nigeria cannot fritter FX on cheap imports, currency speculators\n\nDeji Elumoye, James Emejo and Sonia Mayomi in Abuja\n\nIn line with efforts to enhance the payment system and boost transactions, President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday launched the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), also known as eNaira, in Abuja. This was as Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, unveiled a new financial instrument tagged, \u201cThe 100 for 100 PPP \u2013 Policy on Production and Productivity,\u201d meant to stimulate activities in private sector companies in the country that would be selected.\n\nBuhari said during the launch of the digital currency that with the introduction of eNaira, the country\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was projected to rise by $29 billion in the next 10 years. He stressed that Nigeria was the first country in Africa and one of the first in the world to introduce digital currency.\n\nThe president stated, \u201cIndeed, some estimates indicate that the adoption of CBDC and its underlying technology, called blockchain, can increase Nigeria\u2019s GDP by US$29 billion over the next 10 years.\n\n\u201cCBDCs can also help increase remittances, foster cross border trade, improve financial inclusion, make monetary policy more effective, and enable the government to send direct payments to citizens eligible for specific welfare programmes.\u201d\n\nThe president assured Nigerians of the safety and scalability of the CBDC. He disclosed that the journey to create a digital currency for Nigeria began in 2017.\n\nAccording to him, \u201dWork intensified over the past several months with several brainstorming exercises, deployment of technical partners and advisers, collaboration with the Ministries of Communication and Digital Economy and its sister agencies like the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), integration of banking software across the country and painstaking tests to ensure the robustness, safety and scalability of the CBDC System.\u201d\n\nThe president also explained why he supported the initiative, saying in recent times, the use of physical cash in conducting business and making payments has been on the decline.\n\nThe decline was exacerbated by the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resurgence of a new digital economy, stressed.\n\nBuhari stated, \u201cAlongside these developments, businesses, households, and other economic agents have sought for new means of making payments in the new circumstances.\n\n\u201cThe absence of a swift and effective solution to these requirements, as well as fears that central banks\u2019 actions sometimes lead to hyperinflation created the space for non-government entities to establish new forms of \u2018private currencies\u2019 that seemed to have gained popularity and acceptance across the world, including here in Nigeria.\n\n\u201dIn response to these developments, an overwhelming majority of central banks across the world have started to consider issuing digital currencies in order to cater for businesses and households seeking faster, safer, easier and cheaper means of payment.\n\n\u201cA handful of countries, including China, Bahamas, and Cambodia, have already issued their own CBDCs. A 2021 survey of central banks around the world by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) found that almost 90 per cent are actively researching the potential for CBDCs, 60 per cent were experimenting with the technology, and 14 per cent were deploying pilot projects.\n\n\u201cNeedless to add, close monitoring and close supervision will be necessary in the early stages of implementation to study the effect of eNaira on the economy as a whole.\n\n\u201dIt is on the basis of this that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) sought and received my approval to explore issuing Nigeria\u2019s own Central Bank Digital Currency, named the eNaira.\u201d\n\nThe president also said CBN\u2019s reputation as a leading innovator, \u201cin the form of money they produce, and in the payment services they deploy for efficient transactions,\u201d inspired him to approve eNaira.\n\nHe noted that Nigeria\u2019s apex bank had invested heavily in creating a payment system that was ranked in the top 10 in the world and, certainly, the best in Africa.\n\nBuhari explained, \u201cThis payment system now provides high-value and time-critical payment services to financial institutions, and ultimately serves as the backbone for every electronic payment in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThey have also supported several private-sector initiatives to improve the existing payments landscape, and in turn, have created some of the world\u2019s leading payment service providers today.\u201d\n\nEmefiele said with the new initiative, CBN would advertise, screen, scrutinise and financially support 100 targeted private sector companies in 100 days, beginning from November 1. Under the initiative, the CBN governor said, a new set of 100 companies would be rolled out every 100 days and their names would be published in the national dailies for Nigerians to see and confirm.\n\nHe said the new initiative would be managed by the CBN Development Finance Department, under his direct supervision.\n\nThe CBN governor pointed out that the initiative would be the best and most sustainable way to strengthen the value of the naira, insisting that what the country requires is production and more production.\n\nEmefiele explained, \u201cWorking through banks, the financial instrument will be available to their customers in critical areas to boost the production and productivity, and to immediately transform and jumpstart the productive base of the economy.\n\n\u201cAfter these 100 projects by companies in the first 100 days from November 1, we will take the next 100 companies/projects for another 100 days beginning February 1, 2022, and then another 100 companies for another 100 days beginning from May 1, 2022.\u201d\n\nHe said the instrument was part of measures to reverse the country\u2019s overreliance on imports, adding that the country cannot afford to waste its reserves on cheap imports and currency speculators.\n\nEmefiele also assured that there was no cause for alarm over foreign exchange (FX) availability in the country, pointing out that the country\u2019s FX reserves are strong and, \u201cindeed, getting stronger by the day, crossing the $40 billion mark, and is one of the highest in Africa \u2013 and growing.\u201d\n\nOn the bank\u2019s latest intervention to support companies, the CBN governor said, \u201cWe believe that if we target and support the right companies and projects, we will see a significant, measurable and verifiable increase in local production and productivity, reduction in certain imports, increase in non-oil exports, and improvements in the FX-generating capacity of the economy.\u201d\n\nEmefiele stated that the current challenges with the country\u2019s exchange rate started since the advent of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) led Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) in 1986, and the introduction of the Second Tier Foreign Exchange (SFEM) market. He said the local currency had been on a one-way free fall from parity to the US Dollar in 1984 to over N410/USD today.\n\nHe said about 35 years later, Nigeria had not been able to achieve the many promises and objectives of that programme.\n\n\u201cInstead, what we have seen is widespread import dependency, which have wiped out most of our production and manufacturing bases and exported all our jobs in the process,\u201d he said.\n\nEmefiele queried, \u201cWhat has happened to the massive textile factories across our nation, such that we import almost all cotton products when we are rich in cotton?\n\n\u201cWhat has happened to our vehicle assembly plants across the nation such that we import most vehicles and have become a massive dumping ground for dying second-hand vehicles?\n\n\u201cWhat has happened to our rubber plantations through which we made the best tyres and rubber products in the world? What has happened to our groundnut pyramids? What has happened to our cocoa farms? What has happened to our palm oil mills?\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cWe must return to massive home-made production; we must get our people working again. We must create the economic environment for massive domestic production and significant non-oil exports.\u201d\n\nThe CBN governor said the country must return to an employment-led growth anchored on productivity and rewarding producers of local goods, services, innovation and new technologies.\n\n\u201cIf you consume cheap imports and export our jobs, we will make you pay dearly; but if you produce locally \u2013 with little or no foreign inputs beyond machinery \u2013 we will support you, and the markets will reward you abundantly.\u201d\n\nHe said the 100 PPP policy was in addition to other policies and interventions of the CBN meant to support the economy, especially, through the trying times of COVID-19.\n\nEmefiele said with growing interest in CBDC around the world, the CBN had commenced extensive study, consultations, identification of use cases and the testing of the CBDC concept in a Sandbox environment as far back as 2017. He said the objective of the research was to establish a compelling case for the adoption of a digital currency in the country to enable a more prosperous and inclusive economy for all Nigerians.\n\nHe added that following the completion of the preliminary work, the researchers and experts at the CBN were able to establish that a digital currency will drive a more cashless, inclusive, and digital economy as well as complement the gains of previous policy measures and the fast growing payment platforms.\n\nCBN decided to implement its own CBDC and to name the digital currency eNaira, with the expectation that the innovation would make significant positive difference to Nigeria and Nigerians, he stated.\n\nEmefiele said the eNaira would support a resilient payment ecosystem, encourage rapid financial inclusion, reduce the cost of processing cash, enable direct and transparent welfare intervention to citizens and increase revenue and tax collection.\n\nHe said eNaira would also facilitate diaspora remittances, reduce the cost of financial transactions, and improve the efficiency of payments.\n\nEmefiele added, \u201cTherefore, the eNaira is Nigeria\u2019s CBDC and it is the digital equivalent of the physical naira. As the tagline simply encapsulates, the eNaira is the same naira with far more possibilities.\n\n\u201cThe eNaira \u2013 like the physical naira \u2013 is a legal tender in Nigeria and a liability of the CBN. The eNaira and naira will have the same value and will always be exchanged at one naira to one eNaira.\u201d\n\nEmefiele said in a bid to further de-risk the process, CBN had given careful consideration to the entire payment and financial architecture and designed the eNaira to complement and strengthen these ecosystems. He said the bank had also implemented safeguards and policies to maintain the integrity of the financial system.\n\nThe CBN boss added that there would be strict adherence to the anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) standards in order to preserve the integrity and stability of Nigeria\u2019s payment system.\n\nHe said since the eNaira platform went live, there had been overwhelming interest and encouraging response from Nigerians and others across the world, with over 2.5 million daily visits to the website.\n\nAccording to him, 33 banks are fully integrated and live on the platform while N500 million had been successfully minted by the central bank, including N200 million, which had been issued to financial institutions.\n\nEmefiele said over 2,000 customers have been on-boarded while120 merchants had successfully registered on the eNaira platform.\n\nHe said, \u201cToday, customers who download the eNaira Speed Wallet App will be able to perform the following: Onboard and create their wallet, fund their eNaira wallet from their bank account, transfer eNaira from their wallet to another wallet, and make payment for purchases at registered merchant locations.\u201d\n\nEmefiele acknowledged there was a continuing debate on the true value of the naira, adding, \u201crather than worry today on the direction of the exchange rate, let us take a step back and analyse how we got here, in the first place.\u201d\n\nHe commended the CBN staff that worked tirelessly to deliver on the central bank\u2019s numerous projects.\n\nSpeaking further in an interview with THISDAY, Emefiele said, \u201cWe would not embark on a project where we have not really dimensioned the risks; you identify risks and you now measure the risks and then we think about how to manage the risks and we have looked at it.\n\n\u201cThere is no need, absolutely no reason for anybody to be afraid of the risk of even hacking your account and the rest of that.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThis morning I set up my account and my account is operating very well. I talked about the BVN; the BVN is one of the best payment systems infrastructure that we have put in place and I can assure you that with all that has been done, you cannot hack into it.\n\n\u201cIf somebody hacks into yours, it will be because you were reckless in handling your information but not that the system failed.\u201d\n\nHe described eNaira as an extension of the payment system in Nigeria, which would enhance payments outside the country.\n\nHe said, \u201cYou can make payment for goods and services rendered to somebody who even resides outside the country as long as he is willing to accept Naira.\n\n\u201cWe will see eventually that what it does is that your reliance on third currency would be reduced by embracing eNaira. That is one area that I am looking forward to, how this would help our country.\u201d\n\nCBN Waives Charges on eNaira Transactions for 90 Days\n\nCBN yesterday said charges for transactions that originate from its eNaira platform would be free from charges for the first 90 days, commencing October 25. The bank noted that it would, thereafter, revert to applicable charges as outlined in the Guide to Charges by Banks, Other Financial and Non-bank Financial Institutions.\n\nThis was revealed in a circular on the Regulatory Guidelines on the eNaira, dated October 25, 2021, which was signed by the apex bank\u2019s Director, Financial Policy and Regulations Department, Chibuzo Efobi, and addressed to all stakeholders.\n\nCBN restated in the circular that the digital currency would complement cash as a less costly, more efficient, generally accepted, safe and trusted means of payment and store of value.\n\nIt added that the eNaira would also improve monetary policy effectiveness, enhance government\u2019s capacity to deoy targeted social interventions, provide alternative less costly channels for collection of government revenue and boost remittances through formal channels.\n\nAccording to the apex bank, the guidelines further seek to provide simplicity in the operation of the eNaira, encourage general acceptability and use, promote low cost of transactions, drive financial inclusion, while minimising inherent risks of disintermediation or any negative impact of the system.\n\nThe eNaira wallet is required to access, use and hold eNaira, which will be exchangeable for other Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC).\n\nThe CBN added that the AML/CFT checks for fraud prevention and detection would apply on the eNaira platform.\n\nHence, financial institutions are required to comply with the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act 2011 (as amended), the Terrorism (Prevention) Act 2011 (as amended) and all subsisting anti-money laundering laws and regulations as may be issued by the CBN from time to time.\n\nUnder the new system, Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) may receive revenue in eNaira; and make payments in same form.\n\nIt added that users of the eNaira would be introduced to a tiered structure with transaction and balance limits.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022We\u2019re determined to proceed with election, says INEC\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja, David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka and Gideon Arinze in Enugu\n\nThe National Security Adviser (NSA), Major General Babagana Monguno, yesterday, warned that nobody or group should test the resolve by the federal government to guarantee the November 6 gubernatorial election in Anambra State.\n\nThe NSA, who spoke at a meeting of inter-security agencies for the elections, where the INEC chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu also said the commission was determined to ensure that the Anambra election takes place as scheduled, because according to him, 12 out of 14 items had already taken place.\n\nAlso, a coalition of civil society organisations based in the South-east has waded into alleged plans by separatist group, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) to disrupt the forthcoming Anambra governorship election slated for November 6.\n\nMonguno, who was the co-chairman of election security in Nigeria, spoke against the backdrop of threat by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) to disrupt the exercise and warned that, \u201cFor those of us in security, we have already done what we are supposed to do.\n\n\u201cAll security agencies have been asked to conduct themselves well in a professional manner and exhibit the highest level of professionalism and restraint and operate within the confines of the law, not in any way that will jeopardise the exercise.\n\n\u201cWe are going to ensure that the people of Anambra undergo this exercise without any incident. We want to offer brotherly advice to our brothers, who want to destabilise the process to think again. We are all eager to achieve results that will be acceptable to everybody. I don\u2019t think it will be right for anyone to ignite crisis. Please, think again.\n\n\u201cYes, the law enforcement agencies will not sit by and allow people terrorise people, commit homicide. They have been told to watched out for these elements. I am appealing to you to stay in your wards and local governments and behave yourself. Anyone that wants to disrupt the process will be brought to book,\u201d the NSA warned.\n\nReiterating the importance of the November 6 governorship election, Monguno said, \u201cWe all know how important it is for us. Election is number one legitimate right of every citizen and we must not deny them that right in an atmosphere devoid of rancour and violence. Just like the chairman said, we need to do better than what we did in Edo and Ondo,\u201d he declared.\n\nOn the casualties so far suffered by security agencies and INEC staff in Anambra State, the NSA said, \u201cI know you have gone through a lot of pains, but don\u2019t allow that to dampen your spirit or get into lethargy. I wish you fruitful deliberations.\u201d\n\nThe INEC chairman, speaking earlier, said, \u201cOur deployment of non-sensitive materials and training of personnel for the election have virtually been concluded. The Commission has successfully accomplished 12 out of the 14 activities listed in the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the election released in January this year.\n\n\u201cThe two outstanding activities are the last day of campaign, at midnight on Thursday 4th November 2021 and Election Day, which remains Saturday 6th November 2021. The REC for Anambra State is here to fully provide an update on the implementation of other activities and INEC\u2019s general state of readiness for the election.\n\n\u201cINEC is determined to proceed with the Anambra State Governorship election as scheduled. The safety and protection of voters, our personnel, accredited observers, the media and materials are cardinal considerations in any election. We have been assured by the security agencies of a secure environment for the election.\n\n\u201cI am sure the Commissioner Police, Anambra State, in his briefing, will provide more details regarding preparations on the ground. I wish to place on record the continued support of security agencies to the Commission during elections. Particularly noteworthy is the high level of professional conduct of the agencies in the last two major elections in Edo and Ondo States. Indeed, Edo and Ondo have become the standard for securing elections in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe professionalism and neutrality exhibited by the security agencies in the two elections have been widely praised nationally and internationally. We are confident that this will be replicated in Anambra State,\u201d Yakubu said.\n\nHe, therefore, commended the security agencies for the support INEC had received from religious, traditional and community leaders for peaceful elections.\n\nHe said the commission was also working with the National Peace Committee under the leadership of a former Head of State, General Abdulsalami Abubakar, to bring all political parties and candidates for the Anambra State Governorship election to commit to peace before, during and after the election.\n\nYakubu later introduced two national commissioners sworn in yesterday. They are Kunle Cornelius Ajayi, a Professor of Political Science at the Ekiti State University and Muhammad Sani Kallah, a retired Professor of Ecology and Range Management at the Ahmadu Bello University Zaria. They are the new national commissioners representing the South West and North West geo-political zones respectively.\n\nBut the civil society groups in the South-east, under the umbrella of Coalition of Southeast Democracy and Human Rights Organisations (CSBDHROs) said the action of the separatist group was targeted at the Anambra election.\n\nAddressing newsmen yesterday in Enugu at an International Press Conference, the organisations said disrupting the Anambra election would not be of any benefit to their struggle, rather, it would aid emergency rule, that would not be to the advantage of Anambra people.\n\nChairman Board of Trustees of International Society for Civil Liberties and the Rule of Law (Intersociety), Mr Emeka Umeagbalasi, who addressed journalists on behalf of other rights organisations, called on IPOB to rescind their decision, while also calling for the release of Nnamdi Kanu.\n\n\u201cWe are calling on our brothers (IPOB) not to toe that line (disrupting election). When a group tells you that they will lockdown the South East from November 4 to November 10, and we know that Anambra has election on November 6 and November 7, what does that tell you? The election is the target.\n\n\u201cWe want to tell the IPOB people that nobody knows it all. We have been fighting their cause for a long time, because we know that what they are doing is within their fundamental human right. But we want to tell them that once in a while, they should make consultations.\n\n\u201cThey should sometimes reach out to people like us. The people you see here are leaders of CSOs, and seminal thinkers in the South east, ideas are our currency. We implore them to come to us and exchange ideas once in a while, because no one knows it all.\u201d\n\nThe groups said to disrupt the election by announcing a sit-at-home exercise on that day would mean calling for emergency rule in the state, which they said would ultimately give the state to the federal government and allow them to impose anyone on her, and that would not be fair.\n\n\u201cThat would allow the election to be massively and scientifically rigged or to be stopped will be disastrously calamitous and place the state under \u2018Khaki or Agbada Caliphate\u2019 and \u2018a nomadic rainforest state\u2019,\u201d Umeagbalasi appealed to the secessionists.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Our faith in our Armed Forces remains unshaken and as a government we will do all within our powers to ensure that our Armed Forces are motivated to perform optimally.\n\n\u201dThey have time and again demonstrated unparalleled patriotism, courage, loyalty and commitment as they grapple with the daunting challenges of defending Nigeria\u2019s territorial integrity.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari described the emblem as a sign of the sacrifices and blood shed by officers and men of the Armed Forces for peace and security of Nigeria.\n\n\u201dIt is also a sign of our resolve to remain united as a nation and confront any challenges we may face. It is a sign of our resolve to say no to divisions and embrace one another as a united indivisible country,\u201d he added.\n\nThe president called on all Nigerians to make generous donations to the Nigerian Legion, support the widows and orphans of the fallen heroes, procure the emblems and wear them with pride.\n\n\u201cThe same call goes to all visitors and friends of Nigeria as well as corporate bodies operating in Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the Nigerian Legion, the president noted that the need to maintain the comradeship that existed during the service among officers and men of the Armed Forces led to its establishment through an Act of the National Assembly.\n\nHe commended the Nigerian Legion for living up to its mandate of catering for the welfare of ex-servicemen and those that distinguished themselves in the wars Nigeria participated in.\n\nThe president stated that the veterans\u2019 organisation has remained a veritable pool of abundant and diverse human resources.\n\n\u201dI have the pleasure to acknowledge the contributions of retired officers and men of the Nigerian Armed Forces to the ongoing war on insurgency.\n\n\u201dThe government will continue to welcome these vital contributions. I charge the Ministry of Defence to continue to promote the engagement of our retired officers and men in seeking avenues of contributing to our national affairs.\n\n\u201dI am glad to note that the Nigerian veterans have contributed to the socioeconomic development of our country through engagement in productive ventures thereby generating employment opportunities for themselves and other Nigerians.\n\n\u201dThis is a further testimonial to the patriotism of these Nigerians. They have demonstrated abiding faith in Nigeria and its development. We sincerely commend them and all Nigerians who have continued to believe in Nigeria by making it their investment destination,\u201d he said.\n\nSee Images\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The Nigerian police authorities have come under immense pressure from top government officials, monarchs and ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftains to clear suspended commander of the IGP Intelligence Response Team (IRT), Abba Kyari after an investigation into alleged infractions committed by the disgraced police officer.\n\nOn August 26, Usman Baba, Inspector-General of Police (IGP) received the report of the panel set up to probe the bribery allegations against Kyari, over his relationship with Hushpuppi, the self-confessed international fraudster.\n\nAn FBI agent, Andrew Innocenti, had in a document titled, \u2018Criminal Complaint By Telephone Or Other Reliable Electronic Means\u2019 filed before the United States District Court for the Central District of California, alleged that a suspected fraudster, Abass Ramon, aka Hushpuppi, contracted Kyari to detain a co-conspirator, Chibuzo Vincent, for threatening to expose the alleged $1.1 million fraud committed against a Qatari businessman. See Also Police Probe Report: Nigeria Police Query Disgraced Officer, Abba Kyari Over Communications With Suspected Fraudster, Hushpuppi\n\nThe agency said Hushpuppi paid $20,600 into a bank account provided by Kyari.\n\nThe Police Service Commission (PSC) had suspended Kyari from office as a Deputy Commissioner of Police and head of the IRT based on the recommendation of the IGP.\n\nIt was gathered that the DIG Joseph Egbunike-led panel, which submitted its report in August, established that there were infractions on the part of Kyari in his communications with Hushpuppi but sources told SaharaReporters that the police authorities are being pressured to clear him of wrongdoings. See Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: Hushpuppi: Police Panel Recommends Demotion For Disgraced DCP, Abba Kyari To Prevent His Extradition To US\n\n\u201cPolice authorities are being pressured to clear Kyari; those campaigning for him claim he is the only one who can find a solution to the insecurity in South-East,\u201d a police source told SaharaReporters.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that one of the influential Nigerians working behind the scenes to ensure Kyari is off the hook is the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN).\n\n\"Not only some influential Nigerians, even Malami (AGF) also wants to clear Abba Kyari,\" another top source said.\n\nIt was also learnt that a massive publicity campaign had been launched to call for his reinstatement and get him off the hook. See Also Police Hushpuppi: Police Panel Submits \u2018Damning Report\u2019 On Disgraced DCP, Abba Kyari\n\nSuch campaigners have seen social media as a veritable tool to deploy to sway the mind of the police authorities and the public.\n\nFor instance, a political pressure group, Concerned Advocates For Good Governance (CAGC), recently said it had consulted US-based law firms to defend Kyari.\n\n\u201cWe have diligently consulted with about three notable law firms in the United States to give us their legal opinions on what can be done to formidably defend Abba Kyari,\u201d Olusegun Bamgbose, the President-General of CAGC had said.\n\n\u201cOne of the leading firms has replied to us and gone ahead to send us the indictment against Abba Kyari and other details which is about 26 pages.\n\n\u201cThe reputable law firm, well-grounded on extradition issues, has assured us of their readiness to represent Kyari\u2019s interest before and after his possible extradition to the US.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, a chieftain of the ruling APC and Special Adviser to Lagos State Governor on Drainage and Water Resources, Joe Igbokwe recently alleged that the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), its security wing, Eastern Security Network (ESN) and bandits have been capitalising on Kyari absence to wreak havoc in the country, particularly in the South-East.\n\nHe posted on Facebook, \"FEDERAL GOVERNMENT biko, WE WANT ABBA KYARI BACK IN THE SOUTH EAST. IT LOOKS AS IF IPOB & EASTERN SECURITY NETWORK, BANDITS ARE CELEBRATING HIS EXIT.

The mayhem and heinous crimes being committed with impunity down the South East is alarming and needs his attention.\n\n\u201cThe current Man in charge in my humble opinion is finding Abba's shoes too big to fill. The South East is currently nosediving into a 'failed region'. May God Save My Home Land.\u201d\n\nOn Instagram, Chinedum Agwaramgbo said, \"Pls ABBA KYARI should be re-instated! I don't really care now about the allegations against him...which are only basically that - unproven allegations! South East is in danger of imploding!

See Also Police Abba Kyari Asked Me To Pay The Proceed Of Hotel Owned By Kidnap Kingpin Into My Bank Account \u2014 Police Lawyer\n\nTop sources in the Nigeria Police Force had told SaharaReporters that the plot by the police authorities to hand Kyari a demotion was to frustrate his much anticipated extradition to the United States.\n\nSaharaReporters had also reported that the probe panel set up by the IGP after three weeks of dilly-dallying turned in its report on the alleged indictment of Kyari by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).\n\nCompetent sources however revealed that what the panel recommended to the IGP was a demotion \u2013 the report which would form the basis of what the Police Service Commission would act upon.\n\n\u201cThe police report on Abba Kyari only recommends demotion to a lower rank. They figured that he could be extradited if dismissed. Kyari\u2019s real enemies are at the police service commission and what they want is an outright dismissal.\n\n\u201cBut they have to defer to the IGP. The IGP is no doubt Kyari\u2019s godfather.

          "text": "The Nigerian police authorities have come under immense pressure from top government officials, monarchs and ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftains to clear suspended commander of the IGP Intelligence Response Team (IRT), Abba Kyari after an investigation into alleged infractions committed by the disgraced police officer.\n\nOn August 26, Usman Baba, Inspector-General of Police (IGP) received the report of the panel set up to probe the bribery allegations against Kyari, over his relationship with Hushpuppi, the self-confessed international fraudster.\n\nAn FBI agent, Andrew Innocenti, had in a document titled, \u2018Criminal Complaint By Telephone Or Other Reliable Electronic Means\u2019 filed before the United States District Court for the Central District of California, alleged that a suspected fraudster, Abass Ramon, aka Hushpuppi, contracted Kyari to detain a co-conspirator, Chibuzo Vincent, for threatening to expose the alleged $1.1 million fraud committed against a Qatari businessman. See Also Police Probe Report: Nigeria Police Query Disgraced Officer, Abba Kyari Over Communications With Suspected Fraudster, Hushpuppi\n\nThe agency said Hushpuppi paid $20,600 into a bank account provided by Kyari.\n\nThe Police Service Commission (PSC) had suspended Kyari from office as a Deputy Commissioner of Police and head of the IRT based on the recommendation of the IGP.\n\nIt was gathered that the DIG Joseph Egbunike-led panel, which submitted its report in August, established that there were infractions on the part of Kyari in his communications with Hushpuppi but sources told SaharaReporters that the police authorities are being pressured to clear him of wrongdoings. See Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: Hushpuppi: Police Panel Recommends Demotion For Disgraced DCP, Abba Kyari To Prevent His Extradition To US\n\n\u201cPolice authorities are being pressured to clear Kyari; those campaigning for him claim he is the only one who can find a solution to the insecurity in South-East,\u201d a police source told SaharaReporters.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that one of the influential Nigerians working behind the scenes to ensure Kyari is off the hook is the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN).\n\n\"Not only some influential Nigerians, even Malami (AGF) also wants to clear Abba Kyari,\" another top source said.\n\nIt was also learnt that a massive publicity campaign had been launched to call for his reinstatement and get him off the hook. See Also Police Hushpuppi: Police Panel Submits \u2018Damning Report\u2019 On Disgraced DCP, Abba Kyari\n\nSuch campaigners have seen social media as a veritable tool to deploy to sway the mind of the police authorities and the public.\n\nFor instance, a political pressure group, Concerned Advocates For Good Governance (CAGC), recently said it had consulted US-based law firms to defend Kyari.\n\n\u201cWe have diligently consulted with about three notable law firms in the United States to give us their legal opinions on what can be done to formidably defend Abba Kyari,\u201d Olusegun Bamgbose, the President-General of CAGC had said.\n\n\u201cOne of the leading firms has replied to us and gone ahead to send us the indictment against Abba Kyari and other details which is about 26 pages.\n\n\u201cThe reputable law firm, well-grounded on extradition issues, has assured us of their readiness to represent Kyari\u2019s interest before and after his possible extradition to the US.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, a chieftain of the ruling APC and Special Adviser to Lagos State Governor on Drainage and Water Resources, Joe Igbokwe recently alleged that the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), its security wing, Eastern Security Network (ESN) and bandits have been capitalising on Kyari absence to wreak havoc in the country, particularly in the South-East.\n\nHe posted on Facebook, \"FEDERAL GOVERNMENT biko, WE WANT ABBA KYARI BACK IN THE SOUTH EAST. IT LOOKS AS IF IPOB & EASTERN SECURITY NETWORK, BANDITS ARE CELEBRATING HIS EXIT. WE NEED HIM BACK BY ALL MEANS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.\u201d\n\nAnother Facebook user wrote, \u201cPlease @\u2068BisongOnonye\u2069, can Abba Kyari be restored to the Nigeria Police? The mayhem and heinous crimes being committed with impunity down the South East is alarming and needs his attention.\n\n\u201cThe current Man in charge in my humble opinion is finding Abba's shoes too big to fill. The South East is currently nosediving into a 'failed region'. May God Save My Home Land.\u201d\n\nOn Instagram, Chinedum Agwaramgbo said, \"Pls ABBA KYARI should be re-instated! I don't really care now about the allegations against him...which are only basically that - unproven allegations! South East is in danger of imploding! BRING ABBA KYARI BACK!\"\n\nAnd in response to Agwaramgbo, one Bond Chris Ohuche said, \"So no other police officer is capable?

All orders in process will be shipped or refunded. Sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused,\u201d a message on the Africa eShop website reads.\n\nLaunched in 2019, eShop was designed to help global retailers sell goods to Africa\u2019s consumer markets.\n\nThrough the platform, consumers in Africa could shop directly from more than 200 US- and UK-based online retailers, with purchases delivered to their door by DHL Express.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBeing a global leader in express logistics, DHL appeared to be well-positioned to connect African consumers with global brands, and an early-stage boom suggested that presumption was correct.\n\nWithin seven weeks of operations in 11 countries, DHL expanded the platform to nine more countries across the continent. This followed \u201cimpressive growth\u201d in the usage of the Africa eShop app, Hennie Heymans, CEO of DHL Express Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) said at the time. By August of 2019, the platform had been rolled out to 34 countries across SSA.\n\nOnce considered a threat to leading e-commerce players in Africa, DHL\u2019s eShop offered relatively faster delivery compared to its peers but was also one of the most expensive platforms for international shopping, some of its users told TechCabal.\n\nDHL is closing down its Africa eShop. Image credit: TechCabal\n\nHowever, for reasons not stated, eShop has now been delisted from mobile application stores and some features on the platform have been disabled as DHL moves to shut down the service on October 30.\n\nIt is not immediately clear if the company is closing its eShop operations in other regions too, such as the Middle East and North Africa (MENA).\n\nTechCabal reached out to DHL Africa for answers but has yet to receive a response at the time of publication.\n\nHi, unfortunately the eShop is closing 30 October.

          "title": "How Koa is helping Kenyans build and manage wealth",
          "text": "Despite being the third-largest economy in sub-Saharan Africa and East Africa\u2019s financial and commercial hub, Kenya has a savings rate of 12%, lowest in East Africa\u2014way below Africa\u2019s average of 17%.\n\nThere are many factors attributed to this low rate: high spending appetite among young Kenyans, high cost of living, especially in urban areas, and black tax. There\u2019s also a problem of cumbersome saving options and lack of proper financial education that exposes people to the importance of savings.\n\nThis is a big problem two pan-African tech operators Delila Kidanu and Alexis Roman are tackling through Koa, the digital saving platform they co-founded.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nKoa founding story\n\nThe story of Koa can be traced back to MEST Africa as it\u2019s the first place the two co-founders met and worked. But the idea to start a company together hadn\u2019t been born yet. They were only heavily involved in MEST\u2019s mission, which is to incubate and help scale African entrepreneurs and startups, and were exposed to a lot of people and the process of building solutions for African problems.\n\nKidanu was born in Ethiopia, moved to Kenya as a child and lived there until she went to the UK to study international relations and business. She then moved to Sweden for a master\u2019s degree in innovation management and entrepreneurship. She proceeded to work with an NGO in Belgium to drive policies around global education before she moved back to Kenya to consult for international companies looking to set up shops in East Africa. After doing that for a while, she joined MEST Africa.\n\nRoman, on the other hand, was born in Paris but moved to Togo as a child where he stayed and schooled until he moved to Canada to study economics and finance. He started a business after school but later decided to go work in a traditional financial institution, which he called a mistake that came with lots of needed experience. He moved back to Africa to join MEST Africa in Ghana.\n\nAfter leaving MEST Africa, the duo forayed into different businesses but kept in touch and would always meet up whenever they were in the same city. Early 2020, they became colleagues again and started working as startup scouts for an early-fund venture capital, Microtraction.\n\nKoa co-founders\n\n\u201cWe spent a lot of time in Ghana, Nigeria and Kenya. Both Delila and I saw the popularity of digital saving products in Nigeria, like PiggyVest and Cowrywise, and how they were serving a real need for customers. But when we looked beyond Nigeria, as a market, we felt like there was a significant gap in other countries,\u201d Koa\u2019s CEO Roman told TechCabal.\n\nThey went ahead to speak to thousands of people in Kenya and discovered that 60% of the people relied on inefficient Informal Saving Groups and Cooperatives to save and access financial products. It became more obvious that lack of seamless saving option is another big factor aiding the problem. So they started deliberating about solving the problem the same way PiggyVest and Cowrywise are doing in Nigeria.\n\nIn December 2020, they finally founded Koa with Bubunyo Nyavor, their old colleague from MEST. The platform went into beta in April and was launched to the public in June.\n\nThe platform makes it easy for users to set personal saving goals towards a particular expenses like paying school fee, buying a new phones, cars or even marriage. The app nudge users\u2019 by sending them daily, weekly or monthly reminders to deposit into the goals they set. Koa also makes it easy for users to track their progress so that they won\u2019t slack or help them back on track when they do.\n\nKoa is playing in a tough market and so is investing heavily in educational content that exposes its users to the importance of savings, especially in creating generational wealth. So far, according to Kidanu, the platform has already passed a 12,000 users mark and has received a deposit of 11,105,315.30 KES ($100,000) since its launch.\n\nA few weeks ago, the company pitched at the TechCrunch battlefield as one of the only two African startups that made the cut and was the only African startup that made it to top-five. Both co-founders said it was a great learning curve for them and another validation that their product is essential in solving this real-life problem.\n\nIncentive: make more money while saving\n\nIt\u2019s not only difficult for Kenyans to save; the lack of access to formal financial products also made it hard to invest. So, Koa is killing two birds with one stone by holding its users\u2019 money in a money market through a partnership with Britam, an asset manager in the Kenyan market.\n\nOn Koa, users earn up to 10% interest on their money annually, depending on market conditions. They also earn interest daily, which is good because they see their money grow in real time. This strategy has helped to cement the gospel of building wealth through saving and passive investing.\n\n\u201cOur partner has different types of funds. For us, we needed to be able to tap into a lower risk investment so that we don\u2019t lose our customer base that is a bit more risk-averse. So we opted to work with Britam to invest in their money market fund,\u201d Kidanu said on why they choose such investment and the reality of their promised ROI.\n\nIn fintech, customer trust is key. Once you hack that, scaling becomes a lot less harder. It\u2019s evident in the way savings platforms like PiggyVest transparently communicate with their users and how much loyalty their users have for them. So are Koa users aware that their money is being invested in a money market?\n\n\u201cCustomer trust is very important to us, and we communicate with our customers in terms of where their money is, who our partner is, why we chose them, and how their fund flow works. We only make the investment passive because we want to ensure a seamless experience for our users who are new to this,\u201d Kidanu added.\n\nMaking money for a company whose major mission is to first help people who, before now, wouldn\u2019t even think of saving money and building wealth can be tricky because charging customers directly can end up driving them away. They don\u2019t think of the money they could make but the little that\u2019s being asked of them. So how does Koa make money as a business?\n\n\u201cWe make money when we get a commission from our asset management partner on funds invested. So we didn\u2019t want a situation where we\u2019d have to charge our customers directly for the service. We want them to enjoy the service for free,\u201d Roman said.\n\nThe founders said they\u2019ve raised a pre-seed institutional investment. On the back of the raised funds and their seed round, which closes soon, Kidanu and Roman also plan to scale fast and expand to neighbouring countries like Tanzania and Uganda that have the same saving problem.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "text": "Apple\u2019s second fall event, tagged \u201cApple Unleashed\u201d, happened on Monday October 18 and everybody and their uncles have been talking about the exciting series of updates released at the event.\n\nUnlike its September event that opened with drone-captured California landscapes in the company of live music, this recent event opened in a small garage with instrumental music, composed from a combination of simple sounds from the Mac, AirPods and HomePod.\n\nApple released two new Macbooks: the MacBook Pro 16-inch (2021) and MacBook Pro 14-inch (2021). The tech company went further to silence its critics with the two biggest surprises of the day: two new M1 chips\u2014the Apple M1 Pro and M1 Max\u2014which will power the new MacBooks and promise tremendous performance improvements over the silicon chips in previous MacBooks.\n\nIn a beautiful transition between Tim Cook and Zain Lowe, Apple also revealed the Music Voice Plan, a new subscription category for Apple Music that allows users to seamlessly use Siri with Apple Music.\n\nThe tech giant also introduced AirPods 3 and some new HomePod mini colours.\n\nAnd in a move that looks like a joke but isn\u2019t, Apple wants to sell its users a microfibre cleaning cloth for $19. But that\u2019s Apple doing what it does best.\n\nHere is a detailed list of everything that was announced.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nApple Music subscription plan\n\nApple is undoubtedly bullish on music and how its users experience sounds. The fall event started off with the introduction of Apple Music Voice Plan, a new subscription offering that allows users to seamlessly enjoy Siri with Apple Music.\n\nSiri will now have custom playlists dedicated to various moods and settings and featuring several notable artists. The new Voice Plan will allow subscribers to listen to their favourite music at an affordable price.\n\nThis feature will kick off in 17 countries before expanding to more regions. As you might have guessed, no African countries are included in the kick-off regions.\n\nThe new Voice Plan will begin at just $4.99 a month, which is way lesser than the individual and family plan that are $9.99 and $14.99 respectively.\n\nApple Music plans\n\nNew colours for Apple HomePod Mini Smart Speaker\n\nAesthetics\u2014that\u2019s the simplest way to describe this update. Even though Apple won\u2019t be giving us colour variations in Mac, as demanded by lots of users, it has added new colours to the HomePod. They are now available in orange, yellow and blue.\n\nApple HomePod\n\nAirPods 3\n\nAirpods 3 was one of the most anticipated products on the list, and it was launched with new features. It has the same design as the AirPods Pro and is loaded with spatial audio along with new low-distortion drivers, with sweat and water resistance.\n\nIt has a battery life of over six hours and arrives with MagSafe and wireless charging. The new AirPods selling price starts at $179 and will be available from next week.\n\nM1 Pro And M1 Max Chips\n\nEarlier in this article, we called these updates the two biggest surprises of the night. We didn\u2019t get just one horsepower processor; we got two. Apple is generous and we appreciate that.\n\nThese two processors are like the SSC Tuatara of computer chips; they are, by far, the strongest and fastest processors from Apple\u2014and from any company\u2014to date.\n\nThese two chips power the newly released Mac.\n\nNew 14\u2033 and 16\u2033 MacBook Pros\n\nMacBook Pro\n\nIn our review of iOS 15, we mentioned that Apple is listening to its users now more than ever. And that\u2019s evident in this new update. The new Apple Silicon-powered MacBook Pros, in 14\u2033 and 16\u2033 variations, have a lot of the things people want. Some things they want them to add and some they want them to bring back.\n\nThere are more ports (HDMI and SD card reader), MagSafe charging, real function keys and no-touch bar, along with what they promise is blistering speed with extreme energy efficiency.\n\nThe two devices come with a 1080p camera, studio-quality mics, more powerful sound system, and large beautiful Mini-LED displays. Some critics likened it to a notebook with a superman ability.\n\nThe price starts at $1,999 for the 14-inch and $2,499 for the 16-inch. The basic models come as standard with the M1 Pro, 16GB of Unified Memory and a 512GB SSD. The 16-inch comes with the 10-core CPU instead of the 8-core in the 14-inch.\n\n\u201cIt looks like Apple intentionally released simple iPhone upgrades to lead their competitors on. Intel did their social experiment ads and capitalised on the inefficiency of Apple; then Microsoft had their event boasting about how they have built the best PC in Surface Studios, combining a cool form factor,\u201d Dumebi Iwuchukwu, design lead at Big Cabal Media, and of course an Apple fanboy, said in his unusual slack rants.\n\n\u201cNow Apple has blown them out of the water with better chips. The 64gb video memory is the most futuristic innovation from Apple so far; plus all these happened amidst a global chips shortage.\u201d he reluctantly concluded.\n\nThe prices of the two devices go up as their specs thicken. For instance, there\u2019s an addition of $500 on 14-inch for the M1 Max with 24-core GPU; 32-core GPU adds $700. You can jump up to 32GB of Unified memory but for another $400, and there is a range of SSDs available, 2TB, 4TB, and 8TB for a whopping $2,400 more.\n\nThe fully specced out 16-inch comes in at $6,099.\n\nInsane. At this point, we\u2019ll have to agree with Dumebi that Apple has blown its competition out of the waters with these updates, or can you tell us what can beat this in the world?\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "title": "Editi Effiong: father, writer, producer and tech bro",
          "text": "Editi Effiong\u2019s genius is quiet yet obvious at the same time. He\u2019s a multifaceted creator, builder and thinker\u2014unafraid to tackle the impossible without doubt. From setting up Anakle, a Nigeria-based digital marketing agency, 10 years ago to transitioning into film-making a few years later, Editi has established himself as one of the leading entrepreneurs of his generation. When asked how he would define himself, he responded with, \u201cI\u2019m a father, writer, producer, and tech bro.\n\nThe big picture: Editi Effiong is not your average guy\n\nMany people know Editi Effiong as the brains behind Anakle. Some others might know him for the films he made through his production company, Anakle Films or might have stumbled across him after his involvement in the post-#ENDSARS judicial hearing panel in 2020. Editi attended and documented the daily proceedings, sharing videos, photos and commentaries on his Twitter page. His dedication to reporting on how Lagos State investigated the unforgettable event that took place on October 20 last year, garnered him respect, admiration and a flock of new followers and cheerleaders.\n\nAnakle Films\u2019 theatrical releases, Up North and The Setup, were acquired by Netflix in 2019 and 2020 respectively. Up North, which was based on a story written by Editi, is best described as one of Nollywood\u2019s most adventurous films. Up North did two things successfully: It brought some versatility to Nollywood, Nigeria\u2019s behemoth movie industry; and heralded the arrival of a different Editi. He was no longer just the CEO of a well-respected digital agency with a client list that most marketing agencies would love to get their hands on\u2014Wikipedia, Flutterwave, Glo, to name a few\u2014he was now a film producer and writer who took his craft seriously.\n\nAn illustrated photo of Editi at a filming location in Northern Nigeria\n\nThe Set Up pulled us in a different direction. In this film, there are no adventures or lush, green fields. But there\u2019s suspense and the dirty underworld of crime. Anakle Films distributed The Set Up with legendary film-maker, Niyi Akinmolayan, sitting on the director\u2019s chair.\n\nEditi displayed his writing chops in his most recent short film, Fishbone, released in May 2020. Fishbone, written and directed by Effiong himself, unearths the terrifying business of counterfeit drugs and how it strips our society of its ability to show love and compassion. Fishbone is a deliberately revealing film; it shows us snapshots of Effiong\u2019s mind and showcases his directorial ingenuity.\n\nIn this exclusive interview with TechCabal, Editi opens up about his childhood, the complexity that is his mind, building Anakle, being a father, and his decision to become a full-time film-maker and writer.\n\nAnakle and the race to get businesses online\n\nEven though Editi is eager to hand over the CEO reins to Anakle\u2019s COO, Munachi \u201cMuna\u201d Nwoke-Ekpo, and purposefully step into his role as founder and CEO of Anakle Films, I was compelled to kick off the interview with questions about Anakle\u2019s beginnings.\n\nIn 2011, digital marketing didn\u2019t have as much clout as it does now. It is hard to imagine a world that didn\u2019t exist with numerous digital and social media platforms. Our current economic climate demands that entrepreneurs move their businesses online and acquire a new crop of customers who are obsessed with social media and consumer technology. In conversation, Editi is a masterful storyteller who uses transparency and humour to pull his listeners in. At no point during our chat did he leave me feeling confused or unimpressed.\n\nKoromone Koroye: What inspired you to start Anakle? What did you see and understand about digital marketing that most people didn\u2019t back in 2011?\n\nEditi Effiong: Back in 2011, we had a slide that predicted that internet penetration would deepen in five years. We also predicted that more than five million Nigerians would be on the internet and that that number would eventually rise to 30 million by 2016. Back then, mobile penetration wasn\u2019t that great and Blackberry phones were still a thing. My business partner, Abass, would charge business owners \u20a650,000 to help them run digital marketing campaigns. And that 50K came with a money-back guarantee: if we weren\u2019t able to successfully promote their brands, they got their money back without any hassles. I mean, how on earth does someone believe that the internet can help you sell more? But we saw that there was a market online and we bet big on what we saw.\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: According to the Digital 2021 report, there were an estimated 104 million internet users in Nigeria in January this year. Additionally, internet penetration stood at 50% and 33 million Nigerians with active social media accounts, within that same period.\n\nDo you remember Anakle\u2019s first major campaign?\n\nEditi: In 2010, we ran Interswitch\u2019s first digital campaign. We did this whole flash animation video to push Interswitch\u2019s anti-fraud campaign. I designed the flash. In the early stages of Anakle\u2019s business, I was in charge of execution and Abass handled business operations. So, in this flash animated campaign, if someone emails you for your password or PIN, you don\u2019t give them because Interswitch would never ask you for your PIN or personal information. It was a really great campaign at that time. I mean now, we might take a simple campaign like that for granted; but 12 years ago, building and executing a campaign like that was a phenomenal experience for us and the brands we served during that period.\n\nHow did businesses relate with social media back when Anakle started out?\n\nEditi: \u200b\u200bThe first bank to get on social media was GTB (Guaranty Trust Bank) followed by Diamond Bank. We worked on a project with them and they had their brand assets burned onto a CD. Yes, CDs were a thing back then. But, anyway, they opted for the CD route because they didn\u2019t want anyone to distribute their assets to other sources or agencies. So I picked up Diamond Bank\u2019s CD on a Tuesday and started working on it straight till Thursday. And Thursday happened to be my wedding day.\n\nWoah. You did client work on your wedding day?\n\nEditi: Yes! I was out in the foyer of the hotel room working on this project until I got called into the hall to say my vows and, you know, get married. So I put down my laptop, you know, went and got married and came back and continued working even through my honeymoon. And to think that this was only the second bank that we helped build a Facebook app and get them on social media. Diamond Bank was the second bank in Nigeria to go down the digital marketing route.\n\nIn the summer of 2010, there was a huge opportunity to help businesses get online. And one of the things Anakle was trying to do was help smaller businesses improve brand visibility by getting them acquainted with the internet. We didn\u2019t just target the big brands and enterprise businesses, especially in the beginning. Anakle saw the future of digital marketing and built a business out of it. Our mission was to help businesses grow into the online space, and that\u2019s pretty much it.\n\nAt what point did you realise that Anakle had fulfilled its mission, or at least a part of it?\n\nEditi: There have been many moments. In 2017 we did a very successful campaign with Wikipedia. And that campaign was a forerunner to what became Anakle films. That campaign counted as a major milestone for us. There\u2019s also the part we played in hiring and training people who were new to the digital marketing space. For most of them, Anakle was their first job out of school, and now, most of them are running their own successful companies and projects. You know, making money and growing a company are necessary targets, but I\u2019ve always been more excited about mentoring people and helping them grow in the industry and become better versions of themselves even outside of the work they do at Anakle or anywhere else.\n\nIf our business no longer inspired the people who walked through its doors, then we have failed at our mission. So I get really excited when I see consistent growth in the people who walk through our doors; they come in, grow and become more than they thought they could be before they joined the company.\n\nWhat were Anakle\u2019s hiring values in the beginning? And did those values change after the business grew and garnered success?\n\nEditi: We were looking for people who had the \u2018Anakle spirit\u2019, which is a certain level of fearlessness. We wanted people who could work without fear. I didn\u2019t care too much about CVs and cover letters. We were looking for people who could challenge us; people who could look at the universe as it is and ultimately try to bend it. Because when people are able to challenge the status quo and say, \u201cI can take that on\u201d, then they can create a fire campaign for Sterling Bank or any other enterprise client.\n\nEditi Effiong\n\nHow did you delight Anakle\u2019s early employees?\n\nEditi: I\u2019ll be honest: Back then, we couldn\u2019t compete with Nigerian banks and their salary offerings and other benefits. so we ended up designing a workplace that was exciting. We wanted young people to feel excited about working for us and working out of our office. The Anakle office became our recruitment tool and it was so inspiring to hear people say they wanted to work with us, especially after visiting our office.\n\nNew beginnings: Anakle Films and the road to becoming a director, screenwriter, and producer\n\nKoromone: Moving swiftly along from building Anakle to setting up Anakle films\u2014\n\nEditi: Thank God!\n\nWhen did you know you were ready to make the move?\n\nEditi: Money! I had the money to make that leap of faith into Anakle Films.\n\nSo, how did it feel making that transition from running Anakle to leading the charge at Anakle films? Especially knowing that you were going to put a lot of time and effort into building out Anakle Films\u2019 brand?\n\nEditi: I think the biggest factor there is having a team that can do its job\u2014big props to Munachi. If you\u2019ve never heard of Muna, he\u2019s the best COO in the business. He\u2019s quiet but hard-working and has been with me for 11 years. Muna has done an amazing job at running the business at a group level, and having him around has been extremely helpful and instrumental. I recently received and turned down a global leadership position at a global company\u2014a fantastic offer with great pay\u2014but I turned it down because I wanted the freedom to wake up and do what I love doing or to not do something I hate doing. There\u2019s a madness to having that freedom that works for me. And I think I owe a lot of that to Muna. He gave me the courage to step out of Anakle.\n\nAn illustrated photo of Editi directing a film at a location in Nigeria\n\nTell us about your history and relationship with writing\n\nEditi: This isn\u2019t common knowledge, but I didn\u2019t start writing today. I\u2019ve been writing my entire life. I was also an avid reader when I was younger. My father studied literature and linguistics, so there were a lot of books around the house. I write almost every day and have written almost every day for my entire life. And when I cannot put into words things I want to say, I end up writing them down. I have hardly ever gotten in trouble for writing because I\u2019m able to articulate my thoughts without ambiguity. Wow! I just used a big word.\n\nMy move to Anakle Films is my way of preparing for retirement. I want to retire as a writer. My entire life is run by writing and this is the direction it is headed now. Anakle Films is my excuse to write; it gives me a reason to write, create and build something from the ground up. As you can imagine, there\u2019s a lot of craziness and madness around the work, but I love it.\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: Ambiguity is a situation or statement that is unclear because it can be understood in more than one way. [Source: Cambridge dictionary]\n\nEditi on documenting justice for #EndSars victims and survivors and finding his voice again\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: A few months after the #ENDSARS massacre, Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu set up a nine-person Judicial Panel of Inquiry to investigate allegations of police brutality perpetuated by the now-defunct Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) in Lagos State. This part of my conversation with Editi struck a raw nerve for the both of us, especially for Editi who had to restrain his emotions while he answered my questions. I think it takes a lot of courage to document the truth in the midst of pain and grief.\n\nKoromone: Let\u2019s pivot and talk about 2020. How did you find yourself involved in the #EndSARS Judicial Panel of Inquiry that sat in Lagos? A number of people don\u2019t know this, but you were shooting a film during that period.\n\nEditi: Yes, I was. When I couldn\u2019t attend sessions, I was on set. When I was a kid, I used to stutter. And, you know, I managed it through my teenage years until it went away. After October 2020, my stutter returned. I stutter a lot these days, especially when I\u2019m dealing with difficult situations. So if you pay attention when I speak, you will hear how slow and deliberate I am with my words. I speak slowly to avoid stuttering, and everytime I think about what went down during #EndSars, it messes up my speech.\n\nThe night of the shootings, I could hear the gunshots. And I was going to drive out there because our people were bleeding and needed help, but my wife said, \u201cNo, you cannot go. It is too dangerous.\u201d So, I didn\u2019t go, and that night, I couldn\u2019t speak at all. For hours, I could not say a word. Anytime I tried to say a word, something came up from inside me and blocked off my speech. And since then, I\u2019ve been managing a very bad stutter that comes and goes\u2014but mostly only comes when I\u2019m dealing with difficult subjects. And in the days following October 20, I felt nothing but numbness. Going to those panel sessions was kind of a metaphor for trying to find my voice again.\n\nFor a few weeks following the shootings, I couldn\u2019t speak properly, and writing about the sessions was my way of speaking and reconnecting with the voice I had lost.\n\nShare this article\n\nKoromone Koroye | Author",

          "title": "2023: Implications of PDP\u2019s internal crisis ahead national convention",
          "text": "Some chieftains and stakeholders of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) have expressed concern that the internal wrangling besetting the party is capable of working against its determination to take back power from the All Progressives Congress (APC) in 2023.\n\nThey also warn against the party going to the National Convention a divided house.\n\nThe main opposition party has been embroiled in internal leadership crisis, resulting in court cases.\n\nAn Appeal Court would on Thursday hear and rule on motion for interim order of injunction brought by former national chairman of the party, Uche Secondus, against the party and others.\n\nThe outcome of the ruling, observers say, could make or mar the party\u2019s planned national convention.\n\nSpeaking with BusinessDay on the implications of the wrangling and future of the party, Taoffick Gani, PDP publicity secretary, Lagos State, notes: \u201cWhatever way you see it, it portends danger if we don\u2019t put our house in order. If we are not able to reconcile this and there is a Court judgment at the end of the day the ruling party would take advantage and continue. The leaders of the party have to sit down with Secondus and resolve these issues. Looking at the way it is going, it is the party members that would suffer; they should find a way to settle, that is the message from us.\u201d\n\nRead Also: National convention: PDP knows fate on Thursday\n\nAccording to Gani, \u201cIf the national convention is held and the Court comes to abort it, it would affect the future of the party and ability to compete.\u201d\n\nEbenezer Babatope, a former minister of transport and chieftain of the PDP, says: \u201cThere is nobody that loves the PDP that is happy with what is going on now ahead of the national convention; but if you look around the world there would always be disagreement in party politics. It is not in PDP alone, even the ruling party is having its issues.\n\n\u201cBut the PDP has made up its mind to win the 2023 election for Nigerians, because the suffering in the land is too much for Nigerians to bear. Unity is always on the field, we are going to surmount the inner party crisis which is for power struggle, and come out bigger ahead 2023.\u201d\n\nAyo Fadaka, a former zonal publicity secretary of the party in the South West, faults the leadership selection process of the party.\n\n\u201cAs a party man, I am not comfortable with what is happening now. We are fighting against APC that is well oiled. I am not sure there is sincerity with the recruitment process that is going on now to recruit those that will lead the party in the next four years. The party that is in the opposition that is futuristic is now dragging itself into all manner of crises. There is fire on the mountain,\u201d Fadaka says.\n\nThe former zonal publicity secretary also blames some unstable individuals who are always moving from one party to another as part of the problems.\n\n\u201cIn this party, we all have rights and privileges. We should be careful how we run this party. Many of us are thinking about a country that is well run. As a party in opposition, at this point, I don\u2019t think we should revel in pettiness. Today, there are many politicians that are very mobile. Only a few are interested to build a formidable party. If we as party men are serious about our intentions, we need to do everything possible to stabilise our great party,\u201d he says further.\n\nSanni Umar, a former spokesperson, Presidential Campaign Council of the party, notes lack of respect for party constitution and the imposition of candidates in the guise of \u201cconsensus\u201d are dangerous for the future of the PDP.\n\n\u201cOne of the many problems our party has is about not following constitution. There is nowhere in our constitution that talks about consensus, but we are always talking about consensus. The storms are gathering. It will rain, but we must be prepared,\u201d he says.\n\nOn the recent disqualification of three aspirants by the party\u2019s screening committee on the excuse that the individuals took the party to court, Umar notes that such decisions were dangerous for the party.\n\n\u201cNobody had disciplined them or set any committee on that allegation to find out what really happened; to have said they were found guilty and screened out is not the right thing to do. The screening committee should not be the accuser, the judge and executioner at the same time. There should have been a committee report upon which the screening committee would have relied on its decision,\u201d Umar states.\n\nAccording to the party chieftain, \u201cThe three persons that were screened out and accused of taking the party to court were merely challenging the sack of Secondus. They were saying that Secondus should be allowed to complete the convention. They did not do anything wrong. They wanted to whip the party into line to do what is right.\n\n\u201cThe powers that are controlling the party now do not want Secondus to preside over the convention, but his tenure statutorily ends at the end of December this year, and the convention was supposed to come up that same month, but they decided to shift it forward, and it was targeting at something.\u201d\n\nEddy Olafeso, one of the disqualified aspirants and the party\u2019s former national vice chairman (South west), says he had no regret supporting Secondus. Olafeso, who was aspiring to become the PDP national publicity secretary, expresses concern over the future of the party.\n\nKola Ologbondiyan, PDP national publicity secretary, had said that nothing would stop the convention from holding.",

They are keeping to their terms of the contract and I commend them for that,\u201d he says, noting that it is only one or two occasions in a year that he experienced little delay, and that was when the insurance company was doing verification.\n\nOda\u2019s experience was during documentation, when his PFA was reluctant to let him go for annuity, and therefore asked for much unnecessary documents, he notes.\n\n\u201cI had the experience of staying all day in the PFAs office in more than two occasions, like so many other people who came for the same reason of transfer of their funds, and I think that was just a way to frustrate us so that we could change our mind not to move our funds, he states.\n\nOda, who also had the same experience during his wife\u2019s retirement four years after with a different PFA, was not happy with the experience, saying it is a common practice for most PFAs.\n\n\u201cI think we had an advantage of knowing what to do, and also knowing people we could contact to solve our problem. What of those who don\u2019t know so much or anybody they could contact to help them? How can you imagine that elderly men and women above sixties would be asked to go and get a last pay slip, affidavit and so many other things, maybe in Lagos when the PFAs know they retired in Abuja or other places,\u201d Oda says.\n\nAnother retiree, who will not want her name mentioned, retired from the Federal Ministry of Education in 2019, after rising to top position in Federal Government College in the suburb of Lagos.\n\nShe is also happy with the regularity of her monthly pensions since she began receiving it late 2020.\n\n\u201cI receive my pensions every 16th of the month, even though I had signed with my insurance company for every 22nd.\u201d\n\nHer concern, beyond the documentation process of moving her funds from her PFA to an insurance company for annuity, is the amount she receives monthly. \u201cWhat I received monthly is ridiculous, when you compare my earnings with my retired colleagues who left service at the same level as me before the CPS commenced, they earn better,\u201d she says.\n\nShe however calls on the government to remember retiree annuitants when it starts to implement the planned Minimum Pension Guarantee as provided for in the Pension Reform Act 2014.\n\nThe main objective of the CPS is to ensure that every person that worked in either the Public or Private Sectors in Nigeria including the self-employed persons receives his/her retirement benefits as and when due.",

          "text": "8 questions about e-Naira you are too embarrassed to ask\n\nAfter weeks of anticipation and postponement, Nigeria\u2019s President Muhammadu Buhari finally launched the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). The launch officially kicks off an era of digital transactions with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) housing the national currency online.\n\nThe launch also means Nigeria is the first country in Africa to launch a CBDC. Other countries on the continent are still playing catch-up in the CBDC game. South Africa recently launched a trial of CBDCs for cross-border payments, while the central bank of Ghana is looking to make its digital currency, the e-Cedi, available to offline users soon.\n\nThe eNaira is no doubt one of the most topical issues in 2021 giving that it comes from a government that has taken a hard stance against the cryptocurrency market going as far as restricting banks and other financial services providers from providing support for the market. The eNaira has many people asking questions and we hear there is some unease in the banking industry on whether the digital currency would affect their operations and profit margins.\n\nHere are answers to eight questions you may be too embarrassed to ask.\n\nIs the eNaira a cryptocurrency?\n\nNo. the eNaira is merely a digital version of the naira currency. In other words, it is equivalent to the physical naira which is the official tender of Nigeria and liability of the CBN. The eNaira will always be exchanged 1:1, meaning it would only appreciate when the naira is stronger. It goes weak when the naira is weak. Cryptocurrencies are decentralised, that is, not under the control of a central authority hence their prices are often subject to volatility.\n\nThe only similarity the eNaira bears to a cryptocurrency is that it is built on the blockchain hence it has to be minted. The blockchain was developed by Bitt Inc.\n\nWho needs eNaira?\n\nEveryone that transacts or makes payments to any business or individual within the country needs eNaira. It is available on the eNaira wallet which anyone with a smartphone can download on the Play Store or iOS platforms.\n\nWhy does the CBN need digital currency?\n\nDigital banking is growing in terms of adoption and in form. The notion of freedom that cryptocurrencies introduced \u2013 not under the control of central banks and banks \u2013 has become appealing to many hence the growing adoption around the world. Nigeria is currently the largest country in Africa in terms of peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transactions. In other words, it has the largest number of people embracing the crypto world\u2019s notion of financial freedom.\n\nRead also: eNaira gains traction as 33 banks fully integrate on platform\n\nThe concept of CBDCs, therefore, has become a necessity for central banks seeking not to lose control of the financial system. Central banks exist to safeguard monetary and financial stability for the public good. CBDCs are a tool to pursue this through enhancing safety and neutrality in digital payments, financial inclusion and access, innovation, and openness.\n\nWho controls the eNaira?\n\nA guideline on eNaira issued by the CBN noted that the apex bank will be the authorised issuer of the digital currency, as well as the sole distributor. The CBN also has the power to redeem and destroy the eNaira.\n\nInstitutions licenced by the CBN under the Financial Institution Suite of the guideline are only allowed to request for the eNaira or stablecoins and manage it across their branches \u2013 similar to the naira implementation.\n\nA bank or any authorised financial institution will maintain one treasury eNaira wallet where they store the digital currency they received from the CBN. They are also allowed to create sub-treasury wallets for branches tied to it and fund them from its single eNaira treasury wallet with the CBN.\n\nHow many eNaira has been minted?\n\nGodwin Emefiele, the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria said at the launch that some 500 million eNaira ($1.21 million) have already been minted.\n\nWhat is in it for you?\n\nThe eNaira means less cost managing the naira and possibly charges. For example, you have N1 million to send to a friend, you go to the bank, change the eNaira and send at no fees.\n\nMany experts say it will facilitate the ease of doing business in Nigeria, enhance the means of payment for transactions carried out both locally and internationally.\n\nHow does it profit the economy?\n\nDuring his presentation at the launch, President Muhammadu Buhari said the eNaira is expected to boost the country\u2019s GDP, by $29 billion in the next ten years. The premise is on the potential of CBDCS to increase remittances, foster cross-border trade, improve financial inclusion, make Monetary Policy more effective, and enable the government to send direct payments to citizens eligible for specific welfare of Nigerians.\n\nWill the eNaira compete with existing digital banking wallets?\n\nAccording to Kalu Aja, a personal finance expert, competition is not likely given that the eNaira will be used by operators in the financial services industry including fintech.\n\nHowever, Samora Kariuki, founder of Frontier Fintech Newsletter said the eNaira will only be useful for its programmability and accessibility. The CBN has to enable fintechs and other players to innovate on top of the eNaira system through open APIs.\n\n\u201cPlayers can emerge in this space with organisational structures and practices custom-built for eNaira based merchant lending,\u201d Kariuki noted.",

Ayo Akinyelure said that casualisation of Nigerian graduates in the labour market has become a subject of great concern as more workers continue to groan under the immoral strategy of cutting cost by employers.\n\nThis, he said, was making the workers to look inferior to their counterparts in other countries of the world.\n\nAkinyelure also listed the objectives of the bill to include protecting vulnerable workers against unfair labour practices by way of casualisation, imposing a legal duty on employers of labour, both in private and public sector establishments, to convert casual employment to permanent status, among others.\n\nIn his remarks, Chairman of the Committee, Sen. Godiya Akwashiki said all the stakeholders would be given more time to review the bill, adding that the committee would invite them to another public hearing for further legislative action on the bill.\n\n...",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has attributed growing social unrest to inequalities and unfair policies that exclude majority from opportunities for participation, admonishing world leaders and global investors to prioritise inclusive and humane policies.\n\nSpeaking Tuesday at the 5th Edition of Future Investment Initiative Summit holding in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, the president said his administration would \u201c keep encouraging public and private initiatives that increase investments in health, education, capacity building, youth empowerment, gender equality, poverty eradication, climate change and food security.\n\n\u201cBy so doing, it will go a long way in reenergizing the global economy in a post COVID-19 era.\n\n\u201cNigeria is Africa\u2019s largest economy and most populous nation. Our economic reforms which focus on \u201chumane\u201d investments are ideal for investors looking to have profitable returns while positively impacting the citizenry.\n\n\u201cYour Excellences, Distinguished ladies and gentlemen, Investing in Humanity is the right thing to do. I strongly believe the historical under investments in \u201chumane projects\u201d is the genesis of most of the insecurity and socio-economic challenges the world is experiencing today,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the theme of the summit, \u201cInvesting in Humanity,\u201d President Buhari said the Nigerian perspective remains a focus on people oriented development policies, with diversification from oil to more inclusive sectors such as agriculture, ICT and mining; tackling corruption, insecurity and climate change and introducing Social Investment Programmes.\n\n\u201cInvesting in humanity is investing in our collective survival. This is why we in Nigeria believe that public and private partnership should focus on increasing investments in health, education, capacity building, youth empowerment, gender equality, poverty eradication, climate change and food security. By so doing, it will go a long way in reenergizing the global economy in a post COVID-19 era.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s population today exceeds 200 million people. Some 70 percent are under 35 years old. When we came into government in 2015, we were quick to realise that long-term peace and stability of our country is dependent on having inclusive and humane policies.\n\n\u201cIn the past six years, our government took very painful but necessary decisions to invest for a long-term prosperous future knowing very well that this will come with short term pains,\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari commended the organisers of this year\u2019s summit for the foresight to look at \u201cinvestment,\u201d not only from a profitability and wealth accumulation point of view, but also bringing prosperity to humanity in general.\n\n\u201cThe humane approach to investment,\u201d he said, \u201cis the only way to address the global challenges we face, especially in the Covid-19 era.\n\n\u201cWe should continue to sustain our efforts to combat the Covid-19 pandemic and mitigate its negative socio-economic impact on our societies, build resilience and achieve recovery. It is therefore my hope that this session will leverage on the enormous economic opportunities that lie ahead in order to satisfy the prevailing needs of our people and planet,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president said investment in humanity must also take into consideration the effects of debt burden on nations, which had been worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe cannot invest in humanity without relieving our countries from the crushing effects of the debt burden especially when the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risk of deepening the debt portfolio of poor countries.\n\n\u201cThese nations increasingly allocate more and more resources towards external debt servicing and repayment at the expense of the health, education and other services that contribute to the overall wellbeing of their population,\u201d he said.\n\nDescribing the summit as a credible forum for interaction between the public and private sectors to explore ways of advancing economic growth, development and global prosperity, the president said Nigeria\u2019s diversification efforts continue to yield results, particularly in agriculture.\n\n\u201cWe introduced policies that supported investments in agriculture and food processing. We provided loans and technical support to small holder farmers, through the Anchor Borrowers Programme. As a result, Nigeria today has over 40 rice mills from less than 10 in 2014. Nigeria also has over 46 active fertiliser blending plants from less than 5 in 2014.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, in agriculture, we have reformed the process of obtaining inputs such as fertilizer and seeds. We have several million hectares of available arable land and have embarked on the creation of Special Agriculture Processing Zones across the country. These initiatives we believe will make it easier for investors in agriculture,\u201d he added.\n\nPresident Buhari told the gathering of world leaders, global investors and asset managers that the oil sector was already undergoing a reform that would make it more attractive and inclusive.\n\n\u201cTwo months ago, I signed the Petroleum Industry Act. The Act will serve as a catalyst to liberalize our petroleum sector. It has introduced a number of incentives such as tax holidays, 100 percent ownership, zero interest loans and easy transfer of funds. In addition, we have highly skilled in-country workforce and a large domestic market.\n\n\u201cIn mining, we have also made several opportunities available for investors. Nigeria is a country rich in minerals from gold, iron ore, tin, zinc, cobalt, lithium, limestone, phosphate, bitumen and many others. We have made the licensing process easier and also made extensive investments in rail and transportation.\n\n\u201cInfrastructure investments represent significant potential for investors in Nigeria. We have opportunities in seaports, rail, toll roads, real estate, renewable energy and many others. We have created several institutions that are available to co-invest with you in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe have the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority and more recently, I approved the creation of Infrastructure Corporation of Nigeria. These institutions are run as independent world class institutions to make investments in the country and are available to coinvest with you,\u201d the Nigerian leader further said.\n\nHe further urged more interest in infrastructure such as healthcare and education, which \u201cpresent enormous opportunities for investors in a country our size.\u201d\n\n\u201cDigital Economy in Nigeria has many potentials for investment, as it has remained the fastest growing sector in both 2020 and 2021. Nigeria has many opportunities for investment in broadband, ICT hardware, emerging technology and software engineering.\n\n\u201cWe have recently approved the national policy on Fifth Generation (5G) network. Our aim is to attract investors in healthcare, smart cities, smart agriculture among others. The benefit of real time communication will support all other sectors of the economy,\u201d Buhari said.\n\nTo further improve and reposition the economy to attract investors, the president said \u201ce-Naira, the electronic version of our national currency, which puts us on track to become the first African country to introduce a Central Bank Digital Currency\u201d was launched on October 25th, 2021.\n\n\u201cWe believe this and many other reforms will help us increase the number of people participating in the banking sector, make for a more efficient financial sector and help us tackle illicit flow of funds.\n\n\u201cTo further strengthen our anti-corruption drive, increase accountability and transparency, we have centralized government funds through a Treasury Single Account, and ensuring that all Nigerians with a bank account use a unique Bank Verification Number (BVN). These initiatives, coupled with our nationwide National Identification Number (NIN) exercise, reinforce our efforts to tackle corruption and fraud. We believe that this should give investors a lot of comfort.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian leader also drew attention of world leaders to the devastating effect of climate change on livelihoods of people around the Lake Chad.\n\n\u201cAs we strive to build resilience towards a sustainable economy in our various countries, let us not forget the negative impact of climate change on our efforts to achieve this goal. Nigeria and many countries in Africa are already facing the challenges posed by climate change. Climate change has triggered conflicts, food insecurity, irregular youth migration, raising level of sea waters, drought and desertification, as well as the drying-up of the Lake Chad.\n\n\u201cIn the Lake Chad Basin region, where Boko Haram insurgency continues to undermine the peace, security and development of the region, climate change is largely responsible for the drying up of the Lake Chad which has shrunk by more than 85 percent its original size.\n\n\u201cThe diminishing size of the Lake is at the root of the loss of millions of livelihoods, displacement of inhabitants and radicalization of teeming youths in the region who are recruited to serve as foot soldiers in the insurgency.\n\n\u201cIn order to redress this situation and restore the lost fortunes of the Lake Chad Basin region, strong public-private partnership through massive investments will be needed to recharge the waters of Lake Chad. I am confident that this forum will rise to the challenge in the interest of durable peace and sustainable development of our region,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Buhari conveyed heartfelt gratitude and appreciation to the custodian of the two Holy Mosques, King Salman Bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud for the invitation and congratulated His Royal Highness, Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman for leadership and support through the Future Investment Initiative Summit.\n\n\u201cI remain confident that through such exchanges, the world indeed will be a better place. I hope and pray that this forum will rise to the challenge in the interest of durable peace and sustainable development,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "Sheikh Gumi to Yoruba, Igbo clerics: Talk to IPOB, Igboho as I talk to bandits",
          "text": "Kaduna-based popular Muslim cleric, Sheikh Abubakar Gumi has asked clerics of Igbo and Yoruba extractions to broker truce with members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and Yoruba Nation activist, Sunday Adeyemo, also known as Sunday Igboho, as he did with bandits terrorising the North-West and parts of the North-Central.\n\nThe controversial cleric, had at different times mediated between the bandits and some state governments, a development condemned in some quarters.\n\nThe mission took him to Kaduna, Niger, Katsina, Sokoto and Zamfara where he attempted to broker peace between the governors and the outlaws.\n\nHowever, he could not arrange such peace deal between Kaduna state government and the bandits as the government warned anybody against doing such on its behalf.\n\nThe cleric, who had some time called for amnesty for the bandits, was also reported to have said bandits cannot be declared terrorists.\n\nAnd in a statement Monday posted on his Facebook and obtained by Blueprint in Abuja, the controversial cleric said: \u201cNE is already and is still devastated by this madness for over 12 years. If we allow, terror, to set into these raw na\u00efve unexposed bandits, NW will be in ruins sooner than later. Already IPOB is destroying SE, and Igboho has set the ball of confusion rolling in SW. For those who want to destroy the NW, it\u2019s a good recipe. Turn bandits into religious zealots. Tell me, what then remains of Nigeria?\n\n\u201cI have started to get these raw bandits out of their misadventure, but unfortunately, I have few helpers and a mountain of antagonists. The psychology in fighting natives is to induce a motive for their struggle if they don\u2019t have one already, a motive that is manageable, and it is so managed. Unfortunately, reactions to threat in our nation are always slow and incoherent.\n\n\u201cI hope another Igbo clergy goes into the IPOB militants likewise and talk sense into them, and another Pastor of Oduduwa land talks against the Igboho secessionist tribal movement by way of sensitising people to the values of a cohesive nationalism that will guaranty freedom, equality, and justice for all. Religious forces can permeate hardened hearts where secular forces cannot.\n\n\u201cRegrettably, people just sit down in the comfort of their rooms or parlours and make useless passing comments that only add fuel to the inferno of ethnic jingoism and bigotry. In the 21st century, Nigeria is hijacked by semi-illiterates and half-baked tribal heroes that have nothing to offer besides promoting tribal xenophobia.\n\n\u201cNigeria has over 250 ethnic groupings, it is not possible to divide such a nation into tribal enclaves. Nigeria is multi-religious, even with one same religion or sect there is no harmony and understanding that can build a prosperous unified nation where tranquility and development will flourish. We are tired of these bogus destructive fruitless slogans!\u201d\n\nLabeling bandits terrorists\n\nOn the calls by Governors Nasir El-rufai and Aminu Bello Masari that the bandits be declared terrorists, Guma said such a move would have some dire consequences.\n\nThe ex-soldier cum medical doctor made the position known on his Facebook.\n\nHe said: \u201cDeclaring Bandits as Terrorists: will come with a prize! Nobody doubts that sentimentalism today overrides sensibility in our polity. For the sake of posterity, some people will have to speak out.\n\n\u201cThe acts the bandits are committing now in NW have gradually over time become tantamount to terrorism because wherever innocent people are fatal victims it is pure terrorism. Yet, innocence these days is relative. We agreed if their children and women are also killed, they are guilty by association or collateral damage, so also the bandits may think the same way. It\u2019s right for vigilantes to lynch Fulanis herdsmen or anyone that looks like them by profiling but wrong for the herdsmen to ransack villages in retribution. They are pushed to believe it is an existential war and in war, ethics are thrown to the winds.\n\n\u201cYet again, the only helpful part that is against bandits is that no other than them are attracted to join them in the NW because of its ethnic tinge and coloration. However, the moment they are termed Terrorist \u2013 Islamic for that matter, the direct foreign Jihadist movements will set in in force. And many teaming unemployed youth may find it palatable and attractive. Shouting \u2018Allahu Akbar\u2019 plus AK47 against a \u2018secular\u2019 immoral society, where impunity reigns are the magnet for extremists and downtrodden \u2013 the majority of our youth.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlready these deadly terrorist groups are fighting for the soul of these bandits. This will give criminality a spiritual cover and remove the stigma of discrediting them with such crimes since now they are fighting a \u2018Jihad\u2019 as they will claim. In such a situation, does the larger society -as it is- has the moral high ground to fight back? This is the most probable consequence, the price of which is not worth it. Nothing stops the kinetic actions from going on without the controversy of semantics,\u201d the cleric further added.\n\nOmokri slams Gumi\n\nReacting to the call, Reno Omkri, a former media aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, has condemned Gumi, asking him to stop doing \u2018PR\u2019 for the bandits.\n\nIn a Twitter post Monday, Omokri hit the federal government for going after bandits, while turning a blind eye to \u2018an inspiration to terrorists.\u2019\n\n\u201cSheikh Gumi never speaks for the victims. But when terrorists bandits are affected, he speaks. How long shall a government that is after Igboho and Kanu continue tolerating the PR work Gumi is doing for terrorists bandits? Gumi is an inspiration to these terrorists,\u201d Omokri wrote.\n\nAkeredolu\n\nIn a related development, Ondo state Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu (SAN) has warned that the various criminal activities of kidnapping, bombing and assault on the people in some parts of the country being referred to as banditry must be appropriately addressed as terrorism.\n\nGovernor Akeredolu said infiltration of the country\u2019s borders and burning down of railway were activities that must be addressed as terrorism and the perpetrators treated as same.\n\nThe governor spoke Monday in Abuja at the 27th Nigerian Economic Summit with the theme: \u201cSecuring Our Future: The Fierce Urgency of Now.\u201d\n\nAkeredolu and his Kaduna state counterpart, Mallam El-rufai and others were among the panelists at the summit which centered on addressing the security challenges in the country.\n\nIn his introductory remarks, Akeredolu contended that a nation with failed security and justice systems was set to fail.\n\nWhile lamenting that the dimension of insecurity in the country recently was surprising, the governor said he had always believed in multi-level policing as the best way of securing the nation.\n\n\u201cIn Ondo State, we don\u2019t have terrorism. Our problem is farmer/herder clashes and kidnap for ransom. We have drug abuse and agitation for self-determination. We have always preached the multi-level policing in Ondo state. We believe in layers of security,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor, who explained that although there were criminal trespasses which can be treated by the state, stressed that before the Amotekun corps was established, the Police were not always ready to make arrest.\n\n\u201cYes, you have criminal trespass. It should be treated by the state. All we had before Amotekun was a police that had the duty to arrest and was not prepared to make an arrest. Things are changing and have really changed in Ondo state.\n\n\u201cToday, if you trespass on other people\u2019s land, the Amotekun will go after you and arrest you. They pay compensations to the farmers and when they fail they are in court. It is the only way you can send signals to the people.\n\n\u201cWhen you commit a crime and the hands of law doesn\u2019t catch up with you, another person will repeat it. I can assure you that when you do not have an effective policing system, there is little or nothing a governor can do. And the criminal trial is taking too long,\u201d the governor further said.\n\nSpeaking on the recent ban on open grazing, Governor Akeredolu said the culture of nomadic pastoralist must be discouraged in the interest of those involved.\n\nHe noted that the issue of grazing routes was not a welcome conversation, adding that those were issues of the past that must not be brought back to the fore.\n\n\u201dSpeaking for those of us who have put in place anti-open grazing law. We have our reasons and we have no apologies. Grazing routes? Grazing routes to where? It is not going to work. There are things we had in the past. Don\u2019t let us imagine it now. Time changes. Grazing with AK 47 is an assault. Ban on open grazing, we are doing it effectively in Ondo state.\n\n\u201cNomadic pastoralist is not a new thing. There were nomadic farmers all over the world. I know of people, high ranking who have ranches today. They can showcase their cows.\n\n\u201cWhy are we pushing these people out? It is a culture that must be discouraged in the interest of those who are involved. Even with the president\u2019s order that anyone with AK-47 should be arrested, how many have been arrested?\u201d the governor said.",

          "text": "The National Agency for Food Drug and Administration NAFDAC has informed that 27 water companies has been shut down between January and August 2021 due to their non-compliance with the safety guidelines.\n\nDirector General of the agency, Prof Mojisola Adeyeye ably represented by the Director of public information and public affairs,Dr. Jimoh Abubakar made this known yesterday at the National conference of the Association for Table Water Producers (ATWAP) in Abuja, with the theme\u201dDeveloping a packaged water industry as a catalyst to economic growth and a greener environment in Nigeria\u201d.\n\nHe said that NAFDAC was partnering with ATWAP as one of her regulatory agency to ensure that producers of table water and pure water adhere strictly to the safety measures of maintaining a healthy and production for all hence water is a consumable that no human can live without.\n\nHe said that NAFDAC cannot do the work alone as such ,shows solidarity with ATWAP to reinforce the need for compliance directives in the production of table and satche water even though regulations are ongoing processes , emphasis must continue to be made knowing that water is life and the health of everyone is also dependent on the type of water they drink hence there is need to preach on improved productions.\n\nAlso speaking at the event, National President of ATWAP, Clementina Chinwe Ativie, passionately called on government to intervene on the over lapping functions of all supervising agencies for producers of water as they have become over bearing with their demands for bribe,also while other producers hide for fear of not to be check mated but for only NAFDAC who has not rested in her oars to regulate their activities. However they have decided to look inwards by checkmating themselves, observing self monitoring and regulations in other to flush out quacks and illegal producers in the industry, she added.\n\nShe explained that the reason behind the sudden increase in the price of both water and pure in the country is as a result of the increase in the prices of production materials in the market which has skyrocket everywhere leaving them with no choice but to increase the price so as to meet up with cost of production.\n\nShe emphasized that ATWAP is the only recognized and structured body for table water producers hence government must continue to use the body to clap down on those companies who are not doing the right thing so that the lives of the citizenry will not be jeopardized.\n\nShe informed that ATWAP members are well over sixteen thousand producers nationwide and they have in a way contributes to employment in the country hence there should be tax waiver and other forms of encouragement that will allow them continue serving Nigerians better.\n\nShe further commended NAFDAC under the leadership of Prof Mojisola Adeyeye in her efforts to not to leave any stone unturn in making sure that Nigerians are given wholesome water.",

Then all of a sudden, what happened? I will say also that part of it is the role of political actors,\u201d he said.\n\nREAD ALSO: FG Cannot Start Paris Club Deduction Now, Says Fayemi\n\n\u201cYou see people bringing issues like ethnicity, religion-dominated issues, and so we were now beginning to see ourselves as enemies.\n\n\u201cIf I am a Christian, I don\u2019t want a Moslem to come near me or I belong to this tribe, I don\u2019t want that tribe to come in.\u201d\n\nThe governor also faulted successive administrations in the state for capitalising on the situation, rather than finding means to bridge the gap.\n\nLalong believes the issue resulted in the killings of several people in the state, noting that the situation made the state government make some recommendations to President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nHe lamented that as part of some measures in tackling religious and ethnic violence, some state governors would use resources at their disposal to acquire some technological equipment, which may end up not being used.\n\nMeanwhile, the Chairman of the Nigerian Governors Forum and Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi, who also spoke at the event said Federal Government cannot commence its plans to make deductions from the federation account for payment of consultants for the Paris Club Refund.\n\nAccording to him, a situation where the Federal Government makes arbitrary deductions without the input of state governors is wrong.\n\nHe said state governors have agreed not to collect any allocation from the Federation Allocation Account (FAAC) until the issues are resolved.\n\n\u201cWe are dealing with the issue. we would find a resolution to it. As far as states are concerned, they do not accept that funds belonging to federation account could just be arbitrarily deducted without the input of the states, and that\u2019s why we are insisting that until this is clarified, we would rather leave the money in the pool until we have all agreed on the direction,\u201d Governor Fayemi said.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has explained how his administration took painful decisions to invest for a prosperous future of all Nigerians.\n\nSpeaking on Tuesday in Saudi Arabia at an investment conference organised by the Future Investment Initiative Institute, the Nigerian leader said upon assuming office in 2015, his government understood the importance on inclusive policies for sustainable peace.\n\n\u201cIn the past six years, our government took very painful but necessary decisions to invest for a long-term prosperous future knowing very well that this will come with short term pains,\u201d the President was quoted as saying via a statement issued by his media aide, Garba Shehu.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s population today exceeds 200 million people. Some 70 percent are under 35 years old. When we came into government in 2015, we were quick to realise that long-term peace and stability of our country is dependent on having inclusive and humane policies.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Appeal Court Strikes Out Suit Challenging Secondus\u2019 Suspension From PDP\n\nHe said the Federal Government will keep encouraging public and private initiatives that increase investments in health, education, capacity building, youth empowerment, gender equality, poverty eradication, climate change and food security.\n\nThis, according to him, will go a long way in reenergizing the global economy in a post COVID-19 era.\n\nBuhari attributed the growing social unrest to inequalities and unfair policies that exclude majority from opportunities for participation, admonishing world leaders and global investors to prioritize on inclusive and humane policies.\n\nReacting to the theme of the summit, \u2018Investing in Humanity\u2019, President Buhari said the Nigerian perspective remains a focus on people oriented development policies, with diversification from oil to more inclusive sectors such as agriculture, ICT and mining; tackling corruption, insecurity and climate change and introducing Social Investment Programmes.\n\nBuhari commended the organizers of this year\u2019s summit for the foresight to look at \u201cinvestment\u201d, not only from a profitability and wealth accumulation point of view, but also bringing prosperity to humanity in general.\n\nThe humane approach to investment, he said, is the only way to address the global challenges we face, especially in the Covid-19 era.\n\nThe President noted that investment in humanity must also take into consideration the effects of debt burden on nations, which had been worsened by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nHe added, \u201cWe cannot invest in humanity without relieving our countries from the crushing effects of the debt burden especially when the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risk of deepening the debt portfolio of poor countries.\n\n\u201cThese nations increasingly allocate more and more resources towards external debt servicing and repayment at the expense of the health, education and other services that contribute to the overall wellbeing of their population.\u201d\n\nDescribing the summit as a credible forum for interaction between the public and private sectors, to explore ways of advancing economic growth, development and global prosperity, the President said Nigeria\u2019s diversification efforts continue to yield results, particularly in agriculture.\n\nPresident Buhari told the gathering of world leaders, global investors and asset managers that the oil sector was already undergoing a reform that would make it more attractive and inclusive.\n\n\u201cTwo months ago, I signed the Petroleum Industry Act. The Act will serve as a catalyst to liberalize our petroleum sector.

          "title": "Potential Legal Woes Mount after \u2018Rust\u2019 Shooting Tragedy",
          "text": "Alec Baldwin the actor, who pulled the trigger on a prop gun while filming \u201cRust\u201d in New Mexico and unwittingly killed a cinematographer and injured a director, likely won\u2019t be held criminally or civilly liable for the tragedy.\n\nBut Alec Baldwin the producer might be, along with several others in leadership positions for the Western.\n\nExperts predict a tremendous legal fallout from the tragedy, definitely in civil lawsuits and potentially in criminal charges. In addition to Baldwin, a call sheet for the day of the shooting obtained by The Associated Press lists five producers, four executive producers, a line producer and a co-producer. They, as well as assistant director Dave Halls and armorer Hannah Gutierrez, could all face some sort of liability even if they weren\u2019t on location Thursday.\n\nThe payouts \u2014 which could be covered in part by insurance held by the production company, Rust Movie Productions \u2014 would likely be in the \u201cmillions and millions\u201d of dollars.\n\n\u201cThere was clearly negligence on the set,\u201d said Adam Winkler, a professor at the UCLA School of Law and a gun policy expert. \u201cThe producers had a duty to preserve the safety of the crew. There were obvious hazards on the set.\u201d\n\nAuthorities said Friday that Halls, the assistant director, had handed the weapon to Baldwin and announced \u201ccold gun,\u201d indicating it was safe to use. But it was loaded with live rounds. Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was fatally shot and director Joel Souza, who was standing behind her, was wounded.\n\nBaldwin, who is known for his roles in \u201c30 Rock\u201d and \u201cThe Hunt for Red October\u201d and his impression of former President Donald Trump on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d has described the killing as a \u201ctragic accident.\u201d\n\nThe production of \u201cRust\u201d has been beset by disputes from the start in early October and included seven crew members walking off the set just hours before the shooting. The Los Angeles Times, citing two crew members it did not name, reported that five days before the shooting, Baldwin\u2019s stunt double accidentally fired two live rounds after being told the gun didn\u2019t have any ammunition.\n\nAlarmed by the misfires, a crew member told a unit production manager in a text message, \u201cWe\u2019ve now had 3 accidental discharges. This is super unsafe,\u201d according to a copy of the message reviewed by the newspaper.\n\nWinkler called the previous misfires \u2014 and an apparent lack of any action taken after them \u2014 \u201ca recipe for a very significant liability in damages.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have a dangerous situation, know about it and then do nothing,\u201d he said.\n\nRust Movie Productions, the production company, says it is cooperating with Santa Fe authorities in their investigation.\n\n\u201cThough we were not made aware of any official complaints concerning weapon or prop safety on set, we will be conducting an internal review of our procedures while production is shut down,\u201d Rust Movie Productions said in a statement to The Los Angeles Times.\n\nAlthough New Mexico law defines involuntary manslaughter in part as a lawful act that resulted in death from \u201can unlawful manner or without due caution and circumspection,\u201d defense attorney Nina Marino said she doubts any criminal case would be filed.\n\n\u201cIf a local agency in New Mexico was going to go forward with criminal charges, that would have a real chilling effect on further filming taking place in New Mexico and I think New Mexico appreciates the business,\u201d said Marino, who specializes in white collar cases as a co-founder of the Kaplan Marino law firm.\n\nAny film requires insurance coverage and any policy for a Western would hit upon the use of horses, other animals and firearms. The call sheet for Thursday alone mentions multiple guns, several horses and a daily snake wrangler.\n\nAn insurer would likely cover any accidental events but the company might not pay for negligence claims on a movie set, according to Julie Shapiro, law professor and director of Loyola Law School\u2019s Entertainment and Media Law Institute.\n\nThe insurance company will do its own investigation, Shapiro said, to determine if negligence occurred. The exact wording of the policy will determine what the company would pay.\n\nWhile Baldwin, the other producers, the assistant director and the armorer might be named as parties in a civil lawsuit, not all may be found to be liable \u2014 particularly if they played no role in the safety aspects of the production or only held a vanity credit. The plaintiffs would likely go after the production company\u2019s deeper pockets.\n\n\u201cHow much? To what extent will insurance cover it? This is a loss of life \u2014 there is no dollar amount you can place,\u201d Shapiro said.\n\nOn-set fatalities have led to safety reforms in the past, but Jeff Harris \u2014 founding partner at Harris Lowry Manton LLP and the lead attorney in two high-profile trials involving accidental deaths on television and film sets, including stuntman John Bernecker on \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d and camera assistant Sarah Jones on \u201cMidnight Rider\u201d \u2014 said incidents like these are rare if the cast and crew follow regulations that are standard for the use of firearms in the film industry.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not complicated,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been around for years. And it struck me \u2014 you don\u2019t have this happen if basic safety policies are being followed. The end.\u201d",

          "title": "Paradigm Initiative Launches Short Film FOCUS",
          "text": "Against the backdrop of concerns on the outright ban and state-sponsored surveillance of digital platforms and telecommunications service providers in Africa, Paradigm Initiative\u2019s short film FOCUS tells a story of civil rights, liberty and justice in the digital ecosystem.\n\nDirected by Award-winning Nigerian poet Tolu Ajayi, FOCUS spotlights the fundamental challenges of digital rights in Africa and urges the government and stakeholders to initiate, and enforce laws that support every citizen\u2019s digital rights and internet freedoms in Africa.\n\nSpeaking on the need for digital rights, the Director of the short film, Tolu Ajayi stated,\n\n\u201cThis is a story of the Judas\u2019 kiss and the smeared lips. It is a short narrative of digital foul play; an utmost betrayal of popular trust and constitutional rights to protect basic human interests online. We took a cue from the series of state-ordered activities that have hindered social and political will, justice and expression offline and online. It is a tale of mass struggle flying in the face of digital oppression.\u201d\n\nThis is coming on the heels of various agitations by civil societies, and events fueled by non-existent laws that have pronounced the urgent need for the promulgation of legislative frameworks that guarantee the digital right, data protection and privacy of individuals and corporate citizens.\n\nBased on true events as curated from people\u2019s experiences, the movie documents the series of youth-led civil agitations, protests for absolute online freedom and violation of rights such as; enacting repressive laws, Police brutality, illegal arrest and killings of bloggers and citizens, Internet disruptions, and illegal surveillance.\n\nCommenting on the purpose of the short film, the Communications Officer, Paradigm Initiative, Valery Njiaba, said,\n\n\u201cWhat we are doing with FOCUS is simple. We are using storytelling to engage our African communities on complex social issues, in a way that instils a sense of urgency and help everyone make sense of the different complexities that constitute the issues we are tackling.\n\n\u201cBeyond historical data and evidence-based statistics, we frame them into a story perspective, spotlighting the current realities and what various stakeholders\u2014the state and the citizens should do for a progressive state.\u201d\n\nFOCUS advocates for respect for digital rights, and legal frameworks that promote individuals\u2019 online privacy and data protection. It clamps down on the threat posed by a full-on surveillance state and calls for legislation that forbids data intrusion.\n\nFOCUS is a co-production of Paradigm Initiative and Up In The Sky Films with backing from The Kingdom of Netherlands, United States Department of States and Open Society Initiative for West Africa.\n\nParadigm Initiative is a Nigeria-based pan-African social enterprise. Since its establishment in 2017, Paradigm Initiative has been working to advance digital rights and inclusion in Africa and empower youths with life-changing digital, life and business skills.",

          "text": "Current commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions put the planet on track for a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d average 2.7-degree Celsius temperature rise this century, the United Nations said on Tuesday, another stark warning ahead of crunch climate talks.\n\nJust days before the crucial Scotland climate summit, the UN\u2019s Environment Programme (UNEP) said national plans to reduce carbon pollution amounted to \u201cweak promises, not yet delivered\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe G20 countries are responsible for 78 percent of all emissions so the \u2018to do item\u2019 lies with them,\u201d Inger Andersen, executive director of the UNEP, told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cThe developed countries have a special responsibility to really step up, but actually everyone does \u2013 all 193 member states.\u201d\n\nAndersen said much of the pledged action by countries is delayed until 2030, which scientists warn will be far too late to halt the worst ravages of climate change on the planet. \u201cAction is needed now,\u201d she warned.\n\nGovernments will be in the spotlight at the COP26 conference next week to meet a deadline of this year to commit to more ambitious greenhouse gas cut promises, in what could be the last chance to put the world on track to limit warming to 1.5C (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels.\n\nThis would help prevent the worst-imagined catastrophic changes threatening the planet, scientists say. As extreme weather events such as superstorms, wildfires and floods increasingly hit countries around the world, even the slightest increase in global temperatures will worsen the situation.\n\nThe UN World Meteorological Organization said ahead of the two-week event, which begins in Glasgow on Sunday, that greenhouse gas concentrations hit a record last year and the world is \u201cway off track\u201d in capping rising temperatures.\n\nIf all pledges by 192 countries under the Paris Agreement are taken together, an increase of about 16 percent in global emissions is expected by 2030 compared with 2010, which would lead to warming of 2.7C by the end of the century \u2013 a figure where life on Earth would be devastating for millions of people.\n\nUN chief Antonio Guterres said Tuesday\u2019s report showed the world was \u201cstill on track for climate catastrophe\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis report is another thundering wake-up call. How many do we need? The emissions gap is the result of a leadership gap,\u201d Guterres told a press briefing. \u201cThe era of half measures and hollow promises must end. The time for closing the leadership gap must begin in Glasgow.\u201d\n\nUNEP said most recent commitments would shave 7.5 percent off previously predicted 2030 emissions levels. To keep on a 1.5C trajectory, a 55-percent reduction is needed.\n\nThe report said plans of many of the 49 countries that have made \u201cnet-zero\u201d pledges remained \u201cvague\u201d and were not reflected in their formal commitments.\n\n\u201cWe have eight years to make the plans, put in place the policies, implement them and ultimately deliver the cuts,\u201d Andersen said. \u201cThe clock is ticking loudly.\u201d\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in August said Earth could hit the 1.5C threshold as soon as 2030 and be consistently above it by mid-century.\n\nThe report said even if all net-zero pledges were delivered in full, there was a 60-percent chance that temperature rises would hit 2.7C by 2100.\n\n\u201cThere is no appetite for reducing fossil fuel consumption globally at the rate required to meet our climate goals,\u201d said Myles Allen, professor of Geosystem Science at the University of Oxford.",
