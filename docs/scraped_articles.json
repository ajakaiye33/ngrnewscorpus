          "title": "Court stops National Assembly members from fixing own salaries",
          "text": "The Federal High Court in Lagos has declared that the National Assembly Service Commission has no power to fix or determine the pay of members of the National Assembly.\n\nRather, the court, in a judgment on Friday by Justice Chuka Obiozor, held that the Revenue Mobilization, Allocation and Fiscal Commission should fix the pay of lawmakers to reflect the current economic realities in the country.\n\nAccording to a statement on Friday by advocacy group, Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project, the judgment was delivered in a lawsuit filed by two lawyers, Messrs Monday Ubani and John Nwokwu, in conjunction with over 1,500 concerned Nigerians and civil society organisations.\n\nSERAP, in the statement by its Deputy Director, Kolawole Oludare, said the suit, which was argued by human rights lawyer, Mr Femi Falana (SAN), and Ms Adelanke Aremo, followed widespread outcry about jumbo salaries and allowances the federal lawmakers were allocating to themselves.\n\nThe statement quoted Justice Obiozor as declaring that, \u201cThe National Assembly Service Commission has no power whatsoever to fix and determine or allocate the remuneration, allowances, salaries, emoluments or monetary values to the members of the National Assembly.\u201d\n\nThe judge ordered the RMAFC to take up its duty of fixing the pay of the 109 senators and 360 members of the House of Representatives in the National Assembly.\n\nThe plaintiffs, in their suit, had cited a March 8, 2018 interview by Senator Shehu Sani, saying, \u201cEach senator receives N13.5m monthly as running cost in addition to over N750,000.00 monthly consolidated salary and allowances.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiffs, in their suit, contended that, \u201cRMAFC has failed to do any downward review of salaries and allowances of members of the National Assembly since 2007 in spite of the economic downturn in Nigeria. Yet, the commission is statutorily required to review the pay of the lawmakers, in conformity with the country\u2019s economic realities and to achieve fiscal efficiency.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "2023: Muslims, Christians must unite, vote out bad leaders, says Tofa",
          "text": "A former candidate of the National Republican Convention in the June 12, 1993 presidential election, Bashir Tofa, on Friday, called on Nigerians to vote out bad leaders and \u201celect the right people.\u201d\n\nHe also emphasised the need for Muslims to be united for them to bring about change together, warning that if they remained disunited and antagonistic to one another, Nigeria would not achieve anything.\n\nTofa said, \u201cWe have polluted ambitions; you know the ordinary Nigerians want to live their lives quietly and pursue their daily bread. But politicians and elites are the problems of the country. We have to realise that and do something about it. Next time (2023), elect the right people.\u201d\n\nThe former NRC candidate spoke in an interview with journalists during the opening ceremony of a two-day symposium in Abuja with the theme \u2018Threat to the unity of the Ummah and the future of Nigeria, citizenship and nationhood.\u2019\n\nTofa said, \u201cMuslims must be united and so Christians must also unite. If the Muslims and Christians unite, then they can bring about change together. If we remain disunited and antagonistic to one another, we are not going to achieve anything.\n\n\u201cWe have to realise that our religions have taught us unity, peace and progress and as Nigerians, that should be our foremost priority. We have to live together in peace, harmony and as brothers and sisters.\n\n\u201cWe have to respect each other\u2019s religion and even help in any way we can and that is the way we can form a country which can graduate into a nation. The more we stay as we are and begin to degenerate, the more problems we will have in our country.\u201d\n\nHe advocated that issues of religion and ethnicity should be in the background, while the main focus should be on how Nigerians could manage their lives, unity and progress.\n\nThe event was organised by the Supreme Council for Shariah in Nigeria, in collaboration with Jama\u2019atu Nasril Islam and the Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs.\n\nDuring the event, Associate Professor of Political Science and Public Administration, Dr Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, warned that the ongoing insecurity and bad governance would affect the existence of Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, the onslaught in the South-East, banditry in the North and agitation for Oduduwa Republic in the South-West should be a wake-up call for the government to rise to its responsibilities.\n\nBaba-Ahmed, who is a former permanent secretary and spokesperson for the Northern Elders Forum, in a lead paper he presented titled \u2018The Nigerian federation and the management of our diversity: A critical evaluation,\u2019 said the electorate should be prepared to weed out corrupt politicians.\n\nHe suggested that a new constitution be provided that would capture \u201cthe plural nature of the country and design a federation with national identity and unity at the national level and diversity at the unit level.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President of SCSN, Sheikh Abdulrasheed Hadiyyatullah, regretted the spate of bloodletting and destruction of public assets in the South-East but promised that the organisation would strive to evangelise the gospel of peaceful coexistence.\n\n\u201cThe present disturbing development of the series of reckless attacks on national assets and targeted communities (especially those of Hausa-Fulani extractions) in the southern part of the country, is dragging an already sick nation into another disastrous and dangerous locus,\u201d he said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Nairabox is driving digital future of Cinemas in Nigeria",
          "text": "The cinema-viewing culture worldwide has come a long way since it first originated in the 1800s. Cinemas have evolved from the Silent era in 1891 to The Sound era in 1927, followed by The Golden era in 1939, The Blockbuster era in the 1960s and 1970s, The Independent era in the 1990s, then finally, The New age era of the 21st century, which has seen the rapid globalization of streaming services, the usage of 3D technology in cinemas, and the overall digitization of the cinema experience.\n\nThis new era in cinema culture is tagged as the era with the most rapid advancement attributed largely to digitization, and the fast-growing number of internet users which is currently put at 3.97 billion people globally. The era however felt the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as cinemas and movie theaters worldwide were on lockdown in 2020, resulting in the global box office predicting an estimated $5 billion loss as a result of the pandemic. According to reports and analysis from PWC, there is no prediction for cinemas revenue to recover to pre-pandemic levels globally until post-2024, but the movie viewing culture is advancing and adopting new methods that enable movie lovers to watch more movies, which is the subscription-based business model.\n\nThe impact of the pandemic has put a strain on the revenues of cinemas all over the world, subscription-based business models have been very effective as a source of revenue generation. By using a subscription model, the cinema gets more revenue as people are likely to watch more with the affordable price rate and in its entirety, it\u2019s a step to change and win for cinemas, movie makers and other movie/entertainment businesses.\n\nIn Nigeria, the entertainment and cinema sector accounts for an average of 1.4% of the nation\u2019s GDP annually, with the sector generating $5.5 billion in 2019 alone with progressions for it to reach $10.8 billion by 2023, despite there being less than 100 cinemas nationwide. For a population of 200million people with 52% of this population in urban areas, this is considered low. There is therefore a need for a newer approach to revolutionizing the cinema industry through digitization.\n\nActive steps have been taken by several lifestyle companies in the country to find a newer approach to ticket distribution seeing as cinemas cannot effectively distribute movie tickets to everyone who wants to watch a movie at the cinema. Notable in spearheading this new ticketing distribution approach through digitization is Nairabox.\n\nNairabox, one of Nigeria\u2019s leading lifestyle and entertainment apps has been a driver for change in the cinema going culture in Nigeria since inception in 2016.\n\nIn April 2021, the app relaunched with a newer app look from its old version and introduced what we will describe as an unprecedented change with their new Cinema Subscription Feature, the first of its kind in Nigeria. As a platform which allows users to enjoy a wealth of experience with easy access to these cinema subscription tickets, and regular movie tickets on their user friendly and functional app, Nairabox is blazing the trail and raising the bar.\n\nAt the forefront of their offering is their newest cinema subscription service which allows users the option to get access to 4 cinema tickets for N2,000 and 12 cinema tickets for N6,000 monthly to watch any movie at the cinema. This unprecedented breakthrough in the cinema-going culture in the country shows the emergence of a new revolution in the cinema culture in Nigeria, thanks to digitization.\n\nIn a recent interview, the CEO, Tokunbo Adetona highlighted one of the brand\u2019s reasons for launching Nigeria\u2019s first cinema subscription. In his words, \u201cConsidering that there is a large cinema-viewing audience in Nigeria, there isn\u2019t a community fit for this audience in the country. This is what has spurred us to create this new Cinema Subscription service to provide value as well as ease to everyone from all over the country.\u201d\n\nWith the relaunch of the lifestyle app, the addition of this new feature, and partnership with cinemas like VIVA Cinemas, Genesis Cinemas, and Kada Cinemas, Nigerians in states across the country like Lagos, Ogun, Edo, Enugu, Delta, etc., can now comfortably have access to tickets to any movie of their choice without having to worry about long queues or sold-out tickets anymore. Nairabox has helped to advance the cinema culture in Nigeria and solidified its position as the leading lifestyle app in the country.\n\nThe Nairabox app is currently available to download for free on the Google Playstore and coming soon this June to the IOS store.",

          "text": "By Vincent Ikuomola, Abuja, Alao Abiodun and Robert Egbe\n\nWe\u2019re investigating action against us, says company\n\nFG orders NBC to license all social media companies\n\nJust like Twitter, Facebook pulls down President\u2019s post\n\nAll the social media platforms operating in Nigeria are now to be licensed by the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) following an indefinite suspension slammed on Twitter by the Federal Government on Friday.\n\nTwitter said in its initial reaction to the clampdown that it was investigating the action against it.\n\nNigerians in their thousands condemned the ban.\n\nGovernment cited \u201cthe persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence\u201d for its action.\n\nOn Wednesday, Information and Tourism Minister Lai Mohammed accused Twitter of playing double standards in matters concerning domestic issues, and described the company\u2019s role in Nigeria as suspect.\n\nTwitter had pulled down a comment by President Muhammadu Buhari in which he said the federal government would treat \u201cthose misbehaving today\u201d in \u201cthe language they understand\u201d in reference to the civil war.\n\nAlmost simultaneously with the suspension of Twitter yesterday, Facebook pulled down Buhari\u2019s threat against \u201cthose misbehaving.\u201d\n\nIn a similar move, Facebook extended the ban it placed on the account of the immediate past US president Donald Trump to two years.\n\nIncidentally, the federal government\u2019s ban on Twitter was broken on the same social medium by the Federal Ministry of Information. But it did not say how the ban would be enforced.\n\nTwitter was still available to Nigerian users as at 8.30pm yesterday.\n\nBy that time, the ban had attracted over 265,000 comments, many of which derided government and its officials.\n\nMohammed in a statement through his Special Assistant Segun Adeyemi said the federal government has \u201csuspended, indefinitely, the operations of the microblogging and social networking service, Twitter, in Nigeria\u201d.\n\nHe said the action stemmed from \u201cthe persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\u201d\n\nHe also directed the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to \u201cimmediately commence the process of licensing all OTT and social media operations in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nOther social media platforms used by Nigerians include Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and Youtube.\n\nTwitter: \u2018We\u2019re investigating action against us\u2019\n\nTwitter in its first reaction to the ban yesterday said it was \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d.\n\nIt said it was \u201cinvestigating and will provide updates when we know more.\u201d\n\nA Twitter spokesperson had said it pulled down Buhari\u2019s post because it \u201cwas in violation of the Twitter Rules. The account owner will be required to delete the violative Tweet and spend 12 hours with their account in read-only mode\u201d.\n\nThe statement gave no further details.\n\nBan incompatible with Nigeria\u2019s international obligations, says Amnesty\n\nAmnesty International (AI) described the ban on Twitter as incompatible with Nigeria\u2019s international obligations under the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\nIt asked government to lift the ban immediately.\n\n\u201cAmnesty International condemns the Nigerian government\u2019s suspension of Twitter in Nigeria \u2014 a social medium widely used by Nigerians to exercise their human rights, including their rights to freedom of expression and access to information,\u201d AI said in a statement posted on Twitter.\n\n\u201cWe call on the #Nigerian authorities to immediately reverse the unlawful suspension and other plans to gag the media, repress the civic space, and undermine Nigerians\u2019 human rights. #TwitterBan.\n\n\u201cThis action is clearly inconsistent and incompatible with Nigeria\u2019s international obligations, including under the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\u201d\n\nSweden says no to Twitter suspension\n\nThe Swedish Embassy in Abuja yesterday opposed the federal government\u2019s indefinite suspension of Twitter.\n\nIn a post via its official Twitter handle \u2018Sweden in Nigeria,\u2019 it advised the government to respect Nigerian\u2019s right to freedom of expression.\n\n\u201cNigerians have a constitutional right to exercise their freedom of expression and a right to access of information. This must be respected.\n\n\u201cSafeguarding free, independent media and civic spaces for democratic voices is an important part of Sweden\u2019s\u201d, it tweeted ending its tweet with the hashtags #DriveForDemocracy and #TwitterBan.\n\nSoyinka: It\u2019s a petulant gesture unbecoming of a democratically elected president\n\nNobel Laureate, Prof. Wole Soyinka branded the Twitter ban a \u201cpetulant gesture\u201d that is \u201cunbecoming of a democratically elected president.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cif Buhari has a problem with Twitter, he is advised to sort it out between them personally, the way Donald Trump did, not rope in the right to free expression of the Nigerian citizen as collateral damage.\n\n\u201cIn any case, this is a technical problem Nigerians should be able to work their way around. The field of free expression remains wide open, free of any dictatorial spasms!\u201d\n\nPDP: It\u2019s draconian, slide towards fascism\n\nOpposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) said President Buhari, by the ban, was \u201cpushing Nigerians to the wall\u201d.\n\nIt described the Twitter suspension as unwarranted, draconian and a slide towards a fascist regime in our country.\n\nIt also said the suspension was \u201ca vexatious, condemnable and barbaric move to muzzle Nigerians, particularly the youths,\u201d ostensibly to prevent them from holding the administration \u201caccountable for its atrocities, including human right violations, patronizing of terrorists and outright suppressive acts against innocent Nigerians.\u201d\n\nThe party\u2019s presidential candidate in the 2019 election, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, tweeted: \u201cHopefully, this isn\u2019t my last tweet. #smile,\u201d\n\nWhile former Senate President Bukola Saraki said: \u201cNo sir! This should not be the response from the president of a nation with a vibrant youthful population for whom #Twitter is part of their daily lives and a source of their income and livelihood. This must be reviewed.\u201d\n\nSome other tweets: Dino Melaye \u201cNaija Govt sha. Using Twitter platform to announce Twitter suspension. Na im Baba Fela dey call babanla nonsense. SDM\u201d\n\nDr. D\u00edp\u00f2 Aw\u00f3j\u00edd\u00e9, FHEA @OgbeniDipo Does President Buhari and the federal government know how much young Nigerians make on social media platforms like Twitter daily? Does Lai Mohammed know the number of jobs being sustained by Twitter in Nigeria? What is wrong with these people?\n\nDalla Bona Fan @jaja_sowari Replying to @OgbeniDipo \u201cSo many inconsistencies from Jack and his twitter team. For the first time, I am with FG on this.\u201d\n\n\u2018Fisayo Soyombo \u201cThe most shameful thing about the ban of Twitter in Nigeria is not even that it was announced. It\u2019s the realisation that this government can\u2019t see the divisiveness and irresponsibility of that Buhari tweet, and the barefacedness with which it is going about it.\u201d\n\nRoviel @ObongRoviel \u201cFG has suspended Twitter in Nigeria, if you can still tweet, that means you\u2019re in UAR. Ko po ke\u201d\n\nYourFavLawyer @jagganiyu \u201cIf Twitter is such an issue for them, why don\u2019t they deactivate their accounts? Why are they still on Twitter? They know Crowwe is a useless app. Me I\u2019m in UAR sha, so Twitter in Nigeria suspension no concern me.\u201d\n\nSERAP \u201cBREAKING: We\u2019re suing Nigerian authorities over their ILLEGAL indefinite suspension of Twitter in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cNigerians have a right to freedom of expression and access to information including online, and we plan to fight to keep it that way. @NigeriaGov, we\u2019ll see you in court.\u201d\n\n@Biraphil: This is the same twitter y\u2019all cried when they set up their headquarters in Ghana instead of Nigeria. Government would\u2019ve locked their headquarters up for hate speech by now.\n\nNBA, Ozekhome slam FG\n\nThe Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), and Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) Mike Ozekhome yesterday opposed the federal government\u2019s indefinite suspension of the operations of micro blogging and social networking service Twitter.\n\nThey advised the government to immediately reverse itself on the ground that the suspension contravened Nigerians\u2019 constitutional right to freely express their views via Twitter.\n\nIn the alternative, NBA President Olumide Akpata threatened legal action against the government on behalf of Nigerians.\n\nAkpata said: \u201cThe Nigerian Bar Association has noted with great concern the extraordinary decision of the Federal Govt to suspend the operations of Twitter in Nigeria and, by necessary implication, the right of Nigerians to freely express their constitutionally guaranteed opinions through that medium.\n\n\u201cThe NBA finds no constitutional or legal authority to support the peremptory action of the Federal Government to suspend the operations of Twitter in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cBeyond the dent on our constitutional democracy, at a time when the Nigerian economy is unarguably struggling, the impact of arbitrary decisions such as this on investor confidence is better imagined.\n\n\u201cConsequently, if this decision is not immediately reversed, the NBA will have no choice but to challenge same in the interest of the public and for the sake of our democracy.\u201d\n\nDr Ozekhome slammed the government in a statement \u2018When a toterring government twiddles Twitter\u2019\n\nHe said:\u201dWhat does Nigerian government think Twitter loses by being suspended? It is just the Nigerian people that will suffer, in the same way the government has been punishing Nigerians in the last six years.\n\n\u201cTwitter will not even bother whether Nigerians use Twitter or not. We are 210 million people in Nigeria. Of this number, only about 33 million Nigerians are active on social media. Less than 15 million of these are on Twitter.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, there are well over 300 million people across the world that use twitter. So Twitter will not feel it. It is just like a drop of water in an ocean. Twitter will not even know that a country has suspended it.\n\n\u201cSo, it is the same beleaguered Nigerian people that will suffer, not the Federal Government or Twitter, because the Federal Government is a minute minuscule aspect of the Nigerian society, made up of only a few selected elite that do not care about the common man.\n\n\u201cThis is the same government that undeservedly rode to power using the same twitter and other social media platforms it now detests\u2026.I am very ashamed.\u201d\n\nLike Twitter, Facebook removes Buhari\u2019s \u2018Genocidal\u2019 threat post\n\nAnother social media platform, Facebook, yesterday pulled down Buhari\u2019s controversial threat against \u201cthose misbehaving today.\u201d\n\nFacebook\u2019s action was in reaction to complaints from some Nigerian users.\n\nIt said: \u201cIn line with our global policies, we\u2019ve removed a post from President Buhari\u2019s Facebook page for violating our Community Standards against inciting violence. We remove any content from individuals or organisations that violates our policies on Facebook.\u201d\n\nFacebook suspends Trump for two years\n\nFacebook has also suspended former U.S. President Donald Trump for two years effective Jan. 7.\n\nFacebook, in a statement by Nick Clegg, Vice-President of Global Affairs, cited \u201csevere violation\u201d after Capitol Hill riots of January 6 and that Trump\u2019s accounts would only be reinstated if conditions permitted.\n\n\u201cLast month, the Oversight Board upheld Facebook\u2019s suspension of former U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s Facebook and Instagram accounts following his praise for people engaged in violence at the Capitol on January 6.\n\n\u201cBut in doing so, the board criticised the open-ended nature of the suspension, stating that \u201cit was not appropriate for Facebook to impose the indeterminate and standardless penalty of indefinite suspension\u201d.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe board instructed us to review the decision and respond in a way that is clear and proportionate, and made a number of recommendations on how to improve our policies and processes,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cWe are today announcing new enforcement protocols to be applied in exceptional cases such as this, and we are confirming the time-bound penalty consistent with those protocols which we are applying to Mr. Trump\u2019s accounts.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cGiven the gravity of the circumstances that led to Trump\u2019s suspension, we believe his actions constituted a severe violation of our rules which merit the highest penalty available under the new enforcement protocols Facebook stated.\n\n\u201cWe are suspending his accounts for two years, effective from the date of the initial suspension on January 7 this year.\n\n\u201cAt the end of this period, we will look to experts to assess whether the risk to public safety has receded.\n\n\u201cWe will evaluate external factors, including instances of violence, restrictions on peaceful assembly and other markers of civil unrest.\u201d",

          "text": "By Ibrahim Apekhade Yusuf\n\nDoes Nigeria have what it takes to enforce Federal Government\u2019s \u2018indefinite suspension\u2019 of Twitter? Some Information and Communications Technology (ICT) experts believe it does not.\n\nA cross section of the experts contacted on Friday said Nigeria lacks a central information dissemination system that is required to make a ban work. President, Association of Telecommunications\n\nCompanies of Nigeria (ATCON), Ikechukwu Nnamani said he received the news with shock and was trying to study the situation to determine what level of intervention is required. Nnamani who is also the Founder/CEO, Medallion Communications Limited, an interconnect clearinghouse and co-location data service company, however, hinted that the Association is already in talks with relevant government agencies to see how the issue can be resolved without any backlash.\n\nBut the immediate past President of ATCON, Olusola Teniola, said: \u201cFrom the look of things, it is very clear that the government is trying to regulate the internet and social media.\n\n\u201cUnlike China, which is a communist country and has a central information system, this is not possible in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, Twitter is still being accessed; it is not inoperative as we speak. So I think it is a mere wishful thinking on the part of government.\u201d\n\nRead Also: Anger as Buhari suspends Twitter operations in Nigeria\n\nPressed further, Teniola said: \u201cIn the case of Nigeria, it is very difficult to enforce because Twitter doesn\u2019t have a physical office or presence in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cTheir office is in Ghana. What obtains is that it is the local technology companies that provide access to their services which people access here.\n\n\u201cEven though the government is desirous of banning the activities of\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTwitter, it is powerless in this instance because there are several ways to access Twitter.\n\n\u201cI think the government decision would be weakened by the fact there are several other ways to bypass the ban and easily access their (Twitter) service. So there is really no cause for alarm. The digital world cannot be controlled, because it is a global platform.\u201d\n\nAlso reacting to the Twitter suspension, Mr. Akeem Baiyewu, a digital media expert, described it as an exercise in futility.\n\nWaxing philosophical, Baiyewu said the ban on Twitter was tantamount to stopping the wind from blowing.\n\nOn what is the likely socioeconomic backlash arising from the ban, Baiyewu said, \u201cIt is a mere empty threat by the government and cannot stand the test of time.\n\n\u201cThere is no question of whether services would be disrupted. No. People should go about their businesses without any let or hindrance because the ban can\u2019t work here.\u201d\n\nExpatiating, he said: \u201cThe whole world is going global and transparency comes with democracy. In today\u2019s world, if you violate any rule, you face the consequence.\n\n\u201cTwitter didn\u2019t impose its rule on the spur of the moment. It has its own rules of engagements which anyone ready to access their services must adhere to. Twitter didn\u2019t force the government to access its services and cannot expect preferential treatment from the social media platform. They (Twitter) made their rules and the federal government joined voluntarily.\n\n\u201cAccording to Twitter, there was a violation of its rules by the top hierarchy of the federal government and it had to enforce its rule. So, I don\u2019t think Twitter committed any infraction whatsoever.\u201d\n\nHow Myanmar enforced Twitter, Instagram ban\n\nMyanmar which joined the likes of China, North Korea and others in banning the social media first blocked Facebook and shortly afterwards ordered mobile networks and internet service providers to block Twitter and Facebook-owned Instagram.\n\nThe Southeast Asian country\u2019s military seized power in a coup in February, detaining its civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi along with other government officials.\n\nFacebook users had reportedly been using the social media platform to protest the coup, sharing photos of themselves giving the three-finger salute that\u2019s become associated with resistance in the area.\n\n\u201cAll mobile operators, international gateways and internet service providers in Myanmar received a directive on 5 February 2021 from the Myanmar Ministry of Transport and Communications (MoTC) to, until further notice, block the social media platforms Twitter and Instagram,\u201d Norwegian telecom company Telenor said in a statement late yesterday. The company provides mobile services in Myanmar.",

          "text": "From Femi Folaranmi, Yenagoa and Tony John, Port Harcourt\n\nIntense pressure is being mounted on ex-leader of the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND), Chief Government Ekpemupolo aka Tompolo over the seven days ultimatum he issued to President Muhammadu Buhari and Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio to constitute and inaugurate a substantive board for the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) or face the militants\u2019 wrath.\n\nTompolo broke his silence after a long withdrawal from the public, when he, in a letter addressed to President Buhari demanded the constitution of the NDDC board within seven days.\n\nHe kicked against the continued use of a sole administrator to run the affairs of the NDDC, noting that the action would likely set the Niger Delta region on fire. According to him at the expiration of the ultimatum which is today (Saturday) without the board being constituted, there will be massive protest by members of the Ijaw Youth Council (IYC).\n\nSaturday Sun investigations revealed that, rattled by Tompolo\u2019s pronouncement which instantly received the endorsement of militant leaders in the region, the presidency dispatched Akpabio to Delta State to plead with him over the ultimatum. He was said to have arrived Warri on Thursday and proceeded to Oporoza where he engaged Tompolo\u2019s representative in discussion over the NDDC matter, pleading for understanding.\n\nThe outcome of the meeting did not seem to have met the expectation of the Presidency because leaders of the Ijaw National Congress (INC) have also been enlisted to prevail on Tompolo and other militants to give peace a chance. Sources said Tompolo insisted on the constitution of the board which can continue with the forensic audit of the Commisison.\n\nThe President of the INC, the umbrella body of Ijaw-speaking people, Prof Benjamin Okaba in a statement backing the criticism against the continuous running of the NDDC through a sole administrator, however, pleaded with militants to sheathe their swords and allow INC to engage critical stakeholders which would enable it to seek audience with President Buhari to brief him on the precarious security situation in the region due to the delay in constituting the board of the NDDC.\n\nIn a related development, King Michael Ateke Tom, the Amayanabo of Okochiri Kingdom in Rivers State has thrown his weight behind Tompolo. The ex-militant leader of the Niger Delta Vigilante Force in a statement through his Chief of Staff, Chief Tamunokonba Akaluogbo, said the decision to queue behind Tompolo is due to the continued insincerity and open deceit adopted by Akapbio in handling the affairs of the NDDC.",

          "text": "From Vincent Kalu, Lagos, Aidoghie Paulinus, Abuja and Chineye Anuforo, Lagos\n\nSeveral Nigerians reacted with anger and indignation yesterday as the Federal Government suspended indefinitely the operations of Twitter in the country.\n\nMinister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, disclosed the suspension in a statement signed by a Special Assistant to the President (Media) in the Office of the Minister, Segun Adeyemi.\n\nThe suspension of the operations of Twitter in Nigeria came few days after the micro-blogging and social networking service deleted President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tweet on the civil war.\n\nMohammed, however, stated that the persistent use of Twitter for activities that were capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence was responsible for the suspension.\n\nThe Minister further said the Federal Government has also directed the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to immediately commence the process of licensing all OTT and social media operations in Nigeria.\n\nActing Leader of Afenifere, Chief Ayo Adebanjo said the ban on Twitter has confirmed the position of Nigerians who say that this President Buhari\u2019s government is a military dictatorship. The president is not ready to tolerate contrary views, he stated.\n\nIn a terse twee, former Vice President Atyiku Abubakar said: \u201cHopefully, this isn\u2019t my last tweet. #smile\u201d\n\nSenator Dino Melaye stated: Buhari should learn from Trump. \u201cOrdinary Delete na im vex you like this. Na im be say if dem suspend you you go collect our phones. Yeye dey smell. Naija Govt sha. Using Twitter platform to announce Twitter suspension. Na im Baba Fela dey call babanla nonsense. he wrote in Pidgin.\n\nSenator Ben Bruce in his [email protected] on his Twitter handle, benmurraybruce, said Nigerians deserve their right to free speech.\n\n\u201cThe Twitter ban in Nigeria is hasty and unnecessary. I hope the government sees its error and quickly corrects this goof.\u201d\n\nPopular lawyer, Femi Falana (SAN) also condemned the suspension of Twitter in Nigeria, stating that: \u201cThis is a provocative infringement of Nigerians\u2019 right to freedom of information in the country.\n\n\u201cThis is a confirmation of the suspension of Chapter 4 of the Nigerian Constitution.\n\n\u201cThe NBC has been authorised to impose harsh fines on local media houses that embarass the Federal Government as a pretext for possible ban.\n\n\u201cThe suspension of Twitter may soon be extended to the BBC, VOA and other international media platforms accused of publishing seditious or defamatory information against the government and its officials.\u201d\n\nThe president of African Bar Association, Hannibal Uwaifo, described the ban of Twitter in Nigeria by the Federal Government as irresponsible.\n\nAccording to him, it is uncalled for and absolutely responsible. It is highhandedness to deprive other citizens of the use of twitter. Twitter didn\u2019t ban President Buhari from using it , it deleted his post that they considered offensive and they didn\u2019t delete the post of other Nigerian.\n\n\u201c o, why should they ban Nigerians from using Twitter simply because twitter deleted the post of the president? The president of Nigeria is not the owner of this country; he is just first among the citizens of this country, who gave him the opportunity to rule them.\n\n\u201cTherefore, he should not equate himself as if he were an emperor; that when an emperor is offended, the whole country is offended. He was the one that made the statement they considered irresponsible; he didn\u2019t consult with Nigerians before he made the statement.\n\nThe government should reverse the ban immediately. This is undemocratic, and should not be allowed to stand. Twitter suspended the account of a siting president of United State of America, Donald trump and , Twitter was not banned. What is this issue?\n\nFormer Executive Secretary, National Health Insurance Scheme, Prof Usman Yusuf, said over 99 per cent of Nigerians do not care and they don\u2019t know Twitter. He urged government to concentrate on what concerns people, not Twitter. \u201cInsecurity, the price of Gerri, price of rice, the price of fuel are all that concern Nigerians, not Twitter.\u201d\n\nNational President, National Association of Telecommunications Subscribers (NATCOMS), Adeolu Ogunbanjo, said Twitter was right to have deleted Buhari\u2019s tweets:\n\n\u201cI see his choice of words as offensive to the younger generation and obviously it is a threat because his words were too open ended. I think he should calm down and look at what Twitter is saying; that you can\u2019t use their medium to be threatening a whole generation of a country. These people he is threatening are supposed to be the ones in charge.\u201d\n\nChief Executive Officer of Jidaw Systems Limited, Jide Awe, also absolved Twitter of any blame for deleting Buhari\u2019s tweets.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that all social media big tech platforms are private platforms. My assumption is that such actions are taken when a user\u2019s post is deemed to be against the social media platform\u2019s community guidelines and terms. All users agree to those rules when they sign up. Having social media accounts is a choice.\n\n\u201cIn view of their reach and influence, many world leaders use these platforms to communicate with their citizens and the world. The global response to posts and tweets is a sign of the power of social media platforms. However, they own their private platforms. On their own, these platforms determine when a user breaks the rules and the actions to take when there is a violation.\n\n\u201cFormer US President, Donald Trump had his tweets deleted and received several warnings and \u201cviolation\u201d reports on his tweets before he was eventually banned from Twitter. Yet he never banned Twitter operations in America.",

They said that more than 10 persons including hawkers were killed.\n\nThe exact number of the deceased could not be ascertained as of the time of filing this report; and the number of vehicles involved as security agents scared sympathizers and onlookers away with gunshots; firing live bullets in different directions.\n\nIn fact, there was a pandemonium when the security agents including the military and the police opened gunfire, perhaps, in attempts to disperse the surging onlookers and sympathizers who had throng the accident scene.\n\nVehicles using a section of the road were seen racing on high speed to avoid being hit by bullets even as pedestrians ran helter-skelter, scampering for safety.\n\nPolicemen on the scene, however, told the reporter that about 10 vehicles were affected. They, however, asked the reporter to leave the scene immediately to avoid being hit by the live bullets.\n\nMeanwhile, the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), in a statement by its Public Education Officer in the state, SRC Florence Edor, said that only two persons were killed.\n\n\u201cTwo male adults lost their lives in a multiple fatal crash at about 1428hrs this afternoon near Kwata Bridge opposite the Ministry of Agriculture, Anambra State.\n\n\u201cIt involves a red Man Diesel truck with registration number JJN 59 YZ, a green Honda CRV without enlistment number, a Red M/Benz 4matic with registration number ABJ 115 DA, a black Toyota Highlander with registration number AWKA 226 HM and an Ash Lexus SUV with registration number KJA 136 FD.\n\n\u201cEyewitness report reaching us indicates that the crash which was as a result of brake failure involved a total of 12 people, 11 Male adults and one female adult .\n\n\u201cOne male adult who sustained injury was rushed to Princeton Hospital by FRSC rescue team from Awka, while the other two male adults, who were taken to Amaku General Hospital Awka, were later confirmed dead by the doctors on duty and their bodies deposited at the hospital morgue\u201d, the statement read.",

          "text": "\u2022Insecurity does not make Nigeria failed state, insists FG\n\n\u2022Presidency: Foreign magazine\u2019s opinion on Nigeria distorted, unfair\n\nBy Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja and Kayode Fasua in Abeokuta\n\nFormer President Olusegun Obasanjo yesterday expressed worry over the state of the nation and blamed bad leadership for the nation\u2019s woes.\n\nThe former president, while receiving a book titled, \u2018The Man, The General and The President,\u2019 written by Femmy Carrena, said in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, that even though the country is destined to be a land flowing with milk and honey, bad leadership has made it unachievable.\n\nAccording to him, the country is currently dripping with bitterness and sadness.\n\nBut despite the worsening insecurity, the federal government has said it is preposterous for anyone to declare Nigeria a failed state on the basis of the country\u2019s security challenges.\n\nThe All Progressives Congress (APC) also said alleged plots by some Nigerians to bring down the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari would fail.\n\nObasanjo stated that although Nigeria is destined to lead the black race, failure of leadership has prevented the country from taking its rightful place in the comity of developed nations.\n\nHe said: \u201cMy prayer is that all of us will have something to contribute to making this country what God has created it to be \u2013 a land flowing with milk and honey.\n\n\u201cRight now, it is a land flowing with bitterness and sadness; that is not what God wants this country to be.\n\n\u201cWe must change the narrative; we must talk to ourselves in the civilised language.\n\n\u201cThere is nowhere you go in this country that you will not see geniuses in any section of the country. So, why should we look down on ourselves?\u201d\n\nHe stated that over 14 million children were out of school, adding that if care is not taken, Nigeria would have more \u201cBoko Haram in future.\u201d\n\nObasanjo urged Nigerians to emulate some prominent citizens that are doing well at the international level.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have Akin Adesina running the African Development Bank (AfDB); we have Benedict Oramah running the Afrexim Bank; we have Mohammed Barkindo running the OPEC (Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries); we have my sister, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, running the WTO (World Trade Organisation), and we have Amina Mohammed who, I think celebrated her 60th birthday yesterday or the day before yesterday, who is number two in the United Nations (UN).\n\n\u201cThese are things that should give hope and encouragement for the future.\n\n\u201cAnd each of these people that I have mentioned, are doing fantastically well. We have even at the AU (African Union), Ambassador Bankole Adeoye, who had just taken over as the Commissioner for Political Affairs & Peace and Security (PAPS) of the AU.\n\n\u201cSo why are they doing well there and here we are not doing well? Something must be wrong! We should be interrogating this; we should ask then what should we do?\n\n\u201cWhat we should do is put our house in order, and we can put our house in order.\u201d\n\nThe book was reviewed by Professor Emeritus, Michael Abiola Omolewa, a former Chairperson of United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), and the review was read on his behalf by Ndidi Amaka-Okafor.\n\nInsecurity Does Not Make Nigeria Failed State, Insists FG\n\nMeanwhile, the federal government has said it is preposterous for anyone to declare Nigeria a failed state due to the country\u2019s security challenges.\n\nMinister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, stated this yesterday in response to a recent declaration by the Council on Foreign Affairs in the United States that \u201cNigeria is at a point of no return with all the signs of a failed nation.\u2019\u2019\n\nFormer US Ambassador to Nigeria and a Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, Mr. John Campbell, and the President Emeritus of World Peace Foundation, Mr. Robert Rotberg, had urged the United States to acknowledge that Nigeria is a failed state in the light of the many challenges plaguing the country.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s worldwide companions, particularly the USA, should acknowledge that Nigeria is now a failed state. In recognition of that truth, they need to deepen their engagement with the nation and search to carry the present administration accountable for its failures, while additionally working with it to supply safety and proper financial system,\u201d they had said in an article.\n\nBut Mohammed said in Abuja that \u201cNigeria is not and cannot be a failed state.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe stated that the declaration by the council did not represent an official US policy.\n\nMohammed said: \u201cThis declaration is merely the opinions of two persons, former US Ambassador to Nigeria and a Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, John Campbell, and the President Emeritus of World Peace Foundation, Robert Rotberg.\n\n\u201cDeclaring any nation a failed state is not done at the whims and caprices of one or two persons, no matter their status.\n\n\u201cJust because Nigeria is facing security challenges, which we have acknowledged and which we are tackling, does not automatically make the country a failed state.\n\n\u201cLike former US Senator Daniel Moynihan said, \u201cYou are entitled to your opinion but not your facts.\u201d\n\nMohammed said Nigeria did not meet the criteria for a nation to become a failed state.\n\nHe listed the criteria to include the inability to provide public service and inability to interact with other states as a full member of the international community.\n\n\u201cYes, the non-state actors may be rampaging in some parts of the country; they have not and cannot overwhelm this government,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe minister said it was not the first time it was predicted that Nigeria would fail or break up.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe were even once told that Nigeria would break up in 2015. But their doomsday predictions have all failed and will fail again.\u2019\u2019\n\nPresidency: Foreign Magazine\u2019s Opinion on Nigeria Distorted, Unfair\n\nMeanwhile, the Presidency yesterday described as unfair and distorted an opinion in the latest article on Nigeria entitled \u2018The Giant of Africa Is Failing\u2019 published by the Foreign Affairs (Magazine).\n\nThe Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, made the condemnation in a reaction to the article.\n\nIn a letter addressed to the publishers of the magazine, the presidential spokesman took exception to the way and manner facts were being misrepresented to support distorted opinions.\n\nThe letter read in part: \u201cThe latest article on Nigeria in Foreign Affairs titled \u2018The Giant of Africa is Failing\u2019 is unfair both to a magazine with such an esteemed pedigree and to its readers.\n\n\u201cFormer United States Ambassador to Nigeria, John Campbell, has been predicting the collapse of Nigeria for several years. He is of course entitled to his opinions, even where events consistently prove him wrong.\n\n\u201cBut facts should not be bent to support distorted opinions.\n\n\u201cLet me give you one example.\n\n\u201cThe authors write:\n\n\u2018At an April meeting with the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Buhari reportedly requested that the headquarters of the U.S. Africa Command be moved from Germany to Nigeria so that it would be closer to the fight against jihadi groups in the country\u2019s north.\u2019\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari did not request that AFRICOM move to Nigeria. The transcript of the call with Secretary Blinken is available on the State Department\u2019s own website.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a question of the invented addition of \u2018to Nigeria\u2019 with regard to AFRICOM. It sums up a piece that attempts \u2013 subtly but revealingly \u2013 to shift facts to suit an argument.\u2019\u2019\n\nAccording to Shehu, Nigeria faces multiple challenges, not least of which is the dissemination of fake news and prejudiced opinion.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis is something we have come to expect from partisan blogs and politically motivated lobbies.\n\n\u201cIt is still a surprise, and a disappointment, to see them joined by Foreign Affairs.\u2019\n\nPlots to Destroy Buhari\u2019s Govt will Fail, Says APC\n\nAlso yesterday, the ruling APC said plots by some Nigerians to bring down the administration of Buhari would fail.\n\nNational Secretary of the Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary National Convention Planning Committee of the APC, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, said at an event organised by the APC Professionals Forum, in Abuja, that despite the challenges the party met on the ground, the president had recorded successes in the areas of infrastructural development, the fight against corruption and the reduction of poverty.\n\nAkpanudoedehe spoke on behalf of the Governor of Yobe State and Chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the APC, Mr. Mai Mala Buni.\n\nHe said: \u201cPlans to bring down the government of President Muhammadu Buhari will fail; some disgruntled elements are trying to blackmail and discredit this government with the aim of bringing it down.\n\n\u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari will be judged by security and other achievements. We should not analyse the achievements of this government based on blackmail.\u201d\n\nHe added that despite misgivings in certain quarters, the benefit accruing to the nation through efforts being made by the Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy was visible.\n\nAccording to him, the SIM card registration, which has drastically reduced the number of pre-registered sims available for use for criminal purposes has helped in improving the nation\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cThose who are heating up the polity so that people will believe there is insecurity are organising to bring down the government of the APC. We will bring them to book Insha Allah,\u201d he said.\n\nAkpanudoedehe stated that the positive effects of the social intervention programmes among Nigeria\u2019s poor and the vulnerable were being underreported because most of the beneficiaries were neither party member nor did they share in the administration\u2019s vision.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Farouk Yahaya.\n\nIt said contrary to reports of an impending exodus of about 30 Generals in the military following the appointment of Yahaya, a member of the 37 Regular Course of Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA), other major generals and equivalent ranks in the military senior to him would be redeployed to the Defence Headquarters.\n\nIn line with military tradition that forbids seniors saluting juniors, members of Course 35, 36 and 37 were expected to leave the service following Yahaya\u2019s appointment.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that members of Course 35, notably the Chief of Policy and Plans (COPP), Maj. Gen. Benjamin Ahanotu, and Commander, Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), Maj. Gen. Abubakar Maikobi, have not been seen at official functions since Yahaya assumed duties.\n\nAhanotu\u2019s deputy has been standing in for him at official functions.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that most Course 36 officers were redeployed to Defence Headquarters and tri-service institutions, notably Armed Forces Resettlement Centre, Command and Staff College, Jaji and TRADOC and have since assumed duties.\n\nThe Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Lucky Irabor, is of Course 34, whom by his seniority could accommodate officers of Courses 35 and 36 cadres in tri-service institutions under the DHQ.\n\nThe new army chief is believed to have accepted to work with his coursemates (Course 37).\n\nBriefing the media in Abuja yesterday, Acting Director of the Directorate of Defence Media Operations (DDMO), Bri. Gen.\n\nBernard Onyeuko, said the military was not contemplating any retirement and had, in fact, not retired any general.\n\n\u201cI wish to use this medium to dispel such unfounded rumours. Retirement is only voluntarily for senior officers who desire to do so,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cAt this point, no retirement has been authorised by the military high command.\u201d\n\nHe said the military high command would not be weary of appreciating the general public for their support and continue to encourage them to provide credible and timely information that will facilitate their proactive engagements in the theatres of operations.\n\n\u201cThe military high command also lauds all efforts of the gallant troops of the armed forces and personnel of other security agencies involved in various operations across the country for their resilience and indefatigable commitment,\u201d he said.\n\nOnyeuko also reviewed DDMO\u2019s operational activities nationwide between May 20 and June 2.\n\nHe said the operations were the combined efforts of the military and other security agencies involving land, maritime and air operations.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is worthy of note that these operations are conducted simultaneously in the various theatres of operation on daily basis across the country. The unrelenting and committed efforts of the gallant troops as well as the cumulative results of our operational activities in the various operations and specific events will be highlighted under the different operations.\n\n\u201cWithin the period in focus, troops of the Armed Forces of Nigeria intensified their operational efforts in the fight against terrorism, banditry, hoodlums and militancy as well as other criminalities across all the geo-political zones of the country.\u201d According to him, the troops conducted series of clearance patrols, ambush, raid, picketing, cordon and search operations as well as artillery bombardments.\n\nOthers are anti-piracy, anti-illegal oil bunkering, anti-crude oil theft, anti-pipeline vandalism and anti-smuggling operations. He said there were also extensive air operations, which included air patrols, intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance missions, offensive air strikes, air interdictions, search and rescue operations, and close air support for ground troops.\n\nHe said troops of Operation Hadin Kai carried out series of operational activities.\n\nHe added: \u201cThey rescued kidnapped victims, neutralised scores of terrorists, destroyed terrorists\u2019 enclaves, arrested terrorists and intercepted terrorists\u2019 logistics items, including vehicles.\n\n\u201cOn 20 May 2021, troops had contact and engaged BHT criminal elements in Gwoza LGA of Borno State. This occurred as troops swiftly responded to a distress call by farmers on an attack on their location. Troops gallantly rescued the farmers. During the encounter, several terrorists were neutralised, while some others escaped with varying degrees of gunshot wounds.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Accuses microblogging site of double standards\n\nBy Deji Elumoye\n\nThe federal government yesterday accused the social media giant, Twitter, of double standards in its treatment of issues affecting Nigeria.\n\nIt warned that it would not allow the microblogging site to dictate to President Muhammadu Buhari his views on national issues.\n\nThe accusation followed the decision of Twitter to delete a controversial post by Buhari on the Nigerian civil war.\n\nThe president, in the post on Tuesday, had warned against insurrection, saying that those fomenting trouble in the South-east are in for a rude shock.\n\nBuhari, in a series of tweets on Tuesday via his verified Twitter handle @mbuhari had said: \u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian civil war. Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.\u201d\n\nBuhari\u2019s statement, which was also tweeted, sparked outrage on the social media with some Nigerians reporting it to Twitter.\n\nHowever, some said the president sounded firm in his warning against perpetrators of violence in the South-east.\n\nBut yesterday, Twitter pulled down the tweet for violating its community standards.\n\nTwitter, in a comment, said: \u201cThis Tweet violated the Twitter Rules.\u201d\n\nThe federal government, however, kicked against the decision with the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, wondering why Tweeter would object to a submission by the president on national issues but would ignore provocative postings by the leader of the proscribed Independent People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu on its site.\n\nThe minister told journalist at the end of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting at the State House, Abuja that Twitter\u2019s mission in Nigeria is suspect.\n\nHe wondered if Twitter has ever deleted offensive tweets by Kanu.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe mission of Twitter in Nigeria is very suspect. Has Twitter deleted the violent tweets that Nnamdi Kanu has been sending? Has it? The same Twitter during the ENDSARS protests promoted tweets trying to raise funds for the ENDSARS protesters. It was the first to close the account of former President of US, Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cAnd you see, when people were burning police stations and killing policemen in Nigeria during ENDSARS, for Twitter, it was about the right to protest. But when a similar thing happened at the Capitol, it became insurrection. You see, we are not going to be fooled by anybody. We have a country to rule and we will do so to the best of our ability. Twitter mission in Nigeria citing those two examples is very suspect. What is their agenda?\n\n\u201cHow does Mr. President\u2019s speech that anybody who is destroying infrastructure, who is destroying police stations, who is destroying INEC offices should be ready for the consequences; is that inciting violence?\u201d\n\nWhile accepting the fact that Twitter may have its own rules, Mohammed said that should not stop Buhari from expressing his views against a banned organisation like IPOB inciting people to commit arson and the likes in the South-east.\n\nHe stated: \u201cTwitter may have its own rules, it\u2019s not the universal rule. If Mr. President, anywhere in the world feels very bad and concerned about a situation, he is free to express such views. Now, we should stop comparing apples with oranges. If an organisation is proscribed, it is different from any other which is not proscribed. Two, any organisation that gives directives to its members to attack police stations, to kill policemen, to attack correctional centres, to kill warders, and you are now saying that Mr. President does not have the right to express his dismay and anger about that? We are the one guilty of double standards.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see anywhere in the world where an organisation \u2013 a person will stay somewhere outside Nigeria, and will direct his members to attack the symbols of authority, the police, the military, especially when that organisation has been proscribed. By whatever name, you can\u2019t justify giving orders to kill policemen or to kill anybody you do not agree with.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m saying that you cannot compare anybody with Kanu who boldly say, go and kill policemen.\n\nI think sometimes\u2026policemen are brothers, they are our uncle, they are children. We kill them their wives become widows, their children become orphans. And what is the offence of these policemen \u2013 because they are working to keep the country one. What about soldiers that are putting down their lives so that you and I can sleep? It is not acceptable anywhere in the world for anybody, anywhere, to stay in the comfort of wherever he is and now give directives to go and kill soldiers, go and kill policemen.\u201d\n\nAsked why Sheikh Ahmed Gumi whose comments were perceived as justifying Boko Haram actions has not been arrested, Mohammed asked who appointed Gumi as the go-between between government and Boko Haram.\n\n\u201cWho appointed Gumi middleman between government and Boko Haram? Listen, for me, unless you come and tell me this what Gumi said that is inciting that you are comparing to Kanu\u2026 anyway what we\u2019re discussing is different. We\u2019re discussing Twitter. If you want to ask any question about Gumi or any other person, go ahead but please, be objective,\u201d he added.\n\nHe also said if government had resolved to pick up all those critical of the Buhari administration, the detention centres would have been full by now.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere are so many people who have been spewing hate against Mr. President, against this governments. So if you want to comment, be fair; don\u2019t take a position, which is not objective. If we were to pick up everybody today who had been abusing this administration, the detention centres will be filled up and you will be the first person also to talk about lack of tolerance, lack of rule of law.\u201d\n\nReacting to Buhari\u2019s tweet, human rights activist, Aisha Yesufu, described as \u201cinsensitive\u201d the civil war analogy by the president.\n\nYesufu, in a video statement yesterday, said: \u201cMy name is Aisha Somtochukwu Yesufu. I am Igbo, a threat to the Igbo people is a threat to me. Any attack on the Igbo people is an attack on me. Any malignment of the Igbo people is a malignment to me. We are all Nigerians and no Nigerian is more Nigerian than the others.\n\n\u201cThe government must ensure that it deploys its resources and its apparatus equally to every section of this country.\n\n\u201cI totally condemn the tweet from the president where the president is threatening the Igbo people. He is threatening them with what happened in 1967. What happened in 1967 was a genocide; a crime against humanity and it must never ever be allowed to happen again.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cFor a president to come out today and use 1967 as a yardstick to threaten people with what happened then, with the 30 months of gruesomeness, with the 30 months of heinousness, with the 30 months of atrocities that were meted out on human beings, on fellow brothers and sisters, on children in this country, is inhumane, it is insensitive, it is callous, and it is unspeakable.\u201d\n\nFormer Ekiti State Governor, Mr. Ayodele Fayose, however, called on Twitter to hold presidential spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu and Mohammed accountable for the controversial \u2018civil war\u2019 post.\n\nReacting in a string of tweets, Fayose wrote: \u201cA president who cannot address his own people in time of crisis can certainly not be the one tweeting on the crisis. Twitter should rather hold Garba Shehu, Lai Mohammed and co (others) accountable.\n\n\u201cIt is obvious that those using the president\u2019s powers for him do not know when and where to stop their power. Regrettably, Twitter may not know that Buhari is not the one operating the handle.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Ezeife: South-east Violence, Plot to Undermine Clamour for Igbo Presidency",
          "text": "\u2022Editors express concern over growing insecurity\n\nBy Alex Enumah\n\nA former Governor of Anambra State, Chief Chukwuemeka Ezeife, yesterday accused sponsors of the ongoing violence in the South-east of plotting to forestall elections in 2023 with the sole aim of thwarting the clamour by the zone to produce the next president.\n\nEzeife, while featuring on ARISE NEWS CHANNEL, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers, however, exonerated members of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and the Eastern Security Network (ESN) from the recent killings of police personnel and the torching of public institutions in the zone.\n\nHe spoke hours after the Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE) expressed concern over the growing insecurity in the country and advised government at all levels to activate their structures in tackling the challenges.\n\nEzeife described the insurrection in the South-east as an attempt to provoke indigenes of the South-east.\n\nHe added that their findings showed that those behind the killings and destruction of public institutions such as offices of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) are not Igbo.\n\nHe said: \u201cWho are the people burning INEC\u2019s offices, who are killing the police? There is the impression that some people even within the government are guilty of organising such threat and blaming it on IPOB and ESN.\n\n\u201cNow we know that more than 80 per cent of the people caught by the CCTV are not from the South-east.\n\nWas it a design to blame it on IPOB and ESN? We are learning more now that there is a design to provoke the East.\u201d\n\nHe, however, could not identify the sponsors but suspected that some of them might be in government going by some of the findings by South-east leaders.\n\nHe stated that a South-east governor who had earlier accused IPOB and ESN of executing the attacks had since exonerated the secessionist group.\n\nHe also expressed reservation that the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, could hold the groups responsible for the violence without evidence.\n\nHe said: \u201cIPOB does not have tradition of shedding blood or burning down things. It is not Igbo tradition to shoot police, burn down houses. During the ENDSARS protests, people attributed what was happening in Lagos to some Igbo people and it was later discovered to be untrue.\n\n\u201cThose who are sponsoring this destruction don\u2019t want election; they don\u2019t want president from South-east zone and would even want to scatter the Anambra election and go for emergency situation and appoint someone.\n\n\u201cNigeria should understand what is going on and not jump into conclusion.\u201d\n\nWhile not justifying the activities of IPOB and its leader, Ezeife stated that the federal government by its alleged continued marginalisation of the South-east, is pushing Igbo out of Nigeria.\n\nHe listed some of the injustices the youths are fighting to include the absence of tangible federal government projects in the area as well as the alleged disregard for the principle of federal character in appointments, to the detriment of the Igbo.\n\n\u201cThe federal government has been working hard pushing the Igbo out of Nigeria. The young men are reacting to what is coming from the federal government. Whether it is project location, we don\u2019t have any in Igboland; whether it is appointment, you don\u2019t find it but if it is retirement, we\u2019re dominant.\u201d\n\nEzeife also alleged that many Igbo businesses are being crippled by the government.\n\nHe dismissed insinuation that the Igbo cannot speak with one voice when it comes to presenting a candidate for the 2023 presidential election.\n\nAccording to him, the South-east has many individuals that can govern the country and the zone is currently working hard to win the support of other zones to clinch the presidency in 2023.\n\nOn the ongoing public hearing to review the constitution, the former governor urged legislators to stop wasting their time and public resources because what the people need now is a new constitution.\n\nEditors Express Concern over Growing Insecurity\n\nMeanwhile, the NGE has expressed concern over the growing insecurity in the country and advised government at all levels to activate their structures in tackling the challenges.\n\nIt also called for an enabling political and economic environment for the media to discharge their constitutional and social responsibilities.\n\nIt added that creating a conducive environment for the media to thrive would guarantee and sustain democratic space, sustainable development and provide incentives for social/democratic change.\n\nThe guild, in a communiqu\u00e9 issued and signed by its President, Mr. Mustapha Isah, and General Secretary, Mr. Iyobosa Uwugiaren, at the end of its 2021 Biennial Convention in Kano, called on the federal government to, as a matter of urgency, expunge, repeal or amend as may be appropriate, all existing obnoxious media laws that are inimical to press freedom.\n\nIt also urged editors and journalists to continue to subscribe to and uphold the journalism code of ethics \u2013 as developed by the Nigerian Press Organisation (NPO).\n\n\u2018\u2019The guild observes the need for the Nigerian mass media to exercise their freedom to operate freely with a sense of responsibility. And considering the spikes in the levels of insecurity across the length and breadth of the country, it is high time for the media to set the agenda and lead the country\u2019s drive to sustaining national cohesion.\n\n\u2018\u2019While observing Nigeria\u2019s consistent deterioration in the Global Press Freedom Index since 2005, the guild notes that it is worrisome that the slide is happening in a democracy, whereby the guild has had cause in recent times to issue three press statements on the threats of closure and imposition of fines on some broadcast stations by the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC),\u201d the communiqu\u00e9 added.\n\nThe guild noted that the huge disruption the COVID-19 pandemic has created globally, saying that the disruption has also had negative effects on the Nigerian media industry, leading to drop in revenues.\n\n\u2018\u2019For the media to respond to these challenges creatively, there is urgent need for the media managers to evolve diversification, designing of a dynamic management system, producing innovative contents, restructuring their production technologies and adapting new funding and business models.\n\n\u2018\u2019Considering that the role of information dissemination by the mass media is an essential public and social service, the guild calls on government to consider mitigating the media\u2019s operational costs and economic challenges by floating a national media subsidy regime, including tax holidays and waivers, lifting of licence fees for the broadcast media and offsetting debts of government media agencies in the country,\u2019\u2019 the guild stated.\n\nThe guild\u2019s national convention, which attracted over 300 editors and media owners across the country, also expressed concern over the prevalence and massive elevation of fake news, disinformation and propaganda due to the mishandlings of the social media platforms by negative persons.\n\nThe guild harped on the need for Nigeria\u2019s media publics, particularly the youth whom the media must carry along, to use, decipher and rely on the conventional media for reliable and credible information in taking their decisions.\n\nThe safety of journalists also attracted the attention of the editors, as they called on both the public and the private media operators to devise measures inclusive of guaranteed welfare and insurance schemes for the safety and security of journalists working for them.\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 added: \u2018\u2019Against the backdrop of the assailing new media trends, the guild highlights the essence of training and retraining of the Nigerian journalists to update their knowledge, skills and expertise of the profession \u2013 with a view to attaining the needed proficiency and competencies that are required to overcome the new media drifts that dragging journalism profession.\u2019\u2019\n\nWhile commending Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje of Kano State for keeping the state safe even in the midst of the prevailing insecurity in some parts of the country, the editors also appreciated the state government\u2019s phenomenal drive of infrastructure development; as well as the state government\u2019s determination to turn Kano into a modern city.\n\nThe guild thanked Ganduje and members of the state Executive Council for providing the enabling environment for the national convention to hold.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The Nigerian Government has suspended, indefinitely, the operations of the microblogging and social networking service, Twitter, in Nigeria.\n\nMinister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, announced the suspension in a statement signed by his Special Assistant Segun Adeyemi citing the \u201cpersistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence\u201d.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari\n\nThe Minister said the Federal Government has also directed the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to immediately commence the process of licensing all OTT and social media operations in Nigeria.\n\nThe development comes after Twitter deleted President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tweet where he threatened to treat Nigerians \u201cmisbehaving\u201d in \u201cthe language they understand\u201d.\n\nBuhari had in a tweet on Tuesday stated that his government will get \u201charder\u201d on those hell-bent on destroying the country.\n\nHe said those wanting to destroy his government will receive the shock of their lives as his administration will do everything possible to ensure they fail.\n\nThe president said the sponsors and orchestrators of insecurity in the country are doing so because they want his administration to fail.\n\nHis tweet had read, \u201dI receive daily security reports on the attacks on critical national infrastructure, and it is very clear that those behind them want this administration to fail. Whoever wants the destruction of the system will soon have the shock of their lives. We\u2019ve given them enough time.\n\n\u201cI received a briefing today from the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), on the series of attacks on their facilities nationwide. These attacks are totally unacceptable, and we will not allow those behind them to achieve their evil objectives.\n\n\"I receive daily security reports on the attacks on critical national infrastructure, and it is very clear that those behind them want this administration to fail. Whoever wants the destruction of the system will soon have the shock of their lives. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve given them enough time.\n\n\u201cI have assured INEC that we will make available to them everything they need to operate efficiently, so that no one will say we don\u2019t want to go, or that we want a third term. There will be no excuse for failure. We will meet all of INEC\u2019s demands.\n\n\u201cIn the area of security, we have changed the Service Chiefs and the Inspector-General, and we are demanding that they rise fully to the challenges confronting us. There must be zero tolerance for all those bent on destroying our country by promoting crime and insurrection!\n\n\u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian Civil War. Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe President's Twitter account was reported by Nigerians who understood the last part of the thread as threats against the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and its military wing, the Eastern Security Network (ESN).\n\nMany reminded Buhari of the consequences of the Nigerian Civil War which lasted from 1967 to 1970, stating that such must not be repeated.\n\nOver 3 million Nigerians, mostly Igbo people, died during the war.

          "text": "The Nigerian Government has suspended, indefinitely, the operations of the microblogging and social networking service, Twitter, in Nigeria.\n\nMinister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, announced the suspension in a statement signed by his Special Assistant Segun Adeyemi citing the \u201cpersistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence\u201d.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari\n\nThe Minister said the Federal Government has also directed the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to immediately commence the process of licensing all OTT and social media operations in Nigeria.\n\nThe development comes after Twitter deleted President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tweet where he threatened to treat Nigerians \u201cmisbehaving\u201d in \u201cthe language they understand\u201d.\n\nBuhari had in a tweet on Tuesday stated that his government will get \u201charder\u201d on those hell-bent on destroying the country.\n\nHe said those wanting to destroy his government will receive the shock of their lives as his administration will do everything possible to ensure they fail.\n\nThe president said the sponsors and orchestrators of insecurity in the country are doing so because they want his administration to fail.\n\nHis tweet had read, \u201dI receive daily security reports on the attacks on critical national infrastructure, and it is very clear that those behind them want this administration to fail. Whoever wants the destruction of the system will soon have the shock of their lives. We\u2019ve given them enough time.\n\n\u201cI received a briefing today from the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), on the series of attacks on their facilities nationwide. These attacks are totally unacceptable, and we will not allow those behind them to achieve their evil objectives.\n\n\"I receive daily security reports on the attacks on critical national infrastructure, and it is very clear that those behind them want this administration to fail. Whoever wants the destruction of the system will soon have the shock of their lives. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve given them enough time.\n\n\u201cI have assured INEC that we will make available to them everything they need to operate efficiently, so that no one will say we don\u2019t want to go, or that we want a third term. There will be no excuse for failure. We will meet all of INEC\u2019s demands.\n\n\u201cIn the area of security, we have changed the Service Chiefs and the Inspector-General, and we are demanding that they rise fully to the challenges confronting us. There must be zero tolerance for all those bent on destroying our country by promoting crime and insurrection!\n\n\u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian Civil War. Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe President's Twitter account was reported by Nigerians who understood the last part of the thread as threats against the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and its military wing, the Eastern Security Network (ESN).\n\nMany reminded Buhari of the consequences of the Nigerian Civil War which lasted from 1967 to 1970, stating that such must not be repeated.\n\nOver 3 million Nigerians, mostly Igbo people, died during the war. Millions of people, especially children also starved to death.\n\nSocial media users likened President\u2019s statement to that of the former United States President Donald Trump which earned the latter a permanent suspension.\n\nTrump's Twitter account was \"permanently suspended... due to the risk of further incitement of violence,\" Twitter had said.\n\nTwitter said the decision was made \"after close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account\".\n\nTrump was locked out of his account for 12 hours after he called the people who stormed the US Capitol \"patriots\".\n\nHundreds of his supporters entered the complex as the US Congress attempted to certify Joe Biden's victory in the presidential election.

          "text": "The suspended Senior Special Assistant to the Ogun State Governor Dapo Abiodun, Mr Abidemi Rufai, caught in $350,000 wire fraud, may forfeit his bail as the United State authorities said he would escape to Nigeria if granted bail and his extradition would be difficult.\n\nThe Acting US Attorney, Tessa Gorma, stated this while asking a district judge to reverse a bail earlier granted to Rufai by a magistrate judge.\n\nThe authorities argued that Rufai presents an extreme risk of flight and \u201cif he does escape to Nigeria, extradition will be extraordinarily difficult or impossible because of his ties to the Nigerian government.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is well known that extradition from Nigeria to the United States is difficult under the best of circumstances. That will be exacerbated in this case because of the strong political connections that earned Rufai a governmental appointment,\u201d Gorma said.\n\nDespite his alleged involvement in $350,000 fraud, Rufai said through his lawyer that he was a man of integrity.\n\nResponding to the government\u2019s appeal on why he should be released on bail, his lawyer, Lance Hester, told the court in Tacoma that his client has a good character, which facilitated his appointment as governor\u2019s aide.\n\nThe reply was filed on June 1, 2021.

As the government concedes, Mr. Rufai holds a distinguished Governmental position in his home.\n\n\u201cIt goes without saying that only an individual of high moral character and integrity could achieve such a distinguished governmental appointment,\u201d Hester argued for his client in a court filing obtained by Premium Times on Thursday.\n\nSaharaReporters had on May 18 reported that Rufai faces up to 30 years in prison if he is convicted of wire fraud.\n\nAccording to the United States Department of Justice, wire fraud is punishable by up to 30 years in prison regarding benefits paid in connection with a presidentially declared disaster or emergency, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. See Also CRIME Suspended Governor Abiodun's Aide Faces 30 Years In United States Jail Over $350,000 Fraud\n\nRufai, who served as the Deputy Director-General of the Dapo Abiodun Campaign Organisation in the last governorship election in the state, was arrested on Friday at the JFK Airport in New York, the United States of America, on a criminal complaint of wire fraud for his scheme to steal over $350,000 in unemployment benefits from the Washington State Employment Security Department, the acting US Attorney, Tessa M. Gorman, announced.\n\nRufai, aka Sandy Tang, 42, of Lekki, Lagos, made his initial appearance in court on Saturday, May 15, 2021, in New York.\n\n\"Since the first fraud reports to our office in April 2020, we have worked diligently with a federal law enforcement team to track down the criminals who stole funds designated for pandemic relief. This is the first, but will not be the last, significant arrest in our ongoing investigation of the ESD fraud,\" Gorman had said.\n\nThe criminal complaint alleges that Rufai used the stolen identities of more than 100 Washington residents to file fraudulent claims with the ESD for pandemic-related unemployment benefits.\n\nHe was alleged to have also filed fraudulent unemployment claims with Hawaii, Wyoming, Massachusetts, Montana, New York and Pennsylvania. He used variations of a single email address in a manner intended to evade automatic detection by fraud systems.\n\nUsing this practice, Rufai allegedly made it appear that each claim was connected with a different email account.\n\nThe US Department of Justice stated on its website that Rufai caused the fraud proceeds to be paid out to online payment accounts such as 'Green Dot' accounts or wired to bank accounts controlled by 'money mules'. Some of the proceeds were then mailed to the Jamaica, New York address of Rufai's relative. See Also Corruption $350,000 Fraud: Suspended Governor Abiodun's Aide, Rufai To Remain In Detention Indefinitely, US Court Rules\n\nLaw enforcement determined that more than $288,000 was deposited into an American bank account controlled by Rufai between March and August 2020.\n\n\"Greed is a powerful motivator. Unfortunately, the greed alleged to this defendant affects all taxpayers,\" said Donald Voiret, Special Agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigations in Seattle.\n\n\"The FBI and our partners will not stand idly by while individuals attempt to defraud programmes meant to assist American workers and families suffering the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic,\" he added.\n\nOgun State governor, in his reaction, described the arrest as disturbing news and ordered the immediate suspension of Rufai.",

          "text": "On Friday, the federal government announced the suspension of Twitter, the microblogging and social network service, in Nigeria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLai Mohammed, the minister of information, who announced the \u201cindefinite\u201d suspension, cited persistent use of the platform for activities capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\n\nTwitter\u2019s suspension comes days after a post by President Muhammadu Buhari on the 1967 civil war was deleted by the microblogging platform.\n\nIn a series of posts on Twitter on Tuesday, the president had condemned the attacks on government facilities in the country, and citing a reference to the civil war experience, threatened to treat those \u201cbent on destroying\u201d Nigeria \u201cthrough insurrection\u201d in \u201ca language they understand\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDefending Buhari\u2019s post, the information minister had condemned the deletion of the president\u2019s post and accused Twitter of \u201cdouble standard\u201d.\n\nMohammed had also added that the mission of the social networking service as it concerns Nigeria is \u201csuspect\u201d.\n\nWith this ban, Nigeria joins the list of countries such as China, Iran, North Korea that have restricted the use of the platform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIMPACT ON VARIOUS ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES\n\nThe ripple effect of the ban will impact economic activities some of which are sources of income to millions of young Nigerians.\n\nThe suspension will affect online news platforms that leverage Twitter to extend their reach and bring news closer to the people.\n\nFor telecos, the suspension will also mean a dip in data revenue as Twitter remains one of the most popular social media platforms in Nigeria. Telecos also resolve several of their customer complaints through their social media handles and also intimate them on latest promotions will have to deploy another means to achieve this going forward.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe popularity of the social media platform has seen a growing number of young Nigerian influencers who are often recruited by public relations companies to promote brands. The suspension of Twitter will halt their sources of income and also affect the reach of these brands.\n\nFintech companies that do not have a brick and mortal branches use Twitter to intimate customers on their products offerings and promotions, all these will also take a hit and slowdown government\u2019s financial inclusion drive.\n\nFor investment platforms such as Piggyvest, Flutterwave among others, this latest development will mean a change in their strategy of reaching out to their customers online.\n\nAll these will further slowdown economic activities when Nigerians are battling with the triple-whammy impact of sluggish growth, high unemployment rate, and rising inflation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ban on Twitter is also coming at a time when the nation\u2019s economy is just crawling from the pandemic-induced economic contraction. The last first-quarter gross domestic product report released by the National Bureau of Statistics indicated that the nation\u2019s economy grew 0.51 percent.\n\nFemi Adeoti, a financial analyst, noted that the decision to place a ban on Twitter was ill-conceived.\n\n\u201cBut most importantly, it\u2019s sending a wrong signal to foreign investors and development institutions that the government in Nigeria is still suppressing free speech even after years of its democracy.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time government policies and decisions have impacted negatively the nation\u2019s economic growth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn December 2020, Isa Pantami, minister of communications and digital economy, had directed the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) to audit the subscriber registration database.\n\nThe directive instructed mobile network operators to suspend the sale, registration, and activation of new SIM Cards until the completion of the audit exercise.\n\nThe controversial policy denied new entrants into the country access to purchase mobile lines while existing users who want to retrieve their lost lines were not allowed access.\n\nThe NCC recently announced an extension of the NIN and SIM integration exercise till June 30.\n\nThe knock-on effect of the policy was seen in the Q1 growth for the sector. The information and communication sector, one of the most resilient sectors, recorded a growth rate of 6.47 percent \u2014 first single-digit growth since the first quarter (Q1) 2020. The performance in the sector was a result of a 7.69 percent sluggish growth in the telecommunications sub-sector \u2014 single-digit growth since Q1 2020 \u2014 when it recorded 9.71 percent growth.\n\nAccording to NCC, subscribers in Nigeria\u2019s telecoms market declined by over 12 million during the period.",

          "text": "Twitter has reacted to the indefinite suspension of the social media site by the Nigerian government, expressing concern.\n\nA statement by a Twitter spokesperson to TechCabal said:\n\n\u201cThe announcement made by the Nigerian Government that they have suspended Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria is deeply concerning. We\u2019re investigating and will provide updates when we know more.\u201d\n\nWhile Twitter does not have physical offices in Nigeria, the platform is freely available in the country and has up to 2 million users, according to some estimates. The government\u2019s suspension as announced by Lai Mohammed, the Minister for Information and Culture, has been interpreted as a potential directive to Internet Service Providers to cut off users\u2019 access to the social media platform\n\nAs we have reported, the suspension is a culmination of a three-day drama. It started when Twitter deleted a tweet by President Muhammadu Buhari for violating its rules.\n\nA few hours after Twitter\u2019s action, Mohammed, the Information Minister, held a press conference in which he denounced the US social media company for having a suspicious agenda in Nigeria. He accused Twitter of enabling violence during #EndSARS protests in October 2020.\n\nIn the end, he justified his suspension of Twitter on the grounds of \u201cpersistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\u201d\n\nThe suspension brings Twitter squarely into the heat of the debate about the intersection of democracy and internet freedom in Africa.\n\nWhen they announced that Ghana will be the location of their first Africa office, Twitter said it was because Ghana is \u201ca champion for democracy, a supporter of free speech, online freedom, and the Open Internet, of which Twitter is also an advocate.\u201d\n\nTwitter remains available in Nigeria at the time of publishing this \u2013 two and half hours after the announcement was posted on the Information Ministry\u2019s verified Twitter account. It remains to be seen when the suspension takes effect and what actions Twitter takes.",

          "text": "\u201cWhat does it take to create Unicorns in Africa?\u201d\n\nIn 2017, the journey started with this question. Back then, eCommerce giant Jumia, South Africa\u2019s Promasidor Holdings and Cell C were the only Unicorns from Africa.\n\nToday, the story is different, there are five unicorns in Africa.\n\nCoined in 2013 by venture capitalist Aileen Lee, a unicorn is any private startup company started after 2003 that is valued at more than $1 billion. Lee chose the magic valuation number of $1 billion because it suggests that a company has either disrupted the market or created a new market.\n\nMeanwhile, the increase in the number of unicorns in Africa might seem like progress. It\u2019s only a small fraction of the number of unicorns in the world and in other countries.\n\nAccording to CBInsights, as of May 2021, there were more than 600 unicorns around the world. India has about 100 unicorns, China has 162 unicorns while the US has almost 300 unicorns.\n\nMost unicorns come from outside the African continent because the startup scene in Africa is still growing.\n\nTo accelerate this growth, in 2017, Unicorn Group, a pan-African investment company, set out to create a systematic approach to discover and produce unicorns on the continent. The unicorn team is led by Dr Akintoye Akindele with support from members like Dr Wura Abiola, Kola Abiola, Olatutu Sholeye, Yomi Akapo, Prof Cesar Baena, Mark White, Akudo Nweke, Kunle Soriyan and Dr Ponmile Osibo. The team travelled around the world studying different tech ecosystems to learn about what makes a unicorn and to create a playbook for the African tech ecosystem.\n\nThe wife of the Lagos state governor, Joke Sanwo-Olu at the event\n\nOn the 2nd of June, 2021 Unicorn Group held an event for the official launch of its Lagos campus. A number of distinguished dignitaries were present.\n\nTimipre Sylva Minister of State for Petroleum Resources; Lagos state governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu represented by his wife Joke Sanwo-Olu; Engr Simbi Wabote Exec. sec. Nigerian Content Development monitoring board and Mr Osh Agabi CEO Koniku. The vice-chancellors of Lagos State University and Obafemi Awolowo University, Prof. Oluwatoyin Ogundipe and Prof Eyitope Ogunbodede, respectively, were also in attendance.\n\nA group picture of the invited dignitaries\n\nUnicorn Group\u2019s ecosystem approach\n\nAt this event, the Unicorn Group shared its multifaceted approach to creating more unicorns in Africa.\n\nThis approach is made up of programs developed for startups and early-stage companies, campuses built across Africa to bridge the gap of inadequate infrastructure, advisers for the startups and partnerships with leading global organisations.\n\nThe five-step program caters to businesses at any stage. The first step is the Idea Lab, a program targeted at people with business ideas. The Idea Lab will run for a maximum of six months.\n\nThe Hub program is the second step, it\u2019s for businesses with a viable product. It\u2019ll run for a maximum of 12 months.\n\nThe third step is the incubator program for businesses with existing commercial products with market acceptance. It\u2019ll run for a maximum duration of two years.\n\nThe fourth and fifth programs are the Accelerator and the growth & scale program which are designed for established and profitable businesses.\n\nThe programs would run concurrently. Intentionally, its Lagos campus which is housed in a five story building is built in such a way that each floor caters for each step of the program.\n\nDr Akintoye Akindele, Chairman of Unicorn Group\n\nUnicorn Group has campuses in Lagos, Nairobi, Johannesburg and Accra. A fifth campus in Marrakesh is slated to open in 2022.\n\nWhat sets the Unicorn Group\u2019s approach apart from others? Ponmile Osibo, Chief investor relations officer told TechCabal, that for the Unicorn Group, it\u2019s beyond investing just money.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible to give someone money and it disappears. We\u2019ve come to understand that companies need access to a wide range of support.\u201d\n\n\u201cBack then in 2017, there was no path to becoming a unicorn. There are different types of business models. There are businesses that should monetize from the get go and those who should gain traction first before monetization. There\u2019s no African playbook for this.\u201d\n\nFor any investment company, the end goal is to get a good return on investment (ROI). The investment in creating five campuses amongst other things is an enormous upfront provision of capital. I asked Osibo how they plan to recoup its investment.\n\n\u201cAt some stages, we collect equity in exchange for the capital and support we give these companies but for us, it\u2019s even bigger than that,\u201d He said.\n\nThe bigger picture for the Unicorn Group is the impact it\u2019ll have on the economy. He said, \u201cThink about it, we\u2019ve found out that the average small business hires five people. If we\u2019re able to empower about 200,000 businesses that\u2019s a minimum of 1 million additional jobs that won\u2019t have existed. Think of the ripple effect on the economy.\u201d",

          "title": "5 Reasons Why You Should Consider A Loan from Page Financials",
          "text": "Personal loans are good for a variety of purposes\u2014from consolidating debt to solving a myriad of pressing issues. They are personal, which means your reasons are yours.\n\nDo you remember the first time you needed more money than you had? Borrowing money then was not as easy as it is now.\n\nYou probably would have run to family members or friends which usually meant nothing was certain, or apply for a bank loan, which was a very tedious process, hard to get \u2013 especially if you do not have an enviable collateral in choice locations, or know someone in top management position in the banks to stand as a guarantor.\n\nThe situation is completely different now. There are financial services providers like Page Financials who have changed the game entirely, they have not only disrupted the borrowing and lending ecosystem but have also shaped how even the banks respond to providing these services today.\n\nWith the intervention of Page Financials, a leading financial services provider, anybody with a verifiable and consistent income, that meets a few other criteria \u2013 like having a good credit history \u2013 can now easily get a personal loan from the comfort of their home.\n\nIf you are still thinking about whether or not to consider a personal loan, we have highlighted 5 reasons why customers usually resort to getting a personal loan.\n\nCash Emergencies\n\nIf you need money right away to cover bills, an emergency cost or something else that needs immediate attention, you can take out a personal loan. Page Financials provide online applications that allow you to complete application conveniently in minutes.\n\nYou could receive funding immediately as well, depending on your past credit history and the information you have provided. You can use a personal loan to cover emergencies like:\n\nPaying past-due home payments and utilities\n\nMedical bills\n\nFuneral expenses\n\nAn unexpected car repair or purchase\n\nWhat you can do with a personal loan is limitless, and as established earlier, it is personal to you.\n\nDebt Consolidation\n\nOne of the popular reasons to get a personal loan from Page is for debt consolidation.\n\nIf you have existing facilities with different lenders, you\u2019d agree that managing multiple loans from several lenders can prove to be challenging. Missing on payments can result in negatively impacting your credit score. Availing a personal loan in such a situation can save you from financial distress.\n\nAll you require to do is approach Page and state that you have some other loans elsewhere and would like to consolidate different payments into one debt with the help of a loan. This method offers several benefits that include enjoying an overall lower rate of interest which can help in reducing the timeframe required to pay-off your loan.\n\nRent, Home Improvement and Repairs\n\nWhether you want to renew your rent or looking to move to a more befitting neighborhood, or simply looking to upgrade your apartment and fix some repairs, a personal loan is a great way to cover the costs conveniently.\n\nThe urgencies that come with meeting these needs are usually unprecedented which is why a personal loan may be your surest way to meet up with the deadline.\n\nFailure to meet up with rent on time for example will lead to series of embarrassments from your landlord, and\u2026you don\u2019t what that. In the same vein, if you see a new apartment that you love and fail to make payment on time, the house goes to someone else that has cash at hand.\n\nThis is why speed and convenience are of essence when it comes to personal loans and part of the USPs at Page Financials, you can access a loan and get support anytime whether it\u2019s 2 am or 2 pm so you don\u2019t have to miss any opportunity again.\n\nVehicle Financing\n\nAuto loans are available if you\u2019re looking to buy or lease a car, but personal loans are also available to finance any need you may have \u2013 including a vehicle financing.\n\nAnother great reason why you should consider a personal loan rather than going for an Auto loans are secured loans and use your vehicle as collateral. If you\u2019re worried about missing payments and your car getting repossessed, a personal loan might be a better option for you.\n\nStarting/Expanding Your Business\n\nSide hustles are very popular these days, and are a great way to test the entrepreneurial waters. If you have one, or you are thinking of starting one, you are going to need some funds to run or expand it.\n\nChanneling extra funds into your side hustle can help you take it to the next level. But if you don\u2019t have the money you need now, taking out a personal loan for your side business may help.\n\nGetting an outright business loan would normally require some sort of security or collateral \u2013 which most startups don\u2019t have, which is why taking a personal loan as a salary earner \u2013 to fund your side business, would be a smart thing to do.\n\nPersonal loans may be well-suited for side hustles because they are often smaller than typical business loans and don\u2019t require a high level of collateral or profitability. All you need is a proven source of income \u2014 and that can come from your current day job.\n\nWhat To Consider When Considering A Personal Loan\n\nApplying for a Page Loan is super easy, everything happens online and you don\u2019t need to visit their office.\n\nTo begin the application, click here to visit the website as a private sector employee or click here to visit the application page for public sector employee.\n\nThe application process is in stages, at each stage, you\u2019ll supply relevant information that helps make a decision to approve your loan.\n\n(See requirements for each category below)\n\nYou can upload all the documents online while filling the form so you do not have to worry about carrying files from one office(er) to another.\n\nThe first stage you will encounter while filling the application form is the BVN and IPPIS verification phase.

Consider avoiding a personal loan if:\n\nYou can\u2019t afford it. Borrowing money in the short term is one thing, but remember you\u2019ll still need to pay it back. If you can\u2019t afford monthly payments for your new personal loan, consider skipping it.\n\nBorrowing money in the short term is one thing, but remember you\u2019ll still need to pay it back. If you can\u2019t afford monthly payments for your new personal loan, consider skipping it. You don\u2019t need it. If you\u2019re taking out a personal loan to cover the cost of something you don\u2019t need in the immediate future, think about putting it off until you have more cash on hand.\n\nThe Page customer service is available 24/7 to answer any questions you may have.

          "title": "Green Africa attempts \u2018Southwest effect\u2019 on air travel in Nigeria",
          "text": "Its first flight is days away yet Green Africa, the Lagos-based startup budget airline, is edging closer to disrupting the Nigerian airspace forever. It has announced its entrance with cheaper airfares for seven routes including Lagos to Abuja, a strategy that looks well suited to a large country where average incomes are low and rising insecurity is increasingly discouraging road travel.\n\nGreen Africa\u2019s strategy is not new, at least not on the global scene. It has a similar playbook to the world\u2019s largest low-cost carrier, Southwest Airlines. Southwest, despite being a low-cost carrier has been able to stay profitable through many decades. It even has an economic term named after it popularly called \u201cthe Southwest effect\u201d.\n\nSouthwest started out with an idea to make air travel accessible for all. While most carriers in the U.S. focused on wealthy travelers, it set out to disrupt the market by giving more people the opportunity to travel by air at a low cost.\n\nSouthwest Airlines focused on four main things: a low-cost structure that stayed low due to fast growth, happy employees who liked their jobs and translated that to customers, being future-minded, and differentiated.\n\nGreen Africa, just like Southwest, is coming into the Nigerian aviation sector with a low-cost structure with fares between N16,500 and N23,000, which is about a 50 to 70 percent slash in average fares charged by other airlines. Although, there have been questions as to whether the prices will remain low.\n\nRead Also: Green Africa completes acceptance of 3 ATR 72-600s in preparation for deployment\n\n\u201cI would not say the price they have started with will be permanent, it is an introductory offer but you can be sure that of you pick the first three airline in the country with the lowest fare in two or three months, Green Africa would be one of them\u201d Olumide Ohunayo, a member of the Aviation Safety Roundtable Initiative (ASRTI) said.\n\n\u201cThey have started with a very low-cost aircraft, they are taking a smaller market that fits the Nigerian market and if they build on that and get good maintenance organisations, continue with the same fleet, get better deals with the manufacturer of such aircraft, the maintenance and cost of operation would go lower, their fare will definitely not increase.\u201d Ohunayo said.\n\nDespite the similarity in low fares, differences such as fleet and routes make Green Africa different from Southwest.\n\nGreen Africa will use ATR72-600S jetliners, a turboprop, while Southwest operates Boeing 737 jet planes. Turboprops are generally more fuel-efficient than jets whose fuel usage is higher.\n\nA BusinessDay analysis shows that for a one-way trip, a jet aircraft\u2019s flight from Lagos to Abuja consumes nothing less than 8,000 litres and at N220/litre, airlines pay about N1.76 million for fuel alone.\n\nA turboprop consumes about 58-100 gallons of fuel per hour compared to a jet aircraft which consumes about 77-239 gallons of fuel every hour, according to SherapReport. This means on average, turboprop\u2019s fuel consumption is about 155 percent lesser than jet aircraft, which helps Green Africa save costs.\n\nEight years ago, Southwest expanded its routes to 14 countries outside the US after it gained more domestic passengers than any US airline. For now, Green Africa will fly to seven domestic destinations from Lagos, including Akure, Ilorin, Abuja, Owerri, Port Harcourt and Enugu.\n\nUnlike full-service carriers, Southwest has all its activities tailored towards low-cost delivery. No meals are served, no seats assigned, or any premium class service.\n\nThe Nigerian market is dominated by full-service carriers; low-cost airlines like Southwest are uncommon. It is this niche Green Africa wants to fill.\n\n\u201cWe are crafting a network plan that will afford customers the opportunity to pursue their economic interest or simply spend more time with family and friends,\u201d Babawande Afolabi, the CEO of Green Africa said during the announcement that the airline was commencing operations.\n\nUnsafe roads make Nigerians take to the air\n\nGreen Africa is offering cheap airfares at a time when Nigerians are afraid to travel by road given the rise in the number of kidnap cases on road trips.\n\nRising insecurity on Nigerian roads showed up in data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) which reported a decline of 23.75 percent in Road Transport GDP in the first quarter of 2021 from the previous quarter.\n\nPR24 Nigeria Limited, a private security agency released a recent travel advisory report to highlight areas that are currently unsafe and no state in Nigeria was classified as safe.\n\nOf the 36 states, 14 were classified as high-risk regions; 3 (Adamawa, Borno and Yobe) were classified as dangerous while 19 were in the medium-risk group.\n\nOwerri and Enugu, two of the routes Green Africa plans to ply, were classified as high-risk regions which means only essential travel should be made to these states. For regions classified as medium risk travel security is advised when traveling to those areas.\n\nFriendly prices for infrequent flyers\n\nNigerians travel a lot; after food, Nigerians spend the most on transportation.\n\nAccording to the 2019 consumption expenditure by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the total household expenditure on food and non-food items was N40 trillion.\n\nMore than half of this was spent on food while 43.3 percent was spent on non-food items. In the non-food category, 6.4 percent was spent on transportation, followed by health, education and services with 6.1 percent, 6 percent and 5.5 percent respectively.\n\nWith the insecurity, air transport has become the preferred travel option for Nigerians, for those who can afford it.\n\nData from the NBS also show that on average, bus journeys within cities have increased 72 percent to N3,861 in April 2021 compared to N2,237 recorded in April 2020.\n\nAirfare cost also averaged N36,409 in April 2021, this is an 18.43 percent increase compared to N30,743 recorded in the same period last year, according to data from the NBS.\n\nTransportation costs are increasing at a time when 40 percent of the population is classified as poor. This means an average of four out of 10 individuals in Nigeria live below $1.90 (N780) per day.\n\nNigeria has the second-highest unemployment rate in the world after Namibia at 33.3 percent. With inflation at 18.12 percent and food inflation is also at 22.7 percent, Nigerians are having a hard time affording food and other basic necessities.\n\nAlthough Green Africa only covers seven domestic destinations for now its promise to charge airfare as low as 16,500, makes air travel attractive for more Nigerians.",

          "text": "For more than four decades, Nigeria ran its state refineries into the ground, putting the country in the unusual position of being one of the world\u2019s biggest oil exporters and a major gasoline importer.\n\nNow that private investors, most significantly Aliko Dangote \u2014 Africa\u2019s richest man \u2014 are rushing to open their own plants, the state has stepped in again.\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. wants stakes in at least six planned refineries, including Dangote\u2019s monster 650,000 barrels-per-day plant. There\u2019s no explanation of how the cash-strapped state firm will pay. The NNPC says its vision is to boost the domestic refining capacity and to become a net exporter of petroleum products.\n\nNigeria\u2019s partly private fuel-import system had long been riddled with patronage and corruption. Fuel was imported only to be smuggled to neighboring states, and labor unions and civic groups accused the government of making billions of dollars of illegal payments for fuel subsidies. Idled government refineries served that system well.\n\nRead Also: Nigeria can forget million-dollar oil tax revenues as energy transition nears\n\n\u201cThe state\u2019s record at managing its own refineries speaks for itself \u2014 none of them have worked in years,\u201d said Antony Goldman, founder of Promedia Consulting, a political risk advisory firm. \u201cThis is just how a small, but influential network of traders likes it.\u201d\n\nWhile the NNPC may not be looking to control the plants, its influence would still be outsized. It\u2019s likely to be relied upon for crude, and the government is responsible for permits and rules that need to be adhered to for a private business to succeed.\n\nSince stakes weren\u2019t in the draft reform bill sent by the presidency to the National Assembly, the NNPC\u2019s proposal may not come to pass. Still, the move raises the whiff of interference from entrenched \u201clobbies seeking to dilute the reform process,\u201d Goldman says.\n\nWhile the NNPC says it wants to turn Nigeria into a fuel-products exporter, it hasn\u2019t demonstrated the capability to do so. The government may be best advised leaving it to others.",

We are not just talking, we are walking the talk,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the diplomatic ties between the two countries, Mr Gbajabiamila said \u201cIt is important that we sustain and continue these engagements to the benefit of our countries. As we know, the world is a global village now, and everybody feeds off everybody and we are all interdependent one way or the other.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Mr Simard, informed the speaker that the strong bilateral relationship between the two countries had resulted in more than $1 billion trade exchange between the two nations last year, while about $115 million per year in form of humanitarian and development assistance from Canada to Nigeria to several sectors has been given.\n\nMr Simard also expressed Canada\u2019s readiness for more robust engagement with Nigeria, while he inquired about how Nigeria is dealing with issues of women empowerment and inclusion as well as human rights situation and what steps the House was taking towards the issues.\n\nThe diplomat congratulated Nigeria on the adoption of the Violence Against Persons (Prohibition) Act and its domestication by several states.\n\nCanada is one of the top destinations for young Nigerians seeking opportunities outside the country.",

          "title": "NAFDAC, Global Alliance for Trade partner to enhance ease of doing business in Nigeria",
          "text": "The challenges hitherto experienced by Importers and exporters at the nation\u2019s ports and borders may soon become a thing of the past as the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control NAFDAC and the Global Alliance for Trade Facilitation GATF have commenced putting together strategies aimed at achieving standardization and harmonization of documents for export and import trade with a view to simplifying trade formalities and procedures and ultimately ensuring ease of doing business in Nigeria.\n\nThis was disclosed by the Director General of NAFDAC, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye at a virtual meeting with the Global Alliance for Trade Facilitation, Nigeria top officials led by its Project Lead, Mr. Bernard Traynor.\n\nThe project is being powered by the Global Alliance for Trade Facilitation. It\u2019s an organization that is being hosted by the Centre for International Private Enterprise, International Chambers of Commerce, and the World Economic Forum. The project in Nigeria is being implemented by the German Technical Cooperation popularly known as GIZ. The alliance is supported by the governments of US, Canada, Germany, Denmark and government of Australia through their respective agencies.\n\nIn a statement by NAFDAC Resident Media Consultant, Sayo Akintola on Friday, June 4, 2021, Prof Adeyeye who was represented by Dr Abimbola Adegboye, Head of Trade and International Relations at the Agency reiterated measures that NAFDAC has already put in place to ensure that there\u2019s a seamless and more robust operational procedure with both export and import at the borders; and achieve cooperation amongst government agencies at the borders.\n\nShe said NAFDACs focus now is to ensure smooth trade facilitation and regulation, stressing that operations of regulators should not pose an hinderance to trade transactions but facilitate them. \u2019\u2019We are focused on making sure that there are not so many interferences between the users of our facilities and ourselves. So, we try as much as possible to remove both human interferences under the guise of consultants. Because more or less they do not facilitate trade. They tend to distort it\u2019\u2019.\n\nAccording to Prof. Adeyeye, trade should be on basis of safety and quality, noting that, that is the only way trade could be sustained. \u2018\u2019If quality is not put into your product, It gives the country a bad name. They blacklist the company involved. The consumers are the losers because they do not have value for money and their health is compromised\u2019\u2019.\n\nShe noted that these are the issues that the global alliance is trying to address, adding that \u2018\u2019what will make all these visible and possible is to ensure that operations at the borders are seamless.\n\nIf you have perishable items that are to be exported or that are to be allowed into the country and they are delayed unnecessarily, and they are not held at premium conditions such products could go bad, and quality and the integrity of such product would be compromised leading to health issues with the end-users.\n\nAnything that would make trade operations very easy both for inflow and outflow, that would make the whole process of regulation friendly, we are all for it\u2019\u2019.\n\nIn other not to make the whole process too cumbersome for exporters and importers, she stated that for ease of doing business the agency has ensured that all NAFDAC import licenses consisting of approvals, import and export permits have been made in electronic format which can be verified on the NAFDAC single window for trade portal. \u2018\u2019The import of this is that there is no need for any scanned documents when an importer needs to process form \u2018M\u2019.\u2019\u2019\n\nIn his submission, the Project Manager of Global Alliance for Trade Facilitation, Nigeria. Mr. David Okeku, the title for the project is Standardization and Harmonization of Trade formalities and procedures in Nigeria. He disclosed that his organization is being powered by the Centre for International Private Enterprise, International Chambers of Commerce, and the World Economic Forum.\n\nHe further explained that the project in Nigeria is being implemented by the German Technical Cooperation popularly known as GIZ and supported by the governments of US, Canada, Germany, Denmark and government of Australia through their respective agencies.\n\n\u2018\u2019Being an alliance, we also have critical private sector partners,. which we work with: BLM, BSM, DHL, Mascline, UPS and WALMART. On a global scale, we have series of projects which we are currently implementing in Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Zambia, Senegal, Uganda and Latin America, Asia and middle East countries\u2019\u2019.\n\n\u2018\u2019How we work in the alliance is that we partner with multinationals, local businesses because we believe strongly that they will bring in their expertise and also best practices; and also bring in supply-chain companies. We use them as our ambassadors globally and in-country. Local businesses also contribute in form of expertise and resources in kind towards the alliance\u2019\u2019\n\nIn Nigeria, he said the on-going project, Harmonization and Simplifying Trade Formalities and Procedures in Nigeria, seeks to support implementing three articles of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Trade Facilitation Agreement. \u2018\u2019This speaks to article 10.1 which borders around formalities and documentary requirements, article 8 which talks about border agencies cooperation and article 2.2 which talks on consultation.\u2019\u2019\n\nAccording to him, the aim of the project is to simplify, standardize and harmonize export and import formalities and trade procedures in Nigeria, adding that it also aims at reducing the average release time and the associated costs, its documentary requirements and border compliance for exports and imports.\n\nHe further explained that the scope of the project is capacity building for border agencies, e.g., NAFDAC, Customs, SON, Quarantine, and other agencies on the ground. \u2018We are also working clearly on defining export data, documents and processes for the Nigeria Customs service, and other partner agencies.\n\nFor now, he said the project is focusing on the Cargo operations in Lagos, after which \u2018\u2019we would then take the lessons learnt and scale it up to Sea cargo operations subsequently\u2019\u2019.\n\n\u2018\u2019Our partners on the ground are the Nigeria Customs Service, FMITI and border agencies like NAFDAC, SON, NDLEA, FAAN while on the side of the private sector, we have the International Chamber of Commerce, Nigeria, MAN, LCCI, the Association of Nigeria Licensed Customs Agents, the Nigeria Private sector alliance, and the Organization for Women in Internal Trade. Private sector companies like DHL, UPS, MARZK are our partners on the ground\u2019\u2019, he said.\n\nMr. Okeku said his organization had conducted a gender study to identify gender specific bottlenecks on air cargo trade, adding that \u2018\u2019We also worked out or defined mainstreaming approaches and series of targeted actives which are currently being incorporated into our work plan\u2019\u2019.\n\n\u2018\u2019In February we realized a memorandum of understanding with the Nigeria Customs as a lead agency for border operations in Nigeria. We had series of capacity buildings for the customs service with trade facilitation related topics. Last month we had an executive master class for the management of the Nigeria Customs Service on trade facilitation agreement issues in Nigeria\u2019\u2019.\n\nGoing forward, he said a policy steering group at the headquarters level which will be chaired by the Federal Ministry of Trade and Investment and the NCS would be set up with a similar group at the operational level on the ground at the Lagos Airport.\n\nHe said a baseline assessment at the Lagos airport would be conducted and agreed with stakeholders on target model and workplan. For the policy steering group and operational steering group, \u2018\u2019we would need a representation at the headquarters level that would be giving the management direct feedback\u2019\u2019, adding that the policy steering group would cut across all other agencies and private sector key partners. \u2018\u2019It would be in form of high-level group in Abuja for policy and decision-making purposes\u2019\u2019.\n\nFor the operational purposes in Lagos, he said there would be the operational group consisting of the clearing agents on the ground. \u2018\u2019NAFDAC\u2019s representative at the Airport with the key IT division would be representing NAFDAC at the Airport committee level\u2019\u2019.\n\n\u2018\u2019We are having these two approaches for the purpose of fast-tracking our work and for ease of flow of information between the agencies. It\u2019s also a way of enforcing inter-agency cooperation and collaboration both at the high level in Abuja and on the ground in Lagos\u2019\u2019, he said, stressing that \u2018\u2019We strongly believe that this approach will help us in implementing our projects and ultimately help Nigeria achieve the three articles which we are looking at in helping Nigeria implement in Lagos\u2019\u2019.",

It was diffident, conciliatory, even apologetic.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Nobel laureate, after much internal pressure, Buhari eventually visited the scene of slaughter in Benue but rather than threaten to \u201cshock the killers\u201d the President asked them to \u201clearn to live peacefully with your neighbours\u201d.\n\nHe said Buhari only later asked security agents to shoot criminals on sight after much pressure, a move which he said was belated.\n\nSoyinka argued that the world had moved on from the civil war and wondered why Buhari still spoke of it with nostalgia.\n\n\u201cThe evocation of the civil war, where millions of civilians perished, is an unworthy emotive ploy that has run its course. In any case \u2013 and this has been voiced all too often, and loudly \u2013 the nation is already at war, and of a far more potentially devastating dimension than it has ever known.\n\n\u201cEvery single occupant of this nation space called Nigeria has been declared potential casualty, children being pushed to the very battlefront, without a semblance of protective cover.

Safeguarding free, independent media and civic spaces for democratic voices is an important part of Sweden\u2019s #DriveForDemocracy #TwitterBan \u2014 Sweden in Nigeria (@SwedeninNigeria) June 4, 2021\n\nSimilarly, global human rights body, Amnesty International, called on the government to reverse the ban, describing it as an attempt to stifle free speech, which according to it cannot be allowed in a democracy.\n\nIn a statement titled, \u201cAmnesty International condemns the Nigerian government\u2019s suspension of Twitter, Amnesty noted the microblogging site, is a social media widely used by Nigerians to exercise their human rights, including their rights to freedom of expression and access to information.\n\n\u201cWe call on the Nigerian authorities to immediately reverse the unlawful suspension and other plans to gag the media, repress the civic space, and undermine Nigerians\u2019 human rights,\u201d Amnesty said.\n\n\u201cThis action is clearly inconsistent and incompatible with Nigeria\u2019s international obligations including under the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\u201d\n\nStill, the Nigerian Bar Association, in a statement by its president, Olumide Akpata, @OlumideAkpata, while condemning the ban as an infringement of free speech, warned that the impact of such arbitrary decisions on investor confidence is better imagined.\n\nAkpata in the statement asked that the ban be reversed, failure of which the NBA would take legal action against the government.\n\n\u201c@NigBarAssoc has noted with great concern the extraordinary decision of the Federal Govt to suspend the operations of @Twitter in Nigeria and, by necessary implication, the right of Nigerians to freely express their constitutionally guaranteed opinions through that medium,\u201d the statement issued by Akpata said.\n\n\u201cThe FGN also directed the @NgComCommission to immediately commence the process of licensing all OTT and social media operations in Nigeria, which is, at best, yet another disguised attempt to regulate social media, restrict freedom of speech and shrink civic space.\n\n\u201cWhether one likes it or not, we are operating a constitutional democracy, the primary consequence of which is that everything must be done according to law; government must be conducted within the framework of recognised rules and principles which restrict discretionary power.\n\n\u201cThe @NigBarAssoc finds no constitutional or legal authority to support the peremptory action of the Federal Government to suspend the operations of Twitter in Nigeria. Beyond the dent on our constitutional democracy, at a time when the Nigerian economy is unarguably struggling the impact of arbitrary decisions such as this on investor confidence is better imagined.\n\n\u201cConsequently, if this decision is not immediately reversed, the @NigBarAssoc will have no choice but to challenge same in the interest of the public and for the sake of our democracy.\n\nOn its part, SERAP, @SERAPNigeria, said it is commencing immediate legal action against the government over the decision, while maintaining that freedom of speech is a fundamental human right.\n\n\u201cNigerians have a right to freedom of expression and access to information including online, and we plan to fight to keep it that way,\u201d the body said. \u201c@NigeriaGov, we\u2019ll see you in court.\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s Federal Government had suspended the operations of Twitter in Nigeria indefinitely.\n\nThis was disclosed by the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, via a statement issued by the Ministry\u2019s spokesperson, Segun Adeyemi on Friday.\n\nThe Minister cited the persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government has suspended, indefinitely, the operations of the microblogging and social networking service, Twitter, in Nigeria,\u201d the statement read.\n\n\u201cThe Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, announced the suspension in a statement issued in Abuja on Friday, citing the persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\n\n\u201cThe Minister said the Federal Government has also directed the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to immediately commence the process of licensing all OTT and social media operations in Nigeria.\u201d",

Three teachers were also abducted.\n\nIn an emotional-laden interview on AriseTV today, June 4, the headteacher of the school, Abubakar Alhassan, whose child was also abducted alongside his sister, broke down in tears as he accused the state government officials of not contacting the state government of neglecting them or even showing sympathy to them.\n\n\u201cMy own children. They took them to an unknown place. They took them to bushes where they are to sleep on the ground. No leaf, no mat. How do you expect them to live like that?\n\nAll eyes are on me as the head teacher. I have witnessed the funeral prayers of one of the parents very close to the school. She had just one child in the school.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t around when the incident happened. When she came back, they told her that this is what is happening.\n\nREAD ALSO: Why i stayed a baby mama for four Years \u2013 Omawumi\n\nBefore you know, within 10-15 minutes, she fainted and that was the end of her, she died. That was the day before yesterday.\n\nOne day after the incident happened, another parent, a woman, died from heart attack.\n\nThe government, are we not Nigerians? Are we not Nigerlites? That the government cannot intervene in this issue? This money they are sending to them from the Federal government, is it their money? No sympathy at all. None of the government officials didn\u2019t say hi or sorry to us. Are we animals? We are not. We are Nigerians. I am too sad\u201d\n\nAnother parent of one of the abducted students, Tanko Zagi, said they are yet to hear from the state government\n\n\u201cSince that day up till now, we have not seen anything from the state government. But the local government chairman has been up and doing so that these children can be rescued. But the state government, we don\u2019t know. No official of the government has come to condole with us\u201d he said\n\nThe state government on Wednesday said it was doing everything possible to ensure the safe return of the students.",

They said the suspects have been handed to the Police and by our experiences in the past, crimes will happen like this in school and suspects will be arrested and reported to be handed over to the police and nothing will be heard again about it.\n\n\u201cThat is our anger. Since they cannot protect us, let us protect ourselves. The Police came this morning and started shooting severally. There is no security in the school. No light security lights in the school, no water and they refused to save a life; giving excuses of no fuel in the vehicle, waiting for one person or the other. It is unacceptable,\u201d the angry students said.\n\nThe name of the late victim was not known as at time of filing this report but his nickname was given as FORD.\n\nThe school authority has not issued any statement but a combine security force of the Military and the Police were seen outside the school gate, while students were parking out of the hostels following a directive that management has shutdown the university temporary till further notice.\n\nCross River State Police Commissioner CP Sikiru Kayode Akande confirmed the incident saying that some students protested and wanted to burn down the administrative building of the University following the death of a student.\n\nHe said cultists caused the problem and \u201csome of the cultists have been arrested, still some idiots gathered themselves under the guise of protesting the death of a student; they want to go and burn the university administrative building; who will be at a loss?\n\nAdding, \u201cI am using this medium to sound a note of warning, any attempt by any group of persons, under any guise, disturb the peace we have in Cross River State will be marched with all forces that is required.\n\n\u201cI have advised the Vice Chancellor to go back to the school and address the students and if they are still riotously gathered, he should shutdown the school and then we move in and anybody we fine, will be treated as a criminal.\u201d\n\nThe Nation gathered that the Vice Chancellor acted on the Police advice and shutdown the school when the students refused let off their anger.

These presented as fever, vomiting, diarrhea headaches, dizziness and allergic reactions.\n\n\u201cFive states have the highest records of the AEFI namely: Kaduna (970) Cross River (859), Yobe (541), Kebbi (511), and Lagos (448),\u201d he disclosed.\n\nAccording to Shuaib, as of today, April 16th, 1,071,346, representing 53.2% of the eligible persons targeted with the AstraZeneca vaccine had been administered their first dose in this vaccination phase.\n\nHe said the data were based on reports received from states through the Electronic Management of Immunization Data (EMID) system only and did not take into account vaccinations that were not yet captured in the system.\n\n\u201cWhat this number means is that these are the people who have their information already uploaded on our data base, while others are awaiting upload, potentially due to network problems and the high traffic of those coming in to take their shots at the same time.\n\n\u201cWhile we continue to optimize our registration and immunization data system, we also encourage the state teams to deploy the most suitable internet service for their locations in order to speed up the data entry process, so that we can have the actual number of vaccinated people at any given time,\u201d he said.\n\nShuaib added that in many states, the inoculation of frontline health workers had been completed and that they had begun offering vaccination to the elderly, particularly those that were 65 years and above.\n\n\u201cWe are glad to be able to progress quickly offer immunization to more members of the community.\n\n\u201cOur rollout has been marked by safety, efficiency, best practice, and speed. The National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) and its development partners, have a platform of Senior Supervisors that engage in daily evening review meetings to determine the status of the COVID-19 vaccine implementation in all States & the FCT.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2026It\u2019s a threat to nation\u2019s corporate existence \u2013 CDS \u2018\u20266,145,000 illegal arms with civilian non-state actors\u2019\n\n\u2026Increases insecurity, deaths \u2013 Ex-head of state\n\n\u2026Drives increasing violence rate in Nigeria \u2013 Oxfam\n\n\u2026Land borders, maritime routes poorly manned \u2013 Experts\n\nDespite the efforts being made by security agencies to tackle the myriads of security challenges confronting the country, insecurity is on the increase and experts have attributed it to the proliferation of weapons. BENJAMIN SAMSON in this report takes a second look at the issues amidst citizens\u2019 growing concerns.\n\nThe Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), Gen. Lucky Irabor, recently decried the proliferation of illegal arms in Nigeria, saying it was a threat to the country\u2019s corporate existence.\n\nIrabor stated this in Asaba, the Delta state capital, while addressing journalists after a courtesy visit to Governor Ifeanyi Okowa, adding that the presidential directive to shoot-on-sight anyone illegally bearing an AK-47 rifle was very clear and must be enforced. While saying Nigeria as a country forbade illegal bearing of arms, he warned that anyone found with such weapons was an enemy of the state and would be treated as such.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe mandate of the president for dealing with everyone holding AK-47 illegally is a mandate that must be enforced because we are a state that does not condone illegal bearing of arms.\n\n\u201cThe armed forces and other security agencies are the only institutions that are mandated to carry arms in the course of their duties. So, anyone who is carrying an AK-47 or any other weapon, for that matter, is considered a threat to the existence of the state.\u201d\n\nStatistics\n\nAccording This Day Newspapers, a March 2017 research report by Oxfam estimated that Nigeria had two million small and light arms in the hands of non-state actors. Also, in October 2020, an Africa-focused geo-political research firm, SBM Intelligence, also raised the alarm that the proliferation of small arms and ammunition was driving the increasing rate of violence in Nigeria.\n\nIn the report, the firm noted that \u201cthe number of small arms in circulation in Nigeria, in the hands of civilian non-state actors is estimated at 6,145,000, while the armed forces and law enforcement collectively account for 586,600 firearms.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, the trend of arms proliferation in Nigeria has had an impact on Nigeria\u2019s internal security, which has led to violence and the deaths and injury of thousands of innocent citizens.\n\nA further testament to the harm arms proliferation was doing to Nigeria was the Global Terrorism Index 2020 report, which ranked it the third most terrorised country in the world due to insecurity.\n\nAbdulsalami\u2019s alarm\n\nSimilarly, Nigeria\u2019s former Head of State, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar (retd.), recently expressed concerns over the proliferation of all calibres of weapons in the country.\n\nAbubakar, who spoke during a dialogue session of the Committee with stakeholders in Abuja, lamented the state of affairs in the country, acknowledging that the proliferation of weapons has heightened insecurity and led to over 80,000 deaths and close to three million Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) across the country.\n\n\u201cThe proliferation of all calibres of weapons in Nigeria is worrying. It is estimated that there are over six million of such weapons in circulation in the country. This certainly exacerbated the insecurity that led to over 80,000 deaths and close to three million internally displaced persons.\n\n\u201cWe believe Nigeria must find a way out of these problems. Our hope is that perhaps among us, by listening to your different perspectives, we can begin to build up confidence among our people so that we can hold together. So, our hope is that we shall not only share our collective lamentations about the current situation, but propose some concrete suggestions that can point the way forward, suggestions that can inspire more confidence among our people and ensure that our country remains one,\u201d Abubakar, who is also the chairman of the National Peace Committee (NPC), said.\n\nPorous borders\n\nExperts who spoke with Blueprint noted that the increase in cases of banditry, kidnapping, ethnic conflicts, cult clashes, among others, is as a result of Nigeria\u2019s porous borders.\n\nAlso, the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS), in 2014, through its then comptroller-general, David Parradang, revealed that although the country had 84 approved borders, there were over 1,400 illegal routes.\n\nParradang, who made the disclosure while addressing the National Conference Committee on Immigration, cited the examples of Ogun and Adamawa states, with 83 and 80 illegal posts, respectively.\n\nA security expert, Dr. Don Belema, in his view, blamed it on the lack of harmonious relationships among security agencies in arms proliferation and poor border management.\n\nHe stressed that the federal government should ensure it builds intelligence gathering for the security apparatus in order to tackle the menace.\n\nHe said, \u201cMost of the arms that filtered into the country came in through most of our neighbouring countries that have suffered some kind of armed conflict in the form of insurgency, rebellion, civil war, and so on. Places like Sudan, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Libya, worsen the situation.\n\n\u201cNow, we should begin to ask ourselves: What has been the problem with Nigeria\u2019s security architecture? If we are talking about the security architecture in Nigeria, we should learn to incorporate our entire sister agencies, other than the armed forces and the police. Then we talk about roles, responsibilities and the porous areas, from where these arms come into the country.\n\n\u201cWe have had Customs confiscate rifles that were shipped into the country. We have had them impound 12 cartridges. But those in the security sector will tell you that the problem of the Nigerian security is not such arms like compaction rifles and the double barrels and single barrels because they are firing gauge 12 cartridges, and by law, actually are not prohibited arms. However, they are supposed to be licensable.\u201d\n\nIsa Alkali, a security analyst, said Nigeria\u2019s land borders, particularly in the northern regions, and maritime routes were being poorly manned by those responsible for the tasks. He charged the federal government to revisit the firearms regulations and make it effective.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have porous borders, where many weapons are being brought illegally. There are people hiding arms and ammunition and smuggling into the country. The government needs to look again at the firearms regulations in this country. The law is old; it is a colonial law. We need to look at it and see how to move regulations that could control small arms in the country.\n\n\u201cThere is a committee of federal government bodies that are in charge of small arms proliferation and prevention. The agency should be able to be well-funded in order to do their jobs.\u201d\n\nBorder security\n\nA security/international relations expert and chief executive officer of X-Ray Systems, Mr. Abraham Etukudo, in a chat with this reporter, called on the government to re-strategise and come up with innovative approaches on how to tackle the porous nature of our border.\n\nHe said, \u201cA country is rated by the way it protects its borders from intruders. Nigeria is perennially at the mercy of gunrunning syndicates, smugglers and pastoral herdsmen. The Buhari regime needs to re-strategise quickly on the issue of security in border communities.\n\n\u201cA holistic, innovative approach to achieving operational control of the border is sorely needed now. It is time to re-jig our national patrol strategy. With just a workforce of 22,300 in 2014, the NIS staff strength might need to be re-examined.\n\n\u201cThe allocation of resources, manpower and material, should be based on detailed threats and risk assessments of the borders. Rapid border intervention teams, surveillance systems, radar, satellite and helicopters should be deployed. In the United States, electronic sensors are placed at strategic locations along the nearly 6,000 miles of Mexican and Canadian international land borders and over 2,000 miles of coastal waters surrounding the Florida Peninsula and the island of Puerto Rico to detect people or vehicles entering the country illegally. Video monitors and night vision scopes are also used to detect illegal entries.\n\n\u201cThe federal government must strive to maximise the available resources and apply appropriate prosecutorial pressure and punishment in order to discourage illegal entry into the country.\u201d\n\nInsecurity\n\nIn his view, Dr. Belema said it has posed security and development challenges and resulted in the deaths of thousands of people every year.\n\n\u201cNowadays, if bandits are not attacking communities and kidnapping helpless residents, including students, Boko Haram terrorists or \u2018unknown gunmen,\u2019 usually armed to the teeth, will be attacking security personnel and facilities, carting away every weapon they can lay their hands on in the process\n\n\u201cArms proliferation is enabling the bandits to defy a long list of militancy operations aimed at dislodging them. The bandits have continued to intensify their terrorist operations with recent high profile mass abduction events in Kankara, Katsina state, Jangebe Niger state, Zamfara state, Afaka, Kaduna state and more tragically Greenfield University Kaduna state where five students were executed.\n\n\u201cSecession rhetoric is becoming violent in the South-east and South-west. The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) recently attacked the Owerri Prison, freed over 1,800 persons and torched the facility. It also attacked Police Headquarters in Owerri. Many police personnel have been shot dead in the East, and their service weapon seized, further proliferating weapons.\n\n\u201cKiller Fulani herdsmen who have been declared the fourth most deadly terrorist group in the world have also been able to take over whole communities in the Middle Belt and the Southwest by the force of arms ejecting the inhabitants from their ancestral land.\u201d\n\nFG\u2019s action, battles\n\nIn a bid to tackle the challenges posed by arms proliferation, President Muhammadu Buhari recently established the National Centre for the Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons (NCCSALW) and appointed Maj.-Gen. A.M. Dikko (retd.) as its pioneer coordinator.\n\nThe NCCSALW is domiciled in the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA) and replaces the defunct Presidential Committee on Small Arms and Light Weapons (PCSALW). It will serve as the institutional mechanism for policy guidance, research and monitoring of all aspects of Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) in Nigeria and forms part of the ongoing restructuring of the nation\u2019s security architecture.\n\nAmong others, it is expected to help address emerging threats and strengthen the regional mechanism for the control, prevention and regulation of SALW.\n\nIn a statement, the ONSA while announcing the centre, said it was one of the measures to help tackle the general insecurity in the country as it would \u201cBe fulfilling the requirements of the ECOWAS Moratorium on Import, Export and Manufacture of Light Weapons, as well as the UN Plan of Action to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit trade in SALW.\n\n\u201cThe NCCSALW will serve as the National Focal Point on SALW in Nigeria and lead a multi-stakeholder process involving Ministries, Departments, Agencies (MDAs) and the civil society in implementing all national, UN and ECOWAS plans of action on the control of SALW.\n\n\u201cThe centre will maintain international cooperation and also operate zonal offices in the six geopolitical zones to ensure quick response and effective mobilisation of resources.\u201d\n\nBeyond the centre\n\nReacting on the creation of the centre, Etukudo said it was just the beginning of the battle against arms proliferation, adding that what Nigerians want to see is results.\n\n\u201cAlthough we are averse to the creation of new agencies, which often than not do not add much value to the country as it rather increases the cost of governance, I support anything that will help to address the insecurity situation in the country.\n\n\u201cHowever, it must be noted that the creation of the centre is just the beginning of the battle. It must be made to work so that Nigerians can see results. The centre should hit the ground running; working in synergy with the police, military, Department of State Services (DSS), National Intelligence Agency (NIA), immigration and other paramilitary groups towards meeting set goals.\n\n\u201cStakeholders, especially those that man the borders \u2013 land, air and water \u2013 must not allow pecuniary benefits to continue to put Nigeria at risk. They should reduce the volume of the corrupt practices within their ranks that allows the inflow of SALW into the country in the first place.\n\n\u201cThey should work and share intelligence not only with relevant national security agencies, but also neighbouring countries and regional organs like ECOWAS. The centre is coming on board at a very critical time in the nation\u2019s history and it should ensure that it makes the necessary impact,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

Twitter\u2019s mission in Nigeria is very suspect, they have an agenda,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe mission of Twitter in Nigeria is very suspicious. Has Twitter deleted the violent tweets that Nnamdi Kanu has been sending? Has it? The same Twitter during the ENDSARS protests that were funding ENDSARS protesters, it was the first to close the account of the former president of the US, Trump.\n\n\u201cAnd you see when people were burning police stations and killing policemen in Nigeria during ENDSARS, for Twitter, it was about the right to protest. But when a similar thing happened on the Capitol, it became insurrection.\u201d\n\nHe said Twitter had displayed bias during the #EndSARS protest which led to the looting and destruction of government and private property.\n\nThe minister asked what rule President Buhari had violated to warrant his tweet to be deleted.\n\n\u201cTwitter may have its own rules, it\u2019s not the universal rule,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Mr. President, anywhere in the world feels very bad and concerned about a situation, he is free to express such views. Now, we should stop comparing apples with oranges.\n\n\u201cIf an organisation is proscribed, it is different from any other which is not proscribed. Two, any organisation that gives directives to its members, to attack police stations, to kill policemen, to attack correctional centers, to kill warders, and you are now saying that Mr. President does not have the right to express his dismay and anger about that?\n\n\u201cWe are the ones guilty of double standards. I don\u2019t see anywhere in the world where an organisation, a person will stay somewhere outside Nigeria and will direct his members to attack the symbols of authority, the police, the military, especially when that organisation has been proscribed.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government has suspended, indefinitely, the operations of social networking service Twitter.\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, announced the suspension in a statement issued in Abuja on Friday, citing the persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\n\nThe Minister said the federal government has also directed the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to immediately commence the process of licensing all OTT and social media operations in Nigeria.\n\nThe federal government had on Wednesday accused the social media giant of double standards in its treatment of issues affecting Nigeria.\n\nIt warned that it would not allow the microblogging site to dictate to President Muhammadu Buhari his views on national issues.\n\nThe accusation followed the decision of Twitter to delete a controversial post by Buhari on the Nigerian civil war.\n\nThe president, in the post on Tuesday, had warned against insurrection, saying that those fomenting trouble in the South-east are in for a rude shock.\n\nBuhari, in a series of tweets on Tuesday via his verified Twitter handle @mbuhari had said: \u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian civil war. Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.\u201d\n\nBuhari\u2019s statement, which was also tweeted, sparked outrage on social media with some Nigerians reporting it to Twitter.\n\nHowever, some said the president sounded firm in his warning against perpetrators of violence in the South-east.\n\nBut on Wednesday, Twitter pulled down the tweet for violating its community standards.\n\nTwitter, in a comment, said: \u201cThis Tweet violated the Twitter Rules.\u201d\n\nThe federal government, however, kicked against the decision with the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, wondering why Twitter would object to a submission by the president on national issues but would ignore provocative postings by the leader of the proscribed Independent People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu on its site.\n\nThe minister told journalist at the end of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting at the State House, Abuja that Twitter\u2019s mission in Nigeria is suspect.\n\nHe wondered if Twitter has ever deleted offensive tweets by Kanu.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe mission of Twitter in Nigeria is very suspect. Has Twitter deleted the violent tweets that Nnamdi Kanu has been sending? Has it? The same Twitter during the ENDSARS protests promoted tweets trying to raise funds for the ENDSARS protesters. It was the first to close the account of former President of US, Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cAnd you see, when people were burning police stations and killing policemen in Nigeria during ENDSARS, for Twitter, it was about the right to protest. But when a similar thing happened at the Capitol, it became insurrection. You see, we are not going to be fooled by anybody.\n\n\u201cWe have a country to rule and we will do so to the best of our ability. Twitter\u2019s mission in Nigeria citing those two examples is very suspect. What is their agenda?\n\n\u201cHow does Mr. President\u2019s speech that anybody who is destroying infrastructure, who is destroying police stations, who is destroying INEC offices should be ready for the consequences; is that inciting violence?\u201d\n\nWhile accepting the fact that Twitter may have its own rules, Mohammed said that should not stop Buhari from expressing his views against a banned organisation like IPOB inciting people to commit arson and the likes in the South-east.\n\nHe stated: \u201cTwitter may have its own rules, it\u2019s not the universal rule. If Mr. President, anywhere in the world feels very bad and concerned about a situation, he is free to express such views. Now, we should stop comparing apples with oranges.\n\n\u201cIf an organisation is proscribed, it is different from any other which is not proscribed. Two, any organisation that gives directives to its members to attack police stations, to kill policemen, to attack correctional centres, to kill warders, and you are now saying that Mr. President does not have the right to express his dismay and anger about that? We are the one guilty of double standards.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see anywhere in the world where an organisation \u2013 a person will stay somewhere outside Nigeria, and will direct his members to attack the symbols of authority, the police, the military, especially when that organisation has been proscribed.\n\n\u201cBy whatever name, you can\u2019t justify giving orders to kill policemen or to kill anybody you do not agree with.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m saying that you cannot compare anybody with Kanu who boldly say, go and kill policemen. I think sometimes\u2026policemen are brothers, they are our uncle, they are children. We kill them their wives become widows, their children become orphans. And what is the offence of these policemen \u2013 because they are working to keep the country one.\n\nWhat about soldiers that are putting down their lives so that you and I can sleep? It is not acceptable anywhere in the world for anybody, anywhere, to stay in the comfort of wherever he is and now give directives to go and kill soldiers, go and kill policemen.\u201d",
          "summary": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government has suspended, indefinitely, the operations of social networking service Twitter.\nHe said: \u201cThe mission of Twitter in Nigeria is very suspect.\n\u201cAnd you see, when people were burning police stations and killing policemen in Nigeria during ENDSARS, for Twitter, it was about the right to protest.\n\u201cBy whatever name, you can\u2019t justify giving orders to kill policemen or to kill anybody you do not agree with.\n\u201cBut I\u2019m saying that you cannot compare anybody with Kanu who boldly say, go and kill policemen.",

          "text": "Chelsea has tied Thomas Tuchel to a two-year deal, extending his previously 18-month contract six days after winning the Champions League for the London club.\n\nThe 47-year-old arrived at Stamford Bridge in January, replacing club legend Frank Lampard as head coach on an initial 18-month deal \u201cwith the possibility of an extension\u201d.\n\nThat extension has been granted after the German, who was sacked by Paris-Saint Germain on Christmas Eve, delivered the Champions League trophy courtesy of a 1-0 victory over Premier League champions Manchester City.\n\nTuchel guided Chelsea to a fourth-place finish in the Premier League during the 2020/21 season and also reached the FA Cup final, where his side were beaten 1-0 by Leicester City at Wembley.\n\nOn the extension of his contract, Tuchel told the club\u2019s official website: \u201cI cannot imagine a better occasion for a contract renewal. I am grateful for the experience and very happy to stay part of the Chelsea family.\n\n\u201cThere is far more to come and we are looking forward to our next steps with ambition and much anticipation.\u201d\n\nChelsea director Marina Granovskaia added: \u201cWhen Thomas joined us in January there was still so much to play for domestically and in Europe. He slotted in seamlessly and immediately became an integral part of the Chelsea family.\n\n\u201cReturning us to the top four in the Premier League was crucial, and we could not be happier with our success in the Champions League which crowned a remarkable season at Chelsea.\n\n\u201cWe are obviously extremely pleased therefore to retain Thomas for a further two years, and look forward to more achievements in the coming seasons.\u201d\n\nTuchel has won 19 of his 30 games in charge so far, losing five times and conceding just 16 goals.\n\nLast weekend, he became the first manager to reach back-to-back Champions League finals with two different clubs.",
