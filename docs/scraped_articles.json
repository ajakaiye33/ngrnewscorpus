          "title": "Smaller breasts can produce more milk for babies, physician says",
          "text": "Amarachi Okeh\n\nA medical health expert, Dr. Oluwatosin Kuku, has allayed the fears of women with small breasts who may be concerned that they may not produce enough breastmilk after childbirth, noting that the size of a woman\u2019s breast has no role to play in the production of breastmilk.\n\nAccording to the health expert, there\u2019s no relationship between how a woman lactate and the size of her breast.\n\nSHe said, \u201cIn fact, a small breast can produce more milk than a big breast.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with PUNCH HealthWise in an interview, Kuku explained that \u201cUsually, we would say genetic and other factors are what affects breast milk production after birth.\n\n\u201cThat is why sometimes we encourage new mums to take lots of water and fluid. You\u2019d hear people tell them to take pap and all that but mostly I think it has to do with individuality.\u201d\n\nAlso, a recent article published by Baby Centre UK \u2013 an online resource for expecting and new parents \u2013 noted that the size of the breast does not affect breast milk production.\n\nThe article explained that \u201cThe size of your breasts mostly depends on how much fatty tissue they contain. But fatty tissue doesn\u2019t have anything to do with how your breasts make milk.\n\n\u201cTo make and store breastmilk you need glandular tissue. This is laid down while you are pregnant. The vast majority of women have enough glandular tissue to breastfeed their babies.\n\n\u201cAs your baby suckles, the hormone prolactin stimulates the mammary glands in your breasts to secrete milk. As your baby continues to feed, your body releases yet more prolactin. This places the order to your breasts to make enough milk for your baby\u2019s next feed,\u201d the article explained.\n\nSpeaking further, Kuku urged women who may be having difficulty lactating after birth to allow their newborn to latch on the breast as it can stimulate milk production in such women.\n\n\u201cIt takes days for some women to lactate after giving birth, in those cases you\u2019d allow the baby to latch on the breast for a few days to stimulate the breast to produce but some people are just lucky they start lactating immediately,\u201d she said.\n\nContinuing, she explained that it is even recommended by doctors that when such women are not lactating after birth, \u201cwe tell them to put the baby there and allow them to latch on the breast, so when the baby sucks, the sucking reflex actually stimulates the milk production itself even if it is not coming out at that moment.\u201d\n\nKuku also pleaded with breastfeeding mothers to allow their children to finish the content of a breast before putting them to the other breast.\n\nAccording to her, this is to make sure that the child gets all the nutrients from the breast.\n\nShe explained that the length of time spent sucking on a breast is irrelevant as what is most important is that the breast is emptied by the newborn before sucking on the other breast.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "A Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential aspirant, Mr Peter Obi, has appealed to the party\u2019s delegates to vote wisely during the upcoming national convention.\n\n\n\nObi, a former governor of Anambra, urged them to be guided by their conscience and vote in the interest of the country\u2019s future and that of their children.\n\n\n\nHe spoke on Monday in Awka, when he met with prospective delegates from Anambra.\n\nAccording to him, monetary consideration should not be the major factor in chosing the party\u2019s presidential candidate.\n\n\n\nHe said he decided to end his national consultation in Anambra, after going round the 36 chapters of PDP, plus Abuja, to demonstrate his commitment to the cause.\n\n\n\nObi said that his experience from the tour had strengthened his resolve to seek an opportunity to steer the ship of the country.\n\n\n\nHe likened the ship to the \u201ctitanic, which was sinking while those on top were making merry\u201d.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor the sake of your children and future of Nigeria vote wisely. Don\u2019t hurt the future of your children.\n\n\n\n\u201cDo you want to collect money and bequeath a society of hopelessness, kidnapping, banditry and poverty to future generations?\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\n\n\n\u201cIs that the society you want for your children?\n\n\u201cRemember, you can\u2019t transfer your delegate status to your children, this is an opportunity for you to decide.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am competent, I am committed and I have the capacity to turn this country around, please give me your votes,\u201d Obi said.\n\n\n\nHe said he saw opportunities across the regions of the country during his tour.\n\n\u201cI concluded that it is unacceptable for the country to possess such huge human, arable land and natural resources and still have over 100 million people living in poverty,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nHe said that while the Kainji Dam that was built with the first money borrowed by Tafawa Balewa in 1964 was still standing, there was no justification for the present borrowings that had plunged Nigeria into heavy indebtedness.\n\n\n\nHe said the country with 200 million people could not make progress with 4000 megawatt, while South Africa with 50 million people was generating 54,000 megawatts.\n\n\n\nHe said that Kaduna had more land mass than Netherlands and wondered why Netherlands should earn more from export of agro produce than Nigeria.\n\n\n\nObi said there was no more money to share and that he would shift the conversation from sharing formula to production formula.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, Kaduna can sustain Nigeria, if optimally explored.\n\nHe said: \u201cLet\u2019s stop wasting our time, let us join hands to fix Nigeria\n\n\u201cI visited the tomb of Tafawa Balewa because he was the first to borrow in Nigeria to build Kainji Dam which is still standing today.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhere are the ones we borrowed recently?\u201d\n\nEarlier, Dr Doyin Okupe, a former presidential spokesman to former President Olusegun Obasanjo, described Obi as the best aspirant from across the country in the race.\n\nOkupe, who likened Obi to late MKO Abiola, called on the delegates not to deny Nigerians the opportunity to vote the candidate they yearned for.\n\n\n\nHe said that having a president from the South-East should not be seen as handing out a token but a necessity.\n\nHe contended that the zone had one of the most qualified candidates to preside over the country.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is a national frenzy about Peter Obi, the second after Abiola.\n\n\u201cEvery independent opinion poll in the last two weeks has favoured him.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe has gone round the world seeking knowledge.\n\n\u201cHe is the best from the east and better than others across the country.\n\n\u201cAnambra is still reaping benefits of Obi\u2019s reign in the state. \u201cI will stop supporting him, if I see a candidate with better academic qualifications than your son,\u201d Okupe said.",

I was unjustly denied access to my office as the Vice Chairman of Akoko-Edo local government area and then replaced illegally till the end of that administration.

          "text": "Hon Oladele Bankole-Balogun was one time Federal Commissioner that represented Edo State at the Public Complaints Commission (PCC) and the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for Akoko-Edo Federal Constituency in 2019. He is today an aspirant for the same ticket and in this interview spoke on his chances and what he will do differently if he gets the party\u2019s nomination and wins the election:\n\nWhat is your view on the coming PDP primary election?\n\nThe PDP has a track record of well organised primary election and elections generally, I have had the opportunity of being the PDP candidate on a number of occasions so I am firmly well qualified to speak on the PDP and its modus operandi and I don\u2019t expect anything different this time.\n\nAlthough you know that there has been some fractious behavior from a certain group of people who joined the party not long ago, that does not in any shape or form affect the constitutionality of the party and its procedure vis-\u00e0-vis this primary. Coming to me as a person, I am supremely confident but not over confident that I will win the day; one, I am very well known in this local government, two; people know that I have the capacity, three; of the three of us in the race, people know very clearly that I am head and shoulders above the others but no disrespect to them.\n\n\n\nMy loyalty to the party has been unquestionable for several years, I have been a committed and loyal party man and so I think all of these things stand me in good stead so when you consider the fact that PDP people and Akoko-Edo people in general are still very disappointed and unhappy that I was denied of a clear victory in 2015 and interestingly, the principal character in that tragedy for democracy against the PDP is now seeking the ticket as well so I think we are very well educated and enlightened in Akoko-Edo to know where we are.\n\nIt is rumoured that you are loyal to the Dan Orbih led faction of the PDP as against the governor, is this true?\n\n\n\nThis is a direct question and I am going to answer it as a lawyer and as an educated person and as a staunch PDP member. Now, who is Dan Orbih loyal to? I am sure if you are to answer that question you will say Dan Orbih is loyal to the party, the PDP. I am loyal to the PDP.\n\nWhat makes you confident that you will win the PDP primary for the House of Representatives?\n\nAs I said, there are three of us, the other two gentlemen are relatively new to the party, so their contributions, their visibility, their activities within the party is not as documented as mine and then again when we start looking at following with all due respect I don\u2019t think they have the kind of popular appeal and following that I have and then when you start going into other subjective issues like background, pedigree, life experiences, exposure, national network capability, ability to turn anything into gold, ability to able to stand up at the national stage and Akoko-Edo to have its rightful place at the comity of nationalities of Nigeria, there is no other person of the three of us that can do that job at this particular time except me.\n\nWhat are you going to do differently if picked?\n\nI have been on this road for a long time, I have been denied by evil forces and the haters of democracy and sadly they have had so much time to prove their mettle and they have consistently failed because you cannot give that which you do not have; if you do not have the exposure, if you do not have the network, if you do not have the background, if you do not have the ability, there is no way that you will be able to deliver on a grand scale. Why I feel that I am capable is that I have been raised for this: my background, my education, my network of friends, my network of business, my network of profession, my relationship with my community and the other ones that make Akoko-Edo, the fact that I have been doing massive healthcare programmes in Akoko-Edo for several years, the fact that I have been funding indigent students, the fact that I am helping people to own businesses, support businesses, the aged, all sorts of things put me in that position that I really know that if given that opportunity to serve at the national level, there are certain things we can do to palliate the already brutalized and almost bastardised our situation in Akoko-Edo.\n\nSecondly, there are so many untapped resources in Akoko-Edo, resources of commercial quantity. We have to move governance and representation and the ability to lobby for the people away from keke napep and pepper grinding machines to having grand ideas of how we can comercialise our federal constituency. We haven\u2019t had anyone shout for us at the national level for several years so this is the time now that a fearless, clear thinking, clearly minded person will be able to actualize that because I believe in myself and I believe that I can do it.\n\nWhat is your advice to the delegates?\n\nMy advice to the delegates is that this is the crucial time for the party, we have been out of government for a long time but thank God it has happened like this because the good people of Akoko-Edo have realised and have missed PDP so much and they cannot wait to get rid of these people so it is the duty of the delegates to think with their heads and their hearts, to look at the three aspirants before them and choose based on criteria; who is that one person that is approachable, who is that one person that can speak in Abuja and the whole world will hear and understand, who is that person of the three that has demonstrated, that has the capability to do that, who of the three that has shown that he is a party man, it now very clear; one of them only joined the party recently, the other one has been more-or-less a nominal member of the party; one was a government official with absolutely nothing to show for it in the local government whereas as a federal commissioner for less than two years, the things I did still reverberate in the local government. I think the delegates have a once in a lifetime opportunity to do the right thing and I think they will do it",

This is in addition to his huge investments in education, agriculture, security and infrastructural developments. The World Bank accountability ranking of states in Nigeria evaluated Kogi as 2nd in 2017, 1st in 2018 and 2019.\n\n\u201cThe draft report for 2021 shows that Kogi scored 100 per cent in all the areas and from indic\n\nations, the state will maintain the first position in 2021, judging from the draft report that was released yesterday.\n\n\u201cI am proud of Governor Yahaya Bello (GYB) because of his development records in Kogi. This is a governor that is always looking for progress and the development of lives of his people. This is me, a Yoruba, supporting someone from the Northcentral.\n\n\u201cThere is no progress without demands. I lost my both parents, though unfortunately, because Nigerians believed in them. I\u2019ve been working with GYB for a while and I have seen that he has the courage and intelligence to deliver Nigeria.\u201d\n\nShe said as one of the presidential aspirants of the party, Bello had reached out to party stakeholders in nearly all parts of the country, adding that he stood a better chance to clinch the ticket.\n\nThe director general said in terms of insecurity, the governor had reduced crime, adding that through a well-crafted management system, he had united all groups in the multi-ethnic state.\n\nShe said the campaign team had been interfacing with critical stakeholders of APC to present his development credentials, which would be replicated at the federal level.\n\n\u201cGoing into the presidential primaries, we are on a good footing. If you plant a good seed very early, you will reap better than those who plant late,\u201d she noted.",

          "text": "By Henry Umahi\n\nFormer national chairman of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Victor Umeh, has lambasted the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for jettisoning zoning of its presidential ticket, saying it acted in bad faith.\n\nIn an exclusive chat, Umeh said the South East had remained loyal to the PDP for over 22 years but when it was time to reciprocate the support, the party decided to wear the toga of mischief. He said PDP would pay dearly if it denied the South East the presidential ticket.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\n\u201cThe news came to me as a grave shock, PDP is trying to destroy Nigeria. Nigeria has been surviving on a fragile template and the only thing that has been sustaining the country is the hope that one day, all will be well.\n\n\u201cI was a PDP founding member but I resigned in 2001. In the PDP constitution, it is expressly stated that there shall be zoning of offices between the six geopolitical zones and the party has been following it.\n\n\u201cThat was why in 1999, the presidency went to the South and former president Olusegun Obasanjo emerged when he contested against Alex Ekwueme. After Obasanjo, it went to the North through the late president Musa Yar\u2019Adua. When former president Goodluck Jonathan served out, in 2019, PDP zoned the office to the North through former vice president, Atiku Abubakar, who didn\u2019t win. Now that President Muhammadu Buhari is leaving, it is the turn of the South.\n\n\u201cSo, for the PDP to abandon it, to possibly create another president from the North after Buhari\u2019s tenure, is a disservice to the unity of this country. It\u2019s most painful.\n\n\u201cIn 1998, when the PDP was founded and registered, I was in the home of Igwe Peter Anugwu, during his new yam festival. The big wigs in the PDP from the North attended the new yam festival at the Igwe\u2019s palace. Adami Ciroma, Mrs Solomon Lar, Dr. Ekwueme, Chief Orji Uzor Kalu and many other power brokers from the PDP were there.

If they throw it open, they can still make a South East person their presidential candidate. But if they finish this process and fail to support a South East person to be president, it means, we have been fools all along for supporting the PDP.\n\n\u201cWe will mobilise the whole South East to reject the PDP, no matter who they field. The South East will be stupid to put one vote for the PDP again.\n\n\u201cIn 2015, we supported Jonathan of the PDP, Buhari won. In 2019, they brought Atiku and the South East supported the PDP because they used former governor Peter Obi as vice presidential candidate. Let them not think if they deny us the presidential ticket, we will accept vice presidential ticket. It is not the turn of the North to contest the presidential election.\u201d\n\nHowever, Umeh is still hopeful that with the array of quality aspirants from the South East, the PDP will nominate its presidential candidate there even after jettisoning zoning.\n\n\u201cBut if they don\u2019t do it, I tell you nobody in the South East will vote for them. We will make it impossible for them to get any vote from the South East because they have taken us for a ride. It means our labours for the PDP for over 22 years has been in vain. It means the PDP members from the North have been masterminding the marginalisation and segregation against the South East people in Nigeria. Let them save themselves of this embarrassment by nominating someone from the South East as their presidential candidate. It\u2019s not a threat but votes are our weapons. We will deny them our bloc votes.\n\n\u201cThe All Progressives Congress should also wake up. Let the president know that the PDP is up to some pranks and take the historic opportunity of healing all the wounds in Nigeria and stand behind a South East to become president in 2023. Then we will give the PDP the marching orders,\u201d he said.",

Now that we are a few weeks to the convention, would it be right for the party to now say this person can contest or this person cannot contest?\n\n\u201cPeople have started campaigning, even members of the same family and you cannot rob Peter to pay Paul. How would you tell those who have been spending money and time not to contest because you have zoned it? How would they feel?

Abubakar\n\n\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja, Chinedu Eze in Lagos, Seriki Adinoyi in Jos, John Shiklam in Kaduna, Segun Awofadeji in Gombe\n\nNorthern States Governors Forum (NSGF) and Kaduna-based Islamic scholar, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi, yesterday, joined the growing number of groups and individuals that have condemned last Thursday\u2019s mob killing of Deborah Samuel, a student of the Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto, for alleged blasphemy against Prophet Mohammed.\n\n\n\nChairman of the forum and governor of Plateau State, Simon Lalong, in a statement signed by his media aid, Macham Makut, said the governors were concerned about the development, which they described as clearly an extra-judicial measure of addressing perceived infraction.\n\nThe statement came as Catholic Archbishop of Abuja Archdiocese, Most Rev. Ignatius Kaigama, said Nigerians should not succumb to the machinations of the evil ones by halting the pursuit of brotherhood and peaceful coexistence.\n\n\n\nIn its own reaction, the umbrella organisation of all Christians in Northern Nigeria at the weekend condemned what it described as gruesome and barbaric murder of Deborah. In a statement signed by the Public Relations Officer, Chaplain Jechonia Gilbert, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in the 19 northern states urged \u201call Christian leaders to terminate their participation in Nigerian Inter-Religious Council (NIREC)\u201d until Islamic leaders demonstrate genuine commitment to controlling and disciplining their unruly followers.\n\n\n\nHowever, over 72 hours after the cold-blooded murder in Sokoto, frontline aspirants in the 2023 presidential race were yet to comment on the incident. All Progressives Congress (APC) national leader and former governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu; immediate past Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi; former Anambra State governor, Peter Obi; former Senate President, Bukola Saraki; Kogi State Governor Yahaya Bello; Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike; and Pastor Tunde Bakare had yet to comment at the time of filing this report.\n\n\n\nThe Sokoto incident, which has created religious tension, has effectively dashed any hope of a Muslim-Muslim ticket in the current political climate, as some would have wanted. analysts have pointed\n\nBut Nigeria\u2019s domestic carrier, Azman Air, disowned a pilot, Capt Jamil Abubakar, who expressed support for the killing of the late Deborah. Abubakar came under fire for a statement he made via his Twitter handle, defending the killing of Deborah.\n\n\n\nIn a tweet from its verified Twitter handle, #LetsFlyAzmanAir, Azman Air stated, \u201cCapt Jamil Abubakar is no longer a pilot @AzmanAir: his last flight with us was 22nd Dec 2019. We refuse to take responsibility for a comment or view of a former staff. The general public should kindly take note.\u201d\n\nIn a move to avert a major religious crisis over the killing of the 200-level student of Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto, the state governor, Aminu Tambuwal, had at the weekend declared a 24-hour curfew in Sokoto metropolis.\n\n\n\nThe curfew came as the Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Sokoto, Matthew Hassan-Kukah, suspended all masses in Sokoto metropolis, but clarified that his residence was not attacked.\n\nThe remains of Deborah were at the weekend laid to rest in her home town, Tunga Magajiya, in Rijau Local Government Area of Niger State.\n\n\n\nFollowing the protests in Sokoto, Governor Nasir-el-Rufai of Kaduna State had also banned any form of religious protest across the state.\n\nCAN had at the weekend called on all its members to embark on peaceful protests nationwide on May 22, 2022.\n\nThe declaration of the curfew in Sokoto followed protests by some Islamic faithful that greeted the condemnation of the killing by the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Muhammad Sa\u2019ad Abubakar III.\n\n\n\nThe northern governors, in the statement, stressed that any attempt to adopt self-help in addressing grievances, whether religious or otherwise, would only lead to further chaos that could threaten law and order as well as the general peace and security of the society. While commiserating with the family of the victim, Lalong said in the statement that the northern governors wanted the security agencies to be allowed to thoroughly investigate the matter and ensure that the law took its full course on anyone found wanting.\n\n\n\nThe northern governors also appealed for calm following reports about the hijack of a peaceful protest, which later turned violent and led to the imposition of a curfew in Sokoto metropolis.\n\nLalong also extended the support and commiserations of the forum to Tambuwal over the incident and commended his proactive efforts to restore normalcy. The forum assured the Sokoto State governor of its solidarity and prayers in dealing with the matter as well as ensuring that all necessary measures were taken to forestall future occurrence in any part of the region and country at large.\n\n\n\nNSGF also reminded citizens of the region and Nigerians of the need to continue to show love, tolerance and respect for one another, irrespective of faith, ethnicity or other affiliations.\n\n\n\nOn his part, Gumi, speaking during his daily preaching at the Sultan Bello Mosque, Kaduna, in a video clip shared on his Facebook page, declared that any Muslim who killed a Christian in Nigeria because the prophet was insulted would not smell paradise. He maintained that Nigeria was not an Islamic state, adding that Muslims in the country have agreement with people of other faiths to live together peacefully. He stressed that anyone who killed on religious guise had committed a grievous sin.\n\n\n\nGumi said it was unfortunate that some Muslim clerics were quoting verses they did not understand and telling people to kill whoever insulted their religion.\n\nQuoting several verses from the Qur\u2019an and Islamic jurisprudence, Gumi said killing a non-Muslim under the guise that the person uttered a blasphemous statement against Prophet Muhammad was not an excuse, \u201cbecause Allah has told us in the Qur\u2019an the non-Muslims will insult Allah and His Prophet.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn fact, it is now the blasphemy will start after the killing of that lady in Sokoto, the insult will increase, not reduce.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cSome Muslims in Nigeria that want to defend Prophet Mohammed should be ashamed of themselves because they are corrupt\u2026\n\n\u201cThe best way to go, if we want to defend the Prophet, is to follow his teachings. We, the clerics, need to wake up and teach Muslims their religion. We must leave this state of ignorance; we have turned like animals. We, the Muslims, are not the only ones in this country.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is not only that we are not the only ones in this country, we must know that there was nothing the unbelievers did not do to Prophet Mohammed, but he was patient, because he was conscious that if he killed them, the unbelievers he was trying to bring to the fold of Islam will tag him a killer.\n\n\u201cThere are people who are neither Muslims nor Christians in Nigeria, and everyone is trying to win their souls. Also, there people who are not Muslims, whom we are preaching Islam to, so that they can enter the fold of Islam and be salvage in the hereafter.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf we now begin to kill people, they will say it is even from the leader of our faith, Prophet Mohammed, that we have learnt it.\n\n\u201cThey will say their religion is a religion of bloodletting. At a time we are trying to draw attention of people to see the beauty of Islam, we are now scaring them away.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that we even see some clerics who are telling people that whoever insults your religion, just kill then. They are quoting verses they don\u2019t understand.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is no one who has the will to kill anyone except through the Islamic justice system. And in doing this, the conditions of such justice must be completed before anyone can be killed.\u201d\n\nGumi further stated, \u201cOur religion is a civilised religion. The white people learnt rule of law from Islam. But today, we are the ones in this level of lack of civilisation, to the extent that an Islamic cleric is quoting Qur\u2019an and Hadith spreading and encouraging barbarism.\n\n\n\n\u201cPeople that have not been able to perfect their own act of worship the way they are supposed to. People who don\u2019t know how to pray properly are now the ones that say they want to dispense justice to people who commit blasphemy.\n\n\u201cWhat people don\u2019t know is that, in the Islamic perspective, the world is divided into two \u2013 the Islamic world and the non-Islamic world. That is countries that are governed by the Islamic law and those that are governed by other laws.\n\n\n\n\u201cThose who are not Muslims are divided into two \u2013 there are non-Muslims that you engage in war, and there non-Muslims that you have agreement with. Those you have agreement with are also divided into two \u2013 those who are living under the Islamic laws and those that are not bound by the Islamic laws.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s non-Muslims are not living under the Islamic laws, we all have an agreement under the Nigerian constitution to live together. So, Prophet Muhammad said whoever kills a soul of non-Muslim that is under such agreement of living together will not smell the fragrance of paradise, such person\u2019s distance to paradise will be like a journey of 40 years.\n\n\n\n\u201cKilling a non-Muslim under the guise that the person uttered a blasphemous statement against Prophet Mohammed is not an excuse, because Allah has told us in the Qur\u2019an the non-Muslims will insult Allah and His Prophet. In fact, it is now the blasphemy will start after the killing of that lady in Sokoto, the insult will increase, not reduce.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat Allah asked us to do in the face of blasphemy in a society, like ours, is to be patient and preach to the people and make them understand our religion. In our kind of society, we don\u2019t have the right to kill for blasphemy, otherwise, even many people who call themselves Islamic clerics who have equally been killed because they have fallen into blasphemy by calling Allah human being or saying they know tomorrow or those who have indirectly turned to Babalawo.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Prophet told us that a time will come towards the end time, when people will feel like taking other people\u2019s life. So, he said, instead of doing that, it is better for you to look for a rock and be boxing it, so that you don\u2019t (have) the urge of killing anytime.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, who do we leave just justice for in the face of blasphemy? It is the authority. We don\u2019t have the right to take up arms and kill anyone, except in self-defence, like when some comes for your life or an armed robber invades your house. You are not the one to defend Islam, in fact, you are making the work of those calling people into Islam difficult.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe right thing the students who killed the lady in Sokoto ought to do is to report her to the school management, then the management reports to the governor or Sultan for them to know how to stop her. Just by hearing her commit blasphemy, you just went and carried out jungle justice on her, who taught you that? What do you want our country to turn into? We must leave these acts of barbarism.\n\n\n\n\u201cIs it even we, the Muslims of Nigeria, that want to defend Prophet Muhammad? We that are corrupt? We that cannot even be differentiated from unbelievers in corrupts acts. The best way to go if we want to defend the Prophet, is to follow his examples by being upright in all fronts.\u201d\n\nKaigama Says Efforts at Inter-religious Harmony Must Not Stop\n\nSpeaking during his homily at St. Louis Church, Efab Global Estate, Abuja, against the backdrop of last week\u2019s murder of Deborah Samuel, Kaigama said Nigerians should not give up on the pursuit of brotherhood and peaceful coexistence, but \u201cmust continue to speak up in a common voice and act in solidarity with one another against the evils of our time.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn a related development, the Christian Association of Nigeria, YOWICAN (Youth Wing), asked security agencies to stop the molestation of Christians to avoid a religious war.\n\nIn a statement issued yesterday by Chairman of YOWICAN, Belusochukwu Enwere, the association said, \u201cToday is the 4th day Miss Deborah Samuel was killed by Muslim extremist students who chose to take laws in their hands and yet most of our Nigerian political class who are gunning to lead us as a country failed to condemn or to commiserate with the bereaved family.\n\n\n\n\u201cEven after killing Deborah the miscreants continued to destroy people\u2019s properties, burning of church facilities, and going from house to house intimidating peaceful Christians. The security agencies should do the needful before this becomes a religious war.\n\n\u201cWe call on all Christian youths to continue to be peaceful and do not take laws in their hands. God must surely fight to avenge the killing of Deborah. Her death will unearth evil agenda of the wicked ones in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nNorthern States Chapter of CAN Urges Boycott of Inter-religious Council\n\nThe umbrella organisation of all Christians in Northern Nigeria at the weekend condemned the barbaric murder of Deborah. A statement by the public relations officer, Chaplain Jechonia Gilbert, CAN insisted that the assailants must be brought to justice.\n\nCAN in the 19 northern states called on every Christian parent across the country, especially the northern states, to discourage sending their children to schools in Sokoto State until the federal and Sokoto State governments were ready and willing to secure the lives of their children both in Sokoto and other states \u201cthat are hostile to Christians and Christianity.\u201d\n\n\n\nCAN said in the statement, \u201cWe are urging all Christian leaders to terminate their participation in Nigerian Inter-Religious Council (NIREC), until their counterparts of Islamic faith show commitment to tame their followers on equal terms. Northern CAN prays for the immediate family and, indeed, the church of late Deborah Samuel not to lose hope in God\u2019s ability to avenge the killers of their daughter.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe appeal and counsel those who feel and think that killing and oppressing Christians is a demonstration of their service to their God to learn from history. Those that tried it in Egypt and their experiences should be enough warning. There is a Red Sea awaiting them, even those who are secretly encouraging them, must partake in the Red Sea experience.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe association added, \u201cWhile the CAN does not and will not encourage casting aspersions on any religion or religious leader of any faith, CAN frowns at hiding under the gab of any religious extremism to perpetrate any form of criminality against her members, especially in Northern Nigeria.\n\n\u201cGod Almighty is not and can never be a weak God for mere mortal to fight and defend Him. On the contrary, it is He who keeps, watches and defends us. CAN believes that life is sacred and must never be taken by another unless as directed by the state.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe CAN (19 Northern States and Abuja) is calling on the federal government under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari and the Sokoto State government under Governor Aminu Tambuwal not to resort to the government\u2019s usual rhetoric but must demonstrate political will and capacity to bring the perpetrators of this criminality to justice; otherwise, others may take queue from this and turn our father land to a country of lawlessness at every slightest provocation.\u201d\n\nTEKAN/ECWA Youths Condemn Killing of Deborah\n\nThe national body of Tarayar Ekklisiyoyin Kristi A Nigeria (Hausa, Fulani and Kanuri Christians) and the Evangelical Church Winning All (TEKAN/ECWA) youth block, at the weekend, condemned the killing of Deborah Samuel.\n\nAddressing a press conference in Gombe, National Youth Leader of the block, Jim James Amos, described the killing as an unwarranted jungle justice meted out to Deborah by Islamic extremists.\n\n\n\nTEKAN/ECWA also called for calm, saying, \u201cAs law abiding citizens, we call on all Christian youths to remain calm, law abiding and desist from taking laws into their hands, let us leave everything in the hands of God Almighty who is the final judge.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe youth group commended all organisations and individuals (both Christians and Muslims) that came out to condemn the gruesome murder. It also called on the federal and Sokoto State governments to rise up to the occasion by doing the needful, saying the world is watching.\n\n\n\nIt said, \u201cWe are aware that many organisations have called for the arrest and prosecution of the culprits, we make bold to say that the national and state assemblies must, as a matter of urgency, enact a law that handles such issues.\n\n\u201cAt this moment of grief, when our sister is being buried as we speak, we wish to commensurate with the church in Nigeria, TEKAN/ECWA block, CAN in Sokoto and Kebbi states, the Zuru people, and the immediate family and extended family of Late Deborah Samuel Yakubu.\u201d\n\nNHRC Condemns Deborah\u2019s Killing, Calls for Immediate Prosecution of Culprits\n\nThe National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) condemned the killing of Deborah Samuel, a second-year student of Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto, for alleged blasphemy.\n\nThe Governing Council of the commission, while reacting to the killing on Sunday, in a statement, said that there was no law, either secular or religious in a democratic society, anywhere in the world that justified the killing of any person without due process of the law.\n\n\n\nIt urged all persons to exercise tolerance over religious matters, while tasking the relevant authorities, particularly the police, to thoroughly investigate and prosecute the culprits, who had been, reportedly, arrested as well as put necessary mechanisms in place to effect the arrest of every other person involved in the gruesome murder, with a view to bringing all perpetrators to book and preventing future occurrence.\n\nIt stated that the consequence of inaction now by the law enforcement agencies could be a recurrence In the near future.\n\n\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cThe commission used the opportunity to condemn all acts of religious extremism in the country and appeals to all parties in this matter as well as the concerned public to remain calm even in the face of this provocative and dastardly act, while awaiting the report of the police investigation into the incident, adding that two wrongs cannot make a right.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe council also expressed its heartfelt condolences to the family of the late victim, Deborah, and other families who had lost their loved ones under similar conditions, assuring them that the commission will work with relevant bodies to ensure that justice is served in such cases.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*Friends say he will take unpaid leave after convention if successful\n\n*Activists keep mum\n\nThe President of the African Development Bank (AfDB), Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, who is among the 25 presidential aspirants that submitted forms for screening under the All Progressives Congress (APC) has intensify lobby for the party\u2019s ticket as THISDAY learnt that last week, he met Mallam Mamman Daura, President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s nephew and one of those very few persons that have the president\u2019s ears.\n\n\n\nA source told THISDAY that the meeting held behind closed doors as Adesina continues to lobby of Buhari\u2019s circle.\n\n\u201cHe met him sometimes last week. His car was sighted entering Mamman Daura\u2019s house during the week. Beyond Mamman Daura, he is also reaching out to Buhari\u2019s relatives in Niger Republic, to see if they can convince Buhari to back him,\u201d the source who pleaded to remain anonymous added.\n\n\n\nTHISDAY had reported last week that some African leaders have mounted pressure on Buhari to anoint Adesina, as the presidential candidate of the APC in the 2023 general election. To this end, former President Olusegun Obasanjo, is said to have given Adesina his full backing.\n\n\n\nA reliable source had told THISDAY that leaders in West Africa, including the presidents of Niger and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, had spoken to Buhari on behalf of the AfDB president.\n\nThe West African leaders were reported to have met Buhari in Abidjan last week, where the president attended a two-day conference organised by the United Nations, to try and persuade him to consider Adesina.\n\n\n\nAdesina is expected to contest the ruling party\u2019s ticket with the likes of the Vice-President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo; Bola Tinubu, a former governor of Lagos; outgoing Minister of Transport, Rotimi Amaechi, Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, now former Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba, among others. Delegates of the ruling party are expected to pick a presidential candidate between May 30th and June 1st.\n\n\n\nLast week, a coalition made up of 28 groups bought the form for Adesina worth N100 million. One of the leaders of the coalition, Ademola Babatunde, had said they put their resources together to purchase the form because APC\u2019s fee was outrageous.\n\n\n\nA friend of the AfDB President said Adesina has concluded plan to take an unpaid leave from the bank if he gets the party\u2019s ticket, to enable him campaign around the country.\n\n\n\nHowever, analysts have expressed concern that activists in the country have kept mum despite the fact that Adesina, the head of a continental multilateral institution was still holding onto him job despite having submitted his forms to contest for the presidential ticket of the APC.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy are those who were raising their voices when a group purchased forms for the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria not saying anything about Adesina? Adesina has submitted his forms and has been shortlisted for screening, even when the AfDB doesn\u2019t allow politics, why are they not calling for his resignation as well? He signed his form for submission, so no one can claim he is not aware of it or claim that a group bought the form in his name without his knowledge,\u201d the analyst who pleaded to remain anonymous wondered.\n\n\n\nThe confidential source further disclosed that, for Adesina to submit his form, he had to submit a sworn affidavit and evidence of his APC membership card which he is said to have done in full compliance with the requirements.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

It said the company had made a lot of investments in developing the country\u2019s oil resources since it began operation in the last 60 years.\n\n\n\nThe government criticised Shell, ExxonMobil and Chevron \u2013 three of the five oil majors in the country \u2013 over their apparent withdrawal from investing further in Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas sector, urging them to emulate TotalEnergies\u2019 sustained investments in the country and resume their investments.\n\n\n\nExecutive Secretary of the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB), Mr. Simbi Wabote, made the assertions at the weekend in Lagos, at the TotalEnergies\u2019 EP Nigeria\u2019s 60th anniversary dinner.\n\nThe French oil giant said Nigeria remained at the heart of its strategy, and indicated plans to expand its business into the country\u2019s electricity sector. It stressed that the sector offered exciting opportunities that it would like to explore.\n\n\n\nWabote said TotalEnergies had invested immensely in Nigeria and deserved commendation for remaining consistent in investing in the country\u2019s oil sector. He said with the amount of investments TotalEnergies had put into the country\u2019s oil and gas sector since its entrance into the space, there was no basis for comparing it with that of Shell, Chevron and ExxonMobil.\n\n\n\nWabote stated, \u201cTotal has invested so much in Nigeria since the last 60 years. At the last count, we are looking at almost $30 billion worth of investment in Nigeria within a space of eight years.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe amount of money Total has invested in this country, when you compare that with other IOCs, like Shell, Chevron, ExxonMobil, there is no basis for comparison.\u201d\n\n\n\nSpecifically criticising Shell for refusing to invest to develop the protracted Bonga Southwest project, which had been on the drawing board for many decades, Wabote said on the other hand, TotalEnergies had started and completed many projects that were producing oil and gas in the country.\n\n\n\nBonga Southwest is among the oil assets that the government has been banking on to achieve its plan of increasing Nigeria\u2019s oil reserves and production.\n\n\n\nAccording to Wabote, \u201cWe started discussing Bonga Southwest before I was born, Total took FID \u2013 (Final Investment Decision) on Usan. We were still discussing Bonga Southwest when I got married, Total took FID on Egina. We were still discussing Bonga Southwest, when I had my first child, Total took FID on Ikike. I will go on and on and on.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe executive secretary argued that his job as local content chief executive would not have existed if there was no project, adding that he needs no apology for praising companies keeping him on the service through undertaking projects that create value for the country.\n\n\n\nWabote added, \u201cLet me use Total to challenge Shell. Unfortunately, I\u2019ve not seen Chevron here and I\u2019ve not seen ExxonMobil. I will use Total to continue to challenge them. Total is also one of the investors of NLNG Train 7, which is about the most important investment in the whole of the country.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, we should understand what Total is doing. This is a celebration that we should all partake, for keeping faith in this country, remaining in this country for 60 years is no mean feat. I encourage you to, please, remain with us.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn his address, President, Exploration and Production, TotalEnergies Group, Mr. Nicolas Terraz, assured that Nigeria remained at the heart of the company\u2019s strategy, pledging to continue investing in the country. Terraz said with the company\u2019s first oil discovery in 1964, and the subsequent commencement of production from the Obagi field, TotalEnergies E&P took its first steps into a future that was yet to unfold.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, with new fields and increased productivity, the company has continued to expand and evolve, leading to its current position as the second largest operator in Nigeria, accounting for 20 per cent of the country\u2019s oil and gas production.\n\n\n\nHe maintained that TotalEnergies was a major player and a proud partner with Nigeria in developing its oil and gas sector, noting that they have developed a number of projects over the years.\n\nTerraz said the company was in the final stages of the Ikike project, a project he described as key for its Nigerian affiliate to demonstrate the viability of tie-backs to existing fields.\n\n\n\nHe stated, \u201cA lot of progress has been made, but I know there are a lot of challenges as we near the end. I am counting on the project team, and, indeed, all the affiliates, to apply yourselves to overcome these challenges and deliver the production safely.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs a company, we have shown a unique commitment to Nigeria. Indeed, the country remains at the heart of our strategy. Nigeria has a lot of potential, but as for Ikike, it is not always \u2018plain sailing\u2019, so we all have to perform at our best to continue the adventure.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said the group had strived to become the industry benchmark for Nigerian content as demonstrated by the flagship Egina project, where they set new standards, sharing their technological expertise with the oil and gas industry.\n\n\n\nThe TotalEnergies president hailed the passage of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), saying while bringing some much-needed clarity for the industry, it has also brought changes to the regulatory, fiscal and operating environment in the country.\n\n\n\nAs a responsive organisation, Terraz said the energy group must re-engineer its processes and structure to be able to adapt and face the new challenges while taking advantage of the opportunities.\n\nTerraz expressed excitement at the opportunities that abounded in Nigeria, and indicated the intention of TotalEnergies to expand into the Nigerian electricity sector.\n\n\n\nHe noted that considering the increasing energy demand of a rapidly growing population and the need to address climate change, their objective was to meet energy needs through an energy mix that was less carbon intensive.\n\nHe stated, \u201cOf course, we continue to believe in hydrocarbons. Gas development for NLNG and domestic usage will remain a bedrock of our activities while we concentrate our investments in low cost, low emission oil.\n\n\n\n\u201cElectricity offers an exciting opportunity in Nigeria, and it is an area which we would like to explore while also expanding the scope of our company to renewables. I know you are working on this.\u201d\n\n\n\nSpeaking also, Managing Director of TotalEnergies EP Nigeria and Chairman of TotalEnergies Companies in Nigeria, Mr. Mike Sangster, said the company would continue to collaborate with the government, its partners, and other stakeholders to help to further develop the country\u2019s huge hydrocarbon potential.\n\n\n\nSangster said TotalEnergies was proud to be the second largest oil and gas producer in Nigeria, contributing 20 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s oil production. He said behind the numbers were over 1,166 Nigerian workforce, several billion dollars\u2019 investments into the Nigerian economy in recent years, and five production sites.\n\n\n\nSangster added that the partnership between TotalEnergies and Nigeria had been a very successful one, pointing out, however, that the journey has not always been smooth.\n\n\n\nHe singled out security as a very serious issue currently facing the company that needed to be addressed by the authorities, noting that the situation \u201cis greatly reducing our onshore production.\n\n\u201cSo, we have had our fair share of challenges to overcome, but what I\u2019ve seen personally over the past three years is that when our teams, all our teams, put their heads together, there is no problem that cannot be resolved.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn her part, Managing Director, Deepwater Operation, Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCO), Mrs. Elohor Aiboni, while reacting to the challenge Wabote posed to Shell and other IOCs, stated that it was not only for Shell but for all IOCs existing in Nigeria.\n\n\n\nNoting that Nigeria was a good place to do business, Aiboni stated that they looked forward to more investments from all IOCs.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "The biggest African tech moves from April",
          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Safaricom, the largest telecommunications provider in Kenya, is set to launch commercial operations in Ethiopia later this year. This announcement was made by Safaricom CEO Peter Ndegwa while sharing the telco\u2019s financial statement for the year ended March 31, 2022 last week.\n\n\u201cWe have made our first test call, sent [the] first test SMS and completed [the] first test data session,\u201d Ndegwa said on Twitter. \u201cWe have a strong team of 300 employees with half of them being Ethiopians.\u201d\n\nA key highlight from the results announcement is that we are set to launch commercial operations in @SafaricomET within the year as part of our regional expansion efforts to provide world-class telecommunication services to over 112 million Ethiopians. #SafaricomFYResults pic.twitter.com/oJPgGSVJfw \u2014 Peter Ndegwa (@PeterNdegwa_) May 12, 2022\n\nSafaricom increased its service revenue by 12.3% to KES 281.11 billion ($2.42 billion) and profit by 13.5% to KES 109.13 billion ($940 million), according to its latest financial report. Voice service revenue grew by 0.8% to KES 83.21 billion ($720 million); mobile data revenue grew by 8.1% to KES 48.44 billion ($420 million), while M-PESA revenue grew by 30.3% to KES 107.69 billion ($930,000).\n\nSafaricom Ethiopia\u2019s plans to bring mobile financial services to Ethiopia. However, this is subject to the licensing and regulatory process by the Government of Ethiopia.\n\nLast year, Safaricom joined efforts with Vodafone, Vodacom, Japan\u2019s Sumitomo Corp, and UK\u2019s CDC Group to secure the licence to operate in Ethiopia at a cost of $850 million, a landmark win as the second most populous African country opened up its telecom sector to competition.\n\nThis led Safaricom to set up shop in Ethiopia earlier this year, but while the licence allowed the company to compete against state monopoly Ethio Telecom, it couldn\u2019t offer M-PESA services (its mobile financial service) due to legal limitations.\n\nIn April, Ethiopia started changing its national payments law to enable Safaricom to introduce M-PESA in the country.\n\nAccording to Business Daily Africa, the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) drafted a new bill which included a clause that \u201cForeign nationals may be allowed to invest in a payment instrument issuer or a payment system operator business, or establish a subsidiary which shall be licensed as a payment instrument issuer or payment system operator.\u201d\n\nWhen the new bill is signed into law, Safaricom will be able to compete with Telebirr, a mobile service Ethio Telecom launched last year that attracted 4 million users within its first month. Ethio Telecom has over 58 million subscribers, the highest number of subscribers by an African operator in a country.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nMy weekend began on Friday with Pitch Friday. We had a thrilling experience. You just had to be there.\n\nOne thing that made my Friday was meeting Kolade, a Techpoint Digest reader, after Pitch Friday. At this point, I\u2019d make a good marketer. After all, he came because he saw my newsletter. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nSaturday was very short. I slept for nearly 12 hours after watching a Netflix series about Cerebral Palsy titled Special. \ud83d\ude02 Yeah, 12 hours! I hope I\u2019m well, though.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd yesterday, I couldn\u2019t go anywhere or do anything. I was practically on my bed all day long.\n\nSo, how did your weekend go? Please tell me how you spent it. Interestingly, I\u2019m looking forward to the weekend again, especially Saturday.\n\nI\u2019m sure you can guess why. That is when the highly anticipated Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit will take place. I can\u2019t wait to see you there.\n\nYou don\u2019t have money to get the ticket? Don\u2019t worry. We have two sponsors who are willing to cover your ticket fee. Continue reading to learn how you can be one of the lucky recipients of a free ticket to the event.\n\nSo, today, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nPaying bills with eNaira\n\nSEC\u2019s new guidelines on cryptocurrency\n\nCentral African Bank\u2019s warnings to the CAR\n\nTopUp Mama\u2019s $1.7m seed\n\nPaying bills with eNaira\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerally, do you trust your government? If you\u2019re a Nigerian, do you believe what the government, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), or whoever represents it says? I don\u2019t because they frequently fail to keep their promises.\n\nAnyway, here\u2019s the most recent: The CBN announced that the eNaira would be updated to allow it to perform additional functions like bill payment and USSD access.\n\nAn upgrade to the eNaira Speed Wallet app will be available starting this week, allowing you to perform transactions like paying for DStv or electric bills and purchasing flight tickets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiven the hype surrounding the eNaira in 2021, it appeared to be something the government would get right. The question is, have they got it right?\n\nRecall that the CBN delayed the launch of the eNaira, which was initially scheduled for October 1, 2021, last year.\n\nWhy? Per the CBN, the launch was postponed to avoid conflict with the Independence Day celebration\u2019s lineup of events.\n\nHowever, the CBN was facing a lawsuit at the time from a company called ENAIRA PAYMENT SOLUTIONS LIMITED, which claimed to have registered the name eNaira in April 2004.\n\nDo you think that after last year\u2019s postponement, whatever the CBN says about the eNaira will hold this time? I doubt it, but I think you\u2019re hoping it will hold this time.\n\nIs there anything else to this upgrade? There is, of course. And Bolu has done this justice as he explains what this upgrade is all about.\n\nYou can read about it here: Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank edges close to eNaira use case with much-needed upgrade\n\nSEC issues new cryptocurrency guidelines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by CardMapr.nl on Unsplash\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Nigeria\u2019s capital market regulator, has issued new guidelines on the issuance and custody of digital assets, a move that could boost crypto adoption in the country.\n\nThe new regulations essentially classify digital assets as securities. For context, per the SEC, a \u201cDigital Asset\u201d is \u201ca digital token that represents assets such as a debt or equity claim on the issuer.\u201d\n\nThis signifies that Nigeria is attempting to balance outright prohibition and unregulated use of crypto-assets.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s latest guidelines were released, following the commission\u2019s announcement on September 14, 2020, that it would take a three-pronged approach to regulating innovation in the crypto sector, including safety, market deepening, and problem-solving.\n\nThis publication comes as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) called for the creation of a new public infrastructure to connect various payment systems, including digital currencies.\n\nThe 54-page document establishes registration requirements for digital asset offerings and custodians, and classifies the assets as securities regulated by the SEC.\n\nBesides, the rules apply to all platforms that facilitate the trading, exchange, and transfer of virtual assets, all issuers and sponsors of virtual/digital assets, including international and non-resident issuers and sponsors, and any operator that aggressively targets Nigerian investors.\n\nFor more information, watch out for the Techpoint Africa Podcast on Tuesday. I believe Bolu has some insights that you\u2019d definitely enjoy.\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit (TABS 2022) will take place in less than five days!

Now, the Banking Commission of Central Africa (COBAC) is cracking down on Bitcoin transactions, issuing a reminder of its crypto ban on Friday, May 13, 2022.\n\nWhat does this mean? This means that COBAC \u2014 the six-nation Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa\u2019s (CEMAC) banking regulator \u2014 has prohibited all banks from cooperating with digital currency payment platforms or acknowledging them as assets.\n\nThis is happening because CAR did not consult with its regional monetary authority before adopting Bitcoin.\n\nCOBAC stated that the prohibition is intended to ensure financial stability. Perhaps understandable as cryptocurrencies are currently reaching significant lows.\n\nMoreover, the Bank of Central African States (BEAC), based in Cameroon, urged the Central African Republic to repeal the law that would allow Bitcoin to be used as a reference currency.\n\nThe bank warned in a letter made public last week that the move violated its rules and could jeopardise regional monetary stability. It also warned that its decision could be at odds with the region\u2019s France-backed currency, the Central African Franc (CFA).\n\nThe CFA Franc is the currency of CEMAC members, which are the Central African Republic, Cameroon, Chad, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, and the Republic of Congo.\n\nHow could it affect CFA? The CAR\u2019s decision violates fundamental provisions of the CFA arrangements, including the requirement that the CFA franc be the only legal tender in the region and that the BEAC control the issuing of money and currency conversion for the entire zone.\n\nThe bank also urged the Central African Republic to follow CEMAC\u2019s lead in promoting economic and financial cooperation and avoiding policies that could lead to monetary fluctuations.\n\nTopUp Mama\u2019s $1.7m seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s the story? TopUp Mama, a Kenyan startup that plans to digitise the supply chain for Africa\u2019s micro, small, and medium-sized restaurants, has raised $1.7 million in seed funding.\n\nWho were the investors? Ventures Platform and JAM Fund led the round, while Next Billion Ventures, Future Africa, Jedar Capital, HoaQ Fund, FirstCheck Africa, and DFS Lab participated.\n\nFormerly known as Kibanda TopUp, the company was founded in 2021 by Njavwa Mutambo (CEO), Emilie Blauwhoff, and Andrew Kibe.\n\nWhat does it do? TopUp Mama is a one-stop-shop for restaurants in Kenya and Nigeria, offering them all the supplies, short-term credit, and tools they need to run their businesses.\n\nWhat has it done since its launch? The company claims it has grown tenfold in the last year, with over 3,000 merchants (1,000 active) using its platform to place orders each month.\n\nFuture plans? Over the next few years, it hopes to become the go-to supplier for 50,000 businesses in Kenya and Nigeria as it strives to become Africa\u2019s largest grocery distributor targeting restaurants.\n\nPer Mutambo, TopUp Mama will use the funds to accelerate growth, develop technology, and scale its restaurant sales management tools.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nOpportunities\n\nWin up to \u20a61m when you participate in Credo\u2019s Social Payments Hackathon starting May 16, 2022.

In a test I conducted after the launch, the app had trouble verifying my BVN, which made using the application impossible.\n\nHowever, news by This Day, in December 2021, said the eNaira was getting rapid acceptance among Nigerians. It said the eNaira Speed Wallet app had reached over 600 thousand downloads eight weeks after launch, and \u20a643 million worth of transactions had been carried out just weeks after launch.\n\nPwC\u2019s 2022 CBDC Global Index also reported that the CBN leads global CBDC retail projects. Retail CBDC projects refer to digital currencies designed for public use instead of wholesale projects such as China\u2019s CBDC \u2014 the e-CNY \u2014 created for institutional usage.\n\nAccording to the Index, over 35,000 transactions have been completed on the eNaira, which was downloaded in 160 countries.\n\nWhile the Index lauds the eNaira, a Twitter poll conducted by Intelligence by Techpoint \u2014 Techpoint Africa\u2019s data and Intelligence arm \u2014 in April 2022 said otherwise. The poll had votes from 157 Twitter users, 36.9% (58) of which voted \u201cI don\u2019t own a Wallet.\u201d\n\nNigeria's eNaira adoption\n\nWhat have you done with the eNaira Speed Wallet since its launch?\n\n\n\nKindly vote and retweet. Advertisement April 7, 2022\n\nInterestingly, 27.4% (38) of those who own a wallet had never used it. Only 1.3% had completed a transaction with the eNaira Wallet, while 34.4% were indifferent about the CBDC project.\n\nChuta, however, justified the issues eNaira faced after it launched by saying the \u201cindustry and the technology are still young, so it is normal to go back to the drawing board.\u201d While he cannot point at specific errors, Chuta reiterates that there was a need to rework the project.\n\nWhat will the eNaira upgrade do?\n\nIn addition to bill payments, the eNaira will be accessible via Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD). Per Vanguard, Koyor told business owners and market leaders that the USSD code for the eNaira (*997#) would make onboarding more Nigerians easier.\n\nThe Guardian also reported on Friday, May 6, 2022, that fintech could explore investment opportunities with the eNaira. Yusuf Jelil, Principal Manager and Business Lead for the eNaira project, said that the CBN, along with fintech startups, is looking to explore investment opportunities with the eNaira.\n\nHow eNaira USSD could work\n\nWhile there\u2019s little detail on how the eNaira will work with USSD, we can make educated guesses on how the service will work based on our understanding of the eNaira and USSD protocols in Nigeria.\n\nUSSD integration with the eNaira could mean that feature phone users can now use the digital currency without Internet connectivity. This includes setting up a wallet and sending and receiving eNaira.\n\nAccording to the CBN, the first tier of Speed Wallet users can set up a wallet without a Bank Verification Number (BVN). However, they will have a daily transaction limit of \u20a650,000 ($121.50).\n\nA National Identification Number (NIN) will be required in place of the BVN. Given that 71 million Nigerians have their NINs \u2014 17 million more than the 54 million registered BVNs \u2014 more people get access to financial services without going to a physical bank branch.\n\nIt is, however, important to note that the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) has been unable to verify NINs, leaving 7.5 million MTN subscribers disconnected.\n\nFacilitating eNaira transactions via USSD also raises the question of who bears the consent charge, a question that stands in the way of free transactions, the eNaira\u2019s biggest value proposition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

If you can remind me \u2014 because I\u2019ve been mentioning it for a week now \u2014 you\u2019ll have all my money this weekend.\n\n$5,000. Yeah, you read that right. So, I had a dream last night and won a singing competition. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Don\u2019t mind me; I\u2019m only joking. My voice is terrible. You don\u2019t want to hear me sing. (Editor\u2019s note: You really don\u2019t.)\n\nHowever, I\u2019m happy. I mean, it\u2019s the weekend again. Aren\u2019t you glad?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, today is Techpoint Africa Pitch Friday! Now, you remember, huh?\n\nTechpoint Africa will host entrepreneurs and startup enthusiasts at 43b Emina Crescent, Opebi, Allen, Ikeja by 5 p.m.\n\nWho knows, maybe you\u2019ll meet your next startup co-founder or be inspired to start your own. Don\u2019t pass it up for anything. Kindly register here.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nAre there many fintech startups in Nigeria?\n\nInterswitch\u2019s $110m\n\nSafaricom\u2019s plan to launch M-PESA Junior Accounts\n\nAre there many fintech startups in Nigeria?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat comes to mind when you hear the term \u201cfintech,\u201d especially since every Tom, Dick, and Harry wants to start a fintech startup that \u201cbanks the unbanked\u201d? Digital payments? Lending? Just those two?\n\nPerhaps now\u2019s a good time to ask how many fintech startups you know do not provide lending and payment options in Nigeria. None? Just a few?\n\nIf you believe that fintechs are limited to just those two, I just might hold a fintech Masterclass. For the right amount, of course.\n\nSimply put, fintech \u2014 the combination of the words \u201cfinancial\u201d and \u201ctechnology\u201d \u2014 is the incorporation of technology into the offerings of financial services companies to improve their usability and delivery to customers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow does it function? It primarily works by disaggregating offerings like digital lending, payments, blockchain, and digital wealth management, while creating new markets for them.\n\nFurther, it refers to a wide range of financial activities that can be performed without the assistance of a person, like money transfers, check depositing with your smartphone, bypassing a bank branch to apply for credit, raising funds for a business startup, or managing your investments.\n\nBut seriously, do you think Nigerian startups primarily offer payment and lending services?\n\nChimgozirim probably has answers to your many questions concerning this. Please read his story here: Does Nigeria have too many fintech startups? What the numbers say\n\nY Combinator in Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Y Combinator\u2019s (YCs) website, 3,657 startups had gone through the California-based technology startup\u2019s accelerator programme as of W22 \u2014 its Winter cohort.\n\nIntelligence by Techpoint, the data and research arm of Techpoint Africa, has partnered with YC to give an account of its activities in Africa since 2009. Above is a snippet of the report titled Y Combinator in Africa: A report about African startups that have gone through Y Combinator\u2019s Accelerator Programme.\n\nInterswitch\u2019s 110m\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterswitch, an African payments company, has announced an investment from LeapFrog Investments and Tana Africa Capital.\n\nAlthough Interswitch has not confirmed the amount it received from the firms, TechCrunch, reports it at $110 million, but says \u201cthe precise terms of the transaction have not been disclosed.\u201d When asked about the investment and Interswitch\u2019s new valuation, a spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch, \u201cWe can\u2019t comment on that for the time being.\u201d\n\nSo, what does the company do? Founded in 2002 by Mitchell Elegbe (CEO), Interswitch is an Africa-focused integrated digital payments and commerce company which facilitates the electronic exchange of money.\n\nThe fintech company is well known for its Point-of-Sale terminals and online consumer payment platforms like Quickteller and Verve. The company claims Verve is Africa\u2019s largest domestic debit card scheme, issuing over 35 million active cards since launch.\n\nThe funding will aid in its expansion across the continent and the provision of digital payment services.\n\nAlso, the funds will be used to support Interswitch\u2019s pan-African strategy, which includes acquiring new customers and developing new products to support a financial inclusion strategy.\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit (TABS 2022) will take place in less than nine days!

Children are vulnerable to various risks due to the rapid industrial revolution and digitisation in Kenya and globally. Also, with access to the Internet via various devices, other hazards include child trafficking, prostitution, child pornography, trafficking, early age exposure to alcohol advertising, cyberbullying, and crimes like identity theft.\n\nConsequently, CA wants mobile network operators, broadcasters, internet service providers (ISPs), and content providers to implement policy and technical safeguards to protect minors.\n\nHowever, it appears that Safaricom is at odds with Kenya\u2019s CA with this plan. Well, the company has not revealed additional details on how the M-PESA Junior Accounts will work.\n\nAlso, the telco will launch a virtual debit card for international online payments.\n\nWhy? While some products, like Spotify, can be paid for directly with M-PESA, others, like Netflix, are unavailable, forcing customers to use bank-affiliated cards.\n\nAnd this causes some concern, particularly among those unwilling to do so for security or other reasons best known to them.\n\nFurther, per the World Bank Financial Inclusion Data, 72.9% of Kenyans have a mobile money account, and 26.1% buy and pay bills online. This means that over 14 million people buy and pay bills online.\n\nHowever, the products will be available before the end of June 2022.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nWin up to \u20a61m when you participate in Credo\u2019s Social Payments Hackathon starting May 16, 2022.

          "text": "In the last five years, palm oil producers in Nigeria have been posting record revenues and profits, largely on account of import restrictions that more or less guaranteed their position as suppliers of last resort to diverse commercial and individual users.\n\nYet, even though Presco, for instance, tripled its profit within one year (2020 to 2021), there is even more potential for Nigerian producers to make more than this, both from the local and international markets.\n\nRead also: Nigeria\u2019s palm oil imports from Malaysian dip 8.2% in 11-month\n\nWith data, as reported by BusinessDay, showing Nigeria importing less palm oil as local producers report expansions, there are also opportunities in the global multibillion-dollar industry, and locally too, where supply has not completely met demand.\n\nWhen Indonesia, the world\u2019s largest exporter of palm oil, banned exports of the commodity, to safeguard its own domestic consumption on account of increasing uncertainties and disruptions due to the Russia-Ukraine crisis, it put pressure on edible oil prices globally.\n\nFor Nigeria, it was a reminder of its lost status as a giant in palm oil production, as it was neither able to step up to meet the needs of a global market nor guarantee domestic supply and avoid erratic price surges. Domestic players, both big and small, would keep reporting profits after all, but there is an even bigger cake to be shared if local producers quit being comfortable with the edge they have, which is: as long as imports are restricted, they need not do more than the bare minimum in pushing productivity.\n\n\u201cThis is a further wake-up call,\u201d said Emmanuel Ijewere, vice-president of Nigeria Agribusiness Group (NABG), who added that there need to be concerted efforts to give producers the necessary infrastructural support to become truly productive and globally competitive.\n\nAccording to him, Presco and Okomu in Nigeria are two of the biggest players in the world, and there are also the smaller producers, many of whom cannot expand their production because they cannot modernise their processing capabilities.\n\n\u201cThese are all in states, but the state governments are more interested in just going to Abuja and collecting monthly allocation, instead of encouraging these various individual small plantations in their areas to produce oil from their palm produce, from which the individuals and companies (involved) can pay taxes,\u201d he said.\n\nA BusinessDay analysis shows that Presco\u2019s profit grew to N18.8 billion in 2021 from N5.2 billion in the previous year. The company\u2019s revenue jumped by 97.5 percent to N47.2 billion in the period under review from N23.9 billion in 2020. In 2019, its profit was N3.8 billion, down from N4.3 billion in 2018.\n\nFor Okomu Oil, its profit grew by 55.5 percent within nine years, reaching N14 billion in 2021 from N9 billion in 2012. This was the highest profit after tax recorded, based on its financials published on the Nigerian Exchange Limited.\n\nThe profit was hinged on the 60 percent increase in revenue to N37.5 billion in the financial year ended December 2021 from N23.4 billion in 2020. The revenue growth was on the back of 85 percent local sales while only 14.9 percent was from exports. Local sales reported N31.9 billion while export sales yielded N5.6 billion.\n\nYet, as the Indonesian ban is playing out, there is even more money to be made in the export market too.

          "text": "Nigeria has seen its importation of crude palm oil decline steadily in the last three years thanks to rising local production.\n\nIn an attempt to regain its lost position in the league of global palm oil producers, Nigeria had introduced the backward integration policy in 2011 but it wasn\u2019t until 2018 that it began to gain traction.\n\nThis has spurred massive investments from PZ Wilmar, Dufil Prima Foods, Agric Palm Limited, Presco, and Okomu Oil Palm Company, among others, in developing backward integration projects.\n\nCurrently, there are no reliable figures for Nigeria\u2019s palm oil production and imports.\n\nHowever, Nigeria\u2019s imports from Malaysia \u2013 the world\u2019s second-largest producer \u2013 declined by 76.5 percent in the first three months of the year from 44,908 metric tonnes (MT) in 2021 to 10,536MT. In 2021, it dropped by 15.8 percent from 368,313MT in 2020 to 309,911MT, according to data from Malaysian Palm Oil Council.\n\nIndustry sources attributed the steady drop in the volume of importation to the ongoing massive expansions by existing plantation owners and the entry of new players, which have helped in boosting local production.\n\nAlthough, the sources stressed that production is still not growing at the same pace as Nigeria\u2019s fast-rising population.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that Nigeria\u2019s palm oil production is increasing and will continue to be on the rise owing to the backward integration projects by many producers. This is reducing our importation,\u201d said Fatai Afolabi, former executive secretary of the Plantation Owners Forum of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cExisting players like Okomu and Presco have doubled their plantations and increased production by 100 perecent when compared to their status five years ago,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, the country may be immune to the recent global price rally that has forced Indonesia \u2013 the global top producer of the commodity \u2013 to halt ongoing shipments in an attempt to keep the price affordable for its citizens.\n\nPalm oil is a key ingredient in packaged foods, detergents, and cosmetics. About 90 percent of palm oil is used in the production of foods, while the remaining 10 percent is used by the non-foods industry in Africa\u2019s most populous country.\n\nIgwe Hilary Uche, national president of the Oil Palm Growers Association of Nigeria, said the recent level of investments in processing mills was bringing a major advancement in the growth of palm oil production in the country.\n\nAccording to him, the country can further accelerate and sustain local production of the commodity when the government starts giving much attention to smallholder farmers, who account for 80 percent of the country\u2019s palm oil needs.\n\n\u201cThere is serious expansion by existing plantation owners and this is impacting our production,\u201d he said. \u201cProduction will further increase when the government starts giving much attention to smallholder farmers \u2013 that produce 80 percent of the country\u2019s production \u2013 in the way it ought to.\u201d\n\nThe industry has continued to see new plantations spring up owing to expansion by existing players and new entrants and the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s support.\n\n\u201cRight now, we are seeing the kind of planting that we have not seen in Nigeria before and demand for palm oil has also increased as manufacturers who use it as inputs for production are now sourcing locally,\u201d said Henry Olatujoye, former president of Palm Produce Association of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cNew entrants of farmers are coming into the sector and the combination of all these have driven production,\u201d he said.\n\nNigeria imports its crude palm oil from Indonesia, Malaysia, China and India.",

We are working tirelessly to ensure that you will wake up one day and see our healthcare system becoming second to none in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cHealthcare is not about fancy hospitals or sophisticated equipment but about the health personnel. It\u2019s about the quality of the training and professionalism of those who administer healthcare services to the people. These are all we got from our brothers in the Diaspora during the free medical outreach.\u201d\n\nReiterating the need for improved collaboration between private organizations and local, state and federal governments, Obaseki noted, \u201cCollaboration between doctors here and their colleagues abroad, as well as clinical and non-clinical medical personnel, has led to the success recorded during the medical mission.\n\n\u201cWe got value from this mission and it\u2019s in a hundred times of what we put in as a government. This dinner is to thank you; we know we can\u2019t thank you enough. The lesson of this medical mission is that we can build our own healthcare system to any standard in the world.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe don\u2019t need to have a Central Hospital but we have decentralized our healthcare system and have a clinic or primary healthcare centre in every ward. We don\u2019t need to travel miles to seek healthcare. Before we leave office, we must make sure that every ward in Edo State has a primary health care centre.\u201d\n\nThe Co-Chairman of the Local Organising Committee (LOC) and Chief Medical Director (CMD) at Edo Specialist Hospital, Dr. Sunday Adeoye said, \u201c150 surgical interventions occurred at Edo Specialist Hospital (ESH), 180 at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital (UBTH), nine VVF surgeries, 2500 free medicated eyeglasses were given. EDHIS were there to ensure continuous treatment for the indigent people who can\u2019t afford healthcare.\u201d\n\nEarlier in her welcome address, the Commissioner for Health, Prof. Obehi Akoria commended all stakeholders who contributed to the success of the medical mission, noting that the outreach has changed the lives of the 5,000 beneficiaries in the state.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

If it is about money, I have enough. I came with plenty money (hitting his pocket with his right hand). And it is not only naira, I came with dollars, pounds and Euro. This time around in Osun, it is fire for fire.\u201d\n\nReacting to Ademola\u2019s comment, the Oyetola Campaign Council said: \u201cOsun people are not gullible. We have left them in no doubt of the quality our party, the APC and our Administration are made of, including the capacity of our candidate to deliver in the past three and half years. We have proved through our inclusive governance strategy that our people are our strength and that we do not take them for granted and we will never take them for granted. This explains why in spite of the way the 2018 election went, our administration began infrastructure intervention from Ede, the hometown of the PDP candidate.\n\n\u201cOsun people are enlightened, they Know that the State and its citizens are not up for sale to the highest bidder. Therefore, the PDP candidate should keep his money. Or better still, he could deploy those resources to establish industries to provide jobs for the people. This way, he will also be supporting the present Administration\u2019s noticeable efforts in the last three and half years to industrialise the State and change its narrative as a Civil Service State, to one bubbling with economic activities.\n\n\u201cIt is on record that the Oyetola-led administration has since inception taken concrete steps to open up the State for investments, and has been able to attract a number of investments into Osun, contributing to the economic growth of the State.\n\n\u201cWe assure the PDP candidate that, like the Administration did to other players in the private sector, we will provide a level playing ground for his business to thrive and ensure Osun and its people derive maximum benefit from the investment.\n\nThe Campaign Council also cautioned Adeleke against overheating the polity with his incendiary comments and violent tendencies, wondering what he meant by saying \u2018it\u2019s fire for fire this time around\u2019.\n\n\u201cAs a responsible party, we urge Senator Adeleke and his party to embrace peaceful conduct and decorum in their political engagements and electioneering. We must avoid any comment or action that can jeopardise the peace and stability of our State,\u201d the statement added.q",

Advisory: Avoid 7 Division bypass and Gubio Camp for now,\u201d the alert read.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported on Saturday that one Abdulmajid Tanko Izge who claimed to be the President of a group, Borno Youth Support, was leading the threats to kill the young woman.\n\nWriting partly in Hausa, Tanko Izge had said, \u201cA message to Government of Borno State.

We therefore call on the Borno State Government to take immediate action or else we Muslims will not sleep and we will take action).\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cNaomi you must face the consequences.

I don\u2019t think she will be released soon so she won\u2019t be killed. I heard some people are also planning to attack her father\u2019s house here in Maiduguri,\u201d the source had told SaharaReporters.\n\nThe latest by the Borno extremists comes while the country has yet to resolve the gruesome murder of a 200-level Shehu Shagari College of Education student in Sokoto State, Deborah Samuel, last Thursday by a Muslim mob which comprised of her classmates.\n\nThe incident has continued to attract nationwide condemnation and the police arrested two suspects \u2013 although a protest by some Muslim youths over the arrest on Saturday turned violent in the state.\n\nThe mayhem had forced Governor Aminu Tambuwal to impose a 24-hour curfew.",

We are however doing everything possible to reconnect the line to the national grid\u201d.\n\nHe noted that the collapsed tower was not the only one vandalized and that restringing the transmission line involves bringing down the 330kV DC line on some suspension towers, that were minimally vandalized, up to the nearest tension towers on both sides of the collapsed tower and fortifying the suspension towers before restringing the lines to ensure quality work is done,\u201d he noted.\n\nHe noted that work has reached 70% completion and that TCN is working hard to ensure that the 330kV DC transmission line is completed and reconnected to the national grid in one week, to ensure the evacuation of over 400MW stranded power at the Odukpani Power Plant near Calabar as well as the restoration of power supply to Cross River State.\n\nEngr.

ABCON under my leadership will continue to encourage our members to play the vital role of closing the exchange rate gaps in the market and reducing widening premium between the parallel market and the official window,\u201d he said.\n\nGwadabe listed several factors that continue to undermine the naira stability and the local currency\u2019s value against other currencies.\n\nThe ABCON boss called for the creation of BDCs\u2019 Autonomous Foreign Exchange Trading Window (BAFEX) with determined maximum daily limit for legible BDCs to access dollars from banks, autonomous market and diaspora forex widow at the prevailing market prices.\n\nHe requested for enhancement of existing BDCs\u2019 automation portals to file transaction returns on CBN/ABCON/NFIU/NIBSS portals for effective regulatory monitoring and supervisions.\n\nGwadabe also sought for the creation of an automation portal to encourage registration of undocumented and unlicensed operators for effective monitoring, identification and tracking of their transactions.\n\nHe said the reluctance of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to open new windows through which foreign exchange can be attracted to the economy remains a key factor in the naira continued fall.\n\nHe said the non-inclusion of BDCs in the list of channels through which diaspora remittances flow to Nigeria, under the CBN\u2019s guidance and regulation, has reduced the volume of dollar inflows to the economy.\n\nAccording to him, the World Bank\u2019s latest Migration and Development Brief showed that Sub-Saharan Africa attracting $49 billion in 2021. The bank said officially recorded remittance flows to low- and middle-income countries are expected to increase by 4.2 per cent this year to reach $630 billion.\n\nGwadabe said Nigeria\u2019s contribution to the remittances fund is expected to rise when BDCs are allowed to receive funds from Nigerians in Diaspora into the economy.\n\nHe said the BDCs are to perform this role through contactless and digitised channels that make collections easy and seamless.\n\nHe said there is urgent need to review the guidelines on BDC\u2019s Scope of Operations to include participation in payment space, such as agency banking, Point of Sale (PoS) services, inbound and outbound forex transfers, ATM Forex services, to reflect global business model practice.\n\nHe suggested that the BDCs should be allowed to access dollars or diaspora remittances through the autonomous forex windows that enable operators to receive IMTOs proceeds, carry out online dollar operations and Point of Sale (PoS) Agency, among others.\n\nGwadabe insisted that now is the time to break the current industry monopoly that puts the remittances market in the hands of few players depriving others from tapping into the plan.\n\nThe ABCON boss also called for the establishment of training institutes to enhance capacity and infrastructure in the industry and broaden players\u2019 business scope with cash-back incentives for those that patronize BDCs while also implementing a less cumbersome and complex documentation requirements for end users.\n\n\u201cThe BDCs should be able to operate a network of digital solutions for PTA/BTA. This would reduce overheads, and improve profitability. Some BDCs might still consider working closer with commercial banks. The ABCON can also be recognized as self-regulatory organization to enable it operate effectively and sanction erring members,\u201d he stated.\n\n\u201cWe wish to reiterate our resolve to align with the policy thrust of the apex bank and ensure that ABCON members play their roles professionally and strategically in the interest of the market and economy,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that de-marketing of BDCs by regulators and security agencies is not good for the stability of the market.

During the guided tour, I am sure you all saw that this is indeed a purpose-built, state-of-the-art, 100-bed hospital, which is aimed at delivering the highest standard of healthcare, using the most advanced technology and treatments to provide Nigerians with the best medical expertise available anywhere in the world,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that according to available records, Nigerians spend between $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion on medical tourism annually, a development he described as a huge drain on the country\u2019s foreign reserves.\n\nHe expressed delight that many of the doctors at Duchess International Hospital, a subsidiary of Reddington Hospital, are Nigerians who had\n\ntrained and worked abroad, but who have now decided to return home because of the availability of healthcare facilities with standard equipment and a good work environment.\n\nThe Minister said the Federal Government, through the Central Bank of Nigeria and the Bank of Industry, provided financial support for Duchess International Hospital, as part of its intervention in the health sector.\n\n\u201cThis is not new. Recall that in the wake of Covid-19, the CBN set up the N100 billion Healthcare Sector Intervention Fund, now expanded to N200 billion, to provide credit support for the healthcare sector through long-term, low-cost financing,\u201d he said, listing other interventions by the Federal Government, through the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority, NSIA, as including a total of $22.5 million which was spent in establishing two diagnostic centres in Kano and Umuahia ($5.5 million each) and the NSIA-LUTH Cancer Centre in Lagos ($11.5 million)\n\n\u201cThe essence of these financial interventions and projects in the critical healthcare sector is to fast-track the evolvement of world class healthcare facilities like the Duchess International Hospital.\n\n\u201cWith that, we can conserve our foreign reserves, earn foreign exchange for the country, create jobs, reverse brain drain, become a destination for medical tourists and also ensure affordable and standard healthcare for Nigerians,\u201d he said.\n\nMohammed commended the management of the hospital for making their world class services affordable and accessible to ordinary Nigerians, particularly with the launching of the \u2018World Class Affordable Healthcare Programme that coincided with the visit of the Minister and the over 30 journalists who accompanied him on the tour.\n\n\u201cWith what we have seen here today and the programme that has just been launched, Nigerians can now get access to affordable and world class treatment in whatever is ailing them in many areas, including emergency medicine, women\u2019s health, paediatric care, cardiovascular medicine, kidney dialysis, dental treatment, eye care, etc,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Minister said the visit to the hospital was in continuation of the media tour of the development projects of the Buhari Administration, disclosing that in the past 40 days, he had taken the media on a tour of the Dangote Refinery and Petrochemical Project as well as the Dangote Fertilizer Company in Lagos; the Lekki Deep Seaport and the Duchess Hospital, in addition to the tour of road, rail, bridge and other projects across the country.\n\nThe essence of these tours he further explained was to showcase what the present administration has achieved in the various sectors adding that even where the project was private-sector driven, the Federal Government has either provided the enabling environment or, in some cases, supported such projects with funding,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his remarks, the Chief Executive Officer of the hospital, Dr. Tokunbo Shitta-Bey, who conducted the Minister round the hospital, said the multi-specialist hospital, which was already attracting foreigners coming for treatment, is poised to make its advanced elite service affordable and accessible to Nigerians, who would pay only N5,000 for registration and 5,000 for consultation.",

          "text": "By Kehinde Ibrahim, Lagos\n\nHALO Financial Services Ltd, a fintech start-up has launched with an innovative approach to help Nigerians manage and grow their money.\n\nSpeaking at a media round table to introduce the company, the Chief Executive Officer and co-founder, Chidimma Onyeokoro disclosed that Halo enables communities to provide financial services to their members. Halo defines a community as any group of people with defined membership and identifiable leadership. This includes professional or trade associations, cooperatives, social clubs, unions, even old boys and girls associations and more. Community members are able to leverage the strength of their union for better financial returns. By focusing on communities, Halo will be able to scale faster.\n\nShe said, \u201cNigerians, have always understood that we progress faster when we do things together. From traditional groups savings schemes like \u2018ajo\u2019, to communities putting money together for community development projects, even friends pooling resources to help one of their squad. There\u2019s strength in numbers. We are using technology to harness that strength to drive wealth creation for individuals through their communities.\u2019\n\nAccording to her, trust is the bedrock of all financial services. By leveraging existing trust networks, Halo will be able to reach more people with the products, tools and knowledge to meet their wealth creation goals.\n\n\u2018One key differentiator for us is that we hold two licenses.

This is addition to his huge investments in education, agriculture, security and infrastructural developments. The World Bank accountability ranking of states in Nigeria evaluated Kogi as 2nd in 2017, 1st in 2018 and 2019.\n\n\u201cThe draft report for 2021 shows that Kogi scored 100 per cent in all the areas and from indications, the state will maintain the first position in 2021, judging from the draft report that was released just yesterday.\n\n\u201cI am proud of GYB because of his development records in Kogi. This is a governor that is always looking for progress and the development of lives of his people. This is me, a Yoruba, supporting someone from North Central.\n\n\u201cThere is no progress without demands, I lost my both parents, though unfortunately, because Nigerians believed in them. I\u2019ve been working with GYB for a while and I have seen that he has the courage and intelligence to deliver Nigeria.\u201d\n\nShe said as one of the foremost presidential aspirants of the party, Governor Bello had reached out to party stakeholders in nearly all parts of the country, adding that he stands a better chance to clinch the party\u2019s ticket than others.\n\nThe Director-General said, in terms of insecurity, the governor had been able to bring down the crime rates to the barest minimum, adding that through a well crafted management system, he had united all the groups in the multi-ethnic state.\n\nAbiola-Costello said the campaign team of Governor Bello had been interfacing with critical stakeholders of APC to present his development credentials, which would be replicated at the federal level.\n\n\u201cGoing into the presidential primaries, we are on a good footing. If you plant a good seed very early, you will reap better than those who plant late,\u201d she noted.",

          "text": "Ukrainian troops counter-attacking against Russian forces in the country\u2019s northeast have pushed them back from the city of Kharkiv and advanced as far as the border with Russia, Ukrainian officials said on Monday.\n\nThe developments, if confirmed, would signal a further shift in momentum in favour of Ukrainian forces nearly three months into a conflict that began when Russia sent tens of thousands of troops over the border into Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\nMoscow meanwhile warned of \u201cfar-reaching consequences\u201d should Finland and Sweden go ahead with plans to join the NATO military alliance \u2013 a change in the Nordic countries\u2019 long-standing policy of neutrality brought on by concern about Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s wider ambitions.\n\nFighting was reported near Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city, on Monday in what interior ministry adviser Vadym Denisenko said was \u201cour counter-offensive\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt can no longer be stopped\u2026Thanks to this, we can go to the rear of the Russian group of forces,\u201d he said.\n\nKharkiv, lying about 30 miles (50 km) from the border with Russia, had endured weeks of heavy bombardments from Russian artillery. The Russians\u2019 routing from there follows their failure to capture the capital Kyiv in the early stages of the war.\n\nHowever, thousands of people, including many civilians, have been killed across the country, towns and cities have been blasted into ruins, and more than six million people have fled their homes to seek refuge in neighbouring states in scenes not seen in Europe since the Balkan wars of the 1990s. Russia denies targeting civilians.\n\nUkraine\u2019s defence ministry said on Monday the 227th Battalion of the 127th Brigade of Ukraine\u2019s Territorial Defence Forces had reached the border with Russia.\n\n\u201cTogether to victory!\u201d it said.\n\nKharkiv region governor Oleh Sinegubov said the troops had restored a sign on the border.\n\n\u201cWe thank everyone who, risking their lives, liberates Ukraine from Russian invaders,\u201d Sinegubov said.\n\nReuters could not immediately verify Ukraine\u2019s battlefield account and it was not clear how many troops had reached the Russian border or where.\n\nIf confirmed, it would suggest a Ukrainian counter-offensive is having increasing success in pushing back Russian forces in the northeast after Western military agencies said Moscow\u2019s offensive in two eastern provinces known as the Donbas had stalled.\n\nNonetheless, the governor of the Luhansk region in Donbas, Serhiy Gaidai, said the situation \u201cremains difficult\u201d, with Russian forces trying to capture the town of Sieverodonetsk.\n\nHe said leaders of the Lugansk People\u2019s Republic, the territory in Luhansk controlled by Russian-backed separatists, declared a general mobilisation, adding it was \u201ceither fight or get shot, there is no other choice\u201d.\n\nIn the south, fighting was raging around the city of Kherson and Russian missiles struck residential areas of Mykolayiv, the presidential office in Kyiv said. Reuters was unable to verify the reports.\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Sunday Ukraine could win the war, an outcome few military analysts predicted when Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nEXPANDING NATO\n\nIn a blow for Russia, which has long opposed NATO expansion, Finland on Sunday confirmed it would apply to join the alliance.\n\nSweden\u2019s ruling Social Democrats also backed NATO membership, paving the way for an application and abandoning decades of military nonalignment.\n\nBut Russia\u2019s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said on Monday that Finland and Sweden were making a mistake that would have far-reaching consequences.\n\n\u201cThey should have no illusions that we will simply put up with it,\u201d Ryabkov said, quoted by the Interfax news agency.\n\n\u201cThe general level of military tension will rise, predictability in this sphere will decrease,\u201d Ryabkov said.\n\nNATO and the United States said they were confident both countries would be accepted into the alliance and that reservations from Turkey, which wants the Nordic countries to halt support for Kurdish militant groups present on their territory, could be overcome.\n\nMoscow calls its invasion of Ukraine a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d to rid the country of fascists, an assertion Kyiv and its Western allies say is a baseless pretext for an unprovoked war.\n\nSince mid-April, Russian forces have focused much of their firepower on trying to capture the Donbas. Moscow recognised the independence of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People\u2019s Republic and the Lugansk People\u2019s Republic in the Donbas days before it launched its invasion.\n\nBritish military intelligence said Russia had lost about a third of the ground combat force deployed in February, and its Donbas offensive had fallen \u201csignificantly behind schedule\u201d.\n\nFIGHTING AROUND IZIUM\n\nThe most intense fighting appeared to be around the eastern Russian-held city of Izium, where Russia said it had struck Ukrainian positions with missiles. read more\n\nRussia continued to target civilian areas along the entire frontline in Luhansk and Donetsk, firing at 23 villages and towns, Ukraine\u2019s military task force said.\n\nUkraine\u2019s military also acknowledged setbacks, saying Russian forces \u201ccontinue to advance\u201d in several areas in the Donbas region.\n\nThere was also no letup on Sunday in Russia\u2019s bombardment of the steelworks in the southern port of Mariupol, where a few hundred Ukrainian fighters are holding out weeks after the city fell into Russian hands, the Ukrainian military said.\n\nAlexander Khodakovsky, a commander of separatist forces in Donetsk, said on his Telegram channel on Monday that 10 Ukrainian fighters emerged from a tunnel at the Azovstal steel plant holding white flags. Reuters could not verify the report.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said \u201cvery difficult and delicate negotiations\u201d were going on to save Ukrainians in Mariupol and Azovstal.\n\nUkrainian troops received a morale boost from the country\u2019s win in the Eurovision song contest at the weekend, with some saying it was a sign of battlefield victories to come.\n\n\u201cWe have shown that we can not only fight, but we can also sing very nice,\u201d said Vitaliy, a soldier bunkered down north of Kyiv.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government has disclosed that French oil major, TotalEnergies EP Nigeria Limited, has invested almost $30 billion in Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas sector within the space of eight years. It said the company had made a lot of investments in developing the country\u2019s oil resources since it began operation in the last 60 years.\n\nThe government criticised Shell, ExxonMobil and Chevron \u2013 three of the five oil majors in the country \u2013 over their apparent withdrawal from investing further in Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas sector, urging them to emulate TotalEnergies\u2019 sustained investments in the country and resume their investments.\n\nExecutive Secretary of the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB), Mr. Simbi Wabote, made the assertions at the weekend in Lagos, at the TotalEnergies\u2019 EP Nigeria\u2019s 60th anniversary dinner.\n\nThe French oil giant said Nigeria remained at the heart of its strategy, and indicated plans to expand its business into the country\u2019s electricity sector. It stressed that the sector offered exciting opportunities that it would like to explore.\n\nWabote said TotalEnergies had invested immensely in Nigeria and deserved commendation for remaining consistent in investing in the country\u2019s oil sector. He said with the amount of investments TotalEnergies had put into the country\u2019s oil and gas sector since its entrance into the space, there was no basis for comparing it with that of Shell, Chevron and ExxonMobil.\n\nWabote stated, \u201cTotal has invested so much in Nigeria since the last 60 years. At the last count, we are looking at almost $30 billion worth of investment in Nigeria within a space of eight years.\n\n\u201cThe amount of money Total has invested in this country, when you compare that with other IOCs, like Shell, Chevron, ExxonMobil, there is no basis for comparison.\u201d\n\nSpecifically criticising Shell for refusing to invest to develop the protracted Bonga Southwest project, which had been on the drawing board for many decades, Wabote said on the other hand, TotalEnergies had started and completed many projects that were producing oil and gas in the country.\n\nBonga Southwest is among the oil assets that the government has been banking on to achieve its plan of increasing Nigeria\u2019s oil reserves and production.\n\nAccording to Wabote, \u201cWe started discussing Bonga Southwest before I was born, Total took FID \u2013 (Final Investment Decision) on Usan. We were still discussing Bonga Southwest when I got married, Total took FID on Egina. We were still discussing Bonga Southwest, when I had my first child, Total took FID on Ikike. I will go on and on and on.\u201d\n\nThe executive secretary argued that his job as local content chief executive would not have existed if there was no project, adding that he needs no apology for praising companies keeping him on the service through undertaking projects that create value for the country.\n\nWabote added, \u201cLet me use Total to challenge Shell. Unfortunately, I\u2019ve not seen Chevron here and I\u2019ve not seen ExxonMobil. I will use Total to continue to challenge them. Total is also one of the investors of NLNG Train 7, which is about the most important investment in the whole of the country.\n\n\u201cSo, we should understand what Total is doing. This is a celebration that we should all partake, for keeping faith in this country, remaining in this country for 60 years is no mean feat. I encourage you to, please, remain with us.\u201d\n\nIn his address, President, Exploration and Production, TotalEnergies Group, Mr. Nicolas Terraz, assured that Nigeria remained at the heart of the company\u2019s strategy, pledging to continue investing in the country. Terraz said with the company\u2019s first oil discovery in 1964, and the subsequent commencement of production from the Obagi field, TotalEnergies E&P took its first steps into a future that was yet to unfold.\n\nAccording to him, with new fields and increased productivity, the company has continued to expand and evolve, leading to its current position as the second largest operator in Nigeria, accounting for 20 per cent of the country\u2019s oil and gas production.\n\nHe maintained that TotalEnergies was a major player and a proud partner with Nigeria in developing its oil and gas sector, noting that they have developed a number of projects over the years.\n\nTerraz said the company was in the final stages of the Ikike project, a project he described as key for its Nigerian affiliate to demonstrate the viability of tie-backs to existing fields.\n\nHe stated, \u201cA lot of progress has been made, but I know there are a lot of challenges as we near the end. I am counting on the project team, and, indeed, all the affiliates, to apply yourselves to overcome these challenges and deliver the production safely.\n\n\u201cAs a company, we have shown a unique commitment to Nigeria. Indeed, the country remains at the heart of our strategy. Nigeria has a lot of potential, but as for Ikike, it is not always \u2018plain sailing\u2019, so we all have to perform at our best to continue the adventure.\u201d\n\nHe said the group had strived to become the industry benchmark for Nigerian content as demonstrated by the flagship Egina project, where they set new standards, sharing their technological expertise with the oil and gas industry.\n\nThe TotalEnergies president hailed the passage of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), saying while bringing some much-needed clarity for the industry, it has also brought changes to the regulatory, fiscal and operating environment in the country.\n\nAs a responsive organisation, Terraz said the energy group must re-engineer its processes and structure to be able to adapt and face the new challenges while taking advantage of the opportunities.\n\nTerraz expressed excitement at the opportunities that abounded in Nigeria, and indicated the intention of TotalEnergies to expand into the Nigerian electricity sector.\n\nHe noted that considering the increasing energy demand of a rapidly growing population and the need to address climate change, their objective was to meet energy needs through an energy mix that was less carbon intensive.\n\nHe stated, \u201cOf course, we continue to believe in hydrocarbons. Gas development for NLNG and domestic usage will remain a bedrock of our activities while we concentrate our investments in low cost, low emission oil.\n\n\u201cElectricity offers an exciting opportunity in Nigeria, and it is an area which we would like to explore while also expanding the scope of our company to renewables. I know you are working on this.\u201d\n\nSpeaking also, Managing Director of TotalEnergies EP Nigeria and Chairman of TotalEnergies Companies in Nigeria, Mr. Mike Sangster, said the company would continue to collaborate with the government, its partners, and other stakeholders to help to further develop the country\u2019s huge hydrocarbon potential.\n\nSangster said TotalEnergies was proud to be the second largest oil and gas producer in Nigeria, contributing 20 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s oil production. He said behind the numbers were over 1,166 Nigerian workforce, several billion dollars\u2019 investments into the Nigerian economy in recent years, and five production sites.\n\nSangster added that the partnership between TotalEnergies and Nigeria had been a very successful one, pointing out, however, that the journey has not always been smooth.\n\nHe singled out security as a very serious issue currently facing the company that needed to be addressed by the authorities, noting that the situation \u201cis greatly reducing our onshore production.\n\n\u201cSo, we have had our fair share of challenges to overcome, but what I\u2019ve seen personally over the past three years is that when our teams, all our teams, put their heads together, there is no problem that cannot be resolved.\u201d\n\nOn her part, Managing Director, Deepwater Operation, Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCO), Mrs. Elohor Aiboni, while reacting to the challenge Wabote posed to Shell and other IOCs, stated that it was not only for Shell but for all IOCs existing in Nigeria.\n\nNoting that Nigeria was a good place to do business, Aiboni stated that they looked forward to more investments from all IOCs.",
