          "text": "The Umbrella body of Yoruba Self-Determination Groups, Ilana Omo Oodua, has released a manual for any persons willing to join or champion the Yoruba Nation agitation.\n\nThe 37-page manual, exclusively obtained by The PUNCH, contained the dos and don\u2019ts for agitators, including the reason for the agitation.\n\nThis is coming barely three days after a Yoruba Nation activist, Sunday Igboho was arrested at the airport in Benin\u2019s capital Cotonou.\n\nSigned by its leader, Professor Emeritus Banji Akintoye, the manual also contained conditions that must be met when holding a rally or protest.\n\nIt explained that the need for collaboration between Yoruba Nation and other self-determination groups across the world.\n\n\u201cThe following is a guide or manual for the use of all Yoruba patriots engaged in the struggle for Yoruba self-determination. It supplies to all supporters of the self-determination struggle the kinds of information that they will need to prosecute the struggle; and it supplies guides to the struggle\u2019s strategies and methods,\u201d part of the manual read.\n\nThe manual also provided the basic details of the Yoruba nation\u2019s reasons, part of which were given as \u201cthe Yoruba people\u2019s devastating experiences in Nigeria, the progressive (and now almost total) destruction of democracy in Nigeria, the primitive and blood-curdling agenda of ethnic cleansing and genocide in Nigeria, the constant human brutalisation, pains and death and regime of crimes against humanity in Nigeria\u201d.\n\nPart of the manual read, \u201cWe, Yoruba, lead in the choice of the peaceful and law-abiding path to our goal of a separate country of our own. And we the servants of the Yoruba nation in this struggle faithfully operate, and will always faithfully operate, with methods of peaceful organization, peaceful demands, peaceful propaganda, peaceful protests, peaceful legal actions, peaceful political persuasion, and peaceful negotiation.\n\n\u201cWe will push for negotiating tables, and never push for street brawls or any other kind of conflicts. And if we find, among our people, any nationalist activist person or group that is inclined towards violence, we will encourage them to turn instead to peaceful and law-abiding means.\n\n\u201cAfter careful studies of the records of separatist movements in our world, we are persuaded that the peaceful approach is more likely to succeed. Various nationalist agitations in various countries of the world have, in the course of the past century, employed violent means at various times while striving to achieve their nationalist goals.\n\n\u201cYoruba groups engaged in serving the Yoruba nation need to note carefully that none of these uses of violent or terroristic methods achieved their purpose of self-determination or autonomy for their nations; all they succeeded in doing was to generate confrontations and wars with the governments of their countries.\n\n\u201cYoung nationalist agitators, being young, are naturally attracted to tough and rough activism. From only proudly proclaiming the virtues of their own nations, youthful nationalist activists commonly tend to lapse into insulting other nations, into needless bragging and boasting, into daring or challenging other nations, or even into daring and challenging their country and its government \u2013 all of which actions tend to provoke avoidable conflicts, hostile governmental actions, and even wars. Our Yoruba youths must learn the truth that the use of rough and violent means does not usually confer success \u2013 and, indeed, that it is usually more likely to prevent success.\n\n\u201cEmulating the kind of peaceful processes employed by nationalist movements that have achieved various grades of success in our times \u2013the Scots, Welsh, French Canadians, Czechs, Slovaks, Timor Leste and others \u2013 our various Yoruba self-determination groups and organizations must operate peacefully. Altogether, we Yoruba must demonstrate our Yoruba nation\u2019s civilization and maturity, while resolutely and irrepressibly pushing our way forward to the great goal of Yoruba strength, self-determination, self-fulfillment and prosperity.\u201d",

          "title": "Organised public demonstration: objecting to official policy is lawful",
          "text": "By Aare Afe Babalola, SAN,\n\nThe Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended), under Section 40 thereof, guarantees the right of every person to peaceful assembly and to associate with other persons.\n\nHowever, going by historical antecedents, this right is one of the most abused in Nigeria. And all demonstrations, particularly when such is perceived as anti-government, have been met with stiff oppositions by armed law enforcement officials, usually with the mandate to disperse such public remonstrations by all means necessary.\n\nIn view of this, I will, in this edition, examine the legal, practical, and statutory framework of the constitutionally guaranteed right to peaceful assembly within the Nigerian polity.\n\nHistory of protests in Nigeria: Protests and agitations are intrinsic to the Nigerian system of governance and from the pre-and post-colonial, pre-and post-independence epochs, protests and direct confrontations with the traditional or political class are the veritable tools of the masses to voice out their discontent against injustice, ineptitude, insecurity, and economic fails. However, these actions have either resulted in a definitive, anticipated change or have further sparked an even bigger chain of reactions.\n\nBack in the Old Oyo Empire, the Alaafin of Oyo was then a very powerful monarch, but the system of government rested on the Ogboni to avoid excesses by the Alaafin. The Ogboni played this role very well to the extent that when an Alaafin flouts the separation of powers in place; he is sent a calabash, which by implication is an order to commit suicide. This was the very case of Alaafin Aole when he was sent a calabash in 1817 by his famous war general Afonja, who felt he was a weakling and unfit to rule.\n\nALSO READ: Rape: We vow to end growing culture of silence \u2014 NCAC, DVRST\n\nBetween 1925 and 1930, women in the Eastern region of colonial Nigeria stood their ground and kicked against the intolerable tax levy imposed by the colonial government. Since protests of this kind were unheard of prior to this time, many women were assaulted, beaten, and arrested.\n\nAs soon as this protest started, news soon got to Aba on December 6, 1929, leading to the famous Aba Women\u2019s Riot. Simultaneously, the entire Eastern region was engulfed by protests ably led by women. In October 1946, the Abeokuta Ladies Club under the leadership of Madame Olufunmilayo Ransome-Kuti submitted a list of demands to the Alake of Egbaland, Oba Sir Ladapo Ademola II and one of their demands was the abolition of tax on women in Abeokuta among other issues around their welfare.\n\nTheir demands were ignored; Madame Olufunmilayo was arrested and fined 3000 Pounds or risk going to prison. On November 29, 1947, she led a protest of 10,000 women to the palace of the Alake of Egbaland. They camped around the palace for more than two days, sleeping, cooking, and conducting all their affairs around the palace grounds. The pressure was so huge on the colonial government that they had to abolish the tax laws and the Alake of Egbaland abdicated the throne on January 3, 1949.\n\nThe #EndSARS protest was, by and large, a unanimous voice of Nigerians against police brutality and extra-judicial killings. For days, it was peaceful until the night when the protesters were reportedly attacked. The recent protests and agitations held in Lagos for the declaration of the Yoruba nation was reportedly marked by heavy police presence set to quell the protests, and the reported killing of a girl by a stray bullet. Against these historical antecedents, it is pertinent to review the Nigerian statutory regime on protests and peaceful assembly.\n\nStatutory regimes on the right to protest: Without a doubt, protests play an important part in the civil, political, economic, social, and cultural life of all societies. As seen from history, protests have more often than not inspired positive social changes and improved protection of human rights, and they continue to help define and protect civic space in all parts of the world. Protests encourage the development of an engaged and informed citizenry and strengthen representative democracy by enabling direct participation in public affairs.\n\nThey enable individuals and groups to express dissent and grievances, to share views and opinions, to expose flaws in governance, and to publicly demand that the authorities and other powerful entities rectify problems and are accountable for their actions. This is especially important for those whose interests are otherwise poorly represented or marginalized. In the Nigerian context, it is important to review the statutory backing, international and local, on the right to peaceful assembly and protests.\n\nBesides the 1999 Constitution, the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ICCPR, to which Nigeria is a State Party, equally governs the right of peaceful assembly and protests. Article 21 of the ICCPR provides that: The right of peaceful assembly shall be recognized. No restrictions may be placed on the exercise of this right other than those imposed in conformity with the law and which are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, public order (ordre public), the protection of public health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\n\nArticle 11 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights makes similar provisions.\n\nNotwithstanding these, the Public Order Act, 1979 was promulgated to regulate assemblies in Nigeria. While section 1(2) of the Act mandates the grant of a license by the Governor of a State in order to hold peaceful protests, section 2 empowers the police to stop any assembly for which no license has been issued. Fortunately, the provision of the Public Order Act has received judicial interpretation in the case of Inspector General of Police v. All Nigeria Peoples Party & Ors. (2007) 18 NWLR (Pt.1066) 457 C.A wherein the Court of Appeal held to the effect that the issuance of licenses is no longer mandatory to hold peaceful protests in Nigeria, except the organisers wish to receive police protection. The Court held, in the following words:\n\nThe Public Order Act should be promulgated to complement sections 39 and 40 of the Constitution in context and not to stifle or cripple it. A rally or placard carrying demonstration has become a form of expression of views on current issues affecting government and the governed in a sovereign state. It is a trend recognised and deeply entrenched in the system of governance in civilised countries \u2013 it will not only be primitive but also retrogressive if Nigeria continues to require a pass to hold a rally. We must borrow a leaf from those who have trekked the rugged path of democracy and are now reaping the dividend of their experience (italics added for emphasis).\n\nALSO READ: Tunisia sacks health minister as COVID-19 cases spike\n\nThe use of firearms in curbing peaceful protests: International Law imposes a duty on the State and its law enforcement agencies to facilitate the enjoyment of the right of peaceful assembly. Accordingly, the 1990 United Nations Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials provides that: In the dispersal of assemblies that are unlawful but non-violent, law enforcement officials shall avoid the use of force or, where that is not practicable, shall restrict such force to the minimum extent necessary. Notwithstanding this provision, Section 73 of the Criminal Code Act essentially empowers the police to \u201cuse all such force as is reasonably necessary\u201d towards ensuring the dispersal of protesters; and where such force occasions harm or death to any person, the police officers shall not be liable in any criminal or civil proceeding.\n\nConclusion: Certainly, a greater injustice is done to a people whose rights to voice out their discontent against the leadership, particularly in a democratic society, is forcefully quashed. The government\u2019s usual recourse to force of arms has constantly received a backlash from the international community. The 2019 Freedom House Index Report noted that \u201cRights groups have criticized federal and state governments for prohibiting or dispersing protests that are critical of authorities or associated with controversial groups like the Islamic Movement of Nigeria, IMN, and the separatist group Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB. In October 2018, soldiers responded to rock-throwing protesters from the IMN in Abuja, who were protesting the continued detention and charges against Ibrahim El-Zakzaky, by opening fire and killing as many as 45 people.\n\nReports such as this do not portray the most populous black nation \u2013 Nigeria \u2013 in the positive limelight in the international community. I, therefore, invite the government to take proactive steps in fostering a major review of the law, operational guidelines, and strategies in managing protests in Nigeria; to adopt international best practices, and to live by the wordings of the commencing statement of the Constitution which boldly declares that: \u201cto live in unity and harmony as one indivisible and indissoluble sovereign nation under God dedicated to the promotion of inter-African solidarity, world peace, international cooperation, and understanding\u201d.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Samuel Oamen\n\nFounder of The Living Faith Church International aka Winners\u2019 Chapel Bishop David Oyedepo has broken his silence on the recent sack of over 40 pastors by the church.\n\nHe was reacting to allegation by one of the affected Pastors, Peter Godwin, that they were sacked for not generating enough income.\n\nGodwin, who was in one of the church\u2019s branches in Ekiti State, had claimed: \u201cI was told by the management that the church doesn\u2019t operate at a loss.\n\n\u201cThey also told me that the total income that is being generated from my station should be able to cater for my welfare and accommodation, so as a result of low income, I\u2019m hereby dismissed.\u201d\n\nNigerians reacted massively to the issue on social media with some stating it was within the rights of the church to hire and fire while others said the church was wrong to use income generation to evaluate pastors.\n\nSpeaking to the church on the matter, Oyedepo said the sacked pastors were \u201cunfruitful and blatant failure.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe said: \u201cPeople are confused about our Ministry. I learnt some fellows said, \u201cyou know, they are not bringing income, that is why they asked them to go\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe asked you to go because you are unfruitful. Unfruitful! Blatant failure. Doing what there? We have no patience with failure here.\n\n\u201cWhen we employed 7,000 people at a time, social media was dead.\n\n\u201cWe have more employees in this organisation than most of the states.

          "text": "From Alloyuius Attah, Obinna Odogwu, Awka, and Solomon Mokwugwo\n\nFresh facts have revealed that neither the chieftain of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Chris Uba, nor any member of his family has a link with the Anambra State Goveror, Chief Willie Obiano.Findings conducted by Daily Sun show that the Ubas are doing everything within their power to ensure the victory of PDP in the November governorship election.\n\nMeanwhile a chieftain of the PDP in Onitsha North Local Government Area of Anambra State, Chris Mba, has accused those he called intruders as trying to derail the party\u2019s march to victory in the November 6 Governorship poll.\n\nHe stated that it was those people who did not really know what the party stood for that were fanning insinuation that the leader of the party, Chief Chris Uba, and his brother, Ugochukwu, were paid to distort the efforts of the state chapter of the party to reclaim the State.\n\nMba, who is secretary of the Chris Uba faction of the party in Onitsha North LGA, said that the former BoT member had made enormous contribution to the PDP, that no amount of blackmail could diminish.\n\nHe maintained that the party, with Sen. Ugochukwu Uba as governorship candidate, would win the election.\n\n\u201cWhat our leader, Chief Chris Uba, has been doing in the PDP is to strengthen the internal democratic process of the party, by insisting on due process. Uba has been the leader of PDP in Anambra for a long time, till intruders infiltrated the party and hijacked it.\n\n\u201cSince Uba held sway as leader of the party, the party had been winning governorship elections. But since people that think they\u2019re wise infiltrated, the party started losing governorship elections in Anambra. The problem had continued for 16 years now.\n\n\u201cNow that Uba, in his magnanimity, opted to salvage the party; to help the party win the November 9 governorship election in the state, people start calling him names. He is a founding member of PDP. He had been a BoT member. He contributed meaningfully in financing the party. What has he not done for PDP?\n\n\u201cIt beats my imagination that people, in their right senses, would say that someone paid Chris Uba and Senator Ugochukwu Uba to destabilise PDP. Uba sees the party as his belonging, and he protects it with jealousy. He cannot frustrate the party.\n\n\u201cHow much is somebody going to pay Senator Ugochukwu Uba to destroy his party? How much is somebody going to give Chris Uba? Have you not been hearing about those names? Who do you think will bribe them? I am sure those raising the allegation are the people that have taken bribe.\n\n\u201cAs far as I am concerned, Sen. Ugochukwu Uba, is the most credible person so far in the race for Anambra governorship. He was rightly nominated by the PDP, and he is in the race to win. Those crying foul are PDP members, who do not want to do things the right way,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Senator Ugochukwu Uba has said that he was all out to win the election in order to develop Anambra.\n\nA High Court sitting in Awka, the state capital, had ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to publish Uba\u2019s name as the governorship candidate of the PDP which Mr Valentine Ozigbo is also laying claim to.\n\nThe duo had won elections at parallel primary polls of the party held at different locations in the capital city and subsequently approached the courts to determine who should actually fly the party\u2019s flag.\n\nUba, who spoke through his media aide, Uchem Obi, a lawyer, said that he was positive about winning the election.\n\n\u201cHe is as positive as any man who wants to give his best in a political race. He will do his best, carry his campaigns to the grassroots, explain to the voters his manifesto \u2013 what he wants to do for them, what makes him better than the other candidates.\n\n\u201cWinning a governorship campaign is all about enlisting the people, campaigning very well and talking to the real voters and that\u2019s what the senator is planning to do\u201d, Obi said.\n\nHe said that Ugochukwu Uba\u2019s experience would come handy both in the campaign and actual governance having won election before and represented the people of Anambra South Senatorial Zone meritoriously.\n\n\u201cNot only that, Senator Ugochukwu Uba holds a Masters Degree in Comparative Government and Public Administration and holds a Ph.D in Local Government Administration and Public Administration.\n\n\u201cAnd for years he has been a lecturer, teaching the dynamics of governance to his students. And he has served the military regimes, served civilian governors, served as two-time commissioner in Anambra State; served as two-time DG in the state, and gone to the senate.\n\n\u201cSo, I will say that he is in a comfortable terrain. He is in a terrain he understands very well and he will make a difference. He understands what to do to convince the voters. And as a governor, he will do better than he did when he went to the senate\u201d, Obi said.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

There was a burial in Torkula and people who were coming back from the burial came under attack and about five people were killed.\n\n\u201cAt about 10pm, yesterday, there was another attack at Branch Ude where about eight people were killed, totalling about 13 people, only yesterday.\n\n\u201cTwo people were injured according to the information I received, and they are now receiving treatment in the hospital,\u201d Aba said.\n\nWhen contacted, Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Catherine Anene, said she was yet to be briefed on the attack and promised to call Daily Sun back as soon as she gets the information.\n\nIn a related development, several people are feared killed in a renewed communal crisis between Ochoro and Bonta communities of Konshisha Local Government Area of Benue State.\n\nSometime in April, this year, the Bonta-Okpute crisis escalated resulting in the killing of 12 soldiers who were deployed to the area to maintain peace and order.\n\nThis eventually led to the military sacking Bonta and adjourning communities to recover arms of the murdered soldiers.\n\nThere had been normalcy in the area since then until this fresh crisis in Ochoro, a neighbouring village, on Monday, in which local sources alleged that over 30 persons, including children and women were killed.\n\nAlso, our sources who did not want to be named, claimed that 50 houses were also burnt in the crisis.\n\nWhen contacted by telephone, Chairman of Oju LGA, Clement Ona, said although he was aware of the crisis, it didn\u2019t happen in his council, but in Konshisha LGA.\n\nOn his part, Council Chairman of Konshisha, James Ijirgba, confirmed the fresh crisis in his council, but added that he was awaiting a full briefing by the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) in the area.\n\nPolice Public Relations Officer (PPRO) in Benue, DSP Catherine Anene, said she was yet to be briefed on the crisis.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "title": "EIU Report: FG May Raise VAT to 15% Before 2025",
          "text": "*Govt\u2019s tax take among world\u2019s lowest, undermined by widespread evasion, large informal sector\n\nDike Onwuamaeze\n\nA report by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), London, has predicted that the federal government might effect a 100 per cent rate increase in the Value Added Tax (VAT) from the current rate of 7.5 per cent to 15 per cent before 2025 in order to raise government\u2019s revenue.\n\nThe report titled, \u201cCountry Report Nigeria,\u201d stated that the anticipated increase in VAT was inevitable given the rising public debt burden and the likelihood that the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) might not be able to deliver considerable increase in government\u2019s revenue.\n\nIt also stated that the predicted VAT increase would be implemented instalmentally in 2022, 2024 and 2025.\n\nThe report from the research arm of The Economist magazine explained: \u201cWe expect three equal VAT rate increases, taking the rate to 15 per cent by 2025. The first is expected in 2022, prior to the next elections but seemingly inevitable given a rising debt burden, with further rises in 2024 and 2025. Even then we expect fiscal revenue to peak at just five per cent of the GDP in 2024, which also assumes no fuel subsidies beyond 2022.\n\n\u201cThe federal government\u2019s tax take is among the world\u2019s lowest, undermined by widespread evasion and a large informal sector. The PIB is likely to be balanced between the interests of the treasury and investors, and so not deliver a considerable increase in revenue.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the VAT, currently at 7.5 per cent, is likely to be used as a means of repairing the public finances.\u201d\n\nThe report also projected that public finances would remain in deficit between 2021 and 2025, because an average global crude oil price of $63.8/barrel in 2021-25, which makes up for more than 50 per cent of the federal government\u2019s retained income, would be insufficient to balance the budget.\n\nIt added that the percentage of public debt to the GDP would stand at 35.4 per cent of the GDP in 2025.\n\n\u201cOverall, we expect the fiscal deficit to narrow to 3.3 per cent of GDP in 2021 (from 3.7 per cent of the GDP in 2020) as international oil prices rise.\n\n\u201cAlso, the VAT rate increases and rising oil prices will push down the deficit to 2.6 per cent of the GDP in 2023-24, but a decline in average global oil prices in 2025 will cause the shortfall to widen to 3.0 per cent of the GDP in that year.\n\n\u201cThe government has raised its public debt limit to 40 per cent of GDP to incorporate higher budget shortfalls over the medium term and to accommodate securitisation of the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s deficit-financing as long-term debt. We expect public debt to reach only 35.4 per cent of the GDP in 2025,\u201d the report added.\n\nIt further projected that, \u201chigh debt-servicing costs, a large public wage bill, and the purchase of COVID-19 vaccines will elevate expenditure. Capital investment will be emphasised to compensate for the disappearance of petrol subsidies once the PIB is enacted (which is expected in late 2021).\n\n\u201cThe government will justify price deregulation by promising to invest the savings in infrastructure and will face pressure to match rhetoric with action.\u201d\n\nThe report also identified price controls on petrol prices and electricity tariffs as another important area of focus, stressing that in spite of the astonishing is lacking.\u201d\n\nIt, however, hinged the hope of market-determined petrol pump price on the Dangote Refinery, a new 650,000-barrel/day refinery near Lagos expected to come on-stream in 2022.\n\nIt, therefore, opined that Nigeria\u2019s economic policy choices would be skewed, \u201ctowards protectionism and, for reasons of incompatibility will lean away from internationalism,\u201d even though the country would remain a major player in Africa, given its size.\n\nIt added: \u201cLand borders that were closed to goods since late 2019 have reopened, but Nigeria\u2019s approach to encouraging regional trade will be minimalist, beyond its obligations under the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCTFA).\n\n\u201cThe trade pact compels Nigeria to eliminate 97 per cent of tariff lines over the next five to 10 years. This deadline will not be met zealously, given high prices in Nigeria and declining external competitiveness for industries that could otherwise benefit from regional market access.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Corporation pays N225.5bn into joint account\n\n*Deficit may hit N820.6bn by year end\n\n*Brent rises to $71pb\n\nBy Emmanuel Addeh\n\nThe statutory payments made by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) to the Federation Account, a joint pool operated by the local, state and federal governments, declined by over 63 per cent in the first five months of 2021, documents obtained by THISDAY have indicated.\n\nAn analysis of the data presented by the national oil company to the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC), in the first five months of this year showed that of the calendarised total sum of N613.834 billion, the corporation was only able to remit N225.852 billion.\n\nThe documents obtained from one of the federal ministries showed that N387.982 billion remained unpaid during the period under consideration, representing about 63.21 per cent actual budgetary forecast.\n\nAccording to the NNPC/ FAAC data, while the corporation was expected to pay a net amount of N122.767 billion monthly into the federation account, it was only able to remit N90.860 billion in January, N64.161 billion in February and N41.184 billion in March.\n\nBut as it earlier announced, the national oil company was unable to make any payment into the federation account in April, while a paltry N29.647 billion was remitted in May.\n\nAs exclusively reported by THISDAY earlier in the month, the corporation said it would deduct N114.337 billion from the June federation proceeds at a meeting, which took place last week.\n\nThe documents showed that N225.852 billion was remitted as of May, while a projected N820.684 billion shortage of the net total forecast of N1.473 trillion for 2021 might be recorded by the end of the year if the current challenges continue.\n\nWhile there might be other ancillary issues leading to the inability of the corporation to meet its obligation to the three tiers of government, the NNPC has had to deal with the major challenge of shouldering the government\u2019s petrol subsidy payments in the last couple of months.\n\nThe elimination of payments for what the government now terms under-recovery has been a controversial issue for decades as attempts to alter the existing arrangement has always met with stiff resistance from the labour unions, civil society organisations as well as a cross-section of Nigerians.\n\nLast year, specifically on March 19, at a time the international prices of crude oil took a downward spiral, the Muhammadu Buhari-led administration had announced the total deregulation of the downstream petroleum sector.\n\nHowever, there has been a rollback of that policy following the gradual recovery of the price of the commodity in the international market, which has invariably affected the pump price of fuel in the country.\n\nIn all, added to the funding of its ongoing major projects, payment for under-recovery, among others, the funding performance of the corporation showed that as of May, N1.088 trillion had been disbursed by the NNPC, including N195.652 billion in January and N191.194 billion in February.\n\nIn March, also, N224.589 billion was distributed, while in April and May, N156.366 billion and N320 billion were disbursed respectively.\n\nThe Group General Manager, NNPC, Mallam Mele Kyari, in March, said the federal government was subsidising petrol with about N120 billion monthly, describing the development as unsustainable.\n\nHe said while the actual cost of importation and handling charges amounted to N234 per litre, the government had been selling at N162 per litre, therefore, bearing the cost burden.\n\nHe said the NNPC could no longer afford to bear the cost, saying Nigerians would have to pay the actual cost sooner or later. But the government has since then said it was in negotiations with organised labour on the matter.\n\nOn June 30, the NNPC boss revealed that the price of the product had further skyrocketed and that without subsidy, petrol would be selling at N256 per litre at the filling stations.\n\nAt the time Kyari spoke, crude oil was selling for $74.40 per barrel at the international market. It has since then hit a high of $77, before slumping below $70 on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nMeanwhile, yesterday, the Brent crude sustained its upswing rising from $69.05 per barrel to close at $71.02 per barrel.\n\nThe price rally was in reaction to an industry report which showed an unexpected build-up in US oil inventories last week, which heightened worries about a resurgence in COVID-19 infections potentially dampening fuel demand.\n\nEarlier, a deal by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC,) and its allies, known as OPEC+ to boost supply by 400,000 bpd each month from August through December, sparked an oil price slump on Monday, exacerbated by demand fears with cases of the Delta variant of the coronavirus picking up in major markets.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Air Force Chief: Threats by Bandits Require Robust Security Architecture",
          "text": "*Hints personnel energised by survived pilot\u2019s heroism\n\nKingsley Nwezeh\n\nThe Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Oladayo Amao, yesterday, said the present security challenges in the country required robust security architecture and a versatile air force capable of rapid air power deployment across the theatres of war.\n\nSpeaking against the backdrop of concerns that bandits and terrorists had acquired the capacity to bring down fighter planes, Amao, who was addressing troops in Maiduguri, Borno State, during the Sallah celebration said, the security threat confronting the nation required robust security architecture capable of rapid deployment of air power.\n\nHe allayed fears over the vulnerability of the fighter planes, insisting that the air force pilots were equipped for such encounters with adversaries hence downing of the war planes by bandits and insurgents were not regular occurrences.\n\nHe, however, said air force personnel were energised by the heroism of Flight Lieutenant Abayomi Dairo, who survived the air crash in Zamfara State by ejecting from the aircraft and wading through strongholds of bandits to safety.\n\nAmao, who celebrated sallah with troops in company with the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Faruk Yahaya said, \u201cThe security threats currently facing the nation and the challenges therein required the emplacement of a robust security architecture capable of rapid employment of air power in all spectrums of warfare.\n\n\u201cThe paradigm shift in the way air warfare is waged in the fulfillment of mission objectives necessitates a highly versatile air force capable of executing a wide range of airpower roles across multiple theatres of operation to deal with these security threats\u201d.\n\nHe said the collaborative efforts between the NAF and sister agencies, which had enhanced operational effectiveness of the entire (AFN) contributed in minimising the threats posed by insurgents.\n\nAmao, therefore, assured the troops that the NAF would continue to enhance its synergy with other arms of the military and security agencies while leveraging each other\u2019s capabilities to secure the nation.\n\nIn a chat with THISDAY, Spokesman of the Air Force, Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet, said the air force was aware of the lethal weapons wielded by bandits and insurgents, insisting that pilots were equipped for such eventualities.\n\n\u201cThe likelihood of bandits possessing such weapons have always been considered and the NAF have been aware of the lethality of these weapons. Our pilots have also been trained to guard against such attacks hence the reason why we haven\u2019t had this type of situation in the past until last Sunday\u201d, he said.\n\nGabkwet maintained that Dairo\u2019s heroism was a pointer to the determination of the air force chief to fight until the criminal elements were defeated.\n\n\u201cSo, there is nothing to worry about as the NAF is fully prepared to deal with the situation. The sheer bravity of Flight Lieutenant Dairo in the face of glaring danger recently has energised our personnel. Dairo\u2019s heroism should also convince Nigerians that the NAF under Air Marshal Oladayo Amao will continue to fudge on until these criminals are brought to their knees,\u201d he said.\n\nA statement issued by the air force also said the coming together of the two service chiefs to celebrate Sallah with troops in Maiduguri \u201cwas a demonstration of the jointness at the highest echelon of the Armed Forces of Nigeria (AFN) by the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lt. Gen. Faruk Yahaya and Chief of Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Oladayo Amao, who feted personnel of the Air Component of Operation HADIN KAI (OPHK) to a buffet lunch at Maiduguri.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks at the lunch, the CAS captured the essence of the visit, which he said provided an opportunity to not only bond with frontline troops but also to promote comradeship and regimentation in the service.\n\nThe lunch, according to the CAS, also provided an opportunity to remember colleagues, who had paid the supreme price in the service to fatherland.\n\nWhile expressing pride in the efforts of all NAF officers, airmen and airwomen participating in internal security operations in different parts of the country, Air Marshal Amao stated that, the NAF, through the Air Component of OPHK, would continue to perform overly critical roles in providing the much-needed air support for the effective conduct of ground operations by the Land Component.\n\nOn the gallantry displayed by Fight Lieutenant Dairo, after successfully ejecting from an Alpha Jet, before it was downed by the terrorists, the CAS commended NAF and Nigerian Army personnel, who worked tirelessly to locate the crash site and the pilot\u2019s parachute, while also combing nearby locations for the pilot.\n\nOn his part, Yahaya commended the personnel for their dedication and commitment to counterinsurgency operations under OPHK.\n\nHe went down memory lane to recall his days as the Theatre Commander of OPHK, where he enjoyed unfettered access to all the platforms and facilities under the air component commander, while expressing gladness that the cooperation between the land and air component had continued even after his tenure.\n\nYahaya singled out the air power characteristics of speed and reach which, when combined with the army\u2019s ability to hold the ground as critical to bringing the current security challenges to a halt.\n\nThe service chiefs also took time off to pay a courtesy visit to the Governor of Borno State, Professor Babagana Zulum.\n\nThe governor praised both service chiefs for the synergy their joint efforts brought to the battle against insurgents in the state, while urging them to sustain the momentum.\n\nThe service chiefs were accompanied on the visit by the Theatre Commander, Maj. Gen. Chris Musa; GOC 7 Division Nigerian Army, Brig. Gen. Abdulwahab Eyitayo; Chief of Operations (Army), Maj. Gen. Olufemi Akinjobi; Chief of Training and Operations NAF, AVM James Gwani and Provost Marshal, Maj. Gen.

The University is following due process; panels have been set up to investigate her claims and the panels are yet to submit their report to the management who will consider the report. It is not something as straightforward as people are portraying it to be.

          "title": "This app wants to simplify Twitter giveaways, without bank accounts",
          "text": "Let\u2019s say I wanted to send a surprise \u2018happy birthday\u2019 cash gift to a friend; my first thought would be to ask for their bank account number. I would do this for people I know very well but also for someone I only know on social media.\n\nBut what if my virtual friend, feeling we are not buddies as such or having been scarred by online money doubling scams, hesitates to share such personal information? Can I thrill them on their special day by using public information I have about them?\n\nSometime in June, I tried Vendly, a web app that is trialling a solution for this need (or desire, if you\u2019re not yet persuaded). \u2018Payments made Social\u2019 the landing page declares on a light green background. Bob Nzelu, the brain behind it, described it to me as a way to share and receive items of digital value \u2013 money, crypto, airtime, e-tickets \u2013 over social media.\n\n\u201cLike sending money through email addresses using PayPal, Vendly hopes to replicate that using social media handles,\u201d he said.\n\nBut that is just the basic use case he anticipates, cutting in to assuage my skepticism that money transfer on social media is a compelling enough value to build a (potentially venture-backed) company on. Long-term, Vendly will help social media users monetize their social media presence, the CEO said.\n\nBack to social money vending. Nzelu believes Vendly is similar to Cash App and Venmo because it seeks to simplify transfers between people who don\u2019t know each other. \u201cVendly is not built for chummy friends who have each other\u2019s account details.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFor this type of relationship, creating a \u2018vend\u2019 with a social media handle and sharing the link with a beneficiary walks a fine line of not being too personal or invasive while caring.\n\nIt\u2019s the online equivalent of a co-worker dropping a birthday cake with a card at your desk but not inside your drawer.\n\nSomeone who receives a vend can decide to either make a claim for or ignore it by clicking the link in their DM. The message states the amount sent; recipient inputs the bank account where they want the cash to go. And like cakes, the link expires after some time (Nzelu sent me a vend of about $1 as a demo).\n\nVendly stores the recipient\u2019s bank details to make future transfers seamless but the sender never sees the account information. Because a sender can create one vend to go to multiple social media handles, Nzelu thinks it should appeal to brands or influencers who target giveaways at 3 million Nigerian social media users who have a bank account and phone number.\n\nVendly is part of a crop of social gifting apps seeking to delight people online.\n\nA few months ago, after my managing editor promised to get me a book, I got a Tweet from Showlove, a Lagos-based company, with a voucher to claim my books at a particular bookstore (thanks again, KK). Getcards, a product of the cryptocurrency startup Buycoins, was floated last December for people who want to gift services like a Netflix subscription, an Amazon or Delta airlines ticket to friends and family.\n\nLike these two services, Vendly hopes that its first platform for traction will be Twitter, because the platform is the most friendly for services that require people to click links to claim rewards.\n\nBut Nzelu knows that can\u2019t be the long-term plan. After all, Twitter is officially banned in Nigeria at the moment, an event that currently hampers Vendly\u2019s ability to be fully functional. An alternative is to send vends using phone numbers, although that option might raise privacy concerns. Integrating other platforms \u2013 Instagram, Facebook \u2013 is on their roadmap.\n\nRight now, Vendly is a prototype undergoing iteration. It may yet face hard questions about monetization, like Abeg\u2019s mobile app which launched last year to enable peer-to-peer money transfers using social handles. But Nzelu says Vendly will answer most user concerns at launch in a few weeks.\n\nHe\u2019s been working at it for two years now and feels the time is right to tap into the social and creator economy bump that started last year.

          "text": "Telecommunications infrastructure owned by several mobile network operators was severely damaged in the rampant looting and destruction of property that rocked South Africa last week.\n\nThe Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) revealed on Tuesday, July 13, that the vandalism included more than 100 mobile network towers in some parts of the country.\n\nAfter the statement, rioters destroyed many more mobile sites, according to multiple reports. Virtually all network providers operating in South Africa reported disruption to service delivery.\n\nMTN alone reported damage to over 100 of its base stations which the company\u2019s technicians could not safely reach the sites to repair.\n\n\u201cOver 1,000 MTN employees can\u2019t get to work, and millions of calls and queries from our customers cannot be attended to, as our primary call centre remains inaccessible,\u201d MTN South Africa chief executive, Godfrey Motsa, said Friday.\n\nAccording to Vodacom spokesperson, Byron Kennedy, there was a connectivity issue that affected customers in many parts of the country. Like MTN, the crisis prevented its staff from fixing a fault in its infrastructure.\n\n\u201cUnrest in these areas meant that it wasn\u2019t safe for technicians to immediately visit affected sites physically to remedy faults,\u201d Kennedy was quoted as saying by MyBroadband. An estimated five to ten of Vodacom\u2019s base stations at malls were also damaged by fires.\n\nData-only operator Rain, which has a lease agreement for using Vodacom\u2019s network towers, also said it has sites in the affected areas that had been vandalised and were down.

Hundreds of businesses have been destroyed and more than 200 people have died.\n\nSouth African authorities believe the unrest was deliberately provoked by political opponents to force president Cyril Ramaphosa to pardon Zuma or even step down.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "The Pasteur Institute in Senegal will produce rapid antigen tests for diagnosing the coronavirus disease from early 2022 with the help of a new tech transfer agreement.\n\nThe Dakar-based centre is partnering with Bionote, a South Korean company that provides diagnostic solutions for Covid-19, and Mologic, a British biotech company set to be acquired by a Bill Gates-backed consortium.\n\nAn antigen test is regarded as a suitable \u2018first line of defense\u2019 against the coronavirus disease for individuals who have symptoms. It is a simpler and quicker procedure compared to other approaches like PCR testing.\n\nA typical antigen testing takes around 15 minutes to determine whether a patient is infected, although it is less accurate than PCR, according to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nThe agreement between Pasteur and the companies was disclosed in a statement from two international health agencies, UNITAID and FIND, a global alliance for diagnostics, as reported by Reuters.\n\n\u201cHigh-quality antigen tests are the primary diagnostic tool for detecting active infection in poorer settings where molecular testing is not available,\u201d the statement read.\n\nUnder the deal, the technology and expertise for making the Covid tests will be passed from the foreign pharmaceutical giants to Pasteur\u2019s DiaTROPIX, a diagnostic test production unit launched in November. The goal is to boost Covid detection in Africa.\n\n\u201cExpanded production capacity in local and regional hubs is critical to ensuring that healthcare providers in low- and middle-income countries can implement effective testing strategies to contain the spread of the virus,\u201d UNITAID spokesman Herve Verhoosel, said.\n\nDiaTROPIX will seek regulatory approval in Senegal for the tests transferred from Mologic and Bionote and commercialise them under its own brand. It plans to make 2.5 million tests per month in 2022, according to the statement.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nUnprecedented surge in infections\n\nCompared to its regional peers like South Africa and Nigeria, Senegal has seen fewer coronavirus-related cases and deaths.\n\nDakar has so far recorded more than 52,000 infections and 1,220 deaths since the outbreak started. The numbers pale in comparison to South Africa\u2019s (2.24 million infections and 65,000+ deaths) and Nigeria\u2019s (169,000+ infections and 2,000+ deaths).\n\nHowever, the rapid antigen test deal involving the Pasteur Institute comes at a time when Senegal is grappling with soaring coronavirus cases.\n\nAccording to health ministry spokesman Mamadou Ndiaye, the West African nation was seeing an \u201cunprecedented\u201d surge in Covid infections. He said this after a new daily record of 733 cases was recorded, beating the previous record of 529 cases.\n\nMore than 25% of the 2,854 tests carried out in the past 24 hours to Wednesday came back positive, according to Ndiaye.\n\nVaccinations have been slow, making Senegal vulnerable to fresh surges. Out of over 16 million people, only 590,969 have been vaccinated. Senegal lacks enough doses to vaccinate everyone, like most African countries.\n\nSenegalese authorities are expecting 165,000 doses of the Johnson & Johnson Covid vaccine and 300,000 doses of China\u2019s Sinopharm shots, Ndiaye said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Unique and untapped\n\nFrancophone Africa is home to an island country where many African startups register their headquarters. Two days ago, this country reopened its borders to vaccinated tourists, which may include people founding new companies and seeking a tax-friendly environment.\n\nYes, Mauritius.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2019, startups and SMEs in francophone Africa received $417.9 million, according to Briter Bridges, a research firm. 89% of that money went to businesses domiciled in Mauritius.\n\nWhile it\u2019s a high-income economy, Mauritius has only about 1 million people which is not a huge market. So where does the real action happen in the region?\n\nWe\u2019ll use Partech Africa\u2019s report on venture capital funding in 2020.\n\nMorocco ($11.2m), Senegal ($8.8m), C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire ($6.5m), Algeria ($5.5m) and the Democratic Republic of Congo ($4.6m) are the top five for venture capital funding. Rounding off the region\u2019s top ten are Cameroon, Togo, Tunisia, Benin and Mauritius (startups that operate there, not just domiciled).\n\nThe $52m raised by all ten countries combined is far less than what Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, Egypt and Ghana raised.\n\n\n\nBoluwatife Sanwo/TC Insights\n\nThis is where I clarify that Partech only counts equity deals that are at least $200,000 in size; such investments must be in tech or digital startups. So there could be $15k to $50k grants or loans being written for innovative food processing companies or waste recyclers that are not captured.\n\nThat said, we can definitely say that startups in Africa\u2019s 21 french-speaking countries trail behind the top five where tech investment is concerned.\n\nIf we exclude Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, francophone Africa is a near 300 million market: the seven countries using the West Africa CFA franc (~125 million people), six Central African countries using the Central African franc (~55m people) and DR Congo which, at about 100 million, is Africa\u2019s third largest country after Nigeria and Ethiopia.\n\n[Read: A spotlight on DR Congo\u2019s early-stage tech ecosystem]\n\nSome startups have taken note of this relatively homogeneous culture and currency and leapt into the region.\n\nGozem, a ride-hailing company which also offers ecommerce services, launched in Gabon, its third francophone country, this year with eyes on Cameroon and Dr Congo. Bizao, a cross-border payment company, has stretched across 10 countries.\n\nDjamo (founders pictured at the top of today\u2019s edition) is building a finance app to cover the region and became the first francophone African startup to be accepted into Y Combinator. Two Cameroon-based fintech companies, Maviance and Diool, have raised at least $3m each this year for continental ambitions.\n\nThese ventures, it must be said, are the exception.\n\nFrancophone Africa is dogged by lack of clarity around regulations, language barriers and limited networking opportunities, per Briter Bridges report. Presidential power play in the DRC and an anglophone crisis in Cameroon are examples of the region\u2019s uncertain business climate.\n\nThese concerns will take some time to quell, so maybe unicorn bells won\u2019t ring in francophone Africa anytime soon.\n\nBut 2021 could be the region\u2019s best funding year yet; a big french bank is set to invest in a West African francophone VC fund this year, according to a source familiar with the matter. So watch out \u2013 and maybe prepare to join my plane.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood day,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nGoogle x Maliyo Games partnership\n\nNew features on Instagram and YouTube\n\nClubhouse killing invite-only feature\n\nGoogle x Maliyo partners to train 500 game developers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle has partnered with Nigeria-based gaming studio, Maliyo to organise the GameUpAfrica Bootcamp to give Africans an opportunity to be a part of the booming gaming industry.\n\nThe programme would involve training mobile game developers. Open to Kenyans, Nigerians, and Ghanaians, applications began on July 19 and will close on August 2, 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGaming has evolved from a simple way to pass the time to one of the most profitable industries in the world.\n\nFor context: In September 2013, on launch day, Grand Theft Auto V made $800 million. According to Fast Company, this is more sales in 24 hours than any movie or musical album in history.\n\nMobile gaming: Per Business Wire, the mobile gaming market was worth $98 billion globally in 2020 and is expected to grow to $272 billion by 2030.\n\nInterestingly, people play more games on mobile than personal computers (PC) and consoles. According to Kevuru games, 59.9% of games were played on mobile in 2020, while 28.70% and 16.11% were played on PC and console, respectively.\n\nWhile nothing beats gaming on a 60\u201d, 4K display TV\u2014 at least for me \u2014 smartphones are mobile, hence their lead.\n\nTo know more about the GameUpAfrica Bootcamp, check out this article\n\nNew features on Instagram and YouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram is giving users more control over the kind of content they consume on the app.\n\nOn July 20, 2021, the company announced in a blog post that it was launching Sensitive Content Control. The feature will help users control the content they want to see on the content discovery page, Explore.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat does this mean? Essentially, Instagram is giving you the option to decide which kind of content you want to see while you scroll through the \u2018Explore\u2019 page. Not a puppy person? No more doggy pictures jumping out of your timeline.\n\nAccording to Instagram, sensitive content isn\u2019t content that breaks the rules but could upset some users.\n\nMore control: Back in May 2021, Facebook and Instagram allowed users to remove the Like count on their posts to give them more power over their experience on the apps.\n\nWhile Instagram is giving more power, YouTube wants to help creators make more money.\n\nOn July 20, 2021, YouTube announced it is rolling out a beta version of its new feature, Super Thanks.\n\nWhat\u2019s that? Well, YouTube says in its blog post that it\u2019s a way for fans to show appreciation to their favourite creators on the platform.\n\nHow does it work? While you\u2019re watching a video \u2014 live or not \u2014 you can purchase a Super Thanks that ranges between $2 to $50 to show your appreciation.\n\nYou can make payments through Google Pay, the same way you pay for apps on the Play Store.\n\nStill in beta: According to YouTube, \u201cSuper Thanks is currently in beta and with today\u2019s expansion, is now available to thousands of monetising creators. The feature is available to creators and viewers in 68 countries on desktop and mobile devices.\u201d\n\nClubhouse no longer requires an invite\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Dmitry Mashkin on Unsplash\n\nOn Wednesday, July 21, 2021, live-audio chat platform Clubhouse announced in a blog post that it is no longer in beta testing and the app is no longer invite-only.\n\nFor the past 16 months, Clubhouse was exclusive to invites only. Before now, you needed someone already invited to the platform with your phone number to send you an invite. Business Insider says some people even started a business out of selling invites\n\nWhile this exclusivity made it even more appealing, it was a way to control the rise in the number of app users.\n\nIn its blog, Clubhouse said the invite system was essential to its history. By adding people in waves, it has been able to \u201cgrow Clubhouse in a measured way, and (mostly \ud83d\ude2c ) keep things from breaking\u201d\n\nBreaking the barriers: The invite system wasn\u2019t the only thing that made Clubhouse exclusive. Until May 2021, it was only available to iPhone users.\n\nAs competition mounts from Twitter and Facebook, the app seems to be shedding its exclusivity to accommodate more users.\n\nWhat I\u2019m watching\n\nDON\u2019T buy a new PC for Windows 11!

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Google\u2019s interest in Africa\u2019s tech talent pool deepens, the tech giant has partnered with Nigerian-founded game development studio, Maliyo Games, to open applications for a mobile game developer training program. Called GameUpAfrica Bootcamp, the program is available to interested individuals in Kenya, Ghana, and Nigeria.\n\nThe applications, which opened on Monday, July 19, 2021 \u2014 and closes by August 2 \u2014 will offer developers planning to build a career in game development access to mentorship and relevant tools. Selected applicants will go through a virtual training program from August 16 to December 23, 2021, where they will learn to refine, package, and develop Android games.\n\nBeing a project-based learning program, by the end of the training period, successful participants will be evaluated based on the completion of the curriculum and ability to publish a game on the Google Play Store successfully.\n\nParticipants will pass through three levels of training, themed: Game Development Fundamentals, Succeed on the Play Store, and Publish Your First Game. The successful completion of one level validates moving to the next level.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEligibility\n\nIntending applicants must:\n\nReside in Nigeria, Ghana, or Kenya\n\nHave a basic background in programming languages like C#, C++, and PHP.\n\nOwn a PC.\n\nBe available to commence Bootcamp by August 16, 2021\n\nNote: Selected participants will be judged based on three metrics: competence, commitment, and creativity.\n\nApplication process\n\nApplicants will pass through two stages before final shortlisting.\n\nStage one: Fill the online application form on the company website.\n\nStage two: After scaling the first stage, shortlisted candidates will have to undergo a C# (a core language for game developers) assessment to demonstrate their competence in the programming language. The assessment is scheduled to hold on August 9, 2021.\n\nNote: The organisers will provide data allowance for selected developers during the training.\n\nAbout GameUpAfrica Bootcamp\n\nThe GameUpAfrica Bootcamp is an adaptation of an existing training project by Maliyo Games, which was instituted in 2020. It is a curriculum-based training program that prospective hires must go through before they are accepted into the company.\n\nBetween 2020 and now, the company has trained seven people and absorbed one into the company. Interestingly, the program was born out of the need to solve the problem of talent acquisition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe actually launched this program because, as a game development studio, we are constantly looking for talented individuals to join our team. And because of a lack of structured education system that produces competent game developers in Nigeria, we made the decision last year to launch an in-house program that will enable us to train individuals who are interested in becoming game developers.\u201d That\u2019s Hugo Obi, Founder, Maliyo Games.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHugo Obi, Founder, Maliyo Games. Source: Supplied\n\nFounded in 2012, the company has grown to become one of Nigeria\u2019s longest-standing Android game development studios. According to the founder, this is one of the qualities that attracted Google to the project, aside from the fact that Maliyo Games has published some Africa-themed games on the Google Play Store.\n\nNotable mentions include Aboki Run (similar to Temple Run), Whot King, and Jungle escape. Others like Danfo Racer are still in development.\n\nEven though the company\u2019s initial intention for the curriculum is limited to the Nigerian market, Google\u2019s partnership increased the scope to reach multiple locations, thereby raising the number of selected applicants to 500. In addition to that, Google will also provide support for app store success, which includes successful publishing of content on Google Play Store.\n\nAnother way this program will help beginner game developers is by providing them with a pool of mentors. Going by the number of admitted candidates, mentorship will not only come from Maliyo Games team, but the company will also crowdsource mentors from the international gaming ecosystem.\n\nExperienced mentors can volunteer through this link.\n\nMaliyo Games\u2019 fit\n\nAs is typical of content from many indigenous companies, Maliyo Games studio ensures that its content reflects the African scene.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t do the generic stuff, like working for third parties and designing based on their requirements or being part of a production team where we only look after one aspect of e development. For us, it has always been about African-inspired. And this is what stands us out in the gaming community,\u201d the founder explains.\n\nFor Obi, the ultimate goal of the GameUpAfrica Bootcamp \u2014 which could become a yearly affair \u2014 is to upskill people and have more game developers in the African gaming ecosystem. In addition to that, to increase the number of African-published content on the Google Play Store, and help to identify and attract talents into the company as it plans to grow its team.\n\nIn achieving the former, Obi reveals that top candidates from the Bootcamp will be linked with other studios across the continent. Already, there are existing internal partnerships with studios in Kenya, Ghana, and Senegal.\n\nAside from that, Maliyo Games is part of the Africa Game Developer Community, where it networks with gaming studios in South Africa, Uganda, Cameroon, and Ethiopia. Eventually, Obi believes that the Bootcamp will become a talent pipeline for these studios.\n\nMeanwhile, game studios looking to hire developers through the program can show their interest here.\n\nAfrica\u2019s gaming industry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe growth of the African gaming industry has been gaining momentum for the past three years with growing broadband and smartphone penetration. In fact, prospects are increasing despite the pandemic.\n\nObi likens games to music and movies, not only as a form of escape, but also entertainment which is universally accepted without discrimination of the source.\n\nHe identifies three major challenges that may have stalled the growth of the country\u2019s gaming industry in the past decade: talent, distribution, and monetisation.\n\nIn his opinion, in the past 9 years of running Maliyo Games, opportunities that exist now are thinning out the effects of these challenges. For instance, global distribution channels now exist \u2014 the likes of app stores \u2014 supporting reach and marketing, and payment solutions abound.\n\nWith this, creators can focus on developing and releasing content. If anything, local content are assured of global consumption. Obi\u2019s dream is that by the end of 2022, a product of the Bootcamp would become a highly grossed game on the Google Play Store.\n\nWith projects like this, Africa\u2019s gaming community is, perhaps, on its way to becoming a major contributor to the over $121.1 billion global mobile gaming industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Senior Reporter at Techpoint Africa Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood day,\n\nWhat\u2019s on the menu:\n\nUpdates on Nigeria\u2019s Startup Bill\n\nKenya\u2019s Zoom tax\n\nZimbabwe\u2019s securities law\n\nThe latest on Nigeria\u2019s Startup Bill\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn May, we brought you news about a Startup Bill for Nigeria. Well, its website is live now. Kola Aina, General Partner at Ventures Platform, revealed this in a tweet yesterday.\n\nWhat\u2019s the fuss about? Since the 90s, when the first tech companies were founded, Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem has progressed. Since then, we\u2019ve seen Paystack get acquired, Interswitch and Flutterwave become unicorns, and Jumia get listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese are supposed to be exciting times, but it appears government policies are making it difficult for entrepreneurs and investors to remain excited. This year alone, the transacting of cryptocurrency through banks has been regulated, while Twitter has been temporarily banned in the country.\n\nEvents like this have made it important for founders to interact with the government, hence, the Startup Bill. At the time of the first report, it was revealed that a first draft of the bill would be ready by August 2021.\n\nWith the website launching only 11 days to the end of July, it could be that plans are on track.\n\nAccording to a Medium post on the website, the first draft of the bill would be reviewed by ecosystem leaders and representatives in July, while town halls would be held in August 2021. A final draft would be produced in September 2021 and submitted to President Muhammadu Buhari in October 2021.\n\nCause for optimism? Should plans for the bill go as planned, it could unlock a lot of value for Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem. For one, investors are assured that sudden government policies would not destroy their investments. More capital being injected into the tech ecosystem would also mean more jobs, and who can complain about that?\n\nAs usual, we\u2019ll keep you informed of any new developments.\n\nKenyans to pay VAT for using Zoom\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<em>Photo Credit: <a href=\u201dhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/morgan-mbabazi-001a331a/\u201d target=\u201d_blank\u201d rel=\u201dnoopener\u201d>Morgan Mbabazi</a> (National Media Group).</em>\n\nStarting August 2021, Kenyans will begin paying Value Added Tax (VAT) for using video conferencing platform, Zoom. The company joins the ranks of YouTube and Facebook as Internet platforms charging VAT in the country.\n\nWho is this for? Not everyone. Customers will be issued a VAT invoice showing the tax at the appropriate rate if they are not registered for VAT in Kenya. For registered VAT customers, they must provide Zoom with their Personal Identification Number (PIN) and a declaration that they are registered for VAT in the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf a customer\u2019s \u2018sold to\u2019 location indicates Kenya, but they have not provided a valid PIN and the required declaration, Zoom will charge Kenyan VAT on the invoice.\n\nThis development is not surprising. To increase revenue, the Kenyan government has revealed plans to tax companies that generate profit from the country.\n\nChanging times. Across the world, attempts by governments to tax digital businesses have increased. However, it is not straightforward as they operate models that are not catered to by most taxation laws.\n\nAs we revealed in a previous article, the existing agreement under the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) stipulates that companies pay taxes where their goods/services are produced instead of where they are consumed.\n\nThat has not stopped governments from trying, and the Kenyan government has led the way on the African continent. These are still early days, but it seems companies are getting on board quickly, and it might be a matter of time before other African countries follow suit.\n\nWhat do you think? Share your thoughts in the comment section.\n\nZimbabwe to include VASPs as securities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<span>Photo by <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/@ewankennedy19?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Ewan Kennedy</a> on <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/s/photos/crypto-trading?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Unsplash</a></span>\n\nThe Zimbabwean government has revealed its intention to widen the definition of securities to include Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs).\n\nVASPs refer to entities that facilitate the transaction, safekeeping, and administration of digital currencies. Consequently, cryptocurrency exchanges in Zimbabwe would now be regulated under the amended Securities and Exchange Act.\n\nThis move, which is the first time digital assets are mentioned under Zimbabwean law, suggests that the government is open to cryptocurrencies as stores of value and could facilitate their adoption in the South African country.\n\nBecause of attempts to regulate cryptocurrencies by governments, a common debate has been that of their status as securities. Classifying them as securities would mean that governments would regulate their usage, something that proponents say goes against the nature of cryptocurrencies.\n\nBy the way, seeing you love reading our newsletter this much, invite your friends and family to join you.

          "text": "The Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE) has rejected insinuations by the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) that journalists by their reporting encourage terrorism.\n\nNBC, in its recent directive, warned journalists, television and radio stations in Nigeria against \u201cglamorising and giving too many details on the nefarious activities of terrorists and kidnappers\u201d during daily newspaper reviews.\n\nNGE, in a statement by its President, Mustapha Isah, and the General Secretary, Iyobosa Uwugiaren, on Wednesday, described the recent directive by the commission as yet another attempt to gag the media from playing its primary role in a democratic setting.\n\n\u2018\u2019We hope it is not a ploy by the NBC to ban newspaper review in broadcasting stations. Because the content of the directive doesn\u2019t specify what kind of conduct would fall within their realm. It is our view that the role of independent, critical, and trustworthy journalism has never been more important than now in our country,\u201d the Guild said.\n\nAgainst the background of NBC growing anti-media policy, the group questioned the sincerity of such a directive as it failed to explicitly define what constitutes \u2018\u2019too many details\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2019glamorising\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2019divisive rhetoric\u2019\u2019, and \u2018\u2019security issues.\u2019\u2019\n\nWhile the NGE reiterated the Nigerian media\u2019s commitment to the fight against terrorism, it said the media would not sacrifice its freedom and independence to NBC.\n\n\u201cWhile we are mindful of our responsibility at this trying moment for our nation, we must also not lose the ability to see that security, in a democratic nation, is not an end in itself.\n\n\u201cIts single purpose is to protect the capability of institutions, including the media, to guarantee citizens the free exercise of their fundamental human rights, without discrimination.\n\n\u2018History has revealed time and again that efforts to increase security through the clampdown of liberty and freedom have threatened both liberty and security,\u201d the NGE stated.\n\nRead the full statement by the NDE below.\n\nNigerian Guild of Editors (NGE) said that Nigerian journalists, especially its members, are not terrorists and bandits\u2019 best friends, against the terrific insinuation by the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC), and so, will never be disposed to giving the bloodthirsty criminals any exposure.\n\nThe Nigerian editors also stated that giving the fact that journalists have a responsibility to help the country cope with the prevailing threat and consequences of banditry, kidnapping and terrorism in Nigeria, they will continue to be responsible and responsive in their reports.\n\nThe professional group of all the editors in Nigeria stated this on Wednesday while expressing concern over the recent directive by the NBC, warning journalists, television and radio stations in Nigeria against \u201cglamorising and giving too many details on the nefarious activities of terrorists and kidnappers\u201d during their daily newspaper reviews.\n\nIn a directive, titled \u201cNewspaper Reviews And Current Affairs Programmes: A Need For Caution\u2019\u2019, signed by the Director, Broadcast Monitoring, Francisca Aiyetan, on behalf of the new Director-General of the Commission, Balarabe IIeah, the regulatory agency had cautioned broadcasters against glamorising and giving too many details on the nefarious activities of terrorists and kidnappers during their daily newspaper reviews.\n\nHowever, in a statement signed by the NGE\u2019s President, Mustapha Isah and the General Secretary, Iyobosa Uwugiaren, the group said that the directive is unhelpful, describing it a subtle threat to free press, freedom of expression, access to information, and victims\u2019 right to justice, which are essential to public debate and accountability in a democratic space.\n\nThe Guild added that giving the consistent anti-media policy of NBC in recent times, its members are concerned about what the commission means by the expansive definitions of what may constitute \u2018\u2019too many details\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2019glamorising\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2019divisive rhetoric\u2019\u2019, and \u2018\u2019security issues\u2019\u2019 in its directive.\n\n\u2018\u2019We hope it is not a ploy by the NBC to ban newspaper review in broadcasting stations. Because, the content of the directive doesn\u2019t specify what kind of conduct would fall within their realm. It is our view that the role of independent, critical, and trustworthy journalism has never been more important than now in our country\u2019\u2019, the Guild explained.\n\nThe Guild added that Nigerian media are very mindful of their responsibility in the current collective efforts to address the security challenges in the country, adding that the relationship between the security agencies and the media has been more respectful and trustful along this mission in the past few years.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNGE added, \u2018\u2019While we are mindful of our responsibility at this trying moment for our nation, we must also not lose the ability to see that security, in a democratic nation, is not an end in itself.\n\n\u2018\u2019Its single purpose is to protect the capability of institutions, including the media, to guarantee citizens the free exercise of their fundamental human rights, without discrimination.\n\n\u2018\u2019History has revealed time and again that efforts to increase security through the clampdown of liberty and freedom have threatened both liberty and security.\u201d\n\nNGE reiterated that there is no security without free media and free expression, and no free expression and free media without security, saying these two terms should come hand in hand and not fight each other in the general interest of the nation.\n\nSigned:\n\nFor: Nigerian Guild of Editors\n\nMustapha Isah\n\nPresident\n\nIyobosa Uwugiaren\n\nGeneral Secretary",

          "text": "Diplomat and former Director-General of the Nigerian Institute of International Affairs, Prof. Bola Akinterinwa, has warned that going hard on the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Mazi Nnamdi Kanu and Yoruba nation agitator, Sunday Adeyemo, alias Sunday Igboho, will not stop agitations for secession in the Southeast and Southwest regions of the country, but will instead provoke their followers to resort to violence.\n\nAkinterinwa who spoke in an interview with PUNCH, emphasized that violence is not the solution to their agitations, but dialogue.\n\n\u201cNigeria can be big; nobody is saying you are not big or more powerful but it took just two terrorists to lock down the twin building in the U.S. and for thousands of people to be killed and for America to now sit tight,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe are treading on the same path. I think it is Shakespeare that said in Macbeth that there is no art of finding the human construction from the face. In this case, who really is the terrorist? The terrorists fighting on the battlefield are different from the terrorists that are funding them or that are outside.\n\n\u201cWe are moving towards a situation whereby the Pro-Igbohos, the Pro-Kanus, the Pro-Self-determination (people) etc may begin now to make bombs themselves and be throwing here and there and the whole country will be disorderly. We need application of basic thinking,\u201d he said\n\nAkinterinwa, according to PUNCH, stressed that the clampdown on agitators was not the solution but a mediation process where all parties would sit at a table and dialogue.\n\n\u201cArrest all of them, extradite all of them but that won\u2019t stop the agitation for Yoruba Republic and it won\u2019t stop agitation for Biafra Republic. Biafra Republic came into being as far back as 1962; it was discussed in their palace. So, if by 1967, the war broke out\u2026it is simply because the people felt they do not want to belong,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf any President of Nigeria is sincere about wanting to govern Nigeria (with due respect to all others), please sit down, strategise, ask people to come: \u2018What really are your grievances? Okay, if you want to be sovereign, in which way will the interest of all others? We are all brothers and sisters.'\u201d\n\nKanu was extradited from Kenya and Igbo who was arrested in Benin Republic at weekend on the request of Nigerian government, is facing possible extradition to the country.",

          "text": "A total of 1,031 persons were reported killed, while 390 others were abducted in 205 incidents recorded in 34 states across Nigeria in June 2021, according a report by Beacon Consulting, a security risk management and intelligence company.\n\nAccording to report, Zamfara, Kebbi, and Niger were worst hit as a total of 275 persons were killed in Zamfara State, 93 in Kebbi State, and 91 in Niger State during the month under review.\n\nThe report titled: \u201cNigeria Security Report\u201d obtained recorded various cases of insecurity in June; from armed attacks, armed clashes, mob violence, social disruptions, to other violent crimes.\n\nIn 127 Local Government Areas across the 34 states of the federation under review with the exception of Bauchi and Gombe states, various incidents of casualties and kidnappings were reported with the majority of the cases recorded in areas bedeviled by \u2018rural banditry.\u2019\n\nThe report said nine persons were killed and 20 others abducted in four attacks recorded in the month by Boko Haram and other terror-related groups.\n\nAlso, 18 persons were killed in 12 attacks attributed to the Eastern Security Network and the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) in the same period.\n\nA breakdown of the incidents by regions shows that the Northwest recorded the highest occurrence of insecurity casualties with 416 killings and 280 abductions in 28 Local Government Areas, followed by 218 fatalities and 24 abductions in 27 Local Government Areas in the North-central.\n\nA total of 188 fatalities and 22 abductions were reported in the Northeast within the period under review, while in the Southeast, 117 cases of killings and 26 abductions were reported, in 20 Local Government Areas of Enugu, Anambra, Abia and Ebonyi states in incidents of armed attacks, armed clashes, social disruptions, violent crimes and airstrikes/bomb attacks.\n\nThe Southwest also had 74 fatalities and 27 abductions from 30 Local Government Areas of Oyo, Osun, Ekiti, Ondo, Ogun, and Lagos state, with the South-south recording the lowest amongst the southern regions with 18 fatalities and 11 abductions in 15 Local Government Areas of Edo, Rivers, Delta, Cross River, and Akwa Ibom states.\n\nA total of 275 persons were killed in various attacks in Zamfara State, Northwest, where activities of terror groups have pauperised most rural dwellers; there were no abductions recorded. But in neighbouring Kebbi State, 119 abductions were recorded with 93 fatalities.\n\nKaduna State recorded 26 deaths with 157 abductions, while Katsina State recorded six deaths with three abductions. Sokoto State had 15 fatalities with zero abduction, Kano and Jigawa states recorded one death each with no abductions.\n\nNiger State in the North-central, according to the breakdown, had the highest incidents of 91 deaths and three abductions, while Benue and Plateau states had only one recorded case of kidnap with 72 and 27 fatalities respectively.\n\nKwara State recorded 11 deaths with no abduction, while Kogi and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) recorded three deaths and 10 abductions respectively.\n\nAccording to the report, the activities of non-state actors popularly referred to as \u2018bandits\u2019 continued unabated in the Northwest and North-central despite ongoing security forces operations.\n\n\u201cIn the reporting period, the violent attacks on mainly rural communities were sustained in Kaduna, Katsina, Niger, Sokoto, and Zamfara states and mass abduction of students in schools in Kebbi, Kaduna, and Niger states, as well as families of staff, workers and patients at a medical institution in Kaduna State,\u201d the report read.\n\n\u201cWe also monitored the setting up of illegal checkpoints, where these non-state actors abducted commuters and in one incident along the Kaduna \u2013 Kachia road, killed some of their victims for unknown reasons. We monitored increasing indications of the convergence between armed groups in the northeast and the ones in the North Central and North West.\u201d\n\nIn the Northeast, a total of 101 fatalities were recorded in eight Local Government Areas of Borno, Yobe, Adamawa, and Taraba states. Some of the incidences mentioned in the report in the region were Boko Haram attack on a community and killing of police officers as well as the burning of UN facilities in Yobe State; the killing of over 50 ISWAP terrorists in Borno and the killing of six ISWAP terrorists in Dikwa, Borno State.\n\nAlso highlighted in the report was the storming of Gadawaluwol village in Adamawa State where one person was killed, as well as the killing by suspected criminal herders of a father and two sons in Galang Jauro village in Taraba State.\n\nThe report, obtained by Daily Trust, warned that criminals and criminal activities, including kidnapping for ransom, violent and petty crimes, as well as home invasions, are likely to continue in the short and medium terms due to the progressive worsening of the economic circumstances in the country and rising inflation.\n\n\u201cThere will be a continuation of non-state actors\u2019 activities challenging the supremacy of the state\u2019s monopoly of force and sustenance of their attacks on communities including kidnapping for ransom and raids. This, in turn, will push communities to evolve self-help initiatives including protests, where they block access routes and arm themselves,\u201d the report reads.\n\n\u201cThe deteriorating security situation will continue to fuel political rancor and the exchange between the ruling party and its members and between it and opposition parties, social upheaval especially protests by Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) and political groups hiding behind civil activists will emerge as a major driver of security challenges as the effect of the economic downturn forces governments at the federal and state levels to take measures to manage these impacts.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the Northeast, the non-state actors waging a terror war and the ongoing military operation Hadin Kai will continue the armed conflict. The restructuring and consolidation of ISWAP will translate into bolder attacks and other activities of the group. This will mean a continuation of armed attacks and counter attacks as well as illegal checkpoints mounted along major travel routes particularly in Borno state but in the border towns of Yobe and Adamawa states.\u201d",

          "text": "Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE), the umbrella union of all editors in Nigeria, has has kicked against what it called \u201cdraconian\u201d attempts to gag the media, noting that the media industry is not a political opponent or enemy of the Federal Government.\n\nThe guild said many of the political elite\u2019s attacks on the media were not envisioned to win an argument on values, journalistic or legal, but meant to bully media organisations.\n\nThe NGE said this while reacting to what it called \u201cdraconian provisions\u201d in two Bills to amend the Nigerian Press Council (NPC) Act and the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) Act that are currently before the National Assembly.\n\nThe guild said the sponsors of the Bills claimed that they were aimed at moderating the \u201crecklessness\u201d of the media, but it argued that they \u201care actually meant to criminalise journalism practice in the country\u201d.\n\nIn a statement by Mustapha Isah (President) and Iyobosa Uwugiaren (General Secretary), the NGE said the media, being the \u201coxygen of democracy,\u201d would be strangulated if the Bills were passed in their present forms.\n\n\u201cAt a time there is a popular ongoing global conversation about the need for a #NewDealForJournalism\u201d \u2013 for immediate and sustained action from, and collaboration between governments and other influential actors to improve the policy, funding, and enabling environment for independent professional journalism \u2013 we see the proposed legislations as unhelpful.\n\n\u201cWhile we are not opposed to an Act that will promote media stakeholders-driven regulatory council, the many draconian provisions in the Odebunmi Olusegun-sponsored Bills are actually aimed at criminalising media practice in Nigeria. While the intention of the sponsor of the bills is suspicious, the Bills negate all known features of media regulatory bodies in the world,\u201d the NGE said.\n\nThe guild alluded to the NPC Act, CAP N128, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 1992, created by the military dictatorship.\n\nIt noted that while the NPC Act \u201cgives the Council\u2019s Board full responsibility to administer the council\u201d, the proposed Act restricts the council\u2019s board to \u201cadvisory capacity on a part-time basis without direct interference in the day-to-day administration of the council\u201d, and gives the Executive Secretary all the power.\n\n\u201cWhile the proposed NPC Act says the Board shall consist of one representative each from the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE), Newspapers Proprietors Association of Nigeria (NPAN), Broadcasting Organisation of Nigeria (BON), the Ministry of Information, two representative of the general public, one of whom shall be a legal practitioner and a woman and Executive Secretary of the council, who shall serve as the secretary to the Board, the board is a mere advisory body.\n\n\u201cThe Bill also says that the Chairman of the Board shall be appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Minister in charge of Information, and that all other members of the Board shall be appointed by the President on the recommendation by the Minister of Information. The intension of this kind of Council is suspicious,\u201d the NGE said.\n\nThe body of editors stressed that the professional body does not need the approval of the Minister of Information to establish and disseminate a National Press Code and standards to guide the conduct of the print media, related media houses and media practitioners.\n\nThe body approved the placement of penalties and fines against violation of the press code, as provided for in the Bill.\n\nOn the proposed NBC amendment legislation, the guild said the Section 23 of the Bill, which gives the Minister of Information the powers to participate in the making of regulations, is unhelpful.\n\nIt added that the participation of the minister would turn NBC into a tool for political interference.\n\nThe guild also said the provisions of the two bills give the impression that the Federal Government is out to crush its enemy, saying that the media is not an enemy of the state.\n\nThe NGE added that the two Bills, if passed, would compound the nation\u2019s negative image in the global community.\n\nIt stressed that the Bills are perceived to be attempts to further stifle the democratic space in the country, which is currently having challenges in all fronts.\n\nThe NGE said it also opposed to heavy involvement of the President and the Minister of Information in the composition of appointments into the boards of NBC and the NPC, saying the board members should appoint their own chairmen.\n\n\u201cThe NPC and NBC should be truly independent, and should not be under the supervision of the Minister of Information, who is a political office holder and affiliated to a political party,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cThe Ghana model comes to mind here. Nigeria should be seen to be moving with time, instead of taking retrogressive steps in media freedom.\u201d\n\nThe guild urged the National Assembly to remove the obnoxious provisions in the two Bills, which make them look as if they were meant to strangulate, instead of regulate the media.",

          "text": "The ongoing plans by the federal government to concession the four major international airports in the country is a major step by the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration to enhance the development of the country\u2019s aviation sector.\n\nA think-tank of the All Progressives Congress (APC) under the aegies of APC Legacy Awareness and Campaign made the remark in its assessment of the aviation sector under the present administration.\n\nThe group gave the position in a statement issued Wednesday by its coordinators, including the Youth representative at the party\u2019s National Caretaker and Extra Ordinary Convention Planning Committee, Ismail Ahmed; former National Publicity Secretary, Lanre Issa-Onilu; Director General of the Progressives Governors Forum (PGF), Salihu Moh Lukman and Tolu Ogunlesi.\n\nRecall that the Federal government has commenced the process for the concession of the Lagos, Abuja, Kano and Port Harcourt International Airports \u2013 with completion of the process scheduled for 2022.\n\nIn the statement, it listed major highlights of the Roadmap to include the Establishment of a National Carrier, Development of Agro-Allied/Cargo Terminals, Concessioning of the Major International Airports, Establishment of Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) Center and Establishment of an Aviation Leasing Company, Development of Aerotropolis (Airport Cities).\n\nOthers included the\n\nEstablishment of an Aerospace University, Designation of 4 International Airports as Special Economic Zones, Upgrade of Accident Investigation Bureau (AIB) and the Nigerian College of Aviation Technology (NCAT).\n\nCommending the federal government\u2019s move, the group noted that the process which it said is part of the administration\u2019s Aviation Road map, which was launched in May 2016, is geared towards complete transformation of the sector, in terms of safety, infrastructure and economic viability.\n\n\u201cSince the launching of the Aviation Roadmap, the Ministry of Aviation has focused on implemention. In terms of infrastructure, the new Terminals of the Port Harcourt, Abuja and Kano International Airports, inherited from the previous administration, have been completed, while the new Lagos Terminal is very close to completion. Brand new Runways have been constructed at the Abuja and Enugu International Airports, in 2017 and 2020, respectively.\n\n\u201cMore than a dozen airports around the country have had Low Level Windshear Alert Systems (LLWAS) installed, to improve flight safety. Investigations revealed that the Sosoliso and ADC plane crashes of 2005 and 2006 respectively were caused by the absence of LLWAS in the airports.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Lagos and Abuja Airports have had the Category 3 Instrument Landing System (ILS) installed \u2013 which provides the capability for landing safely and accurately in conditions of near-zero visibility.\n\nAnother 3 Nigerian Airports have been scheduled to benefit this year. \u201cA significant portion of the investment into the Aviation Sector has been focused on resolving issues and bridging gaps inherited from previous Administrations. One example is the payment of pensions owed to staff of the defunct Nigeria Airways.\n\nPresident Buhari approved that the backlog of almost twenty years be cleared, and has released funds to this effect. The reconstruction of the Runways in Abuja and Enugu were also long overdue, but neglected by previous governments. Investments that should have been made over the decades are now finally being made.\u201d\n\nThe group noted further that \u201cunder President Buhari\u2019s watch, the Nigerian College of Aviation Technology (NCAT) has acquired several new training aircraft, and has been recognised globally by the International Civil Aviation Organisation\u201d.",

          "text": "The ongoing plans by the federal government to concession the four major international airports in the country is a major step by the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration to enhance the development of the country\u2019s aviation sector.\n\nA think-tank of the All Progressives Congress (APC) under the aegies of APC Legacy Awareness and Campaign made the remark in its assessment of the aviation sector under the present administration.\n\nThe group gave the position in a statement issued Wednesday by its coordinators, including the Youth representative at the party\u2019s National Caretaker and Extra Ordinary Convention Planning Committee, Ismail Ahmed; former National Publicity Secretary, Lanre Issa-Onilu; Director General of the Progressives Governors Forum (PGF), Salihu Moh Lukman and Tolu Ogunlesi.\n\nRecall that the Federal government has commenced the process for the concession of the Lagos, Abuja, Kano and Port Harcourt International Airports \u2013 with completion of the process scheduled for 2022.\n\nIn the statement, it listed major highlights of the Roadmap to include the Establishment of a National Carrier, Development of Agro-Allied/Cargo Terminals, Concessioning of the Major International Airports, Establishment of Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) Center and Establishment of an Aviation Leasing Company, Development of Aerotropolis (Airport Cities).\n\nOthers included the\n\nEstablishment of an Aerospace University, Designation of 4 International Airports as Special Economic Zones, Upgrade of Accident Investigation Bureau (AIB) and the Nigerian College of Aviation Technology (NCAT).\n\nCommending the federal government\u2019s move, the group noted that the process which it said is part of the administration\u2019s Aviation Road map, which was launched in May 2016, is geared towards complete transformation of the sector, in terms of safety, infrastructure and economic viability.\n\n\u201cSince the launching of the Aviation Roadmap, the Ministry of Aviation has focused on implemention. In terms of infrastructure, the new Terminals of the Port Harcourt, Abuja and Kano International Airports, inherited from the previous administration, have been completed, while the new Lagos Terminal is very close to completion. Brand new Runways have been constructed at the Abuja and Enugu International Airports, in 2017 and 2020, respectively.\n\n\u201cMore than a dozen airports around the country have had Low Level Windshear Alert Systems (LLWAS) installed, to improve flight safety. Investigations revealed that the Sosoliso and ADC plane crashes of 2005 and 2006 respectively were caused by the absence of LLWAS in the airports.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Lagos and Abuja Airports have had the Category 3 Instrument Landing System (ILS) installed \u2013 which provides the capability for landing safely and accurately in conditions of near-zero visibility.\n\nAnother 3 Nigerian Airports have been scheduled to benefit this year. \u201cA significant portion of the investment into the Aviation Sector has been focused on resolving issues and bridging gaps inherited from previous Administrations. One example is the payment of pensions owed to staff of the defunct Nigeria Airways.\n\nPresident Buhari approved that the backlog of almost twenty years be cleared, and has released funds to this effect. The reconstruction of the Runways in Abuja and Enugu were also long overdue, but neglected by previous governments. Investments that should have been made over the decades are now finally being made.\u201d\n\nThe group noted further that \u201cunder President Buhari\u2019s watch, the Nigerian College of Aviation Technology (NCAT) has acquired several new training aircraft, and has been recognised globally by the International Civil Aviation Organisation\u201d.",

          "text": "There are concerns over the arrest of popular Yoruba activist, Mr. Sunday Igboho at an airport in Cotonou, Benin Republic Monday night while attempting to flee to Germany.\n\nIgboho was declared wanted early July by the Department of State Services (DSS) following a raid carried out on his Soka residence in Oyo state.\n\nThe raid was based on intelligence reports received by the DSS on alleged stockpiling of arms.\n\nThe secret police directed Igboho to turn himself in or risk arrest.\n\nIn a bloody gun duel during the raid, two guards died while others sustained several degrees of injuries on both sides.\n\nSome 12 individuals were also whisked away from the house to Abuja by the DSS.\n\nThe Cotonou arrest\n\nBut with his arrest, prominent Yoruba leaders and Afenifere, the Yoruba socio-cultural group, have cautioned the federal government on the handling of the situation.\n\nIgboho, Blueprint gathered from multiple sources, Tuesday, was in possession of a Benin Republic passport at the time of his arrest.\n\nThe operation, it was further learnt, was said to have been carried out by DSS operatives in collaboration with Interpol.\n\nA source said: \u201cIt would have been difficult for authorities to arrest him outside the country. He had a German passport with 10-year validity. Forget the insinuations and reports that his location was tracked in Nigeria, it was difficult for intelligence sources to track his location; he has been in an undisclosed location in Benin Republic since about two weeks.\u201d\n\nCounsel speaks\n\nAnd in quick reaction to the arrest, Igboho\u2019s counsel, Yomi Aliyu (SAN), asked the government of Republic of Benin to refuse any application for his client\u2019s extradition by the Nigerian government.\n\nIn a statement made available to journalists in Ibadan, Tuesday, Aliyu said granting such extradition application would amount to flouting the extradition Treaty of 1984 among the quartet of Togo, Nigeria, Ghana and Republic of Benin.\n\nHe claimed Igboho, who presently has a duly acknowledged application before the International Criminal Court (ICC), narrowly escaped death when DSS invaded his residence in Ibadan, shooting sporadically in search of him and killing at least two people with many, including one of his wives, arrested.\n\n\u201cThe Extradition Treaty of 1984 between Togo Nigeria, Ghana and Republic of Benin excluded political fugitives. It also states that where the fugitive will not get justice because of discrimination and/or undue delay in prosecution, the host country should not release the fugitive,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNow, Article 20 of African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights to which the four countries are signatories, made agitation for self-determination a fundamental right to be protected by all countries.\n\n\u201cThis made Chief Sunday Adeyemo a POLITICAL OFFENDER who cannot be deported and/or extradited by the good people of the Republic of Benin for any reason. Secondly, that he cannot get justice or even be killed is apparent in how those arrested in his house were detained for more than 21days now without access to their lawyers. Even the wife among them could not change her undies for 21 days! Which inhuman treatment can be more than this?\u201d the silk queried.\n\nHe further said: \u201cIt is a shocking news that Nigerian Government has gotten Chief Sunday Adeyemo a.k.a Sunday Igboho Oosa arrested by INTERPOL in Republic of Benin notwithstanding the political nature of his offence and what the DSS earlier said that they refrained from arresting him so as not to overheat the polity of Southwestern Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is advisable for the INTERPOL and Benin Republic to be aware of the savagery acts committed in our client\u2019s house in the wee hours of 1st July, 2021 between 1.00am and 3.00am; shooting their way through and killing 2 people in the process and maliciously damaging his properties in the course of that illegal invasion.\u201d\n\nYoruba group backs move\n\nAlso, a prominent Yoruba scholar, Banji Akintoye, has confirmed Igboho\u2019s arrest, saying Yoruba leaders were \u201ccurrently working to provide assistance to prevent his extradition from Benin Republic.\u201d\n\nAkintoye, leader of \u2018Ilana Omo Oodua\u2019 and a prominent campaigner for Yoruba self-determination, said in a statement Tuesday that Igboho committed no crime.\n\nThe emeritus professor who said \u201cleading lawyers in Benin Republic are now in charge,\u201d also added that \u201cfor a start, we must all see to it now that Sunday Ighoho will get his freedom back so as to be able to move and operate as a free person.\n\n\u201cWe have secured the services of a leading and highly respected lawyer whom we can confidently rely on. We know, furthermore, that for the protection of his people who are being brutalized, he has joined hands with many of his brethren to take the legally-appropriate step, namely to seek the intervention of the International Criminal Court.\u201d\n\nWe\u2018re studying situation \u2013 Afenifere\n\nAnd when contacted, the spokesman ofAfenifere, Jare Ajayi, said: \u201cThe news of the arrest was a surprise. But the body is still studying the situation before making a formal statement as details of the arrest is still sketchy.\u201d\n\nHe, however, added that \u201csecurity agencies appear to be more active in hunting those who are peacefully agitating for the rights and better deals for their people than they appear to be in dealing with bandits and terrorists who have deprived thousands of innocent Nigerians of their lives and properties.\n\n\u201cIf half of the energy deployed to apprehend Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Igboho had been deployed to the menace of terrorists and bandits who kill, rape, rob and kidnap people, we would not have been in the unfortunate security mess that we are presently.\n\n\u201cIt is hoped that government will direct more attention to addressing issues that gave birth to ethnic agitations. The earlier this is done the better.\u201d\n\nLadoja cautions\n\nAlso sounding some caution, the Osi Olubadan and former governor of Oyo state, High Chief Rashidi Ladoja asked the federal government to handle the issue of Igboho\u2019s arrest with utmost caution.\n\nLadoja stated this in Ibadan Tuesday while speaking to journalists at his Bodija residents after observing his Eid-el-Kabir prayers at the University of Ibadan praying ground.\n\nHe said rather than treating Igboho as a criminal, the government should consider giving him amnesty as a citizen of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is not the arrest that is important to me. It is the federal government that created Sunday Igboho. It is the federal government that created him. It was in respect of killings in Igangan and other areas. When the perpetrators are arrested, they will claim that they have power from above and they will release them,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf Sunday Igboho is arrested today and the attitude did not change, many Sunday Igboho will surface. It has never been bad like this. It is unfortunate that the President is turning deaf ears. Just like Kanu has become a leader to some people, Sunday Igboho is also a leader to some people,\u201d the former governor added.\n\n\u201cThe Fulani herdsmen have killed many people, Dr. Fatai Aborode, Alhaji Sherifat Adisa were killed, nobody was arrested. That is why Sunday Igboho resorted into self help. It was because of these that Sunday Igboho came and became a hero.\n\n\u201cIf the situation is not well managed, many Kanu, Igboho will surface. They should give them amnesty just like the way they are giving Boko Haram,\u201d he said.\n\n",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed his deep attachment to the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) and impact so far, saying it had broadened the horizon of citizens, opened up opportunities and enhanced understanding of cultural differences.\n\nHe spoke when he received in audience corps members serving in his Daura country home in Katsina state, who paid him Sallah homage.\n\nThe president said he had consistently commended former Head of State, Gen. Yakubu Gowon for the initiative, which Buhari said had created more opportunities for uniting the country.\n\nPresident Buhari urged the youth corps members to make the most of the opportunity of travelling around the country, especially in understanding different climates, cultures, languages and views on life.\n\n\u201cEvery time I meet with former Head of State, Gen. Yakubu Gowon, like recently, I still commend him for the initiative of the NYSC. The NYSC is spectacular in many ways.\n\n\u201cSome of you have come from Port Harcourt, Lagos and Calabar and you can now feel the heat of Daura and how close it is to the desert,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Buhari said the NYSC scheme was well thought-out to unite the country through understanding.\n\n\u201cI feel very strongly about the NYSC and I am wishing you all the very best. I assure you that you will be much better as Nigerians after your experience,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nPresident Buhari gave the corps members two cows from his farm, 20 bags of rice and N1, 000,000 (one million naira).\n\nExpressing their gratitude, the Corps Liaison Officer, Umaru Babayo, thanked President Buhari for all the efforts and sacrifices to restore peace in the country, and the policies to diversify the economy, with agriculture as the main driver.\n\nHe said the Emir of Daura, Alhaji Faruk Umar Faruk, had shown a lot of kindness and warmth to corps members as well in his domain, appreciating the community for always supporting them.\n\nFaruk assured the president of prayers for a successful tenure in office, and God\u2019s providence in decision making that would move the country forward.\n\nOn 2.5% of Nigerian arable land\n\nIn a related development, President Buhari has urged more Nigerians to embrace farming, saying he was surprised to hear only 2.5 per cent of arable lands in the country was being cultivated.\n\nPresident Buhari told newsmen at his residence in Daura, after the Eid-el-Kabir prayers, that the Presidential Economic Advisory Council notified him that only a small percentage of the land in the country was being used for farming, directing security outfits to work more with communities to create a more friendly environment for farmers.\n\nThe president mandated security outfits to be more relentless in maintaining peace in the country, and ensure a more harmonious relationship with communities so that they can glean intelligence.\n\nHe said the security situation had improved considerably over time in the North East and South South, and efforts were being made in North Central and North West, assuring that more would be done to fish out those that had been troubling the peace of the nation and citizens.\n\nEarlier at the prayer ground, Emir of Daura Faruk Umar Faruk had called on citizens to be more supportive of the president so that he could actualise his vision of improving security and boosting the economy.\n\n\u201cSince the president came into power we have seen some positive changes in the country. May God continue to strengthen the President with good health and courage to bring peace to the country. God will not allow Nigeria to see shame. God has been keeping the country and he will keep the country,\u201d he said.\n\no\n\nRelated\n\nNo tags for this post.",

The Court of Appeal of Nigeria and the Supreme Court of Nigeria\n\n\u201cThese judgment debts are compiled at the office of the Honourable Attorney General of the Federation and the Minister of Justice.\n\n\u201cAppropriations have been made from 2015 to 2021 by the National Assembly of Nigeria to settle and pay these debts including, issuing of promissory notes to beneficiaries, but the office of the Attorney General and Minister of Justice has repeatedly, stated that monies meant for the payment of judgment debts owed by the federal government of Nigeria, was not released by the Federal Ministry of Finance (FMF) and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\n\u201cThis to us is apparently unconstitutional for the executive arm of government to continue in neglecting judgments of the Judicial arm of government, especially superior courts of records vested with the powers to adjudicate between individuals, organizations and all arms of government as stated in Section 6(1) of the 1999 constitution (as amended).\n\n\u201cWe are therefore using the mass media as empowered by Section 22 of the 1999 constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to cry out for justice through payment of the judgment debts by the federal government.\n\n\u201cWe urge the president to rise to the occasion and as a matter of urgent national importance, consider the common man, the citizens of Nigeria whose businesses and assets continue to diminish by the non-payment of judgment debt owed since 2015 and the impact of COVID-19 to our economy.

          "text": "Federal Government has flagged off the construction of the Kaduna-Kano segment of the Lagos-Kano railway modernization project.\n\nSpeaking at the Ground Breaking Ceremony in Kano, President Muhammadu Buhari reiterated his administration\u2019s commitment to reviving the Nigerian Railway system.\n\nHe said the project when completed, will not only drive the nation\u2019s economies through employment from new business opportunities and wealth creation but will also reduce the deficiency in our nation\u2019s transportation infrastructure.\n\n\u201cThis administration recognizes rail transportation as a potent economic driver and as such, has accorded railway infrastructure development the greatest priority it deserves and it is not surprising that several landmarks have been achieved, from the Flag-off for commercial operation of Abuja \u2013 Kaduna railway in 2016 to the recent commissioning of the Lagos \u2013 Ibadan railway project on June 10, 2021, thereby maintaining the pace for the actualization of this vital thoroughfare\u201d.\n\nHe said, \u201cThis project is crucial to the establishment of a supply chain in railway transport within its corridor, Kano \u2013 Kaduna \u2013 Abuja, as it links the major commercial cities of Kano and Kaduna to the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja\u201d.\n\nHe further said \u201cthis railway connection when completed will establish the ports in Lagos, as the choice for import and export business of the people of landlocked Niger Republic.\n\nThe railway line will be linked to the second Port in Lagos, the Tin Can Island Port. It is also expected that the Inland Dry Port on these routes will be activated and the ports can now receive imports directly from the international market as ports of destination such as the Ibadan, Kaduna, and Kano Inland Dry Ports\u201d.\n\nThe Minister of Transportation Rotimi Amaechi says the project will no doubt improve the standard of living of citizens within its corridor, and further create employment and promote trade.\n\nHe said \u201d The project will no doubt improve the standard of living of citizens within its corridor, create employment and promote trade. In the long term, the railway will help decongest the Lagos Port Complex and increase its efficiency as well as further increase the viability of the Inland Dry Ports located in Ibadan, Kaduna, and Kano\u201d.\n\nHe said \u201cThe scope of the railway project involves a 203km double track standard gauge railway from Kano to Kaduna. The railway along this route traverses the major cities of Kaduna, Zaria, and Kano with three (3) railway stations both for passenger and freight services at Rigachukun, Zaria, and Kano with varying capacities and categories\u201d.\n\nHe further said \u201cThis project will link the Federal Capital, Abuja with the Commercial city of Kano and also link the ongoing Kano \u2013 Maradi project. The outstanding addendum, Ibadan \u2013 Abuja, will link the Sea Ports in Lagos to Maradi, Niger Republic. This I believe will greatly boost trade between the two countries and foster economic development. This railway line will present an opportunity for Nigerians to traverse between Abuja and Kano via Kaduna with relative ease\u201d.\n\n\u201d The rail line is also provided with accessories and special installations including Power and Water Supply schemes, Signalling System & Communication in GSM-R, Freight yards, Rolling stock depots, and maintenance workshops,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Kaduna \u2013 Kano railway project is to link the Lagos \u2013 Ibadan Railway project via Abuja, Minna, Ilorin, Oshogbo, Ibadan to Lagos on one end, and Maradi, Niger Republic on the other.",

          "title": "Death Rates Soar in Southeast Asia as Virus Wave Spreads",
          "text": "Indonesia has converted nearly its entire oxygen production to medical use just to meet the demand from COVID-19 patients struggling to breathe. Overflowing hospitals in Malaysia had to resort to treating patients on the floor. And in Myanmar\u2019s largest city, graveyard workers have been laboring day and night to keep up with the grim demand for new cremations and burials.\n\nImages of bodies burning in open-air pyres during the peak of the pandemic in India horrified the world in May, but in the last two weeks the three Southeast Asian nations have now all surpassed India\u2019s peak per capita death rate as a new coronavirus wave, fueled by the virulent delta variant, tightens its grip on the region.\n\nThe deaths have followed record numbers of new cases being reported in countries across the region which have left health care systems struggling to cope and governments scrambling to implement new restrictions to try to slow the spread.\n\nWhen Eric Lam tested positive for COVID-19 and was hospitalized on June 17 in the Malaysian state of Selangor, the center of the country\u2019s outbreak, the corridors of the government facility were already crowded with patients on beds with no room left in the wards.\n\nThe situation was still better than in some other hospitals in Selangor, Malaysia\u2019s richest and most populous state, where there were no free beds at all and patients were reportedly treated on floors or on stretchers. The government has since added more hospital beds and converted more wards for COVID-19 patients.\n\nLam, 38, recalled once during his three weeks in the hospital hearing a machine beeping continuously for two hours before a nurse came to turn it off; he later learned the patient had died.\n\nA variety of factors have contributed to the recent surge in the region, including people growing weary of the pandemic and letting precautions slip, low vaccination rates and the emergence of the delta variant of the virus, which was first detected in India, said Abhishek Rimal, the Asia-Pacific emergency health coordinator for the Red Cross, who is based in Malaysia.\n\n\u201cWith the measures that countries are taking, if people follow the basics of washing the hands, wearing the masks, keeping distance and getting vaccinated, we will be seeing a decline in cases in the next couple of weeks from now,\u201d he said.\n\nSo far, however, Malaysia\u2019s national lockdown measures have not brought down the daily rate of infections. The country of some 32 million saw daily cases rise above 10,000 on July 13 for the first time and they have stayed there since.\n\nThe vaccination rate remains low but has been picking up, with nearly 15% of the population now fully inoculated and the government hoping to have a majority vaccinated by year\u2019s end.\n\nDoctors and nurses have been working tirelessly to try to keep up, and Lam was one of the fortunate ones.\n\nAfter his condition initially deteriorated, he was put on a ventilator in an ICU unit filled to capacity and slowly recovered. He was discharged two weeks ago.\n\nBut he lost his father and brother-in-law to the virus, and another brother remains on a ventilator in the ICU.\n\n\u201cI feel I have been reborn and given a second chance to live,\u201d he said.\n\nWith India\u2019s massive population of nearly 1.4 billion people, its total number of COVID-19 fatalities remains higher than the countries in Southeast Asia. But India\u2019s 7-day rolling average of COVID-19 deaths per million peaked at 3.04 in May, according to the online scientific publication Our World in Data, and continues to decline.\n\nIndonesia, Myanmar, and Malaysia have been showing sharp increases since late June and their seven-day averages hit 4.37, 4.29 and 4.14 per million, respectively, on Wednesday. Cambodia and Thailand have also seen strong increases in both coronavirus cases and deaths, but have thus far held the seven-day rate per million people to a lower 1.55 and 1.38, respectively.\n\nIndividual countries elsewhere have higher rates, but the increases are particularly alarming for a region that widely kept numbers low early in the pandemic.\n\nWith the Indian experience as a lesson, most countries have reacted relatively quickly with new restrictions to slow the virus, and to try to meet the needs of the burgeoning number of people hospitalized with severe illnesses, Rimal said.\n\n\u201cPeople in this region are cautious, because they have seen it right in front of them \u2014 400,000 cases a day in India \u2014 and they really don\u2019t want it to repeat here,\u201d he said in a telephone interview from Kuala Lumpur.\n\nBut those measures take time to achieve the desired effect, and right now countries are struggling to cope.\n\nIndonesia, the world\u2019s fourth most populous nation with some 270 million people, reported 1,383 deaths on Wednesday, its deadliest day since the start of the pandemic.\n\nDaily cases through about mid-June had been about 8,000, but then began to spike and peaked last week with more than 50,000 new infections each day. Because Indonesia\u2019s testing rate is low, the actual number of new cases is thought to be much higher.\n\nAs hospitals there began to run out of oxygen, the government stepped in and ordered manufacturers to shift most production from industrial purposes and dedicate 90% to medical oxygen, up from 25%.\n\nBefore the current crisis, the country needed 400 tons of oxygen for medical use per day; with the sharp rise in COVID-19 cases, daily use has increased fivefold to more than 2,000 tons, according to Deputy Health Minister Dante Saksono.\n\nThough the production of oxygen is now sufficient, Lia Partakusuma, secretary general of Indonesia\u2019s Hospital Association, said there were problems with distribution so some hospitals are still facing shortages.\n\nIn Indonesia, about 14% of of the population has had at least one vaccine dose, primarily China\u2019s Sinovac.\n\nThere are growing concerns that Sinovac is less effective against the delta variant, however, and both Indonesia and Thailand are planning booster shots of other vaccines for their Sinovac-immunized health workers.\n\nIn Myanmar, the pandemic had taken backseat to the military\u2019s power seizure in February, which set off a wave of protests and violent political conflict that devastated the public health system.\n\nOnly in recent weeks, as testing and reporting of COVID-19 cases has started recovering, has it become clear that a new wave of the virus beginning in mid-May is pushing cases and deaths rapidly higher.\n\nSince the start of July its death rate has been climbing almost straight up, and both cases and fatalities are widely believed to be seriously underreported.\n\n\u201cWith little testing capacity, low numbers in the country vaccinated, widespread shortages of oxygen and other medical supplies, and an already beleaguered health care system under increasing strain, the situation is expected to get increasingly worse in the coming weeks and months,\u201d said ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights, a regional advocacy group.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the junta\u2019s confiscation of oxygen, attacks on health care workers and facilities since the coup, and the lack of trust in any services they provide by the majority of the population, risks turning a crisis into a disaster.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, the government reported 5,860 new cases and 286 new deaths. There are no solid figures on vaccinations, but from the number of doses that have been available, it\u2019s thought that about 3% of the population could have received two shots.\n\nOfficials this week pushed back at social media postings that cemeteries in Yangon were overwhelmed and could not keep up with the number of dead, inadvertently confirming claims that hospitals were swamped and many people were dying at home.\n\nCho Tun Aung, head of the department that oversees the cemeteries told military-run Myawaddy TV news on Monday that 350 staff members had been working three shifts since July 8 to ensure proper cremations and burials of people at Yangon\u2019s seven major cemeteries.\n\nHe said workers had cremated and buried more than 1,200 people on Sunday alone, including 1,065 who had died at home of COVID-19 and 169 who had died in hospitals.\n\n\u201cWe are working in three shifts day and night to inter the dead,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is clear that there is no problem like the posts on Facebook.\u201d",

          "title": "Covid-19 Origins: China Rejects WHO Proposal to Return to Wuhan",
          "text": "China has rejected a proposal from the World Health Organization (WHO) that the expert team investigating the origins of COVID-19 should return to the sites in China where the coronavirus first emerged, saying researchers should instead make a priority of the \u201cvery likely\u201d possibility that the virus originated in animals and expand their work to other countries around the world.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference at the State Information Council Zeng Yixin, the vice minister of China\u2019s National Health Commission, said he was \u201csurprised\u201d that the WHO had proposed the team return to places in the central city of Wuhan that they visited earlier this year and also investigate the hypothesis that it leaked from a lab.\n\nIn a closed-door meeting last week, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus proposed the second stage of the agency\u2019s investigation into the origins of coronavirus should include further studies in China as well as laboratory \u201caudits\u201d.\n\n\u201cFinding the origins of this virus is a scientific exercise that must be kept free from politics,\u201d Ghebreyesus said. \u201cFor that to happen, we expect China to support this next phase of the scientific process by sharing all relevant data in a spirit of transparency.\u201d\n\nThe WHO has been under growing pressure to step up its investigation into the origin of the virus, which first emerged in Wuhan and has now killed more than 4.1 million people around the world.\n\nIts team of international and Chinese experts made their first visit to Wuhan in mid-January, more than a year after the first cases of what was then a \u201cmysterious pneumonia\u201d were first detected. They spent four weeks in the city, visiting key sites including the now-closed Huanan Seafood market, and two research laboratories that worked with viruses from bats \u2013 a suspected animal host for COVID-19.\n\nChina has dismissed suggestions the coronavirus could have leaked from a Wuhan lab saying they operate to international safety standards [File: Shepherd Hou/EPA]\n\nIn a joint report released in March the team said the virus had probably been transmitted from bats to humans through another animal but calls for a deeper investigation into the virus\u2019s origins have continued amid speculation that it could have escaped from one of the laboratories. In May, US President Joe Biden ordered a review of the virus origins saying that intelligence agencies were divided over whether it had come from animals or from a lab.\n\nThe hypothesis was also included in the WHO\u2019s phase-two proposal although the theory had been downplayed in the team\u2019s initial report.\n\n\u201cWe hope the WHO would seriously review the considerations and suggestions made by Chinese experts and truly treat the origin tracing of the COVID-19 virus as a scientific matter, and get rid of political interference,\u201d Zeng said.\n\nYuan Zhiming of the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory, who was also at the press conference, said the bio-protection systems at the labs in Wuhan were \u201cstable and reliable\u201d and in line with international standards.\n\n\u201cThe general consensus by the academic community is that the coronavirus was naturally generated,\u201d Yuan said, and dismissed reports that three researchers had fallen sick with coronavirus-like symptoms shortly before the first cases emerged in Wuhan, as \u201ccompletely out of nothing\u201d.\n\nLiang Wannian, who leads the Chinese scientists in the WHO team and also spoke to the media, also dismissed questions over China\u2019s transparency, saying it was not possible to share the raw data from the earliest patients publicly, or allow it to be copied because of privacy concerns.\n\nHe stressed the need to focus on animal-to-human transmission and look not only at bats but other species including pangolins, mink and ferrets. He also stressed that the place where the first cases were detected might not be where the disease had actually originated, and reeled off a number of countries and cities where coronavirus traces had allegedly been found in patients or in wastewater at around the same time as the illness was being reported in Wuhan.",

          "title": "Nigeria Dispute Jeopardises Return of Benin Bronzes: BBC Report",
          "text": "A dispute between Nigerian leaders could jeopardise plans for the return of some of Africa\u2019s most famous artefacts, the Benin Bronzes, which were looted during the colonial era and are now mainly in Western museums, as writer Barnaby Phillips reports.\n\nThe Bronzes, thousands of metal sculptures and ivory carvings, were seized from the West African kingdom of Benin \u2013 in what is today Edo State in southern Nigeria \u2013 by a British military force in 1897.\n\nIn Europe their beauty and sophistication caused an instant sensation, and they are widely regarded as amongst Africa\u2019s greatest artworks.\n\nIn recent years, as European governments have come under pressure to atone for colonial-era crimes, some have spoken of their desire to return looted artefacts.\n\nIn April the German government said it wanted to give back hundreds of Benin Bronzes, and several museums in the UK have made similar announcements.\n\nThe return of the Benin Bronzes to Nigeria would mark an extraordinary moment in Africa\u2019s post-colonial history, and is a prospect that seems more likely now than at any time since 1897.\n\nBut when the king, or Oba, of Benin, Ewuare II, summoned \u201call well-meaning people\u201d to an emergency meeting in the Edo capital Benin City earlier this month, it was not in celebration.\n\nHundreds answered the Oba\u2019s call and assembled in his palace, dressed in handsome robes, singing his praises. Ewuare II, the great-great grandson of the Oba who was toppled by the British in 1897, warned of an attempt by what he called an \u201cartificial group\u201d to \u201cdivert\u201d the return of the Bronzes.\n\nThis group, the Legacy Restoration Trust (LRT) had the support of Edo State Governor Godwin Obaseki and had planned to put the Bronzes in an Edo Museum of Western African Art (EMOWAA).\n\nThe Oba made his opposition clear.\n\n\u201cThe right and only legitimate destination\u201d for the Bronzes would be a \u201cBenin Royal Museum\u201d, he said, sited within his palace grounds. He insisted that the Bronzes had to come back to where they were taken from, and that he was \u201cthe custodian of all the cultural heritage of the Benin Kingdom\u201d.\n\nThe Oba\u2019s argument is compelling, but awkwardly, his son and designated heir, crown prince Ezelekhae Ewuare, attends the board meetings of the LRT he professes to know nothing about. So does Nigeria\u2019s National Commission for Museums and Monuments, representing the federal government.\n\nGovernor Obaseki has convinced a celebrated architect, Sir David Adjaye, to design the new museum, bringing prestige and a wave of positive international publicity to the project. Although the Oba now warns anybody dealing with the LRT they do so \u201cat their own risk and against the will of the people of the Benin Kingdom\u201d, he must worry it is already too late.\n\nThe British Museum has signed a deal with the LRT for an archaeology project in Benin City. The German government is discussing doing the same, and funding an LRT building to initially house returned Bronzes. These contracts are worth millions of dollars. British and German officials, as well as other Europeans, embraced the Trust in part because they believed it and the Oba were working together.\n\nSo how did it come to this? Above all, because of distrust and rivalry between Oba Ewaure II and Governor Obaseki. \u201cIt\u2019s an ego tussle between them,\u201d says one person close to the process.\n\nThe accusations being traded are not pretty \u2013 of individuals allegedly more interested in financial gain, either from the Bronzes themselves or the contracts around a new museum, than in rectifying an historical injustice.\n\nHowever, a German government official told me: \u201cThose who think there\u2019s money to be made from this new museum are mistaken. A museum is somewhere you spend money, you don\u2019t make it\u201d.\n\nNone of this is good news for those who dream of the Bronzes going back to Benin City. An Edo historian involved in discussions with European museums told me the dispute between the Oba and the governor \u201chas sent a chill through all of us\u201d.\n\nA director of a European museum which has a large collection of Bronzes, and has previously spoken in favour of their return, told me: \u201cOur policy is that if claimants are in dispute amongst themselves, we wait until they resolve it.\u201d\n\nThe University of Aberdeen in Scotland said earlier this year that its museum would give back a Benin Bronze head \u201cunconditionally\u201d. But in the wake of recent events the museum\u2019s director, Neil Curtis, told me he would be \u201cvery uncomfortable\u201d if this return occurred without agreement among all parties in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria\u2019s federal government has legal responsibility for the return of any Benin Bronzes, and, it says, will ultimately \u201ctake possession\u201d of them, although the Oba\u2019s supporters stress he will never concede on the question of ownership.\n\nThe Director-General of the government\u2019s National Commission for Museums and Monuments, Abba Isa Tijani, told me the dispute between the Oba and the governor was \u201ca private matter between them \u2013 local politics that cannot slow down restitution\u201d. He suggests a compromise, whereby Benin Bronzes return to various museums within Benin City, including one within the palace grounds as well as the more ambitious EMOWAA outside its walls.\n\nSome European museum curators blame the German government for pushing ahead with bold announcements on the return of Benin Bronzes before they\u2019d confirmed that everyone in Nigeria was aligned on this sensitive issue. A German official conceded they had moved quickly in part because of domestic political concerns, but more importantly, he insisted, out of a sense of what was morally right.\n\nAn ally of Governor Obaseki said: \u201cNothing happens in Nigeria without drama. I\u2019m still 95% certain we can work this out.\u201d\n\nVictor Ehikhamenor is an acclaimed artist from Edo State and an outspoken advocate for the return of the Benin Bronzes. He is also on the board of the Legacy Restoration Trust. When I spoke to him recently, he remained upbeat.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t expect this process to be a cakewalk,\u201d he said. \u201cColonialism yoked us together. We just need to speak with one voice.\u201d\n\nBBC",
