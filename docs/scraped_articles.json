          "text": "Some legislative aides to members of the National Assembly are billed to file a petition to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission and the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission today (Monday) over the alleged non-payment of the backlog of their salaries and allowances.\n\nThe PUNCH reliably learnt on Thursday that the aggrieved aides had already petitioned the leadership of the National Assembly and security agencies, and had now resolved to involve the anti-graft agencies.\n\nThe Clerk to the National Assembly, Amos Ojo, who spoke through his aide, Austin Adesoro, however, stated that the management was in talks with the leadership of the National Assembly Legislative Aides\u2019 Forum, the umbrella body of the legislative aides, while dismissing the protesting aides as acting in ignorance.\n\nAccording to documents sighted by our correspondent, those said to have been petitioned include the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan; Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila; Chairman, National Assembly Service Commission, Ahmed Amshi; Clerk to the National Assembly, Amos Ojo; Chairman, Senate Committee on Public Accounts, Matthew Urhoghide; Chairman, House Committee on Public Accounts, Oluwole Oke; and the Department of State Services.\n\nA competent source in the NASSLAF, who spoke on condition of anonymity, as he was not authorised to disclose the association\u2019s plans, said the aides would petition the anti-graft agencies this week, adding, \u201cThey will submit the petition to the EFCC and the ICPC on Monday.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with our correspondent, Adesoro stated that only N5bn had been released to the National Assembly out of the N25bn supplementary budget, adding that N2.3bn was used to settle issues relating to members of staff, while the aides got N2.7bn.\n\nHe said, \u201cThey are not the elected executive of the NASSLAF. The management is engaging the authentic executive of the NASSLAF. These are just a bunch of unserious and unreasonable aides, who have refused to accept the situation on the ground. If they are still interested in engaging in dialogue with the management, we will find a solution to the issue on the ground.\n\n\u201cAs far as the issue of N25bn is concerned, it was for payment of the minimum wage and liabilities. Are they saying that the clerk should go against the law and pay the legislative aides the arrears? Out of the N25bn, only N5bn was released to the National Assembly; the other N20bn is still with the Central Bank of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe petition addressed to the Director, DSS, National Assembly Division, dated February 7, 2022, is titled, \u2018Continued refusal of the CNA/management to fulfil the terms of our understanding on the issue of salary arrears and minimum wages\u2019.\n\nIt was signed by Zebis Prince for the South and Tony Omali for the North.\n\nThe petition read in part, \u201cFor the umpteenth time, we write to you to intimate you of our frustration with regards to the protracted issue of our salary arrears and non-payment of our minimum wages.\n\n\u201cDespite your kind intervention, and in spite of these sums being captured in the 2021 supplementary budget that was passed (by the National Assembly) and signed into law by the President on July 22, 2021, the Amos Ojo-led management has continued in its impunity of breaching all known financial regulations by deploying legislative aides\u2019 funds to other uses.\n\n\u201cThe CNA had by his own admission stated that N25bn was released under the Service Wide Votes but instead of paying legislative aides their salary arrears and minimum wage arrears, the CAN, with alarming consistency, continues to flout the appropriation law and the House resolution passed on Wednesday, March 17, 2021, wherein the House mandated the management to pay these outstanding liabilities since the money had been approved and appropriated.\n\n\u201cWe are appalled by the discretionary manner in which the CNA runs the affairs of the National Assembly. The CNA runs the National Assembly in a Machiavellian, despotic and irrational manner like a 16th Century fief lord, subjecting a public institution to his whims and caprices.\n\n\u201cWe have always frowned and complained about Amos Ojo\u2019s penchant for discrimination and favouritism and lack of oversight control. If there was ever any doubt about our position regarding the CNA, this current insult on the aides has further reinforced our belief that this current CNA does not possess the qualities to hold a public office.\u201d\n\nThe aides challenged the National Assembly management led by Ojo to \u201cprove us wrong by opening the National Assembly accounts for scrutiny.\u201d\n\nThe aides also said they had written to the CNA for the release of funds made to the National Assembly for 2021 acting under the Freedom of Information Act 2011, \u201cbut as usual, he rebuffed the official request.\u201d\n\nThe petition added, \u201cFlowing from the above, starting from next week, we shall take certain steps to bring our sorry plight to the attention of the world in the hope that they might be able to caution the \u2018Emperor\u2019. Some of these steps include but are not limited to media campaigns/interviews, submission of petitions to the EFCC and ICPC, and ultimately instituting a suit against the CNA and the National Assembly as an institution.\n\n\u201cWe also intend to submit acknowledged copies of the petition to the Presidency and the Minister of Finance.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Professor Yemi Osinbajo\n\nLaments Nigerians facing inadequate shelter\n\n\u2026.Commissions 248 housing units for low-income earners\n\nBy Chris Ochayi\n\nABUJA: The Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo has lamented that many households are faced with a dilemma of survival between food and inadequate shelter.\n\nHe said to the aim is to address the issue of inadequate housing in the country, the Buhari administration remains determined in its vision to build a nation where low income earners have the dignity of a decent home and livelihood.\n\nREAD ALSO:AIG\u2019s plan to build integrated steel plant in Nigeria will create 10,000 job opportunities for youths \u2013 SON boss\n\nOsinbajo, stated this weekend in Masaka, Nasarawa State at the commissioning of 248 housing units and commemoration of the 1,000th home built by the Millard Fuller Foundation, (MFF).\n\nHe described the commissioning of the housing project as a watershed event in the important work of providing housing for Nigerians who need it most.\n\nThe Vice President added that \u201cWhile the challenge of inadequate or no-housing undermines the quality of life of many Nigerians on low income, it also denies our economy and, therefore, our collective welfare the growth that is possible through a vibrant housing market.\u201d\n\nHe emphasized that the Buhari Administration is taking the challenges seriously by addressing the concerns.\n\nThe most recent initiative regarding this is the N200 billion National Social Housing Programme under the N2.3 Trillion Economic Sustainability Plan (ESP), which is aimed at delivering homes for Nigerians on low income, as well as providing jobs for the local industry.\n\nAccording to him, to ensure that these initiatives are sustained, the Federal Government is in the final draft stages of a comprehensive 10-year National Housing Strategy. The strategy is the first of its kind with input from the private and public sector players.\n\nThe VP disclosed that under the ESP Social Housing programme, which will create up to 300,000 homes, 18 States have so far given land for free, while 19,478 homes have been built, including 582 purchased from the Millard Fuller Foundation.\n\n\u201cWe are negotiating another 400 homes with them,\u201d Prof. Osinbajo stated, adding that \u201cthe one-bedroom self-contained costs N2 million and N3.2 million for the two-bedroom. We negotiated with Dangote, BUA and Lafarge to give the Family Homes Fund cement at 30% discount. So we now have low cost cement.\u201d\n\nHighlighting the Millard Fuller Foundation\u2019s housing units in Nasarawa State as an example of private sector partnership with Government in reducing the social housing supply gap, the Vice President hoped that \u201cit can serve as a model for many others to follow, with the potential for creating homes that are affordable to Nigerians on modest income, particularly our young people as they start out in life.\u201d\n\nThe VP, who was received in Masaka, Nasarawa State by Governor Abdullahi Sule, later inspected the affordable housing units built by the foundation.\n\nSpeaking at the event, Governor Sule thanked the Vice President for finding the time to commission the housing units and \u201cto share in the joy of the beneficiaries, especially those of the Fuller Foundation,\u201d describing the gesture as a demonstration of the VP\u2019s care for the people.\n\nThe Governor also commended the effort of the Federal Government in finding solutions to the challenge of affordable housing and gave assurances that the State Government is commitment to fixing the access road to the housing estate.\n\nEarlier, Mr Sam Odia, the National Director of the Millard Fuller Foundation expressed appreciation for the Vice President\u2019s presence to commission the housing units. He described the VP as a \u201cman of his word, and a man who has a heart for the poor.\u201d\n\nHe added that the foundation is working with the Family Homes Fund to advance the cause of social housing in Nigeria.\n\nAlso present at the event were the Managing Director of the Family Homes Fund, Mr Femi Adewole; the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Infrastructure, Ms. Imeh Okon; officials of the State and Karu Local Government Council; the Etsu Karu, HRH Luka Panya-Baba; and representatives of partners in the project, among others.\n\nThe Millard Fuller Foundation was founded in 2006 and has been working on more inclusive housing for low-income Nigerians. The Foundation is supported by the Fuller Center for Housing Inc., USA, Selavip International, Belgium, Family Homes Funds Ltd, and the Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit GmbH (GIZ). The Federal Government\u2019s N-Power programme also partners with the MFF \u201cas an official building skills training centre.\u201d\n\nAlso, Chairman, Board of Directors of the Millard Fuller Foundation, Pastor. Solomon Yero, said: \u201cWe are working hard to improve invisibility of the affordable housing market. While it took us almost 10 years to build our first 100 units with grant funding, it took us only another five years to build 1000. With a combination of grants and loans in the next five years.\n\n\u201cWe expect to build another 10,000 At the very least through a combination of grant, loan and investment. Housing delivery is what our organization does best. During simple design homes as fast and as cheaply as possible. This is how we were able to complete the 185 Minute first phase of this project within three months.\n\n\u201cIn 2019, the highly respected runners for the Center for affordable housing finance, recognize homes built by Fuller as the lowest price by a private developer across the entire African continent. Prior to that, fuller housing projects have consistently been a most affordable in Nigeria.\u201d",

          "text": ".\n\n*** Urges Nigerians to Continue to Trust APC to rule Nigeria\n\nBy Henry Umoru, ABUJA\n\nPRESIDENT of the Senate, Senator Ahmad Lawan has boasted that the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC will continue to rule Lagos State and Nigeria as a country.\n\nLawan has also urged Nigerians to continue to entrust the affairs of the country to the APC, saying that the party is the one to trust, just as he described Lagos as a home for APC and expressed the confidence that \u201cAPC, by the Grace of God, will continue to rule Lagos and rule Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe President of the Senate made the appeal in Lagos at the fifth edition of the empowerment programme of Senator Solomon Olamilekan Adeola, APC, Lagos West.\n\nThe event which was held at the premises of the Nigeria Police College, Ikeja was also witnessed by the Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu.\n\nIn a statement, by his Special Adviser, Media, Ola Awoniyi, the President of the Senate said, \u201cAll that we need to do is to continue what we are doing now. Support our leaders. Tolerate us. Unite ourselves and of course, remain focused.\n\n\u201cPDP may tell you something funny about the administration of APC at the national level but PDP ruled Nigeria for 16 years and all that they did was to leave or bequeath so many challenges to us in 2015.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nI told Buhari I want to step in his shoes, not on his toes \u2014 Tinubu\n\n\u201cWe are dealing with those challenges one after the other and if on the way, we encounter new challenges, we are equal to the task.\n\n\u201cBy the Grace of God, we are going to turn around the fortunes of this country for the better. We have done so much but we are also challenged especially in the area of security.\n\n\u201cWhen someone tells you that the APC administration only takes loans or borrow money, PDP had 16 years of so many resources and they did very little infrastructure in the country if any. The money disappeared and our options are limited.\n\n\u201cBut one option that is not on the table at all is not to do anything. Because you don\u2019t have money, so we shouldn\u2019t develop your country? Nigeria\u2019s administration at the national level is responsible and responsive.\n\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t like to take loans or borrow money but when the options are limited and the imperative of development of infrastructure in the country is there, what do we do?\n\n\u201cIf we have to borrow, we have to borrow responsibly, targeted at capital development and today I want to say without any fear of contradiction that in every part of this country, there is infrastructural development either in terms of roads, bridges, dams and so on and so forth.\n\n\u201cThis is to tell you that we desire to develop our country and that APC at all levels deserves the trust of Nigerians because we will always tell Nigerians what it is. We won\u2019t hide anything because you gave us your trust.\n\n\u201cWhat you witness in Lagos is to tell you one of the best the APC can do and we have many APC states that are working so hard to develop those states.\n\n\u201cI want to assure Nigerians that APC as a political party is the one that you can trust because, for us, the citizens of this country are the most essential elements and people that we must always focus on.\u201d\n\nLawan who urged Lagosians to consider Governor Sanwo-Olu for another term based on his wonderful performance, said, \u201cYour Excellency, we have been watching you over the last two and half years. You have been very wonderful. You have been consistent in terms of service delivery to the people of Lagos State and indeed this country.\n\n\u201cYou are focused. You are reliable. And I want to say even though the fate of politicians is in the hands of voters, your fate is in the hands of Lagosians but Your Excellency, I\u2019m under this tremendous and massive temptation to say that one good turn deserves another term. We are proud of you. APC stakeholders, I hope I will be forgiven for this statement because that is what believe in seriously \u201c\n\nThe Senate President commended Senator Adeola aka Yayi who is also Chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, for the programme which involved the distribution of ambulances, incubators, drugs to health facilities and empowerment items to his constituents.\n\n\u201cWhat we will say about Distinguished senator Olamilekan, about his performance, his representation, is going to be weighty because we work with him. And I want to report here that you have voted for a very loyal person, a very prolific and productive Senator who works round the clock.\n\n\u201cThis your Senator, Yayi, has done so much for the Senate in terms of his productivity and I want to add here that Lagos West is controlling the economy of Nigeria. And I want to tell you why. Before the budget of the Federal Government is passed, you need a financial analysis of what will be available in revenues.\n\n\u201cIt is this Yayi and your Representative in the House, Honourable James Abiodun Faleke, the two of them will sit and decide on what is available for Nigeria to share. The size of the cake is decided by Yayi and Hon. Faleke. And I\u2019m happy for you because you took the right decision by voting for him(Yayi).\n\n\u201cSo you have given Nigeria a very solid, very stable, very reliable person to serve as your Senator. We are all appreciative for what you have been able to help us achieve in the Senate and in the National Assembly, for so many superlative performances that we have been able to achieve in the ninth Senate,\u201d Lawan said.\n\nThe Senate President said the constituency projects were essentially to complement the efforts of the Federal and state governments.\n\nLawan said the various empowerment programmes being undertaken by members of the National Assembly were also to actualise the presidential efforts at reducing the poverty level in the country.\n\n\u201cThis is what members of the National Assembly are doing across the country. And we believe that we will continue to do this as members of the National Assembly because our people, those who voted for us, are happy with it.

And when we act like that, our energy gets diluted, our priorities get twisted and unexpected things start happening.\n\n\u201cTithing is a prosperity message that does not win souls for God. Preach salvation, love and mercy.\n\n\u201cSometimes, I feel ashamed when I see or read that some men of God are mandating or forcing their members to pay tithes.\n\n\u201c2 Corinthians 9:7 is clear about this.

          "text": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said Nigeria and other countries that launched Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) may witness cash shortage as they push for increased adoption of the payment option.\n\nThe CBDC has been launched in Nigeria, Bahamas, Canada, China, Sweden, and Uruguay.\n\nNigerian banks had in December 2021 and early January faced cash crunch at some of their branches in Lagos, Abuja and Port Harcourt. Customers were denied access to cash at such branches, leading to long queues.\n\nIn a report obtained at the weekend, the IMF stated that access to payments through CBDC may trigger multiple hurdles, including shortage of cash, firms\u2019 refusal to accept cash, and lack of or recurring disturbances of digital infrastructure.\n\nThe report titled: \u201cBehind the Scenes of Central Bank Digital Currency-Emerging Trends, Insights, and Policy Lessons\u201d noted that if cash availability falls beneath a certain level, some groups might experience difficulties in making payments.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAccording to the report, these groups include individuals in remote areas where private firms find it unprofitable to operate, with low income, and with different forms of impairments.\n\nThe report advised that a potential CBDC could hence be designed with universal access in mind noting that in countries in which cash usage is dwindling, access to payment is also a key concern as some segments of the population still rely on, or prefer, making cash payments, but may run into limitations.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) digital currency, e-Naira, was launched last October by President Muhammadu Buhari in Abuja. It was estimated that the adoption of e-Naira and its underlying technology, called blockchain, can increase Nigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product by $29 billion over the next 10 years, among other benefits.\n\nCBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele said the CBDC, otherwise known as the e-Naira, would bring about increased cross-border trade, accelerate financial inclusion, and lead to cheaper and faster remittance inflow.\n\nCBN\u2019s data showed that e-Naira wallets downloaded across the world have crossed the 700,000 mark while banks in Nigeria have integrated the e-Naira into their e-payment portals.\n\nThe IMF report outlined that some central banks are concerned that private payment service providers might not find extending services to all parts of the population sufficiently profitable and that declining use of cash will exacerbate the problem.\n\n\u201cSome jurisdictions are therefore exploring if a CBDC could help achieve or safeguard universal access to payments,\u201d the report said.\n\nAccording to the report, in countries where cash and check use is high, operational costs are elevated. And in some countries, existing digital payments are also relatively expensive.\n\n\u201cThe CBDC is, therefore, a potential policy tool to offer digital forms of payments that are cheaper to operate. The non-profit nature of central banks means that they could potentially offer low-cost payments as a public good, potentially subject to the need to eventually recover costs,\u201d the report stated.\n\nThe report noted that some features of cash, including anonymity and the lack of an audit trail, make it attractive for illicit transactions like tax evasion, money laundering, and terrorist financing. CBDC could potentially reduce this problem.\n\nIMF pointed out that CBDC could potentially increase competition in a country\u2019s payments sector in two ways: directly, by competing with existing forms of payments; and indirectly, should the CBDC be designed as a platform open to private payment service providers. The latter would ensure low barriers of entry for new firms seeking to roll out new payment services.\n\nThe report noted that all CBDCs that are currently circulating, either as official currency or through a pilot, are designed with restrictions that limit the competitiveness of CBDC versus bank deposits.",

The minister was yet to reply to text messages sent to him.\n\nBut his Labour and Employment Minister, Dr. Chris Ngige, confirmed today\u2019s meeting at the Education ministry in Abuja.\n\nNgige said a representative of the Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment would attend the meeting and give the ministry updates.\n\nNgige said: \u201cThe Federal Ministry of Education FMoE is calling them to a meeting this week. I have had interactions with the education minister (Adamu Adamu).\n\n\u201cThe meeting will be attended by the National Universities Commission and other relevant government side.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Finance will also attend the meeting. The re-negotiation of the 2009 agreement has financial input so finance will be attending the meeting.\n\n\u201cThey are doing Education ministry meeting tomorrow. The ministry will invite ASUU leadership either Wednesday or Thursday to the education ministry. Everybody will be doing something.\u201d\n\nThe minister also said he has communicated the feedback on the integrity test conducted by National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) on the University Transparency Accountability Solutions \u2013 the payment platform developed by university lecturers.\n\nThe minister added that the feedback of ASUU has also been communicated back to NITDA, adding that both sides would meet to iron out the grey areas identified in the payment platform.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have communicated to NITDA. NITDA detected deficiencies in their system in the 500 items tested and they have notified us of the items that didn\u2019t pass their test and we have communicated the same to ASUU.\n\n\u201cASUU has replied which we have forwarded back to NITDA and asked NUC and NITDA to invite them (ASUU) to sit down; the two technical teams will sit down and iron out the things.\n\n\u201cASUU is not fair to my side as a conciliator.\u201d\n\nASUU President Prof. Emmanuel Osodeke is billed to address a news conference today on the outcome of the union\u2019s NEC meeting which began at the University of Lagos (UNILAG) over the weekend.\n\nThe Nation learnt that in the course of the two-day meeting, the Union changed venues from the Ade Ajayi main auditorium to Tayo Aderinokun Auditorium over fears that the initial venue was bugged by government agents.\n\nIn the run-up to the NEC, the union threatened to begin an indefinite strike over what it called government\u2019s haphazard implementation of the agreement both parties signed in 2009 to improving facilities in public universities, pay earned academic allowances and adoption of the Universities Transparency Accountability System (UTAS) to replace the Integrated Personnel Payroll Information System (IPPIS).",

He disagreed with the proposed amendment in the letter titled: \u2018APC Constitution (Amendment)- Proposed Exclusion of NASS Members,\u2019 he said the amendment violated the 1999 Constitution.\n\nJimoh said: \u201cI read with dismay a proposed plan to amend our party\u2019s constitution in line with Article 30 (iii). This is a welcome development under your leadership.\n\n\u201cHowever, I disagree with the proposed plan to amend 12(i), which has to do with the Convention.\n\n\u201cAny attempt to exclude members of National Assembly (NASS), individually or collectively, by error of commission or omission will violate the principles of Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 Constitution as amended.\n\n\u201cFederal lawmakers or members of National Assembly belong to federal level or national level. As such, they belong to National Convention and must be partakers at all levels.\n\n\u201cMany hands make light work.\u201d Shakespeare said: \u201cMine honour is my life; both grow in one; take honour from me and my life is done.\u201d Members of NASS, both serving and former, have been part of National Convention, ab initio. Removing them will become too apparent that you don\u2019t need them.\n\n\u201cPlease note that our party is not the only registered political Party in Nigeria. Others have members of the National Assembly as part of their National Convention.\n\n\u201cI am convinced that our National Convention will be an excellent opportunity to exchange knowledge and share experiences on the continuous improvement of our party, APC.\n\nI hope through your leadership, our party will once again become a party of international standard.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency, chairman; there is another Chapter of history to be made in Nigeria come 26th of February, 2022.\u201d\n\nJimoh said APC cannot afford to copy dictatorial styles.\n\nHe said why constitution amendment is good, he said federal legislators shoukd not be sidelined.\n\nJimoh said: \u201cThere are some areas I\u2019m disagreeing to and those areas have to do with the National Assembly members, both former and serving where they are proposing that National Assembly will only be represented by the superior officers. That is not too good for us. \u201cThe new proposal only admits former and sitting governors and their deputies, including Secretary to the Federal Government, who was never elected. This is against the norm that allows both former and current National Assembly members. This is not good at all. \u201cPeople must be allowed to participate in convention. The current proposal is not in tandem with with democratic ethos; it has semblance of military era. Military will come and suspend the constitution. This arrangement appears to be mooting the idea of suspending the parliament as a whole. This should not have been proposed.\n\n\u201cWhy will there be any proposal to exclude both past and current National Assembly members from participating in the convention? And this is the only grouse I have with this proposal.\u201d\n\nHe,added: \u201cI completely disagree with the party that they cannot use that on us because it is a ploy to get rid of the legislators. We are representing the national, hence we are called the National Assembly and therefore, we cannot be excluded from the convention.\n\n\u201cIn other political parties, their members of the National Assembly are part and parcel of the of their convention. Why should our own be different?\n\n\u201cI have written a letter to the chairman, Caretaker Committee where I stated that on no account should the members of the National Assembly should be excluded from the convention. And I believe the drafters will have a rethink and ensure that we do something meaningful.\u201d",

It accused the micro blogging platform of double standards in its reaction to the 2020 #EndSARS protest in Nigeria and the ongoing truckers\u2019 protests in Canada.\n\nThe tuckers in Canadian capital, Ottawa, are protesting the stringent COVID-19 restrictions by the government.\n\nThe protest has crippled the international trade between Canada and the United States.\n\nThe Canadian government has employed hardline tactics to end it.\n\nMinister of Information, Culture and Tourism Lai Mohammed said: \u201cRecall that during the #EndSARS protest, which culminated in the blockage of public roads and massive destruction of government and private properties, Canada was one of the countries that spoke out in support of the protesters.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cRecall also that Twitter actively supported the EndSars protesters and even helped them to raise funds while GoFundMe was used to raise funds for the protests.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe entities are now rushing to distance themselves from the protesters in Canada and even denying them the use of their platforms.\n\n\u201cThis is similar to what played out during the January 6th, 2021 insurrection at the United States (U.S.) Capitol in Washington, D.C. where those involved are either still being investigated or have been charged to court. I don\u2019t blame them. Nobody wants their country destroyed under the guise of protests.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand this intervention. We are not gloating over the unfortunate development in Canada.\n\n\u201cBut we are only calling attention to the double standards involved in the way protesters deemed to be violent are perceived in Nigeria and the West.\n\n\u201cThose who referred to the hoodlums who destroyed public and private property in Nigeria under the guise of #EndSARS as peaceful protesters have tagged similar protesters in their own countries as insurrectionists and terrorists.\n\n\u201cThis glaring double standard should not be lost on all Nigerians. We have always said that you must have a country before you can even enjoy the freedom guaranteed by your country\u2019s constitution.\n\n\u201cIf there is no Nigeria, no one will be talking of freedom of expression or freedom of association and the like.\n\n\u201cThis realisation explains why every country goes the extra mile to protect and preserve itself. And this also explains why we have continued to insist on the regulation of social media to ensure responsible content.\n\n\u201cIn this area, I can confidently say we are far ahead of most countries in the world, which have now realised that social media must be regulated in the interest of their own people.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, our successful negotiation with Twitter to fashion out measures to ensure responsible use of that platform which, by the way, will also apply to other social media platforms, has made us a global trailblazer in efforts to prevent harmful content from social media platforms.\n\n\u201cWe must not allow anyone to destroy our country under the guise of protest or unbridled freedoms. We all must put Nigeria first at all times.\u201d\n\nAfter the #EndSARS protest, the Federal Government suspended Twitter\u2019s operation in Nigeria.

The new songs were connected with the processes of installing the 42nd Olubadan of Ibadanland, which suffered delays over litigation.\n\nGovernor Seyi Makinde is, therefore, set to announce the new Olubadan today. He told the audience at the burial rites for Oba Saliu Akanmu Adetunji, the 41st Olubadan, at the Obafemi Awolowo Stadium, Ibadan, at the weekend: \u201cWhen the crisis of the Obaship in Ibadanland started, I was right here in the Liberty Stadium and said that, if there is any division or faction in the land, I will pitch my tent with the king.\n\nNigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\n\u201cToday, I am also happy that the crisis we have been witnessing on the issue of Olubadan stool has been settled. God has really taken control of everything.\n\n\u201cI have received a letter from the Olubadan-in-Council and, by the grace of God, on Monday (today), I will make the official announcement of the new Olubadan of Ibadanland.\u201d\n\nThis new song puts a stop to the old songs, which began on Monday, January 3, 2022. That was a day after the demise of Oba Saliu Adetunju. The old songs, though shrouded in controversies, started from a letter written by former Commissioner for Justice, Michael Folorunso Lana, to Makinde to withhold his approval for the nominee to the vacant stool of Olubadan, based on legal issues.\n\nHe told Makinde to withhold his approval of Senator Lekan Balogun. He based his argument against the installation of Chief Balogun, Otun Olubadan, and other members of the Olubadan-in-Council, except one, as beaded-crown-wearing kings by the former governor, the late Abiola Ajimobi, on Sunday, August 27, 2017.\n\nThe only member of the council who did not accept the crown, Senator Rashidi Ladoja, Osi Olubadan and former governor, challenged the installation in court. He won in a judgment delivered in January 2018 in Ibadan. When the matter got to the Court of Appeal, the judgment of the lower court was set aside, and the case file was returned to the lower court for retrial.\n\nIn the midst of it, Makinde came on board on May 29, 2019. The governor opted for an out-of-court settlement with Ladoja. The terms of agreement formed the consent judgment delivered on November 19, 2019. In the judgment, the \u201chigh chiefs\u201d elevated to the positions of kings lost their crowns and returned to the status quo.\n\nBut they were dissatisfied with the judgment and went back to the same high court to know if it was right for the consent judgment to be delivered without their input. Chief Judge, Justice Munta Abimbola, handled the case and the court was set for judgment when the controversy on who should succeed Oba Adetunju began.\n\nLana postulated two ways to settle the matter. The high chiefs should relinquish their crowns, including Lekan Balogun, for him to become Olubadan: \u201cThey withdraw the case, or wait for the judgment. If the judgment says they should not wear crowns, he should be installed Olubadan, and if the judgment says they could wear crowns, Balogun should forfeit the stool of Olubadan.\u201d\n\nThe chiefs fired back, saying the traditional system of ascendancy to the throne of Olubadan was sacrosanct and there was no controversy over who becomes the next Olubadan. Lawyers to the council also wrote to Makinde, telling him that nothing tinkered with the tradition of appointing a new Olubadan, irrespective of whether their clients were beaded-crown-wearing kings or not.\n\nThe governor said he would respect the wish of the former Olubadan, who stood against the elevation of his chiefs to kings. At a meeting between the governor and the Ibadan kingmakers, which also had Ladoja in attendance, the governor told them to withdraw their appeal so that the process of installing the next Olubadan could kick off.\n\nOn Tuesday, February 1, counsel to the Ibadan high chiefs informed the court that he had a notice of discontinuance of the case, dated January 31, 2022, filed on February 1, 2022. He added that all the respondents were served. The application was supported by a four-paragraph affidavit.\n\nThere was no counter-affidavit filed against the application either in writing or orally. He urged the court to grant the application in the interest of peace and justice in Ibadanland. He prayed the court to strike out the case.\n\nJustice Abimbola dismissed the case. Though the court did not go into details of the case, it mentioned the High Court judgment of January 2018, which declared installation of the high chiefs as kings in August 2017 illegal, unconstitutional, null and void, as well as the Court of Appeal judgment that struck out the appeal and ordered retrial at the lower court.\n\nThe court held that the judgment delivered by the Court of Appeal subsists because no higher court has invalidated it: \u201cIt means the 1957 Olubadan Chieftaincy Declaration is intact, irrespective of the amendment done between May and August 2017 to the declaration.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nThe declaration stipulates that two chieftaincy lines, \u201cEgbe Agba\u201d (civilian) and \u201cBalogun\u201d (military), will produce Olubadan on rotational basis. The immediate past Olubadan was produced by the Balogun Line. It is automatic that the Otun Line will produce the next Olubadan.\n\nThe Otun Balogun of Ibadanland, Chief Tajudeen Ajibola, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a well considered judgment. That\u2019s our view. We thought peace must be allowed to reign. So, we settled out of court. We have withdrawn the case. The case has been dismissed.\n\n\u201cWe are now to move on with the next step of promotion that will be presented to the governor. The appropriate person, Senator Lekan Balogun, will be the Olubadan of Ibadanland. There are no more impediments. It is all solved. We want peace to reign, and it has come to reign. We are happy with the judgment. It is what we want.\n\n\u201cWhen a case is struck out, it can be relisted anytime, by either party. When a case is dismissed, that is the end of the matter. You can\u2019t come back, unless for substantial good reasons. If they say they want it like that, they don\u2019t want us to come back as well we do not want to put people to unrest mind.\n\n\u201cWe want people to be rest assured that we are no longer interested. We are no longer interested. Whether dismissed or struck out, it is no big deal to us. We are happy about it. There is no problem.\u201d\n\nBaale of Ekotedo had at many forums advised the high chiefs to withdraw their appeal. He said he was not against the high chiefs becoming obas (kings), but he was against the way they were installed:\n\n\u201cI am the one who wrote a letter to Senator Ajimobi that our high chiefs must be addressed as Oba Eleyele, Oba Ekotedo and so on. I had to write the letter after we attended the National Development Summit of Traditional Rulers in Abuja. I was amazed and unhappy when the organisers said the chiefs were not invited and they must not enter the venue.\n\n\u201cWe told the organisers that they were high chiefs and that they were Olubadan in the making. They said they should wait until they become Olubadan. On that day, I delivered a paper on Industrial Finance in Agriculture. In the letter, I advised Ajimobi to have the meeting in camera with Olubadan, who is the prescribed and consenting authority to nominate, to choose chiefs, and it is not in the purview of any governor.\n\n\u201cIt is not the responsibility of the governor to nominate or to appoint obas or chiefs. I was unhappy that the high chiefs were not allowed to enter the venue on that day, and that was why I wrote the letter to Ajimobi.\n\n\u201cNow that they have relinquished Ajimobi\u2019s crowns, now that there is no more case in court, what is the way forward? The way forward is that, when the whole dust settles, Oba (Senator) Lekan Balogun will write to the governor as to why high chiefs must be called obas, not high chiefs, because of the experience I cited about what happened in Abuja, where they don\u2019t (recognise) high chiefs.\n\n\u201cThough it is our system here, they don\u2019t buy our own system in Abuja. There must be changes. But the changes will not affect the ascendancy, the promotional system of all these obas.\u201d\n\nThe new song in Ibadan now is that the battle is over, no more war, no more impediment, no legal tussle against the nomination of Lekan Balogun as the 42nd Olubadan. Makinde is expected to do the needful on the nomination.\n\nCommissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Matters, Bayo Lawal, told Daily Sun in a telephone chat that he officially received the nomination form for the Otun Olubadan, Senator Balogun, on Monday, February 7, 2022. He said he presented the document to Makinde, after the Executive Council meeting on Tuesday, February 8.\n\nThe Ibadan kingmakers met on Thursday, February 3, 2022, and ratified the nomination of Balogun as the next Olubadan. The meeting was attended by all the kingmakers, except the Iyalode of Ibadanland, Chief (Mrs.) Theresa Oyekanmi, but she sent her consent letter. The Osi Olubadan and former governor, Senator Ladoja, was also at the meeting.\n\nThe kingmakers are waiting for Makinde\u2019s approval of their nominee. The family of the Olubadan-elect is also waiting for the governor\u2019s approval. The first son of the Olubadan-elect, Femi, commended Makinde for preserving the age-long chieftaincy institution in Ibadan.\n\nHe said in his letter: \u201cYour Excellency\u2019s deep respect for traditional institution and diplomatic disposition, which resolved the contentious issues that arose from earlier controversy over the successor to the Olubadan stool, put an end to what could have brought the Ibadan chieftaincy and traditional institution to disrepute. I salute your courage and great wisdom in resolving the issue to the satisfaction of everyone.\u201d",

          "text": "By Olakunle Olafioye\n\nNational President of Arewa United Consultative Forum, AUCF, Alhaji Shuaibu Ado Dansudu, has urged Nigerians to place emphasis on competence and credibility in making their choice of who rules the country next and bother less about where the person hails from.\n\nThe Arewa leader noted that the Igbo, just like every other section of the country, is eminently qualified to lead the country.\n\nNigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\nBut he expressed reservation about what he termed Igbo\u2019s wrong approach in the race for the 2023 presidency.\n\nIn this interview, Dansudu spoke more on the ordeals of separatist leaders, Sunday Ighoho and Nnamdi Kanu whose freedom he said may not entirely lie with the Federal Government. Excerpt:\n\nLeaders of thoughts in the North recently dismissed the call for power shift to the South. Do you think this is fair?\n\nThis is politics where every individual and group are entitled to their own opinion more so because we are in a democracy. They have their reasons for expressing such view. But what matters to me and what I think should matter to every Nigerian is not where the next president comes from. Rather we should be concerned about electing a credible and competent person as the next president. As far as the person has what it takes to move Nigeria forward; as far as the person can unite the nation and help build our economy, where the person hails from should not bother us. It is not our fault that we find ourselves in this situation; it is the fault of the colonial masters who put us in this mess. They did it intentionally because they didn\u2019t want us to live as one people. But then I need to say that Nigeria does not want a new driver in the saddle. What we need is an experienced person who is versed in the system. We know those who fought for democracy in this country and we need to compensate them. Look at the short period Yar\u2019Adua spent as the president of this country, he did perfectly well because he was not a neophyte in the system. He was a governor and understood governance. So, we need somebody who is already in the system \u2013 not a learner. Then, there is also the need to reciprocate the good that has been done to you. You must support a person who supports you. I am not saying it is compulsory power should come to the South, but if the North wants to be fair, northerners should support Tinubu because of his support for the North in the past. Besides that we all know what Tinubu achieved in Lagos State even when the state was starved of fund by the Federal Government.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nWhat then do you to say to those calling for Igbo presidency in 2023? This is one ethnic group that is yet to have a shot at power since the return to civil rule, a factor, which is central to their claim of marginalization?\n\nThe Igbo have the right to rule Nigeria just like every other ethnic group, but the problem with the Igbo, however, is their approach to seeking power. The activity of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, in the recent years is a major cause for concern. When it started in the Southwest, the leaders in the zone stepped in quickly and successfully nipped it in the bud. I don\u2019t doubt the ability of Igbo leaders to rein in these people, but we are yet to see that happening. As it stands, we don\u2019t really know why the problem festers. We don\u2019t know whether it is because Igbo leaders are in support of the group or it is because they lack the capacity to tame them. The group has been accused of all manners of criminalities- killing, assassinating, terrorizing their people. Everybody is afraid of what is going to happen if they are given the opportunity to rule the country. No matter how just the cause you are fighting, taking up arms against the country is not the solution. South Africa is a good example of country whose people were dealt with unjustly but the people did not succumb to the temptation of picking up arms. That was why they had the kind of support they had before they triumphed. You cannot continue killing, ordering your people to stay at home and causing all sorts of unrests and expect the people to listen to you and sympathise with you. These are some of the reasons people may be having a second thought on the issue of Igbo presidency. I do not subscribe to the sentiment that the Igbo are marginalized. There is no way one ethnic group out of three major ethnic groups should be allowed to take everything. The North is strong in politics and that gives us the edge when it comes to seeking and wielding power. When you look at government\u2019s parastatals, ministries, the Southwest has a hold there. The economy is controlled by the Igbo. Beyond this, the South has enjoyed democratic rule more than the North. Obasanjo ruled for eight years, Jonathan spent six years. Yar\u2019Adua only spent two years; it is only Buhari that has the opportunity of ruling for eight years. So, as far as I am concerned, there are just two divisions in the country: the North and the South. Whenever anybody emerges as president in the North, the South is always quick to tag the person as a northerner forgetting that there are three geo-political zones in the North. But if it is from the South, that is when you will hear that the person is from Southwest or South-south or Southeast. The Southerners must begin to see themselves as one. The Igbo has not demonstrated enough commitment to rule this country. These are people whose majority believe they are Biafrans, and not Nigerians. So, what exactly do the Igbo want? Igbo must drop their agitation first and see themselves as Nigerians. That will serve as the first indication that they are ready to rule Nigeria.\n\nHow best do you think the continued detention of Sunday Igboho and Nnamdi Kanu, two separatist agitators, can be resolved with the Federal Government?\n\nThe struggle of Sunday Igboho should not be compared to that of Nnamdi Kanu. I don\u2019t have enough evidence to disprove the claim by security agents that they found some arms in Igboho\u2019s house, but what I know is that Sunday Igboho\u2019s supporters did not go wild on the streets to unleash violence and disturb the peace of their people the way IPOB is doing in the Southeast. The only issue I have with Igboho is that he personalized the fight against the Fulani. He should have partnered with security agents. That is why Igboho failed. Look at the reaction of Yoruba leaders, how they handled and managed the crisis and compare it to the situation in the Southeast. I don\u2019t think the solution lies totally with the Federal Government. The people will have to initiate the peace move. If today, IPOB decides to lay down their arms and allow peace to reign, the government will be willing to release Kanu because his supporters will be able to convince the government that the tension generated in the zone will fizzle out. But if the government today, accedes to the call to release Kanu without IPOB convincing us that they are ready to drop their arms, do you think that will stop the tension in that zone? No! It will not. On the other hand, Igboho can be released, but then you have to remember that he is not in the government\u2019s custody. So, you can see why I said the solution to their ordeals is not entirely with the government.\n\nPresident Buhari has refused to openly align with the political ambition of any of those craving to succeed him. What do you make of the president\u2019s neutrality?\n\nThat is what a good father should do even if he has a favourite among the contenders. He should not make it known to the rest of them. If he does that the rest will gang up against the anointed contender. It is not yet time to show his support for anyone of them. Apart from creating problems for the anointed aspirant, the president himself will face a lot of problems should he make open show of his support for his favourite among them. We all know the story of Jacob and Joseph. Jacob\u2019s open display of affection for Joseph ahead of his other siblings put him into troubles. So, President Buhari must avoid Jacob\u2019s pitfall now to protect his Joseph. He may show it later; not now.",

After having his bath at 11 a.m., he dressed up to go and join General Gusau in his house.\n\n\u201cWhen he was about to leave, he slumped. His aides rallied around him and rushed him to a hospital. But on the way, he gave up the ghost.\u201d\n\nThe source added that the Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir el-Rufai, had ordered the evacuation of Danbaba\u2019s remains to the Government House in Kaduna before he was airlifted to Sokoto, where he was buried according to Islamic rites.\n\n\u201cBy virtue of his position as the head of the kingmakers of Sokoto Caliphate, there is a reserved cemetery, Hubbaren Shehu, where royal leaders are usually buried in Sokoto,\u201d the source added.\n\nUntil his death, he was one of those behind the Rice Revolution of President Muhammadu Buhari being championed by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nHe played a key role in the last Rice Pyramid fair in Abuja by the RIFAN.\n\nMagajin Garin Sokoto was part of the eminent Nigerians who converged on Lagos last weekend to find solutions to the challenges confronting the country ahead of the 2023 elections.\n\nIn a condolence message issued by his media aide, Garba Shehu, in Abuja, President Buhari said: \u201cI am shocked beyond words.

          "text": "*Former VP being driven by money, not ability, says Middle Belt Forum\n\n*PANDEF, Ohanaeze Ndigbo: Atiku\u2019s position a mockery of Nigeria\u2019s constitution\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja, Christopher Isiguzo in Enugu and Seriki Adinoyi in Jos\n\nFormer Vice President Atiku Abubakar yesterday came under fire for faulting the call on the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to zone its presidential ticket to a particular region of the country, and insisting that the Nigerian constitution does not recognise zoning.\n\nThe 17 southern governors; the Southern and Middle-Belt Forum, comprising the Yoruba socio-political group, Afenifere, the pan-Igbo socio-political group, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, and the Middle-Belt Forum, had called on all political parties to zone their presidential tickets to the South.\n\nBut Atiku, who is one of the prominent northern politicians interested in contesting the 2023 presidential election, has faulted the agitation.\n\nSpeaking at a meeting with members of a group, \u2018Let\u2019s Fix Nigeria\u2019 who were on a solidarity visit at his residence in Abuja on Friday, Atiku said zoning was unconstitutional.\n\nThe former vice president argued: \u201cThere is no zoning in the constitution; there is none. I was a member of the constituent assembly that drafted the current constitution and there was nothing like that.\u201d\n\nHe also reportedly stated that any Nigerian endowed with the right attributes could lead the country, as against the call for a younger president.\n\nReacting to the rejection of zoning by Atiku, the National President of Middle Belt Forum (MBF), Dr. Bitrus Pogu, told THISDAY yesterday that the former vice president was being driven by money and not ability.\n\nHe advised Atiku to be patriotic in his quest for power, adding that \u201che\u2019s not more intelligent than everybody in this country.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Atiku were not a rich man, would he have been clamouring for president? He\u2019s just a Nigerian; he\u2019s not more intelligent than everybody in this country. It\u2019s his money that is driving him, rather than ability. Is he saying he\u2019s the only one that has the intellect and capacity to rule this country? Does he have to be a president to be able to add value to governance in this country? There some individuals who think if they are not the one, nothing can happen in this country. But that is a lie; there are so many people out there.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to save this country; the presidency is not about an individual, but about saving Nigeria,\u201d Pogu said.\n\nReacting to Atiku\u2019s claim that zoning is not in the Nigeria\u2019s constitution, Pogu said: \u201cThere are so many things that are not in the constitution that we practice for political stability in the country.\n\n\u201cFor instance, the Peoples Democratic Party; a party Atiku joined in founding; a party that I can say that he\u2019s one of the greatest beneficiaries, has zoning in its constitution,\u201d he added.\n\nPogu recalled that in 2019, \u201cwe all felt that this government was not doing well for Nigeria, and we said Atiku should then come in and take over. We did what we should do. But there were a lot of rigging and inflation of votes; like in Borno State that her people have been dislodged from their places producing unbelievably higher votes than states that are stable; and Yobe State producing votes higher than accredited voters.\n\n\u201cWhen the party went to court, Atiku abandoned everybody and disappeared to Dubai. People didn\u2019t even ask him the reason he disappeared. It was as if he was not interested in taking back his mandate. Today, he is the one saying this, because he thinks it is birthright. I don\u2019t want to talk too much. Nigerians will give him the deserving response.\u201d\n\nPogu urged the former vice president to be a patriot and an elder statesman, and support any Southerner he believes would not be a tribalist and would not be nepotic to address Nigeria\u2019s problems.\n\nPANDEF: Atiku\u2019s Position on Zoning Unfortunate, Disappointing\n\nOn its part, the Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) has described the position of Atiku that zoning is not provided for in the 1999 Constitution as unfortunate and disappointing.\n\nThe group also described Atiku\u2019s position as a mockery of the nation\u2019s constitution, which preaches equity, fairness and inclusiveness.\n\nIt reiterated the call on all registered political parties to field southern candidates for the 2023 general election so as to have the support of the group.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of PANDEF, Hon. Ken Robinson, told THISDAY yesterday that his group was disappointed at the statement credited to Atiku on the zoning of the presidency.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is rather unfortunate that the former vice president drew such a conclusion. He knows his statement is inconsistent with established and justifiable protocols and conventions, which have helped to sustain considerable understanding, peace and stability in the polity.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the narrative that there is no zoning in the nation\u2019s constitution is a conscienceless mockery of Nigeria\u2019s democratic evolution, and indeed, the country\u2019s constitution.\n\n\u201cIt bears underscoring that Nigeria\u2019s Constitution, though flawed, has ample provisions that emphasise inclusiveness, fairness and equity.\n\n\u201cSection 14(3) of the Constitution (as amended) provides that \u2018the composition of the Government of the Federation or any of its agencies and the conduct of its affairs shall be carried out in such a manner as to reflect the federal character of Nigeria and the need to promote national unity, and also to command national loyalty, thereby ensuring that there shall be no predominance of persons from a few states or from a few ethnic or other sectional groups in that government or any of its agencies.\u201d The intent and purpose of this section are precise and explicit.\u201d\n\nRobinson further stated that zoning and rotation of key political positions in the polity cannot be discarded in a diverse and complex society like Nigeria, particularly, under the prevailing circumstances.\n\nHe advised Atiku and other northerners interested in succeeding President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023 to forget such idea, adding that it cannot stand the test of time.\n\nOhanaeze Ndigbo Expresses Disappointment\n\nAlso reacting, the apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo yesterday expressed disappointment at Atiku\u2019s comments on zoning, describing them as unfortunate and sad.\n\nThe organisation said it was unthinkable that the former vice president who had benefited from zoning in his political contests over the years would suddenly kick against same.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chief Alex Chiedozie Ogbonnia, who spoke to THISDAY, noted that having enjoyed tremendous support of Ndigbo over the years, Atiku should use the 2023 presidency to reciprocate the gesture.\n\n\u201cIn the first place, Atiku has been involved in the politics of this country for about 30 years, from SDP, and several other parties.\n\n\u201cHe understands the politics of Nigeria. We are surprised at this his position. PDP has been using zoning as strategy for winning elections in the past. He should realise that Igbos have always supported him even four years ago. If there are any people he should show support, it should be Igbos,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe further noted that Atiku should not to allow his presidential ambition to becloud his sense of reasoning.\n\n\u201cWe are completely disappointed that he is making this kind of comment. Atiku knows the truth and should not allow his ambitions to lead him to abandoning all he once stood for.\n\n\u201cWe used to know him as a man that supports justice, fairness and equity; let him not deviate from this because it will be so unfortunate and sad,\u201d Ogbonnia added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Litasco had previously said it does not comment on trading activities and did not immediately respond to a query on the STI Symphony.\n\nThe VELOS DIAMANTIS, carrying 60,000 tonnes, and allegedly chartered by Mercuria, did a U-turn on February 4, after showing Lagos as its destination, Refinitiv Eikon ship tracking showed. A Mercuria source, however, said the company no longer owns the tanker\u2019s cargo.\n\nThe NNPC had while labouring to absolve itself of complicity in the importation and distribution of millions of litres of the bad product into the country, named Belgium as the country of origin of the adulterated fuel.\n\nAmid the damage done to vehicles in some states in the country, the federal government had vowed to investigate the matter with a view to bringing the culprits to book.\n\nGroup Managing Director of the NNPC, Mallam Mele Kyari, however, stated that from his investigation, the four petrol cargoes were imported by MRS, Emadeb/Hyde/AY Maikifi/Brittania-U Consortium and Oando.\n\nAll the companies mentioned, aside Duke Oil, the NNPC\u2019s trading arm, have since denied complicity.\n\nIronically, Kyari had maintained that the cargoes\u2019 quality certificates issued at the loading port in Belgium, by AmSpec Belgium, indicated that the product complied with the Nigerian specification.\n\nFurthermore, he said the NNPC quality inspectors including GMO, SGS, GeoChem and G&G conducted tests before discharge, which showed that the cargo also met the country\u2019s standard.\n\nHe stated that all defaulting suppliers had been put on notice for remedial actions, stressing that the NNPC would work with other stakeholders to take further necessary actions in line with subsisting regulations.\n\nHe did not explain what \u201cfurther necessary action\u201d would be taken even after saying that there was no national standard for methanol in the fuel imported into Nigeria.\n\nThe decision to reject the cargoes also came days after President Muhammadu Buhari expressed anger over the importation and circulation of the contaminated petrol in the country.\n\nTHISDAY had exclusively reported that the President had therefore ordered that the Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA), Mr. Farouk Ahmed, be queried immediately.\n\nNNPC had also in January announced that it received four tankers carrying unusable petrol that was loaded in Belgium by Litasco, the trading arm of Russia\u2019s Lukoil, and sold to local traders.\n\nThe fuel was found to contain too much methanol and was removed from circulation, causing shortages nationwide.\n\nFollowing the incident, the NNPC banned methanol content in future petrol deliveries. Previously, traders said Nigeria did not specify methanol content. Methanol is sometimes added to petrol in small amounts because it is a cheaper, and cleaner burning fuel that also optimises engine functioning.\n\nAlthough methanol, in small amounts, is a regular petrol additive, the industry\u2019s regulator said the supplier of the off-specification petrol was known but did not name the firm.\n\nNNPC handles nearly all the imports through crude-for-fuel contracts, known as Direct Sale, direct Purchase (DSDP), with consortia of local and foreign oil firms.\n\nEach consortia THISDAY learnt, receives some quantities of crude oil in exchange for petrol.\n\nEmbattled Chief Executive Officer of the NMDPRA, Farouk Ahmed, during the week, stated that the NNPC had received a delivery of 300 million litres to close the supply gap created in the country by the withdrawal of the off-spec petrol.\n\nThe NMDPRA boss had further stated that the country currently has petrol that can last for 20 days, 10 days short of the usual 30-day reserve\n\nOPEC\u2019s Production Drops by 700,000bpd\n\nMeanwhile, OPEC and its allies have continued to produce crude oil below their oil production targets, with the group\u2019s output falling by a record 700,000 barrels per day (bpd) below its collective quotas in January.\n\nAn S&P Global Platts survey indicated that OPEC\u2019s 13 countries raised output by 150,000 bpd from December, pumping 28.19 million bpd of crude, while the nine non-OPEC partners, led by Russia, only managed to add a meagre 10,000 bpd, producing 13.99 million bpd.\n\nThe cartel\u2019s underperformance continued even as there appears to be no end in sight to the rising prices of oil occasioned by tightening supply and growing demand for the commodity, mainly on the back of growing tensions between Ukraine and Russia.\n\nOil traders have continued to be rattled by reports that a Russian invasion of Ukraine could take place within days and bid up oil prices to over $95 in large trading volumes.\n\nTraders fear disruptions of oil and natural gas flows from Russia to Europe in case a war begins, either directly from blown-up pipelines or halted flows, or indirectly when energy trade gets caught up in sanctions.\n\nRussia delivers Europe with one-third of its natural gas needs and exports around 2 million bpd of both crude oil and refined products to European nations.\n\nAccording to the OPEC\u2019s Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR) for January, released this week, Nigeria struggled to pump 1.399 million bpd out of the total allocation, quoting primary (direct) sources.\n\nThis was in contrast to December 2021, when it pumped 1.197 million barrels per day and November when it was only able to produce 1.275 million bpd.\n\nThe biggest increases in crude oil production came from Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Kuwait, while output declined in OPEC\u2019s second-largest producer Iraq, as well as in Venezuela and Libya.\n\nBut in all, S&P stated that 14 out of the 18 members with quotas underproduced their targets, pushing OPEC+ compliance to 120.8 per cent, the highest since the group instituted record output cuts in April 2020 to pull the oil market out of its pandemic crash.\n\nDespite strong gains from the group\u2019s core Gulf members and Russia, disruptions in several OPEC+ countries, including Venezuela, Kazakhstan, Libya and Iraq, limited the bloc\u2019s growth in January, it stated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Story Behind How Buhari\u2019s Minister, Malami, Media Guru, Obaigbena, Other Cabal Members Are Pushing Central Bank Governor, Emefiele\u2019s Presidential Bid",
          "text": "There is currently a division in the All Progressives Congress (APC) over the presidential ambitions of some of its prominent members, which is capable of tearing the ruling party apart.\n\nWhen a political group, The Green Alliance TGA, on Saturday, launched an initiative in Lagos to draft the Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr Godwin Emefiele, into the 2023 presidential race, little did Nigerians know about the driving force behind the campaign.\n\nSaharaReporters has exclusively learnt that a cabal led by the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami is strongly behind the push for Emefiele to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari, ahead of other strong contenders in the party. Another prominent member of the cabal is media entrepreneur, Nduka Obaigbena.\n\nObaigbena is the founding Chairman & Editor-in-Chief of the THISDAY Media Group and ARISE News Channel.\n\nFor instance, the National Leader of the party, Bola Tinubu has publicly declared his intention to run for President and even though Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has yet to officially declare to run, sponsored groups across the country have been \u2018begging\u2019 him to also join the 2023 presidential race.\n\nA top source in the party told SaharaReporters on Sunday that the \u201cAPC is torn between Osinbajo, Tinubu and Emefiele\u2019s people, each pushing their own candidate and agenda\u201d.\n\nAt the weekend, Emefiele\u2019s supporters, mainly youths, spotted white T-Shirts with the inscription MEFFY 2023 at the occasion held in Lagos to draft him into the race.

          "title": "11 African startups to watch out for in 2022",
          "text": "It\u2019s safe to say the Africa startup ecosystem came full circle last year with a record-breaking number of new innovative startups and huge investment to match it. If innovation is a reflection of economic, social, and technological advancement, then we can say the ecosystem has advanced.\n\nSo, out of hundreds of excellent startups in Africa, we have curated 10 that we think you, our readers, should watch closely as we expect them to do some incredible stuff this year.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFintech/cryptocurrency\n\nFounded in February 2020 by Stephen Young, NFTfi is a decentralised and peer-to-peer cryptocurrency loan platform where users can list their NFT collateral to get loan offers from other users.\n\nOn the platform, you can request for a loan using your NFT and other users start bidding to lend you money in cryptocurrency with varying interest rates and repayment terms. Once you accept an offer, you\u2019ll receive wETH or DAI liquidity in your wallet and your NFT is transferred into a double-audited escrow smart contract for the loan duration. If you repay the loan before it expires, you\u2019ll get your NFT back. If you default, the lender can foreclose and receive your NFT.\n\nThis is a good innovation considering the amount of money locked in NFTs. Imagine being able to access liquidity without selling off your NFT.\n\nAs crypto continues to gain mass acceptance and adoption, so does the need to make it easy for holders to transact with it. Lazerpay, founded and launched into beta in November last year by Njoku Emmanuel, is a payment gateway for crypto. Think of Paystack, but for crypto.\n\nLast year, Lazerpay secured an undisclosed amount of investment from Nestcoin, an innovative venture that builds, operates, and invests in crypto and Web3 products. As it\u2019s set to launch to the public, the startup is expected to do to cryptocurrency what Paystack and Flutterwave are doing to fiat in Africa.\n\nCo-founded by Jude Dike, William Okafor, and Temitope Ekundayo, and launched in July 2021, GetEquity says it wants to make funding easy and quick for African startups, and at the backend of it, help common people have a bite of the booming startup ecosystem.\n\nOn GetEquity, users get to invest as little as $10 in startups. Startups get instant access to several angel investors, syndicates, and institutional investors. Startups also get the chance to raise investment from their communities and customers, \u201cgiving ownership and building a stronger sense of belonging with their most loyal customers\u201d.\n\nAs at December last year, according to the co-founders, the company has experienced a 100% growth rate across all metrics. It has over 4,000 users on its platform. About 20 startups are currently listed on its platform and over $400,000 has been invested on the platform.\n\nFounded by Jesse Ghansah and Barima Effah, Float, formerly known as Swipe, was launched in June 2021 as a cash management and credit provider fintech company for Africa\u2019s fast-growth companies.\n\nThe startup recently picked up $17 million in equity and debt funding from notable investors across the world including Cauris, Tiger Global, and Justin Mateen\u2019s JAM Fund, Ingressive Capital, Magic Fund, and many angel investors.\n\nThe company is already operational in Nigeria and Kenya and the seed round is expected to expedite its growth this year.\n\nLaunched in April last year by Ahmed Sabbah, a co-founder at Swvl and Youssef Sholqamy, a former engineer at Uber, Telda is a digital bank that provides free accounts for its users and enables them to send and receive money. It also provides them with a card to use online, in stores, make withdrawals and pay bills.\n\nIn May, just a month after it launched, the company announced that it has raised $5 million pre-seed funding led by Sequoia. It also affirmed that it is the first company to receive a license from the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) under its new regulations to issue cards and onboard customers digitally.\n\nOwing to its achievement in a short period of time, we expect the startup to even achieve more in 2022, so get your eyes peeled on this one.\n\nEdtech\n\nCraydel is an edtech startup that was launched in March 2021 by Manish Sardana, John Nguru, and Shayne Aman Premji. The startup creates a reliable portal to guide African students in their tertiary education, course selection, and career decisions.\n\nCraydel provides a digital end-to-end higher education service. Its service spans from the point of students choosing schools, programmes, and courses to the application and admission stages. The company also provides visa support for those who choose to study abroad, all for free.\n\nCraydel is already in partnership with 90 institutions across Canada, the UK and US, Ireland, and African countries like Malawi and Kenya. There are over 3,000 courses\u2014spread across undergraduate and postgraduate programmes\u2014available to choose from.\n\nFounded in May 2021 but launched into beta in December by former Google Nigeria boss, Honey Ogundeyi, Edukoya says it wants to empower learners and their parents to take control of their learning and make it easier for them to access high-quality learning material and expert help.\n\nThe platform is built to target Nigerian secondary school learners. It has raised a $3.5 million pre-seed capital war chest from Target Global and top African founders like Shola Akindolu and Babs Ogundeyin, among others, to bring effective education to its target audience.\n\nWith the founder\u2019s experience, quality of the team, and the early investment secured, we expect this startup to do great things in the edtech sector this year.\n\nHealthtech\n\nBypa-ss was founded by Dr Andrew Saad in 2019 and entered the market with its proprietary product, HealthTag, a platform for Health Information Exchange (HIE), offering physicians a free cloud-based clinic management solution.\n\nThrough linking with a cloud database, HealthTag securely stores medical records collected from different healthcare providers and gives them to their rightful owner, the user.\n\nAs of November last year, Saad said the company currently has over 17,000 HealthTag cardholders and over 3,500 healthcare providers\u2014mainly in clinics, pharmacies, labs, and radiology centers using their product.\n\nBuilt on the blockchain technology, Afya Rekod wants to create a seamless mobilised healthcare in Africa, where the patients\u2014who are the only moving parts in healthcare\u2014own all the rights to their data.\n\nFounded in 2019 by the co-founder and CEO of Adanian Labs John Kamara, Afya Rekod provides 4 unique offerings to its customers: its core patient\u2019s portal; electronic health record systems (EHRs) for hospitals; diagnostic centres for medical labs; and disease management for control and management of chronic diseases like Ebola and COVID-19.\n\nEcommerce and logistics\n\nTendo is a social ecommerce platform that eases setup and operating costs for social commerce entrepreneurs by providing them with logistics, financing, and marketing.\n\nFounded by Derrick Mungai, Evans Darbo Boateng, Felix Manford, and Primerose Katena, Tendo provides a curated catalogue of products, marketing tools, and other tools that facilitate trading for its users\u2014resellers\u2014to choose from. Once they sell the product at their own chosen price, Tendo handles the rest\u2014ships the product, subtracts the cost and remits the profit in the account of the seller.\n\nTendo simply enables anyone to start an online shop with zero capital. The company has a unique solution to social commerce. It also made it into Y Combinator 2022 Winter Batch, and this is an indicator of its potential to be watched closely.\n\nFounded in June 2021 by Tola Onayemi and Tope Obanla, Norebase, a one-stop-shop digital platform for African businesses to expand, file trademarks, and patent intellectual property (IP) across the continent.\n\nThe startup handles everything it takes for a business to launch in a new African country. It\u2019s a 360-degree business launchpad: business registration, opening of business bank accounts, compliances, license acquisition, and further legal requirements\u2014all from one dashboard.\n\nWe think this startup is building a game-changing product; something that will have a significant impact on the growth of African startups.\n\nWe know you have some startups you are rooting for this year that we might have missed. Please tell us about them in the comment section below.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Nigeria has set in motion what could herald a new dawn for African tech startups as it moots the adoption of new listing rules to encourage tech companies to go public.\n\nThis story was contributed to TechCabal by Seth Onyango/bird\n\nThe Nigerian Exchange Group (NXG) is going on a charm offensive to attract tech unicorns to the bourse, in part to resuscitate the market after a lull in new listings.\n\nIts pivot towards fintech firms underpins the coming of age of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem \u2013 now a top destination for foreign direct investment (FDI).\n\nNXG is now setting up a NASDAQ-style board to consolidate on the fast-growing internet economy created by local tech firms.\n\nOlumide Bolumole, division head of stock exchange listing activities at NXG revealed that the bourse will make sweeping changes to make listing attractive to tech companies.\n\nHe singled out \u201cbreaking even\u201d, one of the current prerequisites for listing a firm at the bourse, asserting that this requirement was stymieing the growth potential of tech outfits.\n\nNGX demutualised in 2021, taking the company private in a move that it hopes will attract greater flows of foreign and domestic investment into Nigeria\u2019s bourse, with a renewed emphasis on corporate governance and the ability to expand into other markets and sectors.\n\nNGX consists of a holding company and three subsidiaries that cover the operations of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), its regulation, and its real estate. This structure is similar to those of other international market groups such as the London, New York, and Johannesburg stock exchange groups.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nNigeria and a few other African states boast unicorns \u2013 startups that have attained a market valuation of over a billion US dollars and Africa is now home to seven: Jumia Technologies, Interswitch, Flutterwave, Andela, Wave, OPay, and Chipper Cash.\n\nFive of these became unicorns in 2021, including two in September alone, indicating the growing levels of interest in Africa\u2019s startup market not seen before.\n\nBut despite having the fourth-largest stock market in Africa none of Nigeria\u2019s home-grown top startups to date have been listed on the Lagos-based NSE. The proposed reforms should help tech firms tap into larger capital markets, starting at home.\n\nAccording to Wee Tracker (WT), the Nigerian government is in the process of implementing the Nigerian Startup Bill (NSE).\n\nIt will create a new regulatory framework that should allow innovation-driven businesses to thrive.\n\n\u201cThe bill also intends to address prevalent shortcomings such as insufficient digital infrastructure, tax holidays, and capital access,\u201d WT said.\n\nListings for Africa\u2019s tech firms have many benefits, including fundraising and providing a seamless exit route to investors, supervision and control of trading in securities, and fair price for the securities.\n\nTimely disclosure of corporate information and better corporate practice are also some of the advantages of a company going public. Studies have also shown that consumers are often more willing to support listed firms.\n\nFor Nigeria, getting startups to list could help revive the country\u2019s bourse after a three-year listing drought. In recent decades, Nigeria\u2019s stock market capitalisation has fallen well below potential.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, the market cap of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) swelled to $1.05 trillion, equivalent to 235% of the country\u2019s 301 billion US dollars GDP,\u201d according to Wee Tracker.\n\nWhile the NSE outperformed in 2020, growing by as much as 50 percent with 4.5 billion dollars in new listings, its market capitalisation of $56.6 billion \u2013 just 13.1% of the nation\u2019s comparatively enormous $432.3 billion GDP \u2013 shows there is considerable room for growth.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Valentine\u2019s is fast approaching and so is the race to win people\u2019s hearts with gifts. For many, the outcome of February 14 will decide if Christmas this year will be celebrated wearing matching pyjamas, or joining unnamed Zikoko team members blocking and muting words like \u201clove\u201d and \u201cme and mines\u201d later.\n\nFor Christmas, we gave you a guide to help you navigate gifting during the holiday season. Now we\u2019ve created this one to help you navigate Valentine\u2019s.\n\nThere\u2019s tech in everything, even gift-giving. If you\u2019re looking to steer clear of basic gifts like one-time food platters that will be consumed in single sittings, this is the guide for you. For example, James Wardle created a $1 million game\u2014Wordle\u2014for his partner who loved video games. Locket, an app that helps users share their photos to their friends\u2019/lovers\u2019 home screens, was built by Matt Moss as a present for his girlfriend. Even Zoom was the product of a founder who wanted to connect with his girlfriend long distance.\n\nLast year, the African tech ecosystem raised a whopping $4 billion+ so we know things are working. As we invest and build more startups, it\u2019s also important to invest and build relationships. And that\u2019s why you should move away from chocolates and roses to\u2026\n\n1. Professional courses\n\nLevel: Series C\n\nIf you can\u2019t build your partner apps The New York Times will later buy for millions of dollars, at least enrol them in courses where they can learn to build, design, market or manage those apps\u2014for themselves or future lovers. \ud83e\udd2d\n\nThere are a few online schools where you can pay for courses like software engineering, design, product management, marketing, or content creation. Check out AltSchool, Moringa School, Decagon Institute, Coursera, and Pluralsight.\n\nYou should also sign them up for TC Daily, a daily newsletter that can give your lover comprehensive insight into tech.\n\nWe\u2019re always talking about getting more people into tech. Use this Valentine\u2019s and help people kick-start their journey into tech.\n\nPrice range: > $99\n\nWe\u2019ve labelled this a Series C-type gift because it\u2019s a long-term investment beneficial to all involved. It\u2019s expensive but also profitable in the long run. Unless, of course, the giftee gets acquired by another gifter. \ud83d\udc80\n\n2. Music streaming subscriptions\n\nLevel: Seed\n\nImage source: Stuff.tv\n\nThis one is a given.\n\nMusic heals our body, soul, and mind. It\u2019s also one of the greatest ways to connect with people. Over the past 5 years, the growth of streaming services\u2014indigenous and foreign\u2014has doubled.\n\nFor Valentine\u2019s, get your loved ones subscriptions on Apple Music, Spotify, YouTube Music, and Boomplay.\n\nPrice range: $2 \u2013 $4 (for Individual plans)\n\nWe\u2019re labelling this a seed-type gift because, any way you dice it, you\u2019re sowing seeds. You\u2019re either sowing seeds of \u201cThis is how we chose our wedding songs\u201d, or breakfast seeds that will lead to many Adele playlists. Happy planting. \ud83c\udf31\n\n3. Video streaming subscriptions\n\nLevel: Seed\n\nImage source: The Streamable\n\nEver heard of Netflix and Chill? Well, here\u2019s how you can someday build up to that: get them video streaming subscriptions for Valentine\u2019s Day.\n\nWith multiple plans to choose from, Iroko TV and Netflix have been giving us really amazing African content in the past few years.\n\nGet a Nollywood lover an Iroko or Netflix subscription for Valentine\u2019s.\n\nPrice range: From $7 (+ Free basic Netflix plans in Kenya)\n\nThis is also a seed-type gift because it\u2019s affordable and useful if things go sideways. Renewing the subscriptions marks the token of your shared love, and not renewing can be a new way to end the relationship, instead of ghosting.\n\n4. Data subscriptions\n\nLevel: Pre-seed\n\nData is life. And the more of it you have, the more you can access information available online. Data on the continent is still relatively expensive, and in some countries, people can pay as much as $7 for 1GB of data.\n\nAll the digital gifts we\u2019ve listed above are data-dependent so make sure you\u2019re getting your loved ones access to the gifts you give.\n\nWith data, people can stream as many movies and videos as they possibly can. Log on to your MTN, Safaricom, Airtel, or Ethio Telecom services and gift your loved one gigabytes of data.\n\nPrice range: From < $1\n\nThis is the only pre-seed gift here because you can decide how much or how little you want to invest here.\n\n5.

          "title": "This developer transitioned to blockchain development in order to solve Web2 problems",
          "text": "Akinyemi Akindele, 27, studied computer science at the University of Ibadan, where he trained as a Web2 software developer.\n\nHowever, his journey into the blockchain world did not start until he got an internship in 2015 at Interswitch, one of Africa\u2019s earliest unicorns. At Interswitch, he worked in the research and development team where he got the opportunity to test out interesting emerging technologies like AI and blockchain\u2014technologies that the business was not focusing on at that point.\n\nAkindele was neck-deep into the blockchain and soon realised its power. \u201cPeople were talking about the future of finance and I got to work on it early on,\u201d Akindele said. As a Nigerian experiencing the rapid decline in value of the naira, Akindele resonated with bitcoin\u2019s promise to provide a store of value not tied to the traditional financial system or government\u2019s whims.\n\nHe was a man of varied interest, his final year paper at the university was based on artificial intelligence (AI)\u2014with a focus on artificial neural networks. Upon graduating from university, he returned to work at Interswitch and started learning how to develop blockchain solutions. Eventually, he got to build a blockchain supply chain solution with his team, the first of its kind in the country, he said. The blockchain solution made the loaning and contract awarding process involving Dangote Plc bidding suppliers and banks seamless.\n\nAkindele attended hackathons, and ethereum meetups organised by Consensys in Lagos, where he had to build smart contracts on ethereum. He won some\u2014worth 1 to 3 million naira\u2014and that was pivotal to his career growth. He admitted that he won a lot of those hackathons because he already had a lot of experience in building ethereum solutions at his workplace, Interswitch.\n\nIn one of the hackathons, he met an American founder, Daniel Block, who was building an NFT marketplace for properties, as far back as 2018. He was on a mission to tokenise real estate properties in Africa, had digitised land records in Ghana, and had his sights set on Nigeria.\n\nAkindele joined Block\u2019s company, SESO Global, as its first blockchain engineer, where he helped build an NFT marketplace. There, he spent a year building their enterprise ethereum, and wrote smart contract code to power those NFTs\u2014years before the NFT buzz of 2021.\n\nA rich blockchain development experience\n\nIt was in one of those hackathons, where he had been an outstanding competitor, that Akindele met Yele Bademosi, Nestcoin co-founder, who was then director of Binance Labs, the venture arm of global crypto exchange, Binance. Yele was a judge in those hackathons, and he kept in touch with Akindele because of his outstanding performance. So, when Yele needed a team to start a project internally inside Binance, he reached out to Akindele.\n\nAkindele joined Binance\u2014where he was earning about $48,000 per year\u2014as a blockchain engineer, and with a team of backend, mobile, and blockchain engineers, helped build a cryptocurrency exchange right from the scratch. \u201cIt was interesting because we got to learn a lot of new things. For example, I did a lot of encryption, wallet generation, and signing off; and I got to know a lot of different coins listed on the exchange.\u201d\n\nAkindele recalled that the project commenced when Facebook announced Libra, a cryptocurrency, wallet and an exchange, all in one. \u201cIt looked like the hottest thing ever!\u201d Akindele further explained that Binance was worried Facebook might take over developing countries due to the proposed Libra\u2019s reach, so Binance started a competing project, which gave birth to Bundle Africa.\n\nAt the time, Bundle Africa ran as a startup inside Binance and was also a remote-first company. Within 16 months, Bundle Africa got 650,000 users, majorly by word of mouth, community marketing, and a small marketing budget. The way its adoption skyrocketed made Akindele realise the huge potential crypto products had.\n\nAfter two years at Binance, Akindele joined EMTECH, a US blockchain company that builds digital currency for central banks across the world. At EMTECH\u2014where he was earning about $84, 000 per year\u2014he helped build tokens, did DevOps work and helped in shipping projects. EMTECH had created the world\u2019s first CBDC for the Bahamas and was the go-to fintech company for central banks looking to create digital currencies.\n\nBreaking into blockchain development\n\nAnother idea that endeared Akindele to blockchain engineering was that the blockchain was a melting point for a lot of things. \u201cTo be very good at blockchain you have to know things beyond your engineering skills, like finance, and compliance and regulations. You have to think about these things every time you write a code or develop anything.\u201d\n\nAkindele believes that anyone who wants to transition into becoming a Web3 developer must believe that it is the future. \u201cYou have to convince yourself because no one is coming to convince you that ownership rights on non-fungible tokens (NFTs) will be big in the future.\u201d\n\nHe further advised aspiring blockchain developers to learn how to build on a popular blockchain like ethereum, develop ethereum Decentralised applications (Dapps) and write Solidity code. \u201cIt is at this point you will realise that you have new powers because you would be able to write smart contracts, deploy them on a public blockchain and see people interacting with your blockchain.\u201d\n\nSolving problems with Web3\n\nAkindele left EMTECH to found a startup, BetDemand, a decentralised finance (DeFi) sport betting platform where every player who lose their bets still get their initial staking.\n\nThe idea for BetDemand came to him while he studied game theory to understand why and how people play games and the economic models designed as part of those games. He discovered that economic incentives in the traditional sports betting model are harmful: a large number of people were losing money but couldn\u2019t stop playing because they were already addicted to betting.\n\nBetDemand eliminates the major problem people have with betting: losing their money. \u201cImagine telling a punter that even if he loses, he will get his money back after a week. That is an irresistible offer,\u201d Akindele said. Players can only bet on football for now, with naira\u2014for as low as \u20a650\u2014and crypto.\n\nBetDemand gathers all the money staked by players in a single pool, introducing a lock-up period of 1 week, where players do not receive their money back until after a week. During this lock-up period, BetDemand converts this pool of funds to USDT, a stablecoin, which would then be deposited in Venus protocol, a DeFi lending and borrowing platform. The pool of funds then earns 12% to 15% annual percentage yield (APY).\n\n\u201cEverybody gets their money back at the end of the day, whether you win or lose, and the interest we get during the lock-up period is shared with the winners.\u201d\n\nAkindele explained that they could have opted for other coins that would raise their yield to as high as 30% but, right now, they are sticking with USDT because stablecoins are non-volatile. They make less profit but it\u2019s just enough to sustain the business.\n\nIn the last week of October, when BetDemand launched, the size of its pool of funds was $450; now it has increased to $26,000 per week.\n\nBetDemand calculates winnings by multiplying the amount that players bet by total odds\u2014a method not particularly different from how traditional betting companies calculate winnings. The day of the week in which one places a bet also affects winnings; it\u2019s called the \u201cday factor\u201d. The difference with BetDemand, however, is that payouts are based on the interest the pool of funds yields over the week, so players can\u2019t earn as high as they would with traditional betting. \u201cBut what we pay is enough to keep people coming back.\u201d\n\nLike the buzzy play-to-earn gaming Web3 companies, BetDemand is charting its course as a DeFi gaming company. And, although, yet to be announced, it has raised an angel round and is in the process of closing a pre-seed round.\n\nAkindele, speaking about what Web3 will do for Africa, said, \u201cWeb3 will be very big for Africa, because when the internet was being built in Silicon Valley, a lot of Africans did not participate in that. But we have a chance to do so now. Every time new technologies are built, a lot of wealth is created around that period, and people involved in building these technologies, or those that exist at the time, benefit from it.\u201d\n\nHe advised developers hoping to start their blockchain engineering journey to join communities on Discord, connect with people, and ask questions, especially from founders, to see why they make the decisions they make. He also advised them to contribute to open source blockchain projects and look for ways to solve the problems that exist today in Web2 with Web3.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there.\n\nThe rate at which Africans use the Internet for cybercrime is alarming and rapidly increasing. Cybercrime affects all countries, but Africa is particularly vulnerable due to inadequate network and security.\n\nAn estimate shows that cybercrime costs the global economy $500 billion, as of 2016. A 2021 study by Techshielder, a technology and online security platform, describes Nigeria as the second most notorious country in the world for romance scams, after the Philippines.\n\nIf I continue with the types of fraud and the countries that top each list, it won\u2019t be surprising to see an African country on every list, which is very worrisome. For instance, South Africa, after Kenya, is the African country most affected by fraud, draining millions of dollars from the mobile accounts of cellular users worldwide on a daily basis, according to research.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Evina, a French cybersecurity firm with a presence in more than 70 countries worldwide \u2013 including 15 in Africa \u2013 a recent report titled State of Mobile Fraud in Africa, shows that professional cybercriminals targeting Africa\u2019s one billion mobile phone users continue to be a significant problem.\n\nTo fight this, the company which claims to specialise in fighting fraud in Africa has recently raised a \u20ac20 million (~$23m) Series A to help them improve their game in fighting fraud.\n\nI find that interesting because the company declared that at least half of the \u20ac20 million capital injection will be used to combat fraud in Africa. Yes, you read that correctly; over $12 million will be invested in combating mobile fraud in Africa.\n\nWhile I\u2019m interested in how the company intends to accomplish this, there\u2019s also an indigenous company in Nigeria, Stellas digital bank planning to combat fraud. But before I discuss that, let\u2019s see what happens to your data when you die.\n\nSide bar: Is it possible that the rise of startups focused on combating fraud will help achieve its purpose in Africa? What do you think? Please, click the reply button to respond.\n\nSo, today, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nWhat happens to your digital assets after death\n\nStellas digital\u2019s plans to fix fraud\n\nWhat happens to your digital assets after death\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens to your data when you die?\n\nWho will have access to your accounts if you die right now? Do your siblings or parents have access to all of your digital assets?\n\nNot to scare you, but those thoughts were playing through my head about a fortnight ago. What if, despite my optimism, I kick the bucket without any warning? What will happen to my social media accounts, email accounts, and the small sums of money I\u2019ve saved in Cowrywise and Piggyvest if I don\u2019t wake up again after tonight? I mean, I\u2019d like my family to have it, but how likely is that after I die?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith so many daily functions, tasks, and memories now taking place online, the question of what will become of your digital legacy \u2013 who will preserve, control, or delete your accounts after you die \u2013 has become increasingly important.\n\nMaking a plan now can help you avoid identity theft, save documents and records you want to keep, and keep your friends and family from receiving painful pop-up reminders on social media.\n\nHowever, there are numerous potential stumbling blocks to organising your digital will, ranging from privacy concerns and cybersecurity to copyright.\n\nBut, where does your data go when you die in Africa, where you technically have no rights to your data after death?\n\n\n\nIn the Privacy Roundtable series, Ogheneruemu walked us through what happens to our data when we die. Please read, where does your data go when you die?\n\nStellas digital\u2019s plans to fix fraud\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the launch of the NIBSS Instant Payment (NIP) scheme in 2011, interbank transactions in Nigeria have become much faster, with several experts hailing it as one of the best globally.\n\nFraudsters have also taken advantage of this, executing faster due to the increased speed. Consequently, Nigeria has lost $13 billion to cybercrime in the last decade and $12 million in the first nine months of 2020.\n\nBecause fraud remains a problem for both digital and traditional banks, Stellas digital bank \u2014 a microfinance bank founded in 2017 to provide easy access to financial services \u2014 has launched a digital bank to \u201coffer banking services with ease.\u201d\n\nWhat does this mean? The company plans to protect user identities when conducting transactions to prevent identity theft and ensure privacy and security.\n\nBut how is the Bukola Solomon-led company doing that? To know how, please, read: Stellas digital bank launches, plans to fix major loophole for fintech fraud in Nigeria.\n\nPoS for the web\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSending money from one bank to another 25 years ago was a very different process than it is today. Transfers frequently took several days to reach their intended recipients. To withdraw money, you had to go to the branch where you opened your account.\n\n\n\nHowever, banking innovation has caused the industry to evolve to the point where transfers can now be completed in a matter of minutes. And the industry has grown at an unprecedented rate due to these changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith more people shopping online, digital payments have become the order of the day, with startups introducing new features to aid this \u2014 like a Point-of-Sale (PoS) solution for the web, for instance. Thepeer, a startup that creates infrastructure that allows businesses to share data, has launched Checkout to create a simple online checkout experience.\n\nCheckout, according to the startup, is simple to integrate and use on a business\u2019s website. Users can shop online and pay from their favourite businesses using Thepeer Checkout.\n\nTo know what the startup does, please read: Backed by Flutterwave, Thepeer wants to help businesses share data seamlessly using its API\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nMental health advice to my younger self. Read.\n\nScience vs God: Watch.\n\nThe prison of your mind | Watch.\n\nOpportunities\n\nThepeer is hiring an android engineer on contract for 3 months. Apply via this tweet.\n\nTradeRepublic is looking to hire 250 into several roles. See where you fit in here.\n\nHave an amazing weekend ahead.\n\nVictoria Fakiya for Techpoint Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictoria Fakiya Writer. Tech enthusiast.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince 2011, interbank transactions have gotten much faster in Nigeria with the launch of the NIBSS Instant Payment (NIP) scheme, an infrastructure that several experts laud as being one of the world\u2019s best.\n\nUnfortunately, this speed of execution meant that fraudsters have been able to execute with greater speed. In 10 years, Nigeria has lost $13 billion to cybercrime, and in just nine months of 2020, it lost $12 million to electronic fraud.\n\nNigeria\u2019s banking space is, perhaps, one of its most critical sectors, as these companies are tasked with providing essential services to millions of people. Interestingly, we\u2019re observing a trend of banks moving from physical branches to having an online-only presence.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s not clear how much Nigerian consumer behaviour has adapted to this trend, investors are seemingly betting that these companies will usher in the future of banking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith different incentives and hooks like free transfers, micro-lending, speedy and efficient customer lending, these banks aim to capture segments of the market that have experienced relative neglect by traditional banks.\n\nHowever, fraud remains the bane of both digital banks, and traditional banks alike. For the newly launched Stellas digital bank, it plans to guard against one major loophole.\n\nLed by Bukola Solomon, an executive with extensive experience in the investment banking space, Stellas microfinance bank started in 2017, to provide easy access to financial services, and it soon became one of Nigeria\u2019s leading financial services providers.\n\nToday, the company is launching a digital bank to \u201coffer banking services with ease\u201d. With this launch, it plans to promote privacy and security in the financial services space with its \u201cGhost Mode\u201d feature, as well as other savings and budgeting features, but more on these later.\n\nSolomon explains that the company has always prioritised user experience as one of its biggest value offerings, and it brought that philosophy with its digital banking launch.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen several instances of people who need to make transactions but want it to remain confidential and private. With our Ghost Mode feature, you can execute confidential transactions, and more so, it serves as a security feature. We can encrypt transactions so that even if they get access to your phone or that of the recipient, your data is secure,\u201d he says.\n\nBasically, Stellas plans to protect user identities when making transactions, to guard against identity theft and ensure privacy and security.\n\nIn 2020, $219 million was lost to identity theft, and these usually come in different forms from social media activities, emails, or credit cards. Solomon points out that transferring money to a random stranger you bought items from could be another potential loophole for identity theft.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSolomon also reveals that all transactions are fully insured by the National Deposit Insurance Commission (NDIC) and will strictly comply with anti-money laundering and anti-fraud regulations.\n\nInteresting bells and whistles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThough Solomon talks up the Ghost Mode feature, he also reveals that the company has integrated a budgeting feature that would help users create better economic plans for themselves.\n\nSo far, Solomon claims it already has a massive userbase with exciting projections for the future.\n\n\u201cWe have 10,000 users already, and we expect it to reach 200,000 in the first month.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s highly likely that Stellas would be offering its digital banking services to its existing customers, but it would be interesting to see how it would ht 200k users in one month.\n\nIn a space graced by the likes of Kuda, Sparkle, Fairmoney, and Carbon, Nigeria\u2019s digital banking space look set to be exciting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Writer and Narrator.

          "title": "IMF says Nigeria risking financial squeeze as debt piles",
          "text": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that Nigeria\u2019s decade-long rise in public debt could create both financial as well as revenue squeeze for the economy in the medium term.\n\nThe Fund\u2019s mission chief for Nigeria, Jesmin Rahman in the IMF/Nigeria 2021 article IV consultation staff press conference stated that though the country\u2019s current debt dynamics at the moment seem favourable as it still resides within the 30 percent threshold, its trajectory, however, would become a major economic concern in the medium term.\n\n\u201cPublic debt threshold for emerging markets stand at 10 percent; however, Nigeria currently spends above 80 percent to service its debt.\n\n\u201cRecent estimates indicate that public debt is to increase from 36 percent to 40 percent in the medium term. Should this happen, it is going to become a major cause for concern for the Nigerian government,\u201d she said.\n\nDebt servicing for Nigeria since the oil decline in 2020 has been dependent on CBN overdraft and Eurobond subscriptions.\n\nThomas Alun, a senior economist at the IMF stated that while Nigeria\u2019s Eurobonds are oversubscribed, dependence on Eurobonds however, is quite risky as economic volatility could translate to both financial as well as revenue squeeze for the Nigerian economy which in turn further escalates the country\u2019s rising debt.\n\nHe further stated that Nigeria\u2019s debt sustainability or further crisis is dependent on a number of economic factors.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s debt trend is not looking favorable on the debt portfolio end but the estimates are dependent on various economic factors.\n\n\u201cWhether debt becomes stressful or not is dependent on a number of factors like growth, interest rate, oil prices, financing situation in the country amongst others,\u201d Alun said.\n\nNigeria\u2019s debt service is currently suffocating federal spending and by extension is suffocating the general economy and the living conditions of Nigerian households. Accompanying this grim reality is the government\u2019s heavy reliance on oil revenues which has been extremely anemic in the last couple of years.\n\nDwindling oil revenues which emanated in 2020 as a result of the slump in oil prices in the international market due to the covid-19 pandemic, necessitated the Nigerian government to rely heavily on borrowing (both external and domestic), to finance its projects and try to close up budget deficits.\n\nThis notwithstanding has not convinced the Nigerian populace as well as foreign investors\u2019 as to why the country\u2019s borrowing has been significantly rising since 2016 with no evidence (infrastructure or otherwise) to justify it.\n\nDating back to 2015, data culled from the Debt Management Office (DMO) revealed that the nation\u2019s external debt stood at $10.31bn and total public debt stood at $63.806bn or N12.1trn within the review period.\n\nSix years down the line (2021), the figure had almost tripled to $37.95bn for foreign debt and $92.626bn or N38.0trn for total public debt as of September 2021, representing a 268 percent increase in external debts and a 214.0 per cent increase in total debts.\n\nIn a failed attempt to sustain these debts, the Federal Government spends trillions of naira yearly servicing more debts.\n\nSince 2017, this administration has spent a total of N15.375trn on debt servicing, excluding N296bn and N110bn allocated for sinking funds in 2019 and 2020.\n\nAyodeji Ebo, head of Retail Investment at Chapel Hill Denham told Business Day that when a budget crisis emanates, the capital expenditure which directly impacts the general economy is always at the receiving end.\n\n\u201cWe cannot be talking about having any meaningful growth in the economy if we don\u2019t spend more on capital expenditures, which happens to be the productive sector.\n\n\u201cFrom potholed and often barely paved streets of Lagos to moribund refineries around the country to accident-prone highways on Federal roads to inadequate health and education infrastructure, both Nigerians and foreign investors visiting Nigeria are reminded repeatedly of the country\u2019s urgent need for capital. Many investors, however, continue to be willing lenders, despite obvious signs that their money may not always have been put into the most productive use.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the major reasons why when the base effect is taken out of the equation, we still see that the country\u2019s growth rate is still lagging behind the population growth rate.\n\n\u201cAnother major concerning factor is that recurrent expenditure continues to increase which means that the government would subsequently increase borrowing and as a result, servicing cost would continue to increase which would, in turn, translate to an inefficient budget,\u201d Ebo said.\n\nThis has, as a result, erupted questions by analysts as to whether the public finances of the biggest economy in Africa (Nigeria) are as sustainable as they appear and why the country\u2019s debt has lingered this long and continues to significantly increase.\n\nBetween 2017 till date, the Federal Government has budgeted a total of N19.16trn for capital expenditure (money spent to buy, maintain or improve fixed assets).\n\nData from the Budget Office revealed that in the 2017 fiscal year, the Federal Government spent N2.177trn out of N7.441trn aggregate revenue as capital expenditure. The amount represented 29.25 percent of the total revenue in that year.\n\nFor 2018, N2.873trn was expended on capital projects, which was 31.50 percent of N9.120trn total expenditure.\n\nIn 2019 and 2020, N2.090trn and N2.140trn, respectively, were spent as capital expenditure. The figures represented 23.43 percent and 20.71 percent of aggregate expenditure for the years which was N8.920trn and N10.330trn, respectively.\n\nThe amount budgeted for capital expenditure saw an increase in 2021 and 2022 as N4.989trn and N4.891trn were budgeted for capital projects. This shows 34.24 percent and 29.83 percent of aggregate expenditure for the years at N14.570trn and N16.391trn, respectively.\n\nHowever, while presenting the 2021 budget performance, the Minister of Finance, Zainab Ahmed had said that N1.79trn had been spent on capital projects between January and August 2021.\n\nEmeka Ucheaga, the CEO of EUA Intelligence and a financial analyst at Credit Direct limited stated that sub-national debt was also another factor that has played a significant role in elongating the country\u2019s current rising debt debacle.\n\n\u201cMost states generate minimal revenue outside their monthly allocation of Nigeria\u2019s anemic oil income. They depend almost exclusively on monthly allocations of federal revenues, which have been drastically declining in recent times,\u201d he said.\n\nMany states have been borrowing to meet their salary obligations, often at exorbitant interest rates (as high as 25-28 percent). States\u2019 borrowing trends are risky and need to be addressed.\n\nIn 2015, Global Credit Ratings, the African equivalent of Moody\u2019s or Fitch announced that it was going to place the sub-national debt sector on a negative outlook and downgrade five state government credit ratings. Of the eight states it rated, six were below the threshold for issuing investment-grade bonds.\n\nSome of Nigeria\u2019s richest states are actually its most indebted. They owe the most both in terms of overall dollar amounts and as a percentage of internally generated, non-federally derived revenues, or IGR.\n\nFor example, Data from Debt Management Office (DMO) revealed that Delta State which is popularly known for its oil-rich heritage was Nigeria\u2019s third most indebted state as at the end of 2014.\n\nIt owed $233 million to its creditors, roughly five times its annual IGR then. This amount was well beyond the World Bank\u2019s debt burden threshold that stipulated that debt should not exceed 200 percent of IGR.\n\nRead also: Nigeria remains open to investors \u2013 DMO\n\nThat being said, half of all the states in Nigeria have debt-to-revenue ratios that are twice as high as the World Bank sustainability ratio or higher.\n\nJust as there is no easy hack to paying back debts, there are no nice ways to say that the continuously increasing amount spent on debt servicing has debilitating impacts on the economy.\n\nWith 40 percent of Nigerians still living below the poverty line, Nigeria\u2019s revenue projection is beginning to look unattainable and unable to meet the deteriorating situation in the country.\n\nEsther Oye, an economic analyst and a lecturer at Covenant University stated that recent trends indicate that Nigeria is going to be borrowing to the quantum of our budget projections.\n\n\u201cThe direct implication is that any additional money that the government spends would be from additional borrowing; so what it means is that the borrowing will continue to increase.\n\n\u201cIf all our revenue is going to the servicing of debt, it means we have major fiscal problems which could have dire consequences in the near future,\u201d Oye said.\n\nThe Nigerian economy has been and is still operating in \u2018reverse\u2019, Productivity rates are low while debt servicing is increasing (ridiculous). In order to restore balance, two critical realities are non-negotiable; productivity has to increase which in turn would translate to increased revenue. The government needs to begin to invest heavily in production else this ever inflating debt crisis would swallow the economy sooner than later.",
          "summary": "\u201cPublic debt threshold for emerging markets stand at 10 percent; however, Nigeria currently spends above 80 percent to service its debt.\nDebt servicing for Nigeria since the oil decline in 2020 has been dependent on CBN overdraft and Eurobond subscriptions.\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s debt trend is not looking favorable on the debt portfolio end but the estimates are dependent on various economic factors.\nSince 2017, this administration has spent a total of N15.375trn on debt servicing, excluding N296bn and N110bn allocated for sinking funds in 2019 and 2020.\nThe Nigerian economy has been and is still operating in \u2018reverse\u2019, Productivity rates are low while debt servicing is increasing (ridiculous).",

          "text": "The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Area Council election which held Saturday was characterised by low voter turnout, dysfunctional and failed Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) devices as well as late arrival of officials for the commencement of the exercise, despite assurances by the Independent Electoral Commission (INEC) that the polls would be better than past ones.\n\nThere are a total of 1.373 million registered voters in the FCT spread across the six Area Councils, 62 Wards, and 2,822 Polling Units in the Territory.\n\nBut BusinessDay observed that less than 50percent of the voters especially in the city center, comprising, Asokoro, Garki, Wuse, Maitama, Wuse 2, Jabi, Gwarinpa turned out to exercise their franchise.\n\nHours after the election finally commenced behind schedule \u2013 due to the late arrival of voting materials and INEC officials- very few or virtually no voters were seen at most of the Polling Units (PUs) especially the newly created ones.\n\nWhen BusinessDay visited the PUs at the PTF Estate in Wuse 2 and Onitsha Crescent in Asokoro, there were no voters, though the poll officials including, security operatives were on the ground.\n\nAlso at PU 005 -Garki Village, New Primary School School II just about 25 voters out of the 2, 983 registered voters were on the queue. Only 38 votes were cast at PU004 -Old Karu palace with a total of 2,850 voters while only one registered voter who identified himself as Maro Damian turned out at the PU 051-FCDA quarters after 12 noon.\n\nAt PU02- Garki by Wine Shop, none of the seven registered voters turned up as at the time BusinessDay visited, just as observed at the newly created PUs 011 and 025 located at Nyanya market and Morning Star Hotel, Nyanya in the Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC).\n\n\u201cWe have this long-standing issue of non-indigenes not wanting to come out and vote during area council elections,\u201d said a voter who simply identified himself as Ahmed.\n\nThe creation of new PUs also disenfranchised many voters, some of whom were unaware of their new polling units and were turned back by officials.\n\nHabakkuk Ibrahim, a PDP Agent at the polling unit 027, Kuje, said many voters who were unable to \u201clocate their polling units due to poor sensitisation by the electoral body, went home frustrated.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, in polling units, 37/02/02/003, Kuduru Ward, Bwari Area Council outside the city center, voting commenced at about 10 am, but barely 30 persons had voted as at 12:40 pm. That PU has a total of 2642 registered voters.\n\nThough, the situation, BusinessDay gathered was better in some outskirts of Karshi in AMAC; Kuje, Gwagwalada, Bwari and Kwali Area Councils.\n\nApart from the low turnout of voters, the election was equally characterised by dysfunctional BVAS that have been deployed for both fingerprint and facial authentications during accreditation.\n\nIn most of the Polling Units monitored, the devices were either not capturing voters\u2019 fingers and faces or were slow, thereby delaying accreditation and voting. The Kuduru PU for instance had only one BVAS machine for hundreds of voters who gathered. BusinessDay keenly observed that it could take up to 5 minutes to capture and verify one person.\n\nAt PU 001, PU 002, and PU 025 in Nyanya Market, the BVAS were not effective, and the same for PU 05-Gwarinpa where the device could only capture 20 voters to cast their ballot. The Unit has about 1837 registered voters. Also, as at the time BusinessDay visited PU 001-Garki Dispensary, only 17 persons had voted out of 1965 registered, while at PU 017-Ugwan-Bawa in Nyanya a good number of voters turned but could not exercise their franchise for the same reason.\n\nIn Kuchiko/old GSS 004 polling unit, the BVAS machine broke down for at least one hour leaving voters stranded, there was also a very poor internet connection. The entire process was very disorderly despite the presence of security operatives. The situation was the same for Zango and Guto polling units, where voters expressed deep concerns that they may not have the opportunity to exercise their franchise.\n\nOne of the voters, Maimuna Hassan, who lamented that she had to abandon her business to participate in the voting, said the poor functioning of the BVAS was quite frustrating and contributed to many abandoning voting.\n\n\u201cWe are tired; many of our women who came here since morning have gone home. I am just staying back because I want my Chairman to win,\u201d she said.\n\nSome of the Presiding Officers, mostly members of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) who spoke on condition of anonymity, complained that the inefficiency created by the BVAS was very frustrating.\n\n\u201cThe whole thing is frustrating. The BVAS are very slow in that it takes more than 10 minutes to accredit one voter. Sometimes, the device will not even capture the fingerprints and faces of the voters. This has made some of them go back. We are thinking of calling the Registration Centre Officials for a solution,\u201d one of the Presiding Officers told BusinessDay.\n\nThe inefficiencies are despite the assurances by INEC that it had reviewed the performance of the BVAS in the recent Anambra State governorship election with a view to improving them for optimal performance in the FCT Polls.\n\nINEC Chairman, Mahmood Yakubu at the last extended stakeholders meeting ahead of the FCT election on Tuesday said lessons learned from the Anambra election had been considered in planning for the Area Council election.\n\n\u201cThe BVAS have been configured and ready to deploy for the election. We have also made adequate arrangements for technical support and transportation to speedily respond in the unlikely event of glitches,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, there was the late arrival of officials and materials for the election which caused the exercise not to commence, well over one hour after the PUs were supposed to open for accreditation and voting.\n\nIn fact, two hours after the 8:30 am scheduled time for the commencement of the 2022 chairmanship and councillorship elections, voting was yet to commence in the 6 area councils, reason being the non-arrival of INEC officials at the various polling units.\n\nAccreditation and voting were scheduled to start at 8:30 am and close at 2:30 pm but that was not so, as most of the polling units visited by our Correspondent had not opened at the time while the voting continued after the period earmarked.\n\nA visit to most of the centers in Nyanya, Karu, Jikwoyi, Kpeghi, Asokoro, Garki, and Kuduru communities in the Abuja Municipal Area Council, showed no presence of men and materials. In some centers canopies were yet to be erected.\n\nThe story was said to be the same in all the other five Council areas according to our correspondents.\n\nHowever, security agents made up of Police, Civil Defence and Road Safety were seen at the various polling units visited. There was a massive \u201cshow of force\u201d by men of the military and other security agencies around the metropolis ostensibly to ward off criminal elements.\n\nFor instance, at PU 145- Mr. Biggs, Lugbe, the poll officials arrived at 12:45 pm and could not meet a few of the 1,844 registered voters in the unit who had left before their arrival just as the officials also arrived late at 006 -Area C1, 043 -Police Post and 044 -Angwandadi in Nyanya.\n\nA visibly angry party agent, Musbau Ismail told BusinessDay at the Karu Civic center polling unit that he and his colleagues have been waiting for INEC officials since 7 am.\n\n\u201cMy brother as you can see, nothing is happening here. We have been here waiting for them and the materials since 7 am till now 9.05 am,\u201d said.\n\nBusinessDay had earlier reported that the delay was not unconnected with the protests of ad-hoc staff engaged for the exercise over alleged non-payment of their training allowances and replacement by relatives of staff of INEC, Collation, and Returning Officers.\n\nRead also: Abuja area council polls in photos\n\nIt was, however, observed that the polls were generally peaceful as there were no incidents of violence or disruption of the process as at the time of this report except a middle-aged woman allegedly killed by a supporter of one of the political parties who knocked her down with a motorcycle.\n\nThe incident happened close to the PU048 -Salasi, opposite Post Office, Karu in AMAC when the woman, a prospective voter was attempting to cross the road to her polling unit.\n\nThe party supporter whose details are still sketchy was recklessly riding on a motorcycle adorned with the flag of his political party.\n\nThe killer motorcycle rider was immediately apprehended and handed over to security operatives deployed for the election, hence averting the breakdown of law and order.\n\nBusinessDay further noticed an incidence of vote-buying at Jamb headquarters car park unit 10 when a former Senate President of Nigeria, shared some cash to youths which caused chaos and great disorderliness. In polling unit 37/02/02/003, some party agents were giving voters N1,000 and N500 which almost caused commotion.\n\nFurthermore, Covid-19 protocols such as physical distancing and use of face masks were not observed by voters who queued up at most of the PUs visited but the poll officials had hand sanitizers and other protective items provided by INEC.\n\nMore so, restriction of movement was not strictly enforced as usually done at elections due to the conflicting reports from the FCT Command of the Nigeria Police Force; one allowing movement and the other restricting movement.\n\nThe Command had on Thursday announced restriction of movement within the Territory for Saturday, from 12 am to 4 pm, but in a dramatic twist, it canceled the order.\n\nHowever, in a statement issued Friday by Josephine Adeh, the Command Spokesperson, residents were asked to go about their normal duties, which many of the residents claimed they were not aware of.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has urged stakeholders in the healthcare sector to be accountable and transparent in delivering quality healthcare services to members of the public.\n\nThe governor made the call during a 3-day Edo Health Sector Strategy Retreat, with the theme, \u201cTransforming the Health Ecosystem in Edo State to Achieve Resilience and Quality Healthcare.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, everybody in this retreat has committed themselves to the citizens. We must make sure that the design of the system is transparent and open and everybody must be accountable.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t have a situation where someone dies in a clinic or hospital and nobody comes to ask how? Why did this person die? Was it due to negligence? Was he or she given proper and adequate care.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomebody has to be held accountable. Fine, if it is of natural causes, let us know. Let the third-party check and see if it\u2019s true, so that people are held accountable for what they do. Every human life is precious, very precious and even the lives of Edo people are even more precious,\u201d he added.\n\nObaseki said, \u201cAt the end of this retreat, I want to be able to clearly tell as a regulator of the healthcare system, what exactly and how we are going to undertake these regulatory functions in the the next one year in particular. Regulations is not about you paying money, it\u2019s not about revenue.\n\n\u201cRegulations are about quality of service because the activities you undertake affect somebody\u2019s live. Once you provide the right services, money will come. So don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s about revenue. Your primary responsibility is to provide quality care.\n\n\u201cThis whole idea of double dipping can\u2019t work again. If you want to work as an operator in my own healthcare system, then you cannot be working on your own at the same time and double dipping. If that is going to happen, we must have an agreement where there is transparency. You can\u2019t be referring patients that come to my care to your centres.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, moving drugs and service equipment that I have provided for your own private use is not fair. It is not right. If you are going to admit them in my facilities, let us have an agreement. We need to talk through how we make sure that we contribute enough to sustaining our healthcare system.\u201d\n\nThe governor further noted, \u201cAs far as I am concerned, my goal is to improve the healthcare system. Government has a responsibility to provide healthcare. At a certain level, the government is also a regulator and we must understand those two roles clearly. As the regulator, everybody that is providing health care services in Edo has to be regulated by the state government, whether you are federal government, private or international agency, the law says we must regulate you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to be part of this retreat so that together we can all agree on the way forward. I know that it would work. I have worked with some of you. I don\u2019t want any of you to travel again. I know some of you are in high demand globally. We want to make you stay back at home so that we can provide care for our people,\u201d he noted.\n\nIn her remarks, Edo State Commissioner for Health, Prof. Obehi Akoria, reiterated the governor\u2019s determination to provide quality healthcare at all levels through the Edo State Health Insurance Scheme to enable a shift from out-of-pocket spending.\n\nProf. Akoria noted that plans are on to make Edo a regional reference point for quality healthcare delivery and desired destination for health innovations.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

There is a whole generation who are not privileged as some of those you are teaching now to receive the kind of quality education you are impacting on the children under your care. What do we do about adult education?\n\n\u201cIs it possible to bring them back to evening or weekend classes so that we can train them? Considering the role of adult education, should we just leave them like that?\u201d He queried.\n\nOn strengthening security in schools, Obaseki stated, \u201cIt is only a good parent and teacher that will be concerned about the security of students in schools.\n\n\u201cThose are the issues that are bothering us now. So, we are going to try to do as much as we can under our school improvement programmes to fence as many of our schools and those ones that we can\u2019t fence, we will not only use the constabularies, we will now include the vigilantes to help secure the schools.\u201d\n\nThe governor, who noted that his administration has recorded significant progress in the education sector in the past five years said, \u201cYou cannot imagine how happy I am because when I cast my mind back to four, five years ago, this is not the kind of reception I normally have with members of trade unions. For me, we have made a lot of progress.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cToday, we understand each other; we are on the same page, we are now partners. We are all striving to achieve the same goals. I am so glad that our conversation today is not about salary payments, pension for your retired colleagues, or leave allowance.\n\n\u201cWe have streamlined all of these; we are now talking about the children under your care. What more can a leader ask for? I now see you as my real partners and therefore, I will treat you as such.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Commissioner for Education is organizing a series of workshops to bring all of us together to discuss the future of our education. Our priority as a state is education, because that\u2019s the foundation that everything else rests on,\u201d Obaseki noted.\n\n\u201cWe are working things out to make sure that we start a lot of renovations and improvements of our schools,\u201d he assured.\n\nEarlier, the state Chairman of NUT, Mr. Bernard Ajobiewe, commended the governor for prompt payment of salaries to all the workers in the state\u2019s civil and public service, urging increased partnership between the government and teachers to guarantee the provision of quality education to students in the state.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

What they are going to establish is that going forward, the patients that they are going to see will be followed up remotely. So from their various centres in the United States each of them is volunteering to work with us once a week to review these patients and see how we can extend the care to others in the State\u201d.\n\nCommenting on the ongoing plans for the Primary Healthcare Centres in the State, the Health Commissioner said \u201cI was here at the Oredo Primary Healthcare Centre at about 8:15 this morning and there were already patients waiting. The Doctor we have here for example is more than 20 years, post graduation and we have posted senior doctors across many PHCs in the State.

He said if that was the only thing he has done for his subjects, he should be expecting a reciprocative gesture through massive votes.\n\nThe traditional ruler explained that the revitalisation of the general hospital and other primary healthcare centres across the council had contributed significantly to the healthy living of the people of the areas as it had become the signpost of quality healthcare service delivery.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of traditional rulers and the good people in Ife-South Local Government Area, I thank Mr. Governor for his tremendous achievements and for providing quality leadership in the last three years. We are particular about our Local Government where a lot of infrastructural developments had been done to make lives comfortable for the people.\n\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t know much of what you have done, I am fully aware of your intervention in the health sector. I remember vividly that before you were elected in 2018, prior to my installation, the general hospital was in abysmal status and abandoned because of the dilapidated structures to the extent that goat could not deliver or give birth therein. But I thank you for refurbishing and equipping it with quality and state-of-the-art facilities.\n\n\u201cYou might not know the importance of what you did to us because that hospital alone has become the central place for quality healthcare service delivery in the entire council and beyond. To complement this, your Adminstration also revitalised all our primary healthcare facilities across the nooks and crannies of the council.\n\n\u201cWe are indeed grateful for this gesture. Not only that, your swift intervention in education that birthed normalcy to reforms in the sector is also acknowledged. We have seen your hands in the education sector too. We cannot close our eyes to all these because you have been very generous to us.\n\n\u201cYou equally surprised us when you wanted to appoint Caretaker Chairman; the person you appointed is indeed our choice. We have seen all these as a rare privilege and we promise not to take it for granted. You have given us quality, responsible and responsive representatives in this council.\n\n\u201cThough you have done excellently well, as we all know, there are still a lot we want from government. We want you to please consider our intra-town and inter-town roads for reconstruction. We want you to complete the ongoing electrification project at record time because this will help in no measure to improve the socioeconomic activities of our people. We pray that by the grace of God, your second term agenda will be hitch-free.\n\n\u201cWe believe strongly that as long as you are there, our demands will be met. We have seen what you have done so far and we are not going to be ungrateful. We will support you and ensure that you are re-elected. You are a listening Governor whose passion and love for people\u2019s welfare and well-being is second to none. You are too humble and humane, and this has endeared many to you. There is no fear for you. God is with you. The spirit of our forebears is with you and we are solidly behind you\u201d, the monarch assured.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the traditional rulers in Ife-North State Constituency, the Salu of Edunabon, Oba Kehinde Oladepo, assured the Governor of his people\u2019s support, saying they have already made up their minds to return him with their votes come July 16 governorship election.\n\nOba Oladepo who represented the Chairman of the Traditional Council in the Local Government and Apetumodu of Ipetumodu, Oba Olusegun Joseph Oloyede, commended the Governor for being faithful to his electoral promises. He said they have urged their subjects both at home and in the Diaspora to vote massively for him since he has a winning team and there is no point changing a winning team.\n\n\u201cSince your assumption of office, you have no doubt taken the State to a higher level in various fields of endeavour, despite the meagre resources accruable to the State, be it infrastructural development, road rehabilitation, educational funding and human capital development, among others.\n\n\u201cWe in Ife-North are not left out in all the good works that you are doing across the State. For example, you have rehabilitated the road leading to our local government from Osogbo and appointment of some of our sons and daughters into state government positions. All these good works are highly commendable.\n\n\u201cHonestly, you have done creditably well to earn another term. We have urged all our subjects both at home and in the Diaspora to vote massively for you because you have a winning team and there is no point changing a winning team.\n\n\u201cWhat you have done in the last three years is a sign that you can do better during your second coming, and this is going to manifest in the July governorship election.\n\n\u201cWe are assuring you of delivering Ife-North State Constituency to the ruling party, while we will do everything that is humanly possible to ensure your victory because our people will vote overwhelmingly to return you to office to continue the good work that you are doing\u201d, the monarch affirmed.\n\nAddressing the traditional rulers and members of his party, Governor Oyetola said his Administration was committed to taking the State to enviable heights ever known in history.\n\nOyetola who said though the purpose of the tour was to familiarise with the new executives of the ruling party and seek their consent to re-contest, urged the people of the areas to continue to support his Administration.\n\nThe APC State Chairman, Prince Gboyega Famodun, implored members of the party to remain steadfast and united in the collective goal to take the party to victory in the forthcoming governorship election.\n\nFamodun who disclosed that the February 19 APC primary election may be held with direct mode, called on the loyalists of the party to start putting their membership cards nearby and vote Oyetola to become the party\u2019s flag-bearer.\n\nOther party leaders who spoke at the venues of the programme urged the party loyalists and supporters to troop out in large number to elect the Governor for second term during the primary, next Saturday and in the July Governorship election.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "The Bayelsa State government has warned the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, to avoid \u201cthrowing stones from a glass house.\u201d\n\nThe State commissioner for Information, Mr. Ayibaina Duba, in statement on Sunday, described Sylva\u2019s attack on Governor Diri as shocking and indeed misguided.\n\nSylva, a former governor of the State, had upbraided the incumbent State governor when he featured as a guest on a Yenagoa-based radio station on Saturday.\n\nThe State Commissioner for Information noted that Chief Sylva\u2019s comments were unbefitting of the position of an exalted citizen of the state occupying a high national office.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe lamented that the comments by the Minister were coming at a time the state and its citizens are in a mood to celebrate the second anniversary of Governor Douye Diri-led Prosperity Administration.\n\nHon. Ayibaina said the state government was surprised that having previously been the number one citizen of the state, Sylva displayed crass ignorance about ongoing projects of the prosperity government.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, Bayelsans know better and cannot be swayed by the baseless sentiments and the shenanigans of political conflict mongers.\n\n\u201cWhile we acknowledge his praises for some of the policies of the Governor Diri Administration, we, however, listened to him and saw how he trivialised some of the newly inaugurated projects of this administration.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cFor instance, the former governor described the newly inaugurated Igbedi Community Road as a mere 4.5km road project that did not deserve the invitation of another governor to inaugurate. He said that it led to the governor\u2019s wife\u2019s hometown.\n\n\u201cPray, is Igbedi not a community in Bayelsa State that deserves the benefits of government projects like any other community?\n\n\u201cIn his attempt to pour ice on the historic significance of the road, Chief Sylva chose to ignore the fact that this was the only community in Kolokuma/Opokuma Local Government Area of the state that hitherto was not accessible by road for about 500 years before the Senator Diri administration wiped off their tears. We do not want to believe that the Minister is a kill-joy!\n\n\u201cChief Sylva was also economical with the truth and engaging in the usual deceitful politics of the All Progressives Congress by saying that Bayelsa was dark at night when he arrived the state. And we ask: which Bayelsa did he visit? Is it the Bayelsa that the Prosperity Administration has installed functional solar-powered lights on all the major roads in the state capital and still lighting up more areas of the city or another state?\n\n\u201cIf Chief Sylva was referring to darkness arising from power outage, we expect him to know better than to point accusing fingers at the state government for that. We do not think he deserved to be educated on this as someone we expect should know about the privatisation of power in the country,\u201d he said.\n\nThe commissioner dismissed Sylva\u2019s claim that the Diri administration\n\nrevisited the Judges Quarters, Yenagoa, an inaugurated project in order to re-inaugurate it.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe said that Sylva\u2019s negative remarks on the ongoing work on the second phase of the Isaac Boro Road project was not different from the APC\u2019s attack on the Bayelsa Airport which every citizen of the state uses now.\n\nHe said that records at the disposal of the state government shows that monies were released for project execution under Sylva as governor with nothing in the ground.\n\nHe, therefore, added that, \u201cPeople living in glass houses should be careful how they throw stones.\u201d",

Simulated and tested computer models of physical systems are then 3D printed as prototypes that can be subjected to empirical tests, and become the basis towards mass production.\n\nOver the last three years, S2PAfrica has been involved in a project titled \u201cRethinking the West African Engineering Eco System,\u201d funded by the International Development Research Centre, IDRC of Canada and supervised by the Nigerian Academy of Engineering.\n\nNow, in concluding the three-year project, S2PAfrica is organising a West African Engineering Design competition. 50 sets of students from the 18 Nigerian and one Ghanaian university submitted entries. Out of these 50 entries, 46 were accepted and the top 15 will be pre-judged by in-house experts.\n\nThe final judgment will take place on the 26th of February 2022 (by a Zoom event), which will be overseen by a global jury of carefully chosen local, and international experts, who have been selected mainly from among African engineers in the Diaspora, who are recognised as global leaders in their various engineering fields across reputable international organisations.\n\nThe grand prize of $10,000.00 offered by IDRC will go to the team, or individual that produces the most innovative solution to a pressing local problem, based on the application of relevant and appropriate theory to optimise material use and predict product behaviour under pre-defined use conditions.\n\nThe top ten finalists shall receive $500.00 each.\n\nOther prizes include $2,000.00 offered by Autodesk \u2013 a global leader in design, software and engineering technology, for the team, or individual that produces a design that makes the best use of Fusion 360, a 3D Solid modelling software product of Autodesk. There is also a commitment from Cummins West Africa \u2013 the global power leader, for support of the competition.\n\nApart from these, there are various other category prizes and well as individually sponsored prizes.\n\nFor more information, kindly check: https://s2pafrica.org/edc/about-edc\n\nOr contact Dr. (Mrs.) Yinka Adewumi: [email protected]",

Rabiu Ali, on the November 1st, 2021, 21-story Ikoyi building collapse in Lagos.\n\nAt COREN\u2019s headquarters in Abuja, Okonoma submitted the findings and suggestions to the council\u2019s president.\n\nHe stated that the report was intended for the COREN president and the government to consider before making it public.\n\n\u201cWe will ensure that the suggestions are executed by the government,\u201d Ali said after receiving the document, citing COREN\u2019s mandate and Act.\n\n\u201cGoing forward, after we\u2019ve seen what went wrong,\u201d Ali said, \u201cthere are two things to learn from the situation of the collapsed 21-story building.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne must see what went wrong and correct ourselves in the proper manner, as well as to discipline erring practitioners for neglect.\u201d\n\nThe state government had already conducted a detailed investigation into the collapse of the Ikoyi 21-story building through a special probe panel chaired by TPL, Toyin Ayinde.\n\nOn January 5, 2022, Ayinde presented the report to Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, expressing hope that the submission and subsequent implementation of the suggestions will restore confidence in the national economy\u2019s construction industry.",

Malik and Afam Osigwe, Esq., FCIArb among others.\n\nIssues\n\nIn the suit marked SC/CV/655/2020, the governors sought determination of two questions:\n\n\u00b7 Whether by sections 6 and 81(3) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as Amended), read together with Item 21(e) of the Third Schedule thereof, the Federal Government \u201cis not constitutionally obligated and/or charged with the responsibility for funding all capital and recurrent expenditure of the High Courts, Sharia Courts of Appeal and Customary Courts of Appeal of the States of the Federation of Nigeria, being Courts created under Section 6 of the CFRN.\u201d\n\n\u00b7 Whether by sections 6, 80, 81, 120 and 121 of the Constitution, it is not unlawful for the Presidential Executive Order No. 00-10 of 2020 to compel the Governors to fund State High Courts, States Sharia Courts of Appeal and Customary Courts of Appeal.\n\nAnd in the event the two questions were answered in the affirmative, the governors urged the court to order President Buhari to refund all monies expended by states in funding capital expenditure of the High Courts, Sharia Courts of Appeal and Customary Courts of Appeal of states being courts established by section 6 of the constitution.\n\nThey also sought an order \u201csetting aside the Presidential Executive Order No. 00-10 of 2020 made by the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria on 22nd May, 2020 on the ground that same is in violation of the express provisions of the CFRN and, therefore, unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nSupreme Court\u2019s ruling\n\nUpon hearing from both parties on the two fundamental issues raised before it, the Supreme Court invited top constitutional lawyers as amici curiae (friends of the court) to advise it on the issues.\n\nWhile rendering the national service, the top legal practitioners were divided in their opinions, with some supporting the state governors while others supported President Buhari\u2019s government on the issue.\n\nAnd on Friday, the Supreme Court, like the amici curiae, in a split decision of six justices to one, declared as illegal the EO 10.\n\nIn its lead judgement delivered by Justice Mohammed Dattijo, the apex court held that President Buhari acted beyond his statutory powers in issuing the Order 10, saying it was inconsistent with the 1999 Constitution (as amended), and therefore unconstitutional, illegal, null and void.\n\nSpecifically, Justices Centus Chima Nweze, Hellen Ogunwumiju, Emmanuel Agim, Ejembi Eko and Adamu Jauro, agreed with the lead judgment.\n\nThe court, in its judgement delivered by Justice Dattijo, held that President Buhari over-stepped his bounds with the Executive Order 10, and thereby engaged in breach of the constitution and usurpation of powers of heads of other arms of government.\n\n\u201cThis country is still a federation and the 1999 Constitution it operates is a federal one. The constitution provides a clear delineation of powers between the state and the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cThe president has overstepped the limit of his constitutional powers by issuing the Executive Order 10. The country is run on the basis of the rule of law,\u201d Justice Dattijo held.\n\nDissenting judgement\n\nBut a member of the panel, Justice Uwani Abba-Aji, disagreed with the lead judgement and declared that the Order was in order.\n\nJustice Abba-Aji maintained that the EO 10 was meant to grant fiscal autonomy to both the judiciary and the legislature at the state level.\n\n\u201cWe are not unaware of the hanky-panky and subterfuge played by state governors against the independence and financial autonomy of state judiciary.\n\n\u201cIt is a pitiable eyesore what judicial officers and staff go through financially at the hands of state executives, who often flout constitutional and court orders to their whims and caprices.\n\n\u201cThus, the presidential Executive Order 10 is meant to facilitate the implementation of the constitutional provisions. The Executive Order is to aid the states legislature and judiciary in curing the constitutional wrong of their financial autonomy which the states have always denied. This is not unconstitutional,\u201d the jurist held.\n\nSANs differ\n\nIn his reaction, a prominent South-west lawyer, Chief Adeniyi Akintola (SAN), said the Supreme Court judgement on the Executive Order was in order.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court was absolutely right. And thank God for the lives of those justices. They lived up to expectation. They didn\u2019t consider their own personal comfort. The president has good intention but good intention is not enough in a democracy. You cannot usurp the function of the legislature in the name of executive order. You cannot replace the provision of section 4 of the constitution with executive order. The power to make laws belongs the State Assemblies and National Assembly.\n\n\u201cThe judgement has no negative implication for the both the state judiciary and the legislature. It is the inability of the executive to implement the constitution that is causing the problem. The constitution has made provision for judicial autonomy. It is separated from the other arms of government. They are not implementing it. Nonetheless, you don\u2019t need executive order to sustain the judiciary\u2019s independence. You don\u2019t need it.\n\n\u201cLook at what the governors are doing. Many of them are also now resorting to executive orders. It is an invitation to anarchy and dictatorship. Where we copy it from, it is not used to make law. You don\u2019t use executive orders to make laws.\u201d\n\nOwonikoko, SAN\n\nAlso in his submission, Mr Abiodun Jelili Owonikoko ((SAN), said the judgement did not in any way open any fresh loophole for governors to exploit.\n\n\u201cI believe the judgment has no negative impact on the autonomy of the judiciary because from day one, the instrument was a non-starter on the very basic that what it sought to do are beyond the provisions of section 121(3) of the constitution as amended by the Fourth Alteration Act No 4 of 2017. What the Executive Order did was to supplant and expand the provisions of the constitution on how to operationalise section 121(3) that has to do with financial autonomy of the legislature and the judiciary at the state level.\n\n\u201cBut as a political move, the Federal Government should still be vindicated that the decision of Mr President to issue that executive order spurred the populace and other role actors to take on their own responsibility for operationalising section 121(3). And what do I mean? In the interval between the executive order and the judgment of the Supreme Court, a lot has happened. The Governor of Lagos State has been compelled by public opinion, pressures from relevant stakeholders like the NBA, JUSUN, and even civil society organisations that have commitment to independent and properly funded judiciary to respond by each of them proceeding now to initiate and pass into law financial autonomy or what they called fund management bills in various states.\u201d\n\nSagay, SAN\n\nBut another legal luminary, Professor Itse Sagay (SAN) differed, saying he was in total agreement with the minority judgement.\n\nSagay said: \u201cI just read the judgement. I was out of the country. I just want to say broadly that I agree with Justice Abba-Aji, the minority judgement. The reason is that the constitution makes it clear that the legislative and judicial branches of state government are to get specific sums of money from what goes to the state. And if the state governors are not making them to have it, all that the executive order has done is to facilitate the implementation of the constitution. And that is what executive orders are supposed to do. So, the Federal Government was right and I agree with the minority judgment entirely.\n\n\u201cBut I agree with the majority judgment where they say that states do not deserve the fund that they have spent on court buildings and other infrastructural expenditure because that is their duty anyway. It is not the duty of the Federal Government. That was what really upset me. It is shameful that state governors could do this and sort of totally defeat everything they have said about independence of state from the control of the Federal Government. If you are asking federal government to be funding everything you are doing, of course, he who pays the piper dictates the tune. So, it is so contradictory. It is very shameful.\u201d\n\nOkutepa, SAN\n\nToeing Sagay\u2019s line of thought, Mr Jibrin Samuel Okutepa (SAN) said the majority judgement of the apex bench missed a golden opportunity to make a policy statement on state governors\u2019 failure to obey court order and provisions of the constitution regarding the financial autonomy of the judiciary.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court has spoken. What again can I say? Nevertheless, my viewpoint is that the Supreme Court, with the greatest respect, the majority judgment missed a golden opportunity of making a policy statement and find a way out of the insubordination and insolence of the state governors who have refused to pay absolute obedience and fidelity to the constitutional provision that makes the judiciary and the legislature autonomous organs of government.\n\n\u201cYes, it is true that unlike American constitution, there is no provision in our constitution that empowers the president to issue Executive Order, but when you look at the provision of Section 5 of the constitution very clearly, it gives the president the executive powers of the federation and the president being the custodian of the Nigerian constitution is under statutory and constitutional duty to ensure that Nigerian constitution is respected and obeyed,\u201d Okutepa argued.\n\nOkutepa , however, added that as a lawyer, he agreed that \u201cthe judgement of the Supreme Court is the majority judgment. There is nothing anybody can do about it as we are bound by it. My respective view therefore is in support of what Prof Ernest Ojukwu, former D G of the Nigerian Law School, said to the effect that the minority judgment of Justice Abba Aji represents a solution to the logjam of the insubordination of the governors of the various states who have refused to give autonomy to the state judiciary and the state houses of assembly. The president was only being carried away by the patriotic and nationalistic view to ensure that the provisions of the constitution are respected.\u201d\n\nOn way out, the silk said: \u201c\u2026the solution will also be to go back to judicial enforcement of judicial order. Mark you, there is a judgement obtained by JUSUN, that have not been enforced. I have always been advocating that the Judicial Staff Union of Nigeria can go to court and enforce the judgment by seeking an order compelling the AGF and the accountant general of the federation to deduct their money at source and pay over to them, particularly now that we have the opportunity and the privilege of a president who wants the enforcement of this order, the step which he took. The only way now is to go back to the judiciary by another method either by way of enforcement or by a way of mandamus.\u201d\n\nKalu (SAN)\n\nAlso in yet another reaction, a former Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice in Abia state, Prof Awa Kalu (SAN) hailed the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, saying enforcement of judicial autonomy is not in the purview of the federal government.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Supreme Court is the final court. Their infallibility lies in the finality of the court. Once they have decided, there is nowhere to go. They have decided. And it is the law. I had written an opinion on the Executive Order 10 when it was issued that it was unconstitutional. What the Supreme Court has done is purely a confirmation of my opinion.\n\n\u201cIn the opinion, I said my source of concern was to confirm that the executive orders are not sources of legislation. This is because, the executive, if you look at distribution of powers under the constitution, simply executes the laws as well as decisions of courts. But you will not use an executive order to legislate. That was what I said at the time and I stand by it.\n\n\u201cJudicial autonomy is not within the purview of the federal government to enforce. It is a brilliant idea stated in the constitution. But within the autonomy of the state, those elements that enforce obedience to the law and the constitution within the state should act. When you have JUSUN for instance, it is a trade union, a major pressure group. So they should continue their discussion with state governments to ensure the maintenance and sustenance of the autonomy of the judiciary.\u201d\n\nCISLAC, others\n\nSimilarly, the Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) gave separate reactions to the apex court\u2019s decision.\n\nIn his view, Executive Director Civil Society Legislative and Advocacy Centre (CISLAC) and Transparency International Nigeria Auwal Rafsanjani said the judgement never came as a surprise.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe all know that it is important to have a judicial autonomy, to have a state legislature autonomy and local government to be allowed to function with fully autonomy.\n\n\u201cHowever, what I expected from Mr President is to engage with State, Local government and other stakeholders on the democratic processes rather than this military decree which has now been challenged by the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cIt clearly shows that he was not properly advised. We want the local government to be more autonomous because the grassroots democracy has been tampered with and it has been affected.\u201d\n\nYaiga Africa\n\nBut the Board member, Yiaga Africa, Ezenwa Nwangwu, said the unfortunate judicial closure on the long drawn struggle for even its autonomy can be reignited through the window of the ongoing constitutional amendment.\n\nHe said many of the people \u201cspeaking on restructuring don\u2019t believe in it, a few grandstand or don\u2019t even understand it.\u201d\n\nHe said the vicious control of resources and ambush of the other organs of government especially by the governors would require more than executive order.\n\nHe further said it will need a mobilised citizenry to support the desire of the president take off the stranglehold of the czars in the states on the finances of judiciary and legislature.\n\nLakemfa\n\nIn his reaction, a former Secretary General, Organisation of African Trade Union Unity (OATUU), Owei Lakemfa said the twin cases of \u201cfederalism and impunity in our body polity\u201d were playing out.\n\nIn his view, Supreme Court was only concerned about the danger of allowing the Presidency \u201cacquire more imperial powers by dictating to the states in the guise of enforcing the constitution.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the other hand is the impunity of state governments in not implementing the letters and spirit of the constitution as regards the separation of powers that would ensure the independence of the legislature and judiciary.\n\n\u201cThis is a no win situation for the Nigerian people who are played around like football by the political class.\n\n\u201cThe solution is the enlightenment, mobilisation and empowerment of the people to exercise their sovereignty over all powers at whatever level so that all leaders, at whatever level, can be called to order,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, the Convener Take Back Nigeria Movement and Co- Convener, Say No Campaign, Jaiye Gaskiya explained that what the Supreme Court was to rule that the executive had no such power and voided the Executive Order.\n\n\u201cHowever, what the order sought to enforce are provisions of the constitution on which the courts had earlier made pronouncements affirming the constitutional guarantee of legislative and judicial autonomy, and ordering the the budgets of the two arms should be first line charge and should be appropriated directly to the respective arms.\n\n\u201cWhat should be done now is for the state judiciary and the legislatures to approach the Supreme Court directly to seek enforcement of the constitutional provisions, and the relevant rulings of the courts, include seeking an order to direct the Federation account, and or the federal government to deduct such appropriations at source and credit same to the respective judiciaries and legislatures of the states; if the states failed to comply with the ruling of the supreme court on the matter,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018EO 10 unnecessary\u2019\n\nAlso speaking on the issue, a political analyst, Mr Jide Ojo, said Executive Order 10 was highly unnecessary, describing the Supreme Court Judgement as an informal way to restructure the country.\n\nOjo told one of or correspondents that \u201cExecutive order 10 is just an enabled law, it is highly unnecessary. The President did that to fast track the implementation of the financial economy to states\u2019 judiciary and legislature.\n\n\u201cBut the constitution which is the supreme that is the grand norm of all legislation in Nigeria had already stated incontrovertibly that there should be financial autonomy to state judiciary and legislature.\u201d\n\nThe political analyst noted that \u201ca framework was agreed upon in 2021 by Nigeria Governors Forum, and it is what many of the states are now cuing into to implement financial economy for their state assembly and judiciary.\n\n\u201cWhat the governors challenged was the arbitrariness of being coerced by the federal government to implement something which they felt was executive recklessness. And 6 out of 7 Judges of the Supreme Court agreed with the governors that, yes executive order 10 was highly unnecessary.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt also shows that the governors are not mere appendices of the federal government or that the state is not just a mere appendices but they are independent, and cannot be dictated to by the state.\n\n\u201cThis also has arisen over the issue of Value Added Tax, it has also arisen over the issue of Police Equipment Trust Fund which Rivers State Government Challenged.\n\n\u201cI think is just the restructuring we are talking about that is gradually coming out to play. Restructuring can take any form, it can take the form of legislation, it can also take the form of judicial pronouncement. And now we know that the federal government cannot dictate to the state as to the way and manner they should govern their territories.\u201d\n\nOjo who said the outcome was good for Nigeria democracy, expressing the hope that in going forward, \u201cthe federal government would have learnt the limits of its power under this situation.\u201d",

          "text": "As reactions continue to trail Friday\u2019s judgment of the Supreme Court nullifying President Muhhamadu Buhari\u201ds Executive Order 10 (E10), which directed the implementation of financial autonomy for the states\u2019 judiciary and legislature, senior lawyers have described the judgment as one that was neither won nor lost by parties in the suit.\n\nSenior lawyers, who spoke on the implications of the judgment, were of the opinion that it is the constitution that is rather the winner in the legal battle between the federal and the state governments.\n\nThe apex court had in a split decision of six-to-one, held that the president exceeded his powers when he initiated the E10 to compel the governors of the 36 states to implement the constitutional provisions on financial autonomy of the states\u2019 judiciary and legislature.\n\nIn his apparent bid to deepen democracy in the country, and in response to the agitations of judiciary workers, President Buhari had in 2020 signed into law the Executive Order 10 to compel the states to implement the provisions of Section 121(3) of the 1999 Constitution.\n\nSpecifically, E10 directs the Accountant-General of the Federation to deduct from the allocations due to a state from the Federation Account, any sums appropriated for the legislature or judiciary of that state, which the state fails to release to its legislature or judiciary as the case may be and to pay the funds directly to the state\u2019s legislature or judiciary concerned.\n\nThe move it was believed would curtail the alleged dominance of the state executive over the two other arms of government.\n\nBut the states through their\n\nAttorneys-General swiftly approached the court to challenge the legality of the presidential order, insisting that it was unconstitutional and should be voided.\n\nHowever, the seven-man panel of justices of the apex court, which heard the matter held divergent positions leading to split decisions on the two issues raised before the court.\n\nDelivering judgment in the suit on Friday, six justices of the apex court agreed with the position of the plaintiffs that President Buhari exceeded his powers by initiating and signing the law.\n\nAccording to the majority decision, the Executive Order 10 was inconsistent with the 1999 Constitution and therefore unconstitutional, illegal, null and void and of no effect whatsoever.\n\nThose who held this view include: Justices Muhammed Dattijo, Centus Nweze, Ejembi Eko, Adamu Jairo, Helen Ogunwunmiju and Emmanuel Agim.\n\n\n\nThe court subsequently voided E10 signed into law by President Buhari in 2020.\n\nReacting to the Supreme Court decision on the ARISE NEWS Morning Show, Mr. Abiodun Owonikoko (SAN), was emphatic that there was no winner or loser in the legal contest between the federal government and the states. \u201cIt is not anybody\u201ds loss, it is the constitution that has won,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, although the judgment came in form of anti-climax, the federal government should be commended for making the various state government activate the provisions of Section 121(3) of the 1999 Constitution.\n\n\u201cUltimately, the executive arm of government has achieved its objective, the judiciary vindicated,\u201d since the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum has agreed with both the judiciary and the federal government to implement the provisions by enacting fund management law for the purpose of the independence of the legislature and the judiciary.\n\nResponding to questions whether the judiciary did not enter judgment foreclosing its own independence when it nullified the E10 which appeared to be in its favour, Owonikoko replied, \u201cThe court has not ruled against itself because before the executive order, it has been a matter of executive discretion by the various states\u2019 government, how much and in what manner monies due to the other two arms of government are released whereas the Constitution at that time expressly by the amendment made in 2017, took that discretion out of the hands of the governors\u201d.\n\nHe explained that because most of the state legislators were in the pockets of the governors they were unable to assert themselves, adding that the constitution itself was not a self-executing instrument, thereby necessitating the need for some form of framework by which one can judge compliance with Section 121(3).\n\n\u201cNow, the governors by assenting to the various fund management bills that were initiated by consent of all of them at the level of the governors\u2019 forum can no longer exercise those powers because there are bodies set up which will start with budget preparation, budget allocation and then appropriation.\n\n\u201cOnce the appropriation is done in form of financial bill in the state houses of assembly, the governor has no say anymore. Whatever is due from the consolidated revenue to it or the other arms of government go directly from the accountant general of the state to their account\u2019s management bodies. In the court, the heads of the courts and the chief registrar manage the finances of the courts.|\n\nAlso reacting, another senior lawyer, Reverend John Baiyeshea (SAN), noted that the simple implication of the judgment is that the constitutional provisions on the subject matter shall prevail.\n\nAccording to him, Buhari had initiated E10 \u201cout of genuine concern (as a result of agitations and long strike actions by JUSUN for the enforcement/implementation of same).\n\nHe however, agreed with the majority judgment that since the Constitution has covered the field, the Executive Order 10 made by the President becomes unnecessary.\n\n\u201cActually, the issue of autonomy of the judiciary as provided for in the Constitution is with regards to control of the funds budgeted for the Judiciary. State governors over the years have always hijacked the funds of the judiciary and they will now be giving pittance to judiciary as if doing them a favour.\n\n\u201cThe governors derive enormous pleasure in exercising power to control the judiciary. The judiciary is never in charge of their affairs. If you cannot control your fund, you are not independent.\n\n\u201cSo, it is all about independence of the judiciary. The same governors who have been frustrating the full implementation of the autonomy for the Judiciary \u2018rushed\u2019 to Court to challenge Executive Order 10, which the President made to strengthen the independence of the Judiciary.\n\nFor Mr. Dayo Akinlaja (SAN), \u201cthe plain implication of it is that the EO10 is now non-existent in the eye of the law and not binding on the states.\n\n\u201cIt is a decision of the apex court of the land against which there is no appeal. In the circumstance, the states are at liberty to continue with the issue of funding the judicial sector as they may choose or consider appropriate\u201d.\n\nHe however, noted that the only remedy lies with the amendment of the Constitution. \u201cUntil then, the status quo continue,\u201d he added.\n\nAlex Enumah in Abuja",

          "text": "The All Progressives Congress (APC) will on Monday commence the sale of forms to all aspirants vying for national offices ahead of the party\u2019s national convention slated for February 26.\n\nThis is coming as the cracks in the Progressives Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF) have widened over the choice of a consensus national chairman of the ruling party.\n\nIn the schedule of activities released by the party and signed by the Secretary of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Senator John Akpanudoedehe, the purchase of forms will take place at the national secretariat of the party in Abuja.\n\n\n\nThe party said: \u201cSale of Forms to all aspirants vying for National Offices (APC National Secretariat) \u2013 14/02/2022. Submission of completed forms and accompanying documents (APC National Secretariat) \u2013 on or before 19/02/2022.\u201d\n\nIt added that the publication of the members of the sub-committees for the national convention is scheduled to take place on February 19, 2022, while screening of all aspirants vying for national offices would take place between February 20 and 22, 2022.\n\nThe party noted that the screening appeal committees to hear and resolve complaints arising from the screening exercise would be held on February 23.\n\nHowever, following the recent inauguration of state executives of the party, which has further polarised the ruling party, indications have emerged yesterday that the ruling APC is doing all it can to avoid an elective convention.\n\nHowever, there appears to be cracks in the Progressives Governors\u2019 Forum over the choice of a consensus national chairman.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the cracks widened after two North-west governors allegedly presented their choice of a consensus chairman for the party to the presidency without the knowledge of the other APC governors.\n\nIt was learnt that the two governors presented their choice to the Presidency but other APC governors rejected the choice.\n\nA source privy to the political horse trading told THISDAY that the Presidency told the two governors to meet the Chairman of the APC Caretaker Committee, Governor Mai Bala Buni and other members of the committee to discuss and agree on the options that met its (presidency) criteria.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the consensus arrangement was being considered in order to reduce the acrimony within the party.\n\nMeanwhile, some chairmanship aspirants have disagreed on the mode of election of the new national leaders of the party.\n\nWhile some aspirants promised to align with the decision of the leadership of the party, others said they would prefer an elective convention to elect the chairman of the ruling party.\n\nSpeaking on the issue, the Senator representing Niger East and a chairmanship aspirant, Senator Sani Musa, said the mode of election would depend on the provision of the law.\n\nAlso, the former Governor of Zamfara State, Abdulaziz Yari said he wouldn\u2019t mind if he emerges as the consensus candidate of the party.\n\nYari, who spoke through his Chief of Staff, Mr. Abdulkarim Tsafe, told THISDAY that he would prefer an elective convention.\n\n\u201cIf he is the consensus candidate, then good but we\u2019ll prefer to go for elective convention. It is very good if the party leadership will consult the aspirants on the mode of the convention.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking on the mode of the election, another aspirant, Mallam Saliu Mustapha said the decision on the options lies squarely with the leadership and stakeholders of the party.\n\nMustapha, who spoke through his media aide, Mr. Dapo Okubanjo, told THISDAY that as an aspirant, he has done his best to canvass the support of stakeholders of the party across the country, particularly the delegates.\n\n\u201cSo, whichever method the stakeholders adopt at the convention, be it consensus or elective, we believe that our candidate is the candidate to beat.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the former Governor of Borno State, Senator Ali Modu Sheriff, stated that all the aspirants should go into the field for the best candidate to emerge as chairman.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are many and anyone can be chairman but not everyone can lead this party. All the people seeking to be chairman are qualified but only one person will emerge. It is a family thing and we will all go to the field. And party members will elect who they deem fit.\u201d\n\nChuks Okocha and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja",

          "title": "Chelsea Become Club World Champions as Late Havertz Penalty Ends Palmeiras\u2019 Resistance",
          "text": "Once again, Kai Havertz was the match-winner.\n\nOn Saturday evening in Abu Dhabi, the man who scored the only goal in last May\u2019s Champions League final stepped up to take one of the most important penalties in his club\u2019s history, and cooly stroked the ball past Palmeiras goalkeeper Weverton to claim the Club World Cup for the Blues.\n\nNo wonder they call him King Kai. In less than a year, he\u2019s crowned Chelsea champions of both Europe and the world.\n\nChelsea fans have long sung that they\u2019ve won it all. But they hadn\u2019t until Havert\u2019s extra-time spot-kick at the 40,000 seater Mohammed Bin Zayed Stadium.\n\nFinally, owner Roman Abramovich, who was in attendance, has got his hands on the Club World Cup trophy, making it 20 titles in 19 years of the Russian\u2019s rule.\n\nChelsea will receive an estimated \u00a34m ($5m) for winning the FIFA-organised tournament but that will obviously mean little to a man that has spent over \u00a31 billion ($1.35bn) on players turning the Blues into world-beaters.\n\nIndeed, as well as Havertz, another big signing also played a pivotal role, with Romelu Lukaku opening the scoring early in the second half with his 10th goal of the season.\n\nHowever, Thiago Silva handled the ball in his own box in the 61st minute, allowing Raphael Veiga to level matters from 12 yards out.\n\nThe winner came from another handball, as Chelsea\u2019s pressure finally told.\n\nBy the time Havertz scored with three minutes of extra time remaining, manager Thomas Tuchel was on his third formation and had already used all five substitutes.\n\nHis changes worked, just, meaning the German \u2013 who arrived just before the game after recovering from Covid-19 \u2013 has now won three cups since succeeding Frank Lampard at the helm just over a year ago.\n\nThis latest triumph was as difficult as the final scoreline suggested, though.\n\nPalmeiras coach Abel Ferreira brought up the massive difference in budgets before the game, telling reporters, \u201c[Chelsea] are a team that that has spent \u00a3545m ($740m) to be in this competition. Palmeiras spent \u00a329m ($39m).\u201d\n\nHowever, he added, \u201cBut I believe \u2013 and my players believe.\u201d\n\nTheir fans clearly did, too. Chelsea\u2019s players had to deal with an intense atmosphere but they proved their mettle in a deserved victory.\n\nN\u2019Golo Kante can now boast of being a world champion for club and country, while Cesar Azpilicueta became the first Chelsea player to complete a clean sweep of honours.\n\nAntonio Rudiger was arguably man of the match, though, showing why the Blues are now willing to make him the highest-paid defender in the club\u2019s history.\n\nTuchel and his players will now be targeting more silverware, with Chelsea set to face Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final later this month.\n\nThe Blues\u2019 Premier League title challenge may have faltered over Christmas, but there\u2019s a belief behind the scenes that Tuchel can break the boom-and-bust cycle at Stamford Bridge, given his success and excellent working relationship with those behind the scenes.\n\nFor example, he didn\u2019t complain when Chelsea refused to sign another wing-back on a permanent transfer in January, despite Ben Chilwell being out for the rest of the season.\n\nTuchel is a good fit for Chelsea. He understands how things work at the club and he has every chance of staying longer than the 18 months Chelsea managers average under Abramovich.\n\nIndeed, he\u2019s now provided his boss with the one trophy he was missing and there is an undeniable feeling that there are even more titles to come for Tuchel and his young side.\n\nGoal",

          "text": "Following the circulation of adulterated petrol in Nigeria, which damaged vehicle engines last week, the federal government has turned back two tankers carrying petrol loaded in Antwerp, Belgium, and destined for Lagos.\n\nThis is coming as the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies have continued to produce crude oil below their production targets, with the group\u2019s output falling by a record 700,000 barrels per day (bpd) below its collective quotas in January.\n\nThe off-specification fuel, it was learnt, was rejected amid the raging controversy over the bad fuel in circulation in the country, which led to the disruption of the country\u2019s supply chain, resulting in long queues in filling stations across the country.\n\nThe current problematic supply of petrol, which grounded movements in Abuja, Lagos and some other parts of the country, was made worse by the shortage of inventory, according to the figures released by the sole importer, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC).\n\n\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nAs at Saturday, majority of filling stations in Abuja were shut even as motorists spent hours in the sun struggling to buy from the few that were open.\n\nThe imported cargoes were said to have high methanol content, while marketers were advised not to sell to consumers, after over 100 million litres were said to have been in circulation.\n\nBut quoting Refinitiv Eikon ship tracking and other sources, Reuters reported that the two tankers, STI SYMPHONY and VELOS DIAMANTIS, were turned back by the federal government against the backdrop of other petrol cargoes loaded in Antwerp for containing too much methanol.\n\nAccording to a fixture list from a ship broker and Refinitiv Eikon data, Litasco chartered the STI SYMPHONY for January 15 to take 90,000 tonnes of petrol to West Africa.\n\nThe STI SYMPHONY loaded petrol in Antwerp around January 22 before sailing to Lagos, but has now been turned back, according to the Refinitiv Eikon ship tracking.\n\nHowever, the tanker did a U-turn off the coast of Guinea on February and is now heading back to the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp oil hub, Reuters reported.\n\nAccording to the report, NNPC did not respond to a request for comment. Litasco had previously said it does not comment on trading activities and did not immediately respond to a query on the STI Symphony.\n\nThe VELOS DIAMANTIS, carrying 60,000 tonnes, and allegedly chartered by Mercuria, did a U-turn on February 4, after showing Lagos as its destination, Refinitiv Eikon ship tracking showed. A Mercuria source, however, said the company no longer owns the tanker\u2019s cargo.\n\nThe NNPC had while labouring to absolve itself of complicity in the importation and distribution of millions of litres of the bad product into the country, named Belgium as the country of origin of the adulterated fuel.\n\nAmid the damage done to vehicles in some states in the country, the federal government had vowed to investigate the matter with a view to bringing the culprits to book.\n\nGroup Managing Director of the NNPC, Mallam Mele Kyari, however, stated that from his investigation, the four petrol cargoes were imported by MRS, Emadeb/Hyde/AY Maikifi/Brittania-U Consortium and Oando.\n\nAll the companies mentioned, aside Duke Oil, the NNPC\u2019s trading arm, have since denied complicity.\n\nIronically, Kyari had maintained that the cargoes\u2019 quality certificates issued at the loading port in Belgium, by AmSpec Belgium, indicated that the product complied with the Nigerian specification.\n\nFurthermore, he said the NNPC quality inspectors including GMO, SGS, GeoChem and G&G conducted tests before discharge, which showed that the cargo also met the country\u2019s standard.\n\nHe stated that all defaulting suppliers had been put on notice for remedial actions, stressing that the NNPC would work with other stakeholders to take further necessary actions in line with subsisting regulations.\n\nHe did not explain what \u201cfurther necessary action\u201d would be taken even after saying that there was no national standard for methanol in the fuel imported into Nigeria.\n\nThe decision to reject the cargoes also came days after President Muhammadu Buhari expressed anger over the importation and circulation of the contaminated petrol in the country.\n\nTHISDAY had exclusively reported that the President had therefore ordered that the Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA), Mr. Farouk Ahmed, be queried immediately.\n\nNNPC had also in January announced that it received four tankers carrying unusable petrol that was loaded in Belgium by Litasco, the trading arm of Russia\u2019s Lukoil, and sold to local traders.\n\n\n\nThe fuel was found to contain too much methanol and was removed from circulation, causing shortages nationwide.\n\nFollowing the incident, the NNPC banned methanol content in future petrol deliveries. Previously, traders said Nigeria did not specify methanol content. Methanol is sometimes added to petrol in small amounts because it is a cheaper, and cleaner burning fuel that also optimises engine functioning.\n\nAlthough methanol, in small amounts, is a regular petrol additive, the industry\u2019s regulator said the supplier of the off-specification petrol was known but did not name the firm.\n\nNNPC handles nearly all the imports through crude-for-fuel contracts, known as Direct Sale, direct Purchase (DSDP), with consortia of local and foreign oil firms.\n\nEach consortia THISDAY learnt, receives some quantities of crude oil in exchange for petrol.\n\nEmbattled Chief Executive Officer of the NMDPRA, Farouk Ahmed, during the week, stated that the NNPC had received a delivery of 300 million litres to close the supply gap created in the country by the withdrawal of the off-spec petrol.\n\nThe NMDPRA boss had further stated that the country currently has petrol that can last for 20 days, 10 days short of the usual 30-day reserve.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, OPEC and its allies have continued to produce crude oil below their oil production targets, with the group\u2019s output falling by a record 700,000 barrels per day (bpd) below its collective quotas in January.\n\nAn S&P Global Platts survey indicated that OPEC\u2019s 13 countries raised output by 150,000 bpd from December, pumping 28.19 million bpd of crude, while the nine non-OPEC partners, led by Russia, only managed to add a meagre 10,000 bpd, producing 13.99 million bpd.\n\nThe cartel\u2019s underperformance continued even as there appears to be no end in sight to the rising prices of oil occasioned by tightening supply and growing demand for the commodity, mainly on the back of growing tensions between Ukraine and Russia.\n\nOil traders have continued to be rattled by reports that a Russian invasion of Ukraine could take place within days and bid up oil prices to over $95 in large trading volumes.\n\nTraders fear disruptions of oil and natural gas flows from Russia to Europe in case a war begins, either directly from blown-up pipelines or halted flows, or indirectly when energy trade gets caught up in sanctions.\n\nRussia delivers Europe with one-third of its natural gas needs and exports around 2 million bpd of both crude oil and refined products to European nations.\n\nAccording to the OPEC\u2019s Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR) for January, released this week, Nigeria struggled to pump 1.399 million bpd out of the total allocation, quoting primary (direct) sources.\n\nThis was in contrast to December 2021, when it pumped 1.197 million barrels per day and November when it was only able to produce 1.275 million bpd.\n\nThe biggest increases in crude oil production came from Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Kuwait, while output declined in OPEC\u2019s second-largest producer Iraq, as well as in Venezuela and Libya.\n\nBut in all, S&P stated that 14 out of the 18 members with quotas underproduced their targets, pushing OPEC+ compliance to 120.8 per cent, the highest since the group instituted record output cuts in April 2020 to pull the oil market out of its pandemic crash.\n\nDespite strong gains from the group\u2019s core Gulf members and Russia, disruptions in several OPEC+ countries, including Venezuela, Kazakhstan, Libya and Iraq, limited the bloc\u2019s growth in January, it stated.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",
