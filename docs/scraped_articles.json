          "title": "INEC in dilemma over prosecution of 1.1million multiple registrants",
          "text": "The Independent National Electoral Commission says it has not ruled out the possibility of prosecuting the 1,126,359 persons involved in multiple registrations in the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration. It said the figure represented those detected between June 2021 and January 2022 alone.\n\nINEC\u2019s National Commissioner and Chairman of its Information and Voter Education Committee, Mr Festus Okoye, told Sunday PUNCH in an interview that the commission would decide on the issue after the completion of the CVR, scheduled to end on June 30, 2022.\n\nNotably, Section 114 (b) of the Electoral Act (2022) reads, \u201cA person who presents his or herself to be or does any act whereby he or she is by whatever name or description howsoever, included in the register of voters for a constituency in which he or she is not entitled to be registered or causes his or herself to be registered in more than one registration or revision centre\u2026commits an offence and is liable on conviction to a maximum fine of N1,000,000 or to imprisonment for a term of 12 months or both.\u201d\n\nThe Chairman of INEC, Prof Mahmood Yakubu, had said on Wednesday that in the first and second quarters of the CVR, covering June 2021 to January 14, 2022, the commission discovered invalid registrations while cleaning up the register. This, he said, was due to multiple registrations, failure of the Automated Biometric Identification System and incomplete data.\n\nWhile describing the situation as worrisome, given the time and resources expended, he pointed out that 45 per cent \u2013 and 60 per cent in some states \u2013 of registrations conducted during the referenced period were invalid and that the infraction happened in all the states, with no exception.\n\nYakubu said, \u201cIt seems that many registrants, either out of ignorance that they do not need to re-register if they had done so before, or a belief that our systems will not detect this infraction, have gone out to register again. This is despite repeated warnings by the commission against this illegal action. These invalid registrations will not be included in the register of voters.\n\n\u201cThis development is worrisome because of the time and resources expended in handling these cases. Even more disturbing are the strong indications that some of our staff members may be complicit.\u201d\n\nYakubu noted that it was even more disturbing that some of the commission\u2019s staff members could have been complicit in facilitating the infractions despite stern warnings. He said the commission was reviewing reports on such staff members and had commenced a detailed investigation, which might include the prosecution of those found culpable.\n\nHe noted that specific registrants associated with the infractions by the commission\u2019s staff members might also face prosecution in line with sections 22 and 23 of the Electoral Act, 2022.\n\nOkoye, however, noted that prosecuting over one million multiple registrants was no \u201ctea party\u201d and that some of the people did it out of ignorance.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe commission has not ruled out the prosecution of multiple registrants. The commission will complete the registration before taking a position on the issue of multiple registrants.\n\n\u201cAs pointed out by the chairman of the commission, some of the registrants did it out of ignorance, while some thought that our systems are not robust enough to detect them. Prosecuting 1,126,359 multiple registrants for the first and second quarters alone is not a tea party.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the commission has called on the National Assembly to expedite action on the bill seeking to establish an Electoral Offences Commission and Tribunal for the purpose of handling electoral offences.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly must move and pass the bill for the establishment of an Electoral Offences Commission and Tribunal to handle cases relating to the arrest, investigation and prosecution of electoral offenders,\u201d Okoye said.\n\n\u2018Multiple voting no longer possible with BVAS\u2019\n\nAhead of future elections, with the closest being the June 18 governorship election in Ekiti State, INEC said the Bi-Modal Voter Accreditation System, introduced as a replacement for the card readers, would eliminate multiple voting.\n\nThe BVAS, according to Okoye, is a more modern and robust technology used for the purposes of voter registration, accreditation and uploading of polling unit results to the INEC Result Viewing portal, known as iReV.\n\nOkoye said, \u201cThe BVAS performs various and varied functions. It serves as an INEC voter enrolment device during voter registration, which was introduced to improve data capturing at the point of enrolling voters\u2019 facials and fingerprints, migrating from the initial mono-biometrics of fingerprints to bimodal biometrics of fingerprints and facials.\n\n\u201cDuring elections, it transforms to the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System during voter accreditation. The commission has added facial technology to the existing fingerprint technology. With bi-modal authentication, no person can come to vote more than once, as the face of the person would have been captured during authentication. During result upload, it becomes the INEC result viewing portal used to improve the openness and credibility of elections.\n\n\u201cThe introduction of technology in the electoral process in Nigeria has been impactful. From the introduction of the smart card readers for authentication of voters to the present Bi-modal Voter Accreditation System, the commission has continued to sanctify the voting process by mitigating incidences of electoral malpractices and strengthening voter confidence in the electoral process.\n\n\u201cThe commission believes that technology appropriately channelled can reduce pernicious human interference in the electoral process. The commission rolls out its technological innovations based on its satisfaction of its robustness and fit for purpose.\u201d\n\nAsked if the commission had procured all the BVAS machines needed for forthcoming elections, being a new technological innovation, he said, \u201cThe commission is procuring the BVAS in batches and a substantial number has been delivered to the commission.\u201d\n\nINEC to deposit uncollected PVCs with CBN\n\nOwing to the growing voter apathy, which manifests in the usual reluctance of Nigerians to collect their PVCs or vote during elections, INEC has said it will mop up uncollected PVCs and deposit them with the Central Bank of Nigeria.\n\nAsked if the commission had fixed a deadline for the collection of PVCs ahead of the 2023 general elections, Okoye said, \u201cThe Continuous Voter Registration is ongoing. The fourth and final phase will terminate on June 30, 2022. Thereafter, the supplementary voter register will be integrated with the main register and published.\n\n\u201cThe commission has printed 1,390,519 voter cards for those who registered during the first and second quarters of the CVR. The commission has also printed a total of 464,340 replacement cards for those who applied for transfer and those who lost their PVCs or have defaced PVCs.\n\n\u201cThe cards of those who registered during the third and fourth quarters will be printed ahead of the 2023 general elections. At the appropriate time, the commission will give the cut-off date for the collection of the PVCs and thereafter all uncollected PVCs will be mopped up and deposited with the Central Bank of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe commission is doing its best to remain within the ambit of the law. Section 9(6) of the Electoral Act makes it mandatory that the registration of voters, updating and revision of the register of voters shall stop not later than 90 days before any election covered by the Act.\u201d ,,\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "The Pan Niger Delta Forum has stated that the lamentation of the National Assembly over the spate of killings and insecurity in the country is a mere campaign strategy to endear Nigerians to them towards the 2023 elections.\n\nSpeaking with our correspondent in a phone interview, the National Publicity Secretary of PANDEF, Ken Robinson said the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), had failed Nigerians. He urged the citizens to set aside their ethnic and political sentiments to seek a detribalised Nigerian as President in 2023.\n\nHe blamed the National Assembly for contributing to the failure of Nigeria\u2019s security systems by its lack of critical evaluation of the situation. He accused the NA of relinquishing its oversight function.\n\n\u201cWe will conclude that what they (Assemblymen) are doing now is political campaign. Years ago, they were a rubberstamp National Assembly. They were saying yes to everything the President wanted, they were not carrying out their oversight functions.\n\n\u201cWe have one member of the National Assembly who would cite budget figures that had been approved for the Nigerian military, particularly the army in the last two, three years, 400b plus, 500b plus, what did they do with that money? The welfare of the soldiers in the war front in engaging in the criminals and terrorists is very poor as reports indicate. They are well motivated, and trillions of Naira are been appropriated annually. So the National Assembly share a major part of the blame for the collapse in Nation\u2019s security architecture. What they are doing now is to impress their constituents as to fact that elections are close, so that when they go back to campaign people will say, this man was speaking against insecurity .They are not sincere. It is medicine after death,\u201d he stressed.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "The Zamfara State chapters of the All Progressives Congress and the opposition Peoples Democratic Party have bickered over the procurement of 260 cars for monarchs in the state by the Bello Matawalle-led administration.\n\nA statement quoted the governor as saying that the gesture was in recognition of the status of the traditional institutions as the custodians of religion and culture and vehicle of cohesion and peace in societies. The cars; Cadillac 2019 model, were for 17 emirs, 13 senior district heads and 230 district heads across the state.\n\nReacting to the development, the state PDP Secretary, Alhaji Faruku Ahmed, described the gesture as a waste of resources, urging the governor to focus on the security challenges confronting the state.\n\nAhmed said, \u201cThe governor needs to be more serious in tackling insecurity in the state instead of wasting the scarce resources on white-elephant projects. The insecurity challenges affecting the state should matter most at this moment. He should squarely focus on the security challenges facing the state and stop deceiving people with bad policies. He has been telling the world that he has succeeded in tackling insecurity in the state. But we have yet to see it in reality. People are still being killed and kidnapped.\u201d\n\nHe added that the governor should have given the monarchs money to buy the cars they desired if he had to buy the cars which he described as refurbished vehicles. The PDP scribe started, \u201cThe vehicles are refurbished. They are not new, as such. They will consume a lot of fuel.\u2019\u2019\n\nBut the state APC Publicity Secretary, Yusuf Idris, said there had been an orchestrated campaign to incite the people of the state against the personality and administration of Matawalle by people he termed \u2018certain elements in society.\u2019\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "The Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Prof. Isa Pantami, has underscored the significance of mosque as a centre for the integration and advance of Islam and Muslim community in the country.\n\nPantami made the assertion at the Public Presentation of Progress Report and Milestones on Al-Noor Mosque Expansion Project, held at the International Centre for Islamic Culture and Education (ICICE), on Saturday in Abuja.\n\nHe said that historically, mosque had played a significant role in the development of Islamic Culture and Education, adding that the first University to be established in the world started from a mosque.\n\n\u201cThe second University to be established globally also originated from a mosque. Similarly, the first University and first Degree Awarding institution in the world was the University of al-Qarawiyyin in Morocco.\n\n\u201cIt was followed by the University of Al Azhar in Cairo, Egypt, both of them originated from a mosque.\n\n\u201cThis is to show us that mosque is not only where we converge and pray five daily prayers, but a mosque is supposed to be a centre of learning, centre for child upbringing, uniting Muslims and a centre for guidance and counseling.\n\n\u201cAlso, a mosque is a place where Muslims are taught good moral behavior and it is a place for economic development and so on.\u201d\n\nPantami explained that the International Centre for Islamic Culture and Education, Abuja, is among the most effective Islamic centres in the country.\n\n\u201cThe series of activities at the centre includes praying five times daily, conducting marriage activities, taking care of orphans, widows and vulnerable groups.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\n\u201cICICE also engages in marriage reconciliation, providing support to the poor and needy, particularly Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), and teaching our children in nursery, secondary schools and adult education.\n\n\u201cSo, by implications, you can consider this centre to be an informal university, particularly if you look at the activities taking place here and the quality of teaching and other activities.\n\n\u201cIt is because of this we feel it is necessary for us to converge here once again to update our brothers and sisters about the journey so far.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Director-General of ICICE, Dr Kabir Kabo, explained that the project is between 30 to 40 per cent completed, adding that by the time the female Wing construction begins after the month of Ramadan, it would accelerate the project.\n\n\u201cBasically, what we have generated is almost about N2 billion and what has been expanded is about N800 million. We are lucky that the Chief Executive Officer of BUA Group, Abdul Samad Rabiu, has promised to provide all the cement.\n\n\u201cThat has helped to cut cost. But very soon, with the kind of work that is going to take place in the female Wing, we could be asking for more disbursement of funds in the region of about N500 million.\n\n\u201cThe initial estimate of the project is N3.15 billion and with other components that have been taken into account like the excavator, solar, lift, lightening and other things which will cost additional N800 million.\n\n\u201cSo, all together even though the actual contract fee is N3.15 billion for the construction work. Then a separate budget is needed within the region of about N600 to N800 million in order to accomplish the excesses we want to see.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Group Managing Director, NNPC and Chairman, ICICE Advisory Committee, Dr Mele Kyari, who assured that the project would be delivered by next Ramadan, said the project is Al-Noor Mosque\u2019s contribution to nation building and national development.\n\n\u201cWe have a very effective and efficient contractor, we are proud that this work is going on very well.

          "text": "Ekweremadu\n\n\u2026President Emeritus disassociates self from letter\n\n\n\nA group of Enugu State-born United States of America- based professionals, the Enugu State Independent Professional Group in Diaspora (ESIPGID), has endorsed former Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, as the most sustainable and prepared aspirant to take over from the incumbent governor, Hon. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi in 2023.\n\n\n\nThe group made the endorsement in a statement entitled \u201cOur Stand on Zoning\u201d signed by the Chairman, Prof. William Onyebeke, and several others.\n\n\n\nIn taking stocks of critical sectors since 1999, ESIPGID said Enugu was worse off, although power had rotated to the three senatorial districts of the state.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe sentimental issue of fairness as regards to access to executive power by the senatorial zones in the state has been, by commission or omission, addressed significantly at the end of the regime of the current governor of Enugu State.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe attest that candidates from every senatorial zone competed in every gubernatorial contest in the state, and fortunately it turns out that every senatorial zone has now tasted executive power and occupied the seat in Lions Building for eight years apiece.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut we asked ourselves the question: \u2018Are we better off now than we were prior to 1999?\u2019\n\n\u201cDevoid of sentiment, we concluded that the unambiguous answer is a resounding no. Rotation of any sort has not served us well\u201d, the group averred.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur public primary, secondary and tertiary institutions are, regrettably, now shadows of the establishments where we passed through and got the education that made us to excel both in Nigeria and overseas. \u201cThe state\u2019s internally generated revenues structure is progressively diminishing. There are fewer industrial projects and establishments left from what was handed over to the first civilian administration in 1999. Companies have packed up and left the state. Their buildings now house snakes, rodents and ants.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe general health of the state citizens is profoundly poor. Public hospitals are now unhealthy for citizens. \u201cThe state\u2019s jobless environment is pathetic, to say the least. This phenomenon may be breeding irresponsible behaviors amongst the hopeless youth.\n\n\n\n\u201cSecurity is the most urgent and critical of all the issues. The fear of the safety of life and limb is a recurrent topic during discussions within and outside Nigeria\u201d, it stated.\n\nThe group, consequently, urged Enugu people to rise above sentiments, stay true and fair to collective statehood, and elect Ekweremadu as the next governor, given his capacity to tackle and resolve Enugu\u2019s nagging problems.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have exhaustively debated and examined their qualities and qualifications. We collectively concluded that one of the aspirants checks off on all criteria that we listed and debated. Without sentiment or favor, the Distinguished Senator, Professor Ike Ekweremadu comfortably checks off favorably on all points and criteria, at this time.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe therefore throw our unalloyed support behind his candidacy. He should run, he should win and he should ascend to the seat of the next Executive Governor of Enugu state in 2023.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\n\n\nESIPGID said Enugu\u2019s next governor should be perceived as declannised in all its forms; experienced in local, state, national and international affairs; show tangible and factual evidence of a proven track record of activities; show evidence of winning Enugu State popular mandate as opposed to selection; campaign with a winning manifesto that can be publicly audited in future; fearless and ready to guard the entire state, selflessly; and show regard and respect for all citizens and areas of Enugu state, adding that Ekweremadu met all the criteria\n\n\n\n\u201cWith due respect to all aspirants, Senator Ekweremadu is the most popular, most experienced, most declannized and most prepared candidate in the current Enugu State gubernatorial election contest. He has shown his approachability and openness of character.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe is assuring us that he will apply the wealth of experience that he has garnered as a Senator, Deputy Senate President, and Nigerian representative to West African, African and Worldwide political events.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe would strategize, formulate and promulgate policies and infrastructural plans that will elevate our state again to its original status as the hub of Igboland and Southern Nigeria\u201d, the group concluded.\n\n\n\nThis comes on the heels of an earlier statement by 22 Igbo and Enugu State professionals under the auspices of Nigerian American Political Forum, urging Governor Ugwuanyi to \u201chelp bring an immediate end to the divisive rhetoric and overheating of Enugu State polity, especially since all three senatorial zones have had the opportunity to be governor of our state for two terms each\u201d.\n\n\n\nLamenting that Enugu was not where it ought to be, given the human and material capitals it inherited as a former capital of Eastern Region, East Central State, old Anambra and old Enugu State, the group urged the governor to ensure an unhindered participation of every qualified aspirant to elect a leader with the actual competencies and experience needed to take Enugu State to a new height.",

Cargo companies have also applied to have their presence here.\n\n\u201cThose that want to go into hospitality business have applied to build hotels. We will also have demonstration farms that would be run through an outgrower scheme. That is the entire gamut of what will be seen here, I don\u2019t have any doubt that this airport in the first instance, will generate over 25,000 to 30,000 jobs\u201d, the governor stated.\n\nAbiodun, who regretted that the project had been on the drawing board for many years, maintained the reason for embarking on the construction of the airport was economic gains through employment opportunities and the desire to keep the state as the nation\u2019s industrial capital.\n\nAccording to the Governor, \u201cthis project started about 12 months ago and I promised that by God\u2019s grace we will complete it in 18 months. We have gone round and see that the control tower is gradually coming out from the ground, we have driven on the runway which is four kilometres and have seen where the apron is. There is the administrative building of the control tower.\n\n\u201cComing into the airport itself, we drove on the access road which is three kilometres, the runway is being asphalted. I am happy with the project and impressed with the speed and quality of work the contractors are doing. I don\u2019t have any doubt that this project will be delivered on schedule which is the end of November or first week of December\u201d. He added.\n\nThe governor, however, described the project as \u201cmonumental\u201d, stressing that \u201cthe project when completed, will not only have multiplier effects on the economy of the state, subregion, but the entire country\u201d.\n\nWhile reiterating that his administration would keep to its promises, he noted that \u201cwhen we came here last year, we made a pronouncement that we will build this airport. The nay sayers said it was a political statement but you all know that in our usual style, we are a very deliberate and focused administration. We only make promises we can keep. We did not promise to do everything but everything we promised, we will ensure that is done. This is yet another testimony of the promise made to the good people of our state\u201d.\n\nHe said his administration had signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Arise Integrated Industrial Platform which is expected to invest over $400m at the processing zone as well as the Olokola cluster.\n\nSpeaking, Mr. Gupta expressed satisfaction with the level and quality of work done so far at the airport, noting that his organisation was looking forward to participating in developing the state\u2019s processing zone which he said would lead to the creation of more jobs opportunities for the people.",
          "summary": "He noted that the airport would also provide facilities for cargo processing, storage, warehouses, training centre, among others.\nThe agro serving part is the most interesting, it is going to be a conglomeration of agro-processing companies that take raw materials, turn them into finished goods.\nWe will also have an aggregation centres, storage facilities for agro produce so that the agro-processing centres will not run out of raw materials.\n\u201cThis is a truly an international cargo airport.\nCargo companies have also applied to have their presence here.",

          "text": "By Sanni Onogu, Abuja; Chris Njoku, Owerri; Victor Gai, Jalingo; Simon Utebor, Yenagoa; Linus Oota, Lafia; AbdulGafar Alabelewe, Kaduna, Yinka Adeniran, Ibadan and Frank Ikpefan, Abuja\n\nDeputy President of the Senate, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, former Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige, state governors and other eminent Nigerians have called on Christians to imbibe the lessons of Easter by appreciating the central theme of sacrifice, death on the cross and the resurrection of Jesus Christ.\n\nOmo-Agege, in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Yomi Odunuga, in Abuja, said the lessons illustrated by the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ should be a model for human existence.\n\nThe Delta Central lawmaker therefore urged Christians to rededicate themselves to the values of love, peace, sacrifice and tolerance.\n\n\u201cEaster celebrates Christians\u2019 belief in the divine power of Jesus and the hope that loss leads to something new.\n\n\u201cJesus\u2019 death was a sacrifice for the sins of others, but his resurrection represents something even more powerful: the potential for rebirth, salvation, restoration, rejuvenation and renewal of faith.\n\n\u201cThe important message of Easter is love for humanity and this Christ-like virtue must be converted into a citizen\u2019s will towards national integration and harmony between the various religious and ethnic sections of the country,\u201d he said.\n\nThe lawmaker who recently declared his intention to contest the governorship election in Delta State on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), thanked Deltans for their massive show of love and support by gracing the event in their large numbers.\n\nHe stressed that his plan to build a new Delta State is hinged on \u201cEmployment & Empowerment, Development, Good Governance and Enduring Security (EDGE).\n\nHe explained: \u201cLike I noted in my declaration, Delta Central is my comfort zone, if l want to run for re-election over and over again, l am confident that my people will return me, but l have decided to step out of my comfort zone and bring the same benefits to the whole of Delta State.\n\n\u201cI want an opportunity to also bring the same dividends of democracy to Delta South and Delta North because what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. We can\u2019t continue to allow Governor Ifeanyi Okowa and PDP to continue to marginalize us.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Ekweremadu in a statement by his Media Adviser, Uche Anichukwu, in Abuja, said only peace built on justice and love could guarantee the much-needed development and lasting security in the nation.\n\nEkweremadu said: \u201cEaster is a thought-provoking moment as it commemorates the triumph of love, forgiveness, and self-sacrifice over hate and evil.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, Nigeria has not lived up to the promises she held at independence due partly to systemic injustice as well as ethno-religious and sectional discriminations and recriminations that have combined to slow down the nation\u2019s match to greatness.\n\n\u201cIt pains in particular to watch as our nation is daily demystified by the mounting insecurity, poverty, and multi-sectorial regression.\n\n\u201cBut we can still and should indeed resurrect the giant in Nigeria by pulling together, promoting and imbibing the virtues of justice, forgiveness, and love needed to build a peaceful, united, secure, and prosperous nation\u201d.\n\nNgige also felicitated Christians on the occasion of the remembrance of the death and resurrection of Christ.\n\nA statement from his Media Office in Abuja on Saturday, the minister appealed to Christians to see Easter as another great opportunity to re-awaken the dying fervor of personal and collective sacrifice, calling on Nigerians not to despair in the face of threatening national challenges.\n\nNgige said that just like Christ suffered death for the redemption of mankind, no sacrifice is too much towards nation building.\n\nHe said: \u201cBy death on the cross and resurrection, Christ has left an undying lesson that obedient , absolute faith in God, perseverance and sacrifice make the ultimate path to victory. What else does the world want? What else does Nigeria need than these virtues at this crushing moment of national history.\u201d\n\nHe therefore charged the nation to \u201cunite in collective sacrifice against the common enemies of insecurity, corruption , lukewarm patriotism and every other vice, eating out and ebbing away the progress of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe further used the opportunity to once more appeal to university lectures to consider the efforts which the Federal Government has committed towards the revitalisation of the university system as well as the openness it has shown in the upliftment of their welfare as contained in the 2020 Memorandum of Action and return to the classroom.\n\nOver 90% of sponsors of insecurity in Imo are Christians \u2013 Uzodimma\n\nImo State governor, Hope Uzodimma has said that over 90 per cent of both actors and sponsors of insecurity in the state and all over Igboland claim to be Christians.\n\nUzodimma who made the observation while addressing the citizens and residents of the state in a state broadcast to mark the Easter celebration on Saturday, urged the perpetrators of insecurity to use the Easter celebration to purge themselves of those acts that make them hypocrites and worst enemies of Christ.\n\nHe said:\u201dIt is truly ironic and disheartening that over ninety percent of both the actors and sponsors of insecurity in Imo State, and indeed all over Igboland, claim to be Christians. Are these Christians the true followers of Christ? Do they even remember the 5th commandment which says; \u201cThou shalt not kill?\n\n\u201cLet us, therefore, use the occasion of this Easter celebration to purge ourselves of those acts that at best make us hypocrites and at worst, enemies of Christ.\n\n\u201cIn several fora, I have literally gone on my knees to appeal to the sponsors and perpetrators of these senseless killings to sheath their swords and embrace peace and reconciliation irrespective of whatever grudges they may have. I have also asked for forgiveness from anyone who feels offended by any of the policies or actions of the government of Imo State which I lead currently.\n\n\u201cIn the spirit of the Easter season, I would like to repeat this appeal for forgiveness, peace and reconciliation in our state. Heaven will bear me witness that I have always placed the welfare of the people of Imo State above other considerations while taking decisions as Governor of Imo State. It is also on record that I have gone to very great lengths to provide succour to many citizens of the state who were aggrieved by some of the actions of my predecessors.\n\n\u201cAs peace-loving people, I appeal to you to follow the proper channels to lay down any complaints you may have. As I have done before, I promise to look into these complaints and make all efforts to resolve them to the best of my ability. I am using the period of Easter which symbolises peace, brotherliness, forgiveness, reconciliation, love and sacrifice to appeal to everyone to embrace peace for the sake of our children and their unborn children.\u201d\n\nUgwuanyi enjoins Christians to renew faith in God\n\nAs Christians celebrate Easter today, Enugu State governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, has called on the people of the state and indeed all Nigerians to take advantage of the historic event to advance peace, intensify prayers and commit themselves to God.\n\nIn his Easter message, Ugwuanyi applauded Christians for the successful conclusion of the forty-day long lenten season.\n\nHe therefore enjoined Nigerians to appreciate deeply this great reason for the celebration, come closer to God, and dedicate themselves to virtues that would promote peace, love, unity and progress of the country.\n\nWhile wishing all Nigerians a spiritually rewarding Easter celebration, Gov. Ugwuanyi urged them to remain prayerful and committed to God, reassuring the good people of Enugu State of his resolve to continue to serve them with the fear of God, and to work assiduously towards the advancement of peace and good governance in the state, for the wellbeing of the people.\n\nIt\u2019s time to renew hope in Nigeria \u2013 Diri\n\nBayelsa State governor, Douye Diri, said the season of Easter affords yet another opportunity for Christians all over the world to reflect on the purpose of the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ.\n\nHe said importantly, His resurrection and defeat of death rekindled hope for everyone that believed in Him.\n\nIn a statement on Saturday by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Daniel Alabrah, the governor said as Nigerians reflected on the essence of the significant season, he urged all Christians, and, indeed, the people of Bayelsa State to rededicate themselves to the lessons of Jesus\u2019 resurrection.\n\nHe admonished that Christians\u2019 action should manifest in love towards fellow man, peaceful co-habitation and ensuring the unity of Nigerians as a people is preserved.\n\nDiri said: \u201cOur country is going through challenging times at the moment. Easter is therefore a time not to despair but a season to renew hope of a better future for Nigeria and Bayelsa in particular.\u201d\n\nMake Christ\u2019s virtues your everyday template, Ayade admonishes Christians\n\nCross River State governor, Professor Ben Ayade, has urged Christians to imbibe the virtues of Jesus Christ and adopt them as a template for everyday living.\n\nIn an Easter message signed by his Special Adviser, Media and Publicity, Christian Ita, the governor stressed that Christ\u2019s death on the cross for the redemption of mankind and His resurrection after three days signify unwavering love, compassion, sacrifice, selflessness and triumph over despair.\n\nAyade maintained that it was only through show of love and compassion for one another and for Nigeria and sacrifice and selflessness that Nigerians can navigate through the present difficult times.\n\n\u201cAs the Lenten season draws to a close to herald Easter, I charge Nigerians, particularly Christians, to imbibe Christ\u2019s virtues and make them the template for everyday living.\n\n\u201cOf course, Christ\u2019s death for the redemption of mankind and His resurrection represent unwavering love, monumental sacrifice, unparalleled compassion, wholesome selflessness and definite triumph over despair.\n\n\u201cI do not doubt that as Nigerians, these virtues if we inculcate them in our daily life, will help us navigate the present difficulties\u201d, Ayade said.\n\nWhile urging politicians to put God first and embrace politics with ethics as political activities leading to the 2023 general elections hot up, the Cross River state governor opine that Easter is the veritable season for deep introspection and soul-searching.\u201d\n\nMakinde calls for prayer, felicitates Christians\n\nOyo State Governor Seyi Makinde, felicitated Christians across the state and Nigeria on the occasion of this year\u2019s Easter, urging them to imbibe the lessons of love, sacrificial living and peaceful co-existence.\n\nAccording to him, those were the values Jesus Christ taught the world through his death and resurrection.\n\nThe governor, in an Easter message signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Taiwo Adisa, charged Christians to use the important period to pray for the continued progress of Oyo State and for peace and security across the state and Nigeria as a nation.\n\nThe governor stated that prayers of God\u2019s people remained an important ingredient to sustaining the peace and prosperity being witnessed in the state.\n\nHe said: \u201cI felicitate our brethren in Christ across Oyo State and all over Nigeria on the important occasion marking the death and resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n\n\u201cEaster season has always been a moment for sober reflections; a period for Christians to re-evaluate their stand in the Lord and a moment to relive the lessons inherent in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ\u201d.\n\nSule harps on neighbourliness\n\nNasarawa State Governor, Engr Abdullahi Sule, has felicitated with the clergy and all Christian faithful in commemoration of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.\n\nIn a statement he personally signed, Governor Sule said: \u201cAs we are aware, the events leading to the resurrection of Christ were significant milestones in the history of Christianity.\n\n\u201cThe death and rise of Jesus Christ, therefore, symbolises sacrifice and the divinity of God, this, Jesus Christ personifies selflessness, humility, sacrifice, patience and perseverance.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s unite against forces of evil- Abdulrazaq\n\nKwara State governor, Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq, has called on Nigerians to take advantage of this Easter celebrations to seek God\u2019s favour for the country.\n\nHe also urged countrymen and women to reunite against all forces of evil who seek to tear the country apart and terrorise its people with violence and economic sabotage.\n\nAbdulrazaq hailed the Christian community for the Easter festivities, calling it a period of reunion, self-discipline, sacrifice, forgiveness, and commitment to God.\n\nThe governor in a statement said \u201cthat this Easter period coincides with the Muslims\u2019 month of Ramadan \u2013 in which self-discipline and increased virtues are seriously encouraged \u2014 is in fact a signal to the faith communities to unite, speak, act and pray in one accord for a greater Nigeria. Let us come together to fight all forces of evil that work against peace and development.\n\nIshaku calls for vigilance over insecurity\n\nTaraba State governor, Darius Ishaku, has called on the people to be extra vigilant considering \u201cthe alarming spate of kidnappings, killings and other forms of crimes and criminality going on in the country, particularly in neighbouring states and communities.\u201d He also advised the people to report suspicious persons visiting the state to security agencies for prompt action.\n\nThe governor in his Easter message signed by his Special Adviser, Media and Publicity, Bala Dan Abu, felicitated Christians in Taraba State, Nigeria and the entire world on Easter.\n\nHe called on Christian to \u201cponder over the lessons and the significance of this great act of humility and sacrifice demonstrated by Jesus Christ during his trial and crucifixion.\u201d\n\nPDP urges Nigerians to rekindle hope for brighter future\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has urged Nigerians to use the occasion of Easter, which marks the resurrection of Jesus Christ, to rekindle their hope for a brighter future and a national rebirth.\n\nThe party made the call in a statement issued by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr Debo Ologunagba, in Abuja on Saturday.\n\nThe statement said that Easter, the celebration of the victory of life over death, \u201coffers us the opportunity to further strengthen Nigerians resolve to rescue the nation from forces against it.\u201d\n\nIt went on to advise Nigerians not to resign to despondency in the face of life-discounting experiences, but reinforce their determination to unite and use their votes to give the nation a new lease of life, come 2023.\n\nSani urges Nigerians to pray for victims in terrorists\u2019 captivity\n\nIn a message to Nigerian Christians as they celebrate this year\u2019s Easter, Senator Uba Sani representing the Kaduna Central District has called for prayers for the safe return of all the people currently in captivity of criminal gangs across the country.\n\nWhile wishing Christian community in Nigeria and across the world happy Easter celebrations, Sani, a forerunner for the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship ticket in Kaduna State, urged them to spare some thoughts for fellow brothers and sisters still in captivity.",

          "title": "More knocks for FG over Dariye, Nyame pardons",
          "text": "By Mike Odiegwu, Port Harcourt and Eric Ikhilae, Abuja\n\nThe Federal Government yesterday received more knocks for the pardons granted to former governors of Plateau State, Joshua Dariye and Taraba State, Jolly Nyame, convicted for corruption.\n\nRivers State governor, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike and a frontline Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) Mike Ozekhome, flayed the gesture describing it as an act capable of ridiculing the country in the international community.\n\nThe Nation on Saturday learnt that Dariye shed tears of joy on learning about his pardon. Officials of the Kuje facility who broke the news of their pardon to them also noticed that they were suddenly thrown in high spirits as if the doors of the facilities would be opened just immediately.\n\nHowever, our correspondent learnt that the duo are still awaiting their release from the Kuje facility located at the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, as at the time of filing this report.\n\nOfficials of the facility who confided in our Correspondent said Governor Dariye on being told of the pardon was surprised and speechless for some moments, only for tears of joy to roll down his cheeks immediately. \u201cHe embraced some of us in excitement and expressed appreciation to the Council of State, and President Muhammadu Buhari,\u201d one of the officers said.\n\nWike, a leading Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential aspirant said the pardon was a demonstration that the corruption fight of the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led Federal Government was shrouded in despicable politics that had ridiculed Nigeria in the international community.\n\nThe governor spoke when he visited Niger State as part of his ongoing consultations with delegates of the PDP ahead of the party\u2019s presidential primaries.\n\nOzekhome in a statement on Saturday, argued that both the President and the Council of State goofed and abused their undoubted constitutional powers and privileges in granting pardon to Nyame and Dariye in view of their conduct.\n\nHe wondered if Buhari possesses the legal capacity to grant pardon to people prosecuted under state laws.\n\nWike said it was difficult to explain the rationale of the APC led Federal Government in handpicking supposed corrupt persons, make them go through court processes up to Supreme Court and then turn around to release them in the guise of a pardon.\n\nWike in a statement signed by his Special Assistant, Media, recalled that President Buhari promised to fight corruption forthrightly.\n\nHe, however, said Buhari\u2019s pattern was tilted against persons opposed to his policies and programmes.\n\nHe said: \u201cTo tell you the truth, this APC government has deceived us a lot. This is a government that said they\u2019re fighting corruption. They handpick people and jail them after they have gone through all court processes up to the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cThen they turned around to release from prison those people that they said are corrupt. What country and what a government?\n\n\u201cDoing it for political reasons because the elections are coming and they want (Joshua) Dariye to help their party in Plateau State. They want (Jolly) Nyame to help them in Taraba State. Why don\u2019t they give pardon to James Ibori for example.\n\n\u201cLook at how they have made the Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) to prosecute and spend so much money. Then at the end of the day you played politics with it. How will the international community look at us? It\u2019s so shameful.\u201d\n\nWike told the delegates that he was resolved to end the era of lies by the APC to Nigerians, saying it was the reason he was vying for the ticket of the PDP.\n\nHe promised to tackle the festering insecurity in parts of the country to allow farmers return to their farms and grow the economy.\n\nHis words: \u201cThe day you give me the ticket is the day we will start to form the government, because by giving me the ticket, I know I\u2019ve won the election already.\n\n\u201cIt is only when you\u2019ve given me the ticket that I\u2019ll make sure that I present, put together the best of professionals that will help me to run the affairs of this country.\n\n\u201cLeadership is the ability to organise and galvanise experts to do the work under adequate supervision and coordination.\u201d\n\nFor Ozekhome, Buhari\u2019s action was not only a negation of his administration\u2019s anti-corruption stand, but a confirmation of the argument that the president was not committed to the fight against corruption.\n\nHe distinguished the pardon granted to the late governor of Bayelsa State, Diepreye Alamieyeseigha from the current case of Nyame and Dariye.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere is the more worrisome legal conundrum in the entire presidential pardon as it pertains to the two governors.\n\n\u201cThis is whether the president could have legally granted pardon to former governors Joshua Dariye and Jolly Nyame of Plateau and Taraba states respectively, having regards to the fact that both men were convicted for offences allegedly committed between November 2000 and May 2007.\n\n\u201cThe offences under which they were tried and convicted fall under state laws which took place after the promulgation of the1999 Constitution during which time they were governors.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, they were tried and convicted under sections 115,119 and 309 of the Penal Code Act, Cap 532, LFN, 1990, obviously an existing State law within the meaning, import and true purport of sections 315(1)(b) and 318 of the 1999 Constitution.\n\n\u201cThis Act which became effective as a state law is applicable to the FCT and the northern states. This Penal Code Act ,not being a federal legislation of the NASS, became an existing state law deemed duly enacted by the 19 Northern States by virtue of section 315(1)(b) of the 1999 Constitution.\n\n\u201cIt becomes clear therefore that only the governors of Plateau and Taraba States could have legally and rightly granted pardon to Dariye and Nyame,invoking section 212 of the Constitution; and not Mr President under section 175 of the Constitution.\u201d\n\nOn the negative implication of granting pardon to Nyame and Dariye, Ozekhome said: \u201cThe purpose of criminal prosecution is to secure justice, not only for the accused, but also for the victims of crimes and the state; and to some extent get reparation and restitution for the victims, while deterring others from going the same route.\n\n\u201cWhere lies the justice for the impoverished people of Plateau and Taraba states who will now watch their tormentors stroll out with red carpet treatment?\n\n\u201cThe government budgets huge sums of money for the prosecution of such accused persons from the tax players\u2019 sweat; and if after the rigorous period of trial and subsequent conviction, the guilty are simply let off the hook in such a brazen manner, the little remaining lean hope the citizens have in the system is further diminished.\n\n\u201cI dare say that in these two instances, both the President and the Council of State goofed and abused their undoubted constitutional powers and privileges.\n\n\u201cA constitutional issue as volatile as this could have been better managed if the minders of the president had told him the embarrassment this could cause the government in the estimation of the comity of nations. And it is doing just that.\n\n\u201cThis brazen abuse of power will definitely ricochet and erode the confidence of our international partners in the fight against corruption.\n\n\u201cIt will also dampen the morale of the agencies fighting corruption, such as EFCC, the Nigeria Police Force, and the ICPC, amongst others.\n\n\u201cThis singular ill-advised act of abuse of power will also definitely embolden political thieves and unrepentant pilferers of our national commonwealth.\n\n\u201cIt shows that once you are a friend of the President or a member of his political party, or his acolyte and supporter, you can get away with any crime. In other words, in Nigeria, corruption surely pays!\n\n\u201cWith this action, the fight against corruption appears forlorn and a mirage. What is the essence of spending scarce resources in the name of fighting corruption if at the end of the day the convicts will be pardoned and stroll into their palatial homes in splendour in this ugly manner?\n\nEx-governors still in custody\n\nPublic Relations Officer of the FCT Command of the Nigerian Correctional Service (NCoS), Humphrey Chukwuendo says that the ex-governors Dariye and Nyame are still in their custody.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs of today we are yet to get letters to release them. It\u2019s the Federal Government that will bring the letters. And once we receive the letters, they will be set free. The holidays may not affect their release because it is from the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cBut supposing we are expecting the letters from the courts, then we can say it will be after the holidays. As we are talking now, if they bring the letter, we will release them.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where exactly the letters will come, maybe from the Attorney General of the Federation or the Presidency.\n\n\u201cIt is possible the letter will go through the Controller-General, then, come down to the FCT Command. We will immediately do the needful. But as we speak, ex-governors Dariye and Nyame are still in our custody. \u201c",

          "text": "The Bring Back Our Girls Movement, Lagos, Saturday, held its weekly sit-out at Falomo, Lagos, to commemorate the eight anniversary of the abduction of over 200 students of the Government College, Chibok, Borno State by the dreaded Boko Haram sect.\n\nOne of the liberated girls, Grace Dauda, was there to share her experience.\n\nLooking pretty and well-kept, Dauda recalled her experience in the three years she spent in captivity saying: \u201cImagine yourself living in the forest, no freedom and fighter jets hovering around. No one would want that. Please we need these young women back. We can\u2019t fold our hands and do nothing, thereby losing them forever.\n\n\u201cI want to tell the Nigerian government to help us out. I no longer hear anything about my sisters in captivity. Please don\u2019t forget about these young women. They are suffering because I know what I went through when I was there. They deserve better.\u201d\n\nTracing the history of the Chibok abduction, which has since gained global acclaim, with even the Bring Back Our Girls (BBOG) movement having branches across continents, Coordinator of Bring Back Our Girls (Lagos), Habiba Balogun, said \u201c276 girls were abducted, 57 jumped out of the bus as they were being taken away; government negotiated the release of 82 and later another 21 girls. A few others also escaped or were liberated by the army, but there are still 109 Chibok girls in captivity, whose families are still crying, still begging God for them to be released.\u201d\n\nShe however said that the movement and indeed Nigerians are tired of begging and we are now demanding that the government should bring back the girls now and alive.\n\nShe said all Nigerians are now a metaphor for Chibok girls, stressing that the series of abductions and attacks, including the recent Kaduna-Abuja train bombing and abduction more than underline this.\n\nBalogun revealed what could be termed a piece of good news, when she said two more girls were recently liberated, culminating in celebrations in their families. She, however, that they are still being processed, which is why they have not released their names.\n\nIn an attempt to capture the trauma parents of the yet to be released girls are going through, Balogun said, \u201cIf your child is dead, she is dead, but for her to be missing, that is a nightmare. And to even know that your child is in the hands of people who are not kind, to know that your child is in a condition that nobody would pray to be in; in a forest, with no shelter, no clean water, no regular food, and subject to God knows what, is something you don\u2019t want to imagine.\u201d\n\nDelivering a message titled, \u201cLet everyone be restless until they are free,\u201d Very Reverend Allotey Pappoe, urged united and concerted effort until the girls are back.\n\nReading from the book of Luke 22: 35-38, Rev Pappoe said \u201cthe people will remain restless until they are sure that everyone in captivity is back and there is no more of this criminality in our land.\u201d\n\nMember BBOG Ikoyi and renowned Human rights activist, Ayo Obe, said, \u201cWe have entered into the 9th year, having celebrated 8th years two days ago. The government did not have anything to say or deemed it fit to say anything on the 8th anniversary of the abduction, apparently because they had nothing to tell us. But government should say something even if they are embarrassed. They should face the embarrassment and tell the people what they are doing. The father of Leah Sharibu said he no longer hears anything from the government. Rather than keep quiet, they should speak up.\u201d\n\nConfirming Balogun\u2019s claim that the group has been sitting out for the past eight years, Mrs Obe said she is disappointed that the government has not been able to bring back all the girls.\n\n\u201cI am disappointed, not only because we don\u2019t have our children back but at the number of kidnap victims, particularly because those kidnapped from educational establishments have been on the increase. The impact on education has been devastating. I praise parents who still send their children to school in those areas. If government does not find a solution, the seed of assault that is being sewn on our educational establishment, we will reap the harvest and we will not find it funny.\u201d\n\nAsked if she is not tired sitting out for the same purpose all of eight years and still counting, Obe said, \u00cf am tired. But we are not giving up.\u201d",

          "title": "Rebuilding Jos main market: Better late than never",
          "text": "I write this piece upon hearing an uplifting news item a couple of weeks ago in Plateau State; quite a refreshing change from the constant stream of bad news about killings and skyrocketing prices of foodstuffs. It was the cheering news that the state government has at last found a financier to partner in the rebuilding of the burnt Jos Main Market which for the past 20 years lay in ruins at the city centre. Although it could hardly compensate for lost lives or deepening economic gloom families face these days, it was a reassuring news item, nevertheless, given the vast potentials the market has in revitalizing the economy of the state as well as the vast opportunities it holds for individual commercial activities.\n\nThe burnt Jos Main Market held a special place in the soul of Plateau State and its people. It was initially conceived, like most iconic projects in the state, by the former Governor of the defunct Benue Plateau State, Mr. Joseph D. Gomwalk, in 1975. Gomwalk was toppled in the coup of the same year, so the project went through many hands. But like it is often said, if Gomwalk was the Moses of Plateau State, Chief Solomon D. Lar was the Joshua, an allusion to the Biblical characters God used in the liberation of the Jews from Egypt and final arrival in the Promised Land!\n\nIndeed, Chief Lar was instrumental to the completion of the market as he injected a massive part of the Midland Bank foreign loan he had procured into it. By the time he, too, was overthrown in the General Muhammadu Buhari coup of January 1984, the magnificent edifice was almost completed. It was the military Governor Navy Commodore Samuel B. Atukum\u2019s special honour to invite Gen. Buhari, then Head of State, to Plateau State to commission the market in 1985.\n\nBy the time it was commissioned, the market stood out as the biggest indoor market in West Africa. But there was more to it than sheer size; it was aesthetically resplendent, a sheer architectural splendor! Almost immediately, it became a tourism delight in its own right, attracting a daily retinue of tourists from near and far who visited the market to just behold the architectural masterpiece. No students\u2019 educational visit to Jos was complete without including the market in the itinerary.\n\nThe market had the capacity to accommodate at least 3,500 traders in the lock-up shops while the open space at the base of the main structure could accommodate at least another 2,000 traders. The complex also had provision for banks, restaurants, police station, fire service station, car parks and even accommodation for some important market staff. The market was well patronized by traders from all over Nigeria. It was a veritable internally generated revenue (IGR) spinner for the government. However, all these went up in flames one night in February 2002. It was described as mysterious fire but public perception was that it was an act of arson by unknown hoodlums. The government of Chief Joshua Dariye set up a commission of inquiry but the report was never released.\n\nFor the past 20 years successive governments had promised to rebuild the edifice but they all failed to so. In fact, during the brief administration of Chief Michael Botmang, the beautiful yellow metal frames adorning the complex were removed and allegedly sold by a top aide! In 2009, Governor Jonah D. Jang promised to demolish the entire structure and build a modern international shopping mall in its place. This, too, was not fulfilled.\n\nHowever, Governor Simon B. Lalong back in February 2015, even before he contested the election, told a newspaper in an interview that \u201cone of the first things he would do was to rebuild the market either through build-operate-and transfer model or public-private partnership.\u201d Yet it remained an unfulfilled promise during his first tenure in government even after the fanfare of demolishing a section of the market preparatory to the commencement of constructing the market. The political opposition made heavy weather of this during his reelection electioneering campaigns, widely circulating the Lalong demolition video as evidence of failed promises. As the years fly by, with the second tenure inching to an end, the video was also a subject of political jest at watering-holes\n\nSo it was pleasant news, indeed, when the Lalong government announced arrangements for the commencement of the project with Jaiz Bank Plc in a public-private partnership (PPP) . It said under the agreement signed by the partners, the bank will fully finance the N9.4bn project at zero per cent interest. Jaiz Bank is Nigeria\u2019s first non-interest bank operating under Islamic banking principles. Although it was founded in 2003, the bank began operation as a national bank in Nigeria only in January 2012.\n\nNaturally, owing to the sentiments religion packs in this country, already voices have started shouting \u201cIslamization!\u201d since the announcement was made. I respect our defenders of constitutional secularism but this can hardly be a threat in any way. The cynicism, however, is borne out of public ignorance about the operation of the Islamic banking principles of non-interest, a concept which other Western mainstream banks such as HSBC, Citibank, Barlays Bank, Standard Chartered, etc, have since incorporated non-interest banking products into their operations. Proponents of this system say that it is an alternative banking based on the principle of non-interest, sharing of risks and rewards, equity, fairness and justice. In short, it is an ethical financial system without recourse to Islamic propaganda or proselytism.\n\nThe major point of departure with the traditional capitalist banking system as practiced in Nigeria is the rejection of usury (riba). In truth, this principle is shared by both Christianity and Judaism. The Bible is emphatically against usury (Exodus 22:25-27, Deuteronomy 23:19 Ezekiel 18:8) as practiced by the mainstream banks which have virtually strangulated Nigerians or rendered them enslaved through exorbitant interest charges. Christianity is very much in tune with non-interest banking principles. In fact, Jesus\u2019 only recorded expression of anger was the chasing out of usurers who had converted the temple, God\u2019s house, into their place of operation (John 2:15).\n\nIf Jaiz Bank will rebuild the burnt Jos Main Market and thus resuscitate the economy of Plateau State, so be it. Governor Lalong should be saluted for keeping his word to rebuild the market. Although, it may be coming late in the life of his Administration, and I am sure there is a convincing reason for that, the most important thing is that the process is now under way. His choice of a partner for the PPP is also a sound one. Within the short period of its operation in Nigeria, Jaiz Bank has established a reputation of reliability. The first Islamic bank anywhere in the world to break even within the first three years of its operation, the bank has also just within 10 years of operation been able to move its asset base from N12 billion to N278 billion and, finally, to earn an overall Fitch rating of B- just under a decade.\n\nBesides, Jaiz Bank Plc has a track record in such project financing. A few examples will suffice: in a tripartite partnership between the Kano State government and private investors, the bank is constructing a multi-million world-class drug-only wholesale market, the first of its type in Nigeria, at the Kano Economic City; in Niger State, in partnership with the government, the bank is developing 3 hectares in the Minna City Centre to provide for a shopping complex, modern underground parks, modern filling station, warehouses, corner shops, restaurants and a recreational a centre at a total cost of N3.5 billion; Kaduna State also engaged it in its market development and currently Enugu State government is reported in talks with it for a similar project! The above performance profile and experience in the sector are good assurances of the bank\u2019s capacity to handle the Jos market project.\n\nMy only advice, as I initially expressed on the social media, is that the memorandum of understanding (MOU) should be doubly scrutinized to guarantee equity, fairness and justice to the people of Plateau State as well as ensure hitch-free implementation of the partnership.",

          "text": "Tinubu to youths: With you on my side, we\u2019ll make Nigeria excel\n\nAll Progressives Congress (APC) National Leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, yesterday sought the support of Nigerian youths in his bid for the presidency, saying together, they could change the story of the country for the better.\n\n\u201cIf YouTube alone has 2.9 billion people following it, including you all standing here, then Nigeria can excel.\n\n\u201cWe can do it. You must develop the \u2018can do\u2019 attitude. You must believe that this country is yours and you want to change the story,\u201d Tinubu told thousands of youths from the six Southwest states who stormed the Mobolaji Johnson Stadium, Onikan, Lagos for a rally endorsing his aspiration.\n\n\u201cYou must change the story of potential, the story of banditry, you must change the story of tribalism,\u201d he added.\n\nNigeria, Tinubu said, has all it requires to conveniently feed its citizens \u201cby being creative, visionary and committed.\u201d\n\nContinuing, he said: \u201cAnybody who says we cannot, they can get out, because it is voluntary. We cannot continue the lamentation of the past.\n\n\u201cWe cannot continue with excuses of power failure. No nation can make rapid development without electricity.\n\n\u2018Nigeria, it is about time. We have enough gas to fire up electricity and supply the rest of Europe and make money.\n\n\u201cYou know it. We don\u2019t want to bore you with it.\n\n\u201cWhen I started, we used to pick dead bodies on the streets. But today, Lagos is one of the cleanest, most progressive states in the country.\u201d\n\nHe said that with him at the helm of Nigeria\u2019s affairs, challenges such as unstable power supply, banditry, ethnic bigotry would be eliminated.\n\nHe told them to revalidate their permanent voter cards to enable them to vote in the 2023 elections.\n\nThe former Lagos State governor spoke at a grand rally by youths under the aegis of Progressive Youth of South-West to declare their support for his presidential aspiration at the Mobolaji Johnson Arena in Onikan area of the state.\n\nThe youths from different states in the region, like Lagos, Ogun, Osun, Ekiti, Ondo and Oyo states, had converged on Lagos in their large numbers to drum up support for the aspiration of the national leader of the party.\n\nTinubu, addressing the crowd of youths he described as the brightest, urged them to team up with him in his bid to change the story of Nigeria for the youths and tomorrow which they represent.\n\n\u201cWe as a nation can conveniently feed ourselves by being creative, visionary and committed,\u201d he said.\n\nHe urged the youths to revalidate their permanent voter cards and get ready to vote in the forthcoming 2023 general elections.\n\nAlso addressing the rally organised by the Progressive Youth of South-West, Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu said the youth would continue to be critical stakeholders in Nigeria\u2019s socio-political development.\n\nHe hailed the rally organisers and the attendees for the event, which he hoped would herald a new dawn in the 2023 polls.\n\nOne of the speakers, Dr. Muritala Seriki, said Tinubu\u2019s achievements in Lagos State during his tenure as governor bore eloquence to his ingenuity, hard work and commitment.\n\nI fully support Tinubu\u2019s presidential ambition \u2013 ex-NAN MD Onanuga\n\nA former Managing Director of the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), Bayo Onanuga, yesterday pledged his support for the presidential ambition of the APC national leader.\n\nOnanuga reaffirmed his support while responding to claims that he had switched camps ahead of the 2023 election.\n\nHe said he had known Tinubu for a long time and was part of his governorship campaign in 1998.\n\nOnanuga wrote: \u201cMy attention has been drawn to some lies being circulated about me as having jumped the Bola Ahmed Tinubu train and being against his presidential ambition.\n\n\u201cThe faceless writer, I guess a hatchet hand, wrote: \u2018Almost all members of the Tinubu original power/intellectual base and allies when he was governor are not in support of his presidential ambition. Aregbesola, Afikuyomi, Ojudu, Onanuga, Alake, Fasola, etc. Most of them may work for PYO.\u2019\n\n\u201cLet me correct this misrepresentation straightforwardly: the statement is far from the truth as far as I am concerned.\n\n\u201cI am fully in support of Bola Tinubu. I am not in PYO\u2019s camp and will not be in his camp if Tinubu is running.\n\n\u201cPeople who know me will attest to the fact that I am ever loyal to my friends, loyal to a political cause. I have been on the political left since 1978 when I joined Awolowo\u2019s UPN as a UNILAG student.\n\n\u201cI am not a renegade. And I can vouch for Senator Tokunbo Afikuyomi and Dele Alake as well.\n\n\u201cThe author of the rumour was merely writing conjectures on an issue that is unpredictable, a party\u2019s primary election, where an outsider will only labour in vain in making permutations.\n\n\u201cAs far as I am concerned, and let me say it loud and clear, I am in support of Bola Tinubu\u2019s ambition. I am not against him. He is my first choice, the second choice and the third choice for the exalted seat.\n\n\u201cNigeria is in need of a visionary, a deep thinker, a man with the Midas touch, who can take our country on a journey of prosperity. This country has suffered enough and really needs a new leader who can breathe fresh air in it and change the way things are done.\n\n\u201cNigeria needs a man of ideas, who will not just talk his way, but really get things done.\n\n\u201cI have no doubt that Bola Tinubu is capable of this, which is why I support his campaign to lead Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI have known him since 1992. I was part of his governorship campaign in 1998 before others were invited to his government after we won the election in January 1999.\n\n\u201cI was close to his government for eight years and I bore witness to the innovations he brought into governance, the overhauling of the system that he carried out, some of which other states and the Federal Government had copied.\n\n\u201cI have no iota of doubt that he will replicate the same at the centre, and even do more, if given the opportunity. These are the reasons I support his campaign. And Nigerians will hear more about my involvement in the next few days.\u201d",

          "title": "Pat Utomi exclusive: Why Nigerians should reject APC, PDP in 2023",
          "text": "By Daniel Kanu\n\nPat Utomi is Professor of Political Economy and teacher at the Lagos Business School.\n\nHe is the founder, Centre for Value in Leadership (CVL), as well as former presidential adviser, ex-presidential candidate, and co-convener of the National Consultative Forum of Leaders of Conscience.\n\nIn this no-holds-barred interview with Sunday Sun, he raised the alarm on the need for Nigerians to look for an alternative government in the 2023 elections.\n\nHe said the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have failed in the rescue mission.\n\nHe spoke on other critical national issues, including zoning, failure of leadership, and pointed the way forward. Excerpt:\n\nContrary to the expectation that the opposition party, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) will zone its presidency to the South, the party has decided to throw it open to all zones. What is the implication?\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nI don\u2019t think that they have announced any conclusion as such; I think we are all still speculating or have they formally said anything?\n\nThe signs are there from their body language that it can go anywhere\u2026?\n\n(Cuts in) This is really the fundamental problem with Nigerian politics, it has never been generally governed by principles, it is often been a function of the convenience of those who have money, that is precisely why Nigeria is lying prostrate right now. Nigeria suffers from a collapse of culture, character means nothing, and your word means nothing. In fact, in the Nigerian language when your behaviour is ugly and unredeemable, all you have to do to give it a semblance of decency or whatever is to say, \u2018haba, na politics naa\u2019. I am just being political, that means, if it is politics, it does not have to be decent, and because of this cold-blooded slaughter of decency in the name of politics, Nigeria does not manage to do things that are trustworthy and so the world stopped trusting Nigeria. And this affects Nigeria in business, it affects Nigeria in terms of its reputation generally and how Nigerians are treated around the world. So, when we say that values shape human progress, there is no argument about that. There is low-value content in Nigerian character and how people make and break promises. I am giving you a general analysis of human nature and to come to the specifics of the PDP, nobody forced PDP to put that (zoning) in their constitution and they have not reviewed their constitution but they have reviewed the act because some people, somehow, think that it is not convenient for them, but you see we have principles. We play politics with everything; the two past presidents are both from Katsina and so it\u2019s North, it was okay, but they say okay it should be coming to South and then the people from the Southeast say it\u2019s Southeast, it\u2019s Southeast, then any Igboman who is from Rivers is not involved because they are just bad candidates, they know that they cannot compete so they begin to narrow it so that it can reach them without their having the competence. So, how will you have the moral courage to speak up when you are being driven without principle? And the people who are making this noise don\u2019t know how much closer we all are. In December or November of 1983, when the F28 plane crash in Enugu took place, President Shehu Shagari when he came back went to Enugu for a condolence visit with the vice president and the delegation and when his visit was over and President Shagari flew back to Lagos, Dr Alex Ekwueme, the VP, flew in the same plane (Ministry of Transport Jet) with Umaru Dikko and myself and a couple of other people into Ibadan, the NPN convention was taking place in Ibadan. When we got to the stadium in Ibadan, Ekwueme, the great man, brought out his symbol of office and asked me to hold it. That singular act was a symbolism of something. Let me not go further with this story, it is a story for another day. We just went in briefly, took salutations and all that and we returned to the airport. Ekwueme went into that place to symbolically claim his turn as president of Nigeria and it was a done deal. In 1987 Ekwueme would have become president of Nigeria. If that had happened we won\u2019t be talking about this nonsense we are still talking about today. Zoning and all that would have been long forgotten, because the point of it is to really make everybody feel belonged, feel that we all are together then when it\u2019s zoning you focus on who is the best person since everybody feels symbolically part of the project. The symbolism of what Ekwueme handed to me on that trip to Ibadan was spiritual, it was a spiritual moment, Ekwueme was simply saying to me: you are the next generation, and you, I hand the baton to. You see, Dr Alex Ekwueme was not thinking Southeast. Ekwueme in 1983 picked a group of very fine, highly intelligent Igbo boys, brought them back from America, from all other places, and put them in government to help replace older men like my former teacher who I replaced as political adviser to the president. Those were the kind of leaders who had a pan-Nigeria, pan-Igbo view, and what Ekwueme was trying to do was find competent people to supply into the pipeline of who next it will be their turn. By general calculation, Ekwueme would have been president by 1987, I probably would have been Chief of Staff to the President by 1987, it would have gone round to North, to whatever zones, probably come back. By now I would have been even the president of Nigeria and perhaps retired (laughs). I am telling you this story to show the foresight of someone like Dr Alex Ekwueme. Today, you get all these upstarts who are looking for power, they don\u2019t even know what to do with power, they don\u2019t train themselves to be competent with it, but they just want power, that is why Nigeria is prostrate, nothing is happening. They paid so little attention to how to govern and the results have come in. The chicken has come home to roost. Nigeria is not making progress; the country is on the floor. You can\u2019t see competence in people who want power; you can\u2019t see a heart for the people, a heart of service for the people.\n\nWhat is the way forward from where we are today?\n\nWe are in a very unsustainable situation right now and that is the truth of the matter. If they get away with playing this game it is somehow communicated clearly that what this game is about is to exclude the Igbo man, then you will not be able to stop the irredentism and I can tell you that there may be no Nigeria sooner than we think. I have said on different platforms that the APC and PDP should be shunned in 2023. Both parties have failed Nigeria and should not be allowed to continue to rule. When you listen to them (APC and PDP) it seems they are just competing on who has done more damage to Nigeria. I think Nigerians should just discard the two parties so that we start afresh. Nigerians have spoken in despair about the politicians of APC and PDP and their actions even now show that they can do nothing about the Nigerian condition. Let me repeat some of the things I said in our last press briefing. We must now forge a consensus and the national unity team an approach to governing during this season of a yet-to-be declared national emergency which poses an existential threat to all the parties notwithstanding. It is clear now that the democratisation of misery from the spread of insecurity, poverty, and disease has become evident to both those who think they have cornered power and those who consider themselves victims of power. There is the need for Afenifere, Arewa Consultative Forum, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Niger Delta People Congress and the Middle Belt Forum to be consulted to nominate people into this unity government forum that can walk us through the evil forest of now. The long-drawn painstaking efforts to construct an alternative political track are to avoid the errors of the APC and PDP and socialise interest into clearly values and ethics of the party and train all on the basic policy planks from the vision and grand and human development ideas of the platform party of the Third Force. Our group is calling on Faith groups, and community leaders, alumni associations to seek out the members of their community and bring them forward with a suggested position they should contest.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nHow would you react to the spate of insecurity that has continued to exacerbate taking into consideration the Abuja-Kaduna terrorist attack?\n\nThere is nothing surprising again to me in all of these things, I predicted, 20 years ago that these things will happen. I wasn\u2019t the one who did the analysis, it was an American called Robert Kaplan. He wrote the book: \u201cThe coming anarchy\u201d, in which he looked at the progression of ethnic, religious, and economic cleavages in West Africa and predicted a systematic descend into anarchy. And the only antidote to it is good government and the one thing we have been denied is good government. So, we have not invested in our young people to get a demographic dividend out of them and so we have created a time-bomb that has been mobilised by discontent. The more we govern badly the more the discontent in society, the easier it is to recruit people towards anarchy.\n\nWhen the government says they are on top of the security situation, how do you react to such statements?\n\n(Laughs) If they are on top of it and it is like this what will happen when they are underneath. What we are witnessing is a sad commentary.\n\nAnambra state governor, Prof Chukwuma Soludo, set up a reconciliation committee recently\u2026?\n\n(Cuts in) I think it\u2019s a good idea, I think the more people can talk about what is hurting them the easier to heal. Nigeria needs a lot of healing and Igbo land needs plenty of healing and I have spent a lot of time the last couple of years, I operate fairly quietly. There is certainly no governor in the Southeast I haven\u2019t spent time with physically, personally, trying to persuade a certain kind of behaviour and I am hoping that the Soludo season will probably help push those efforts. I only pray for the best.\n\nCritics say that Nigeria cannot move forward, even with a good leader without restructuring? Do you share in this view?\n\nRestructuring is automatic, it is just happening whether you like it or not, Nigeria has already begun to restructure itself. There is no way you can contain the current security problem until you go to policing and when I say policing it doesn\u2019t have to be formal. The only people who can stop 300 men riding on motorcycles carrying AK47 are the local people who will prevent the people from entering into their community in the first place. We cannot but restructure, that is a natural thing that will come on its own.\n\nAre you talking about community policing?\n\nYou know that there are two different views on community policing, community policing in the classic sense of it, as police and community talking, but community policing with the community as police, a vigilante kind of it, but now designed, like in a way India organizes policing. It is a local function, funding, everything is local, but the standard, operational mode is central from the top they set all those standards and people can be promoted from the local state police into federal police service. And if things locally overwhelm local policing the federal police will come in. They are well organised.\n\nWhat type of leader can tackle the Nigerian problem?\n\nFormer President Ibrahim Babangida prescribed that type of leader a few months ago when he spoke. The person must be one who cares about people, is passionate about people, he must have the capacity to think progress, so he must understand the economy and understand it well, not whatever they tell him he accept and say it is so. The person has to be well known, adequately informed and respected across Nigeria and he has to be somebody who is so well networked that he can draw friends from everywhere to work together to solve problems.",

He said the essence of humanity is love of God and love of neighbour as exemplified by the sacrificial love of Jesus Christ.\n\nIn his Easter message to Nigerians and Imo people, Uzodinma said: \u201cAs clearly defined by Christ, the essence of our humanity is to love God and one another and be ready and willing to make sacrifices for the love of humanity.\u201d\n\nThe governor regretted that some politicians had allowed the quest for power and wealth to rob them of their humanity.

Alfred Adewale, called on all Nigerians to embrace the wonderful message of Easter exemplified in the selfless sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who offered himself willingly to die on the cross of Calvary in order to redeem mankind from sin and eternal damnation, stressing that such a measure of self-sacrifice for the common good is expected of everyone, particularly those in leadership positions in the country, in order to bring about genuine progress, peace and hope for the nation at this period of excruciating pain brought about by failure of leadership over the years and the dwindling economy.\n\nOn the reality of the current desperate situation in the country, he said: \u201cThe high level of insecurity is very real in our time. The brutal killings that are reported almost on a day-to-day basis create fear and panic. The most recent are the massacres in Plateau and Benue states even as violence is reported in other parts of the country. Our government must rise up to its responsibility. The hardship that our people are facing today arise from the fact that over the years, the leadership of our country has often been concerned about parochial ethnic, religious and narrow interests instead of the common good. We must realise that individual personal good, security etc. can be assured only if the good of every individual person is attained. Both leaders and people must renounce the path of selfishness and greed that we are pursuing now. If we learn to love one another as Christ loves us, then we can build a better society where all would be able to develop and grow at their own pace and actualise their God-given visions and dreams as children of God.\u201d\n\nGeneral Overseer of The Lord\u2019s Chosen Charismatic Revival Movement, Pastor Lazarus Muoka, in his message reassured Christian faithful that by the \u201cpower of Jesus Christ\u2019s resurrection today, the challenges of humanity including physical, spiritual, political and economic challenges that are distorting the progress of man shall become eradicated.\u201d\n\nThe Bishop on the Niger, Rt Reverend Dr Owen Nwokolo advised the Federal Government to tackle insecurity frontally with the creation of job opportunities for the teeming youth population who are unemployed.\n\nBishop Nwokolo argued that since the youth constituted the vibrant segment of the population, governments at all levels should double their efforts to ensure that adequate provision was made for gainful employment, skill acquisition and also enabling environment for self-employment to properly keep the youth busy.\n\nThe Bishop said with this done, the rate of security challenges would reduce drastically across the country, adding that any government that had no clear-cut, genuine and sustainable empowerment programmes for its teeming youth would always be grappling with security challenges.\n\nIn the spirit of Easter, New Nigeria People\u2019s Party (NNPP), felicitated with Christians and appealed to Nigerians to show love and remain peaceful.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of the party, Ambassador Agbo Major, in a statement yesterday urged citizens not to give up on the country because of the economic hardship and insecurity.

You must change the story of potential, the story of banditry and the story of tribalism.\n\n\u2018\u2019We as a nation can conveniently feed ourselves by being creative, visionary and committed, anybody who says we cannot, they can get out because it is voluntary. We cannot continue the lamentation of the past, we cannot continue with excuses of power failure, there is no nation that made rapid development without electricity, give us light and if we cannot be successful then you can abuse us, you cannot give us erratic light that is undependable and then blame us again that we are lazy.\n\n\u2018\u2019Nigeria it is about time, we have enough gas to fire up electricity and supply the rest of Europe and make money, long term from it.

The Eastern and Southern Africa sub-region shows sustained recovery from the recession, at 4.1 per cent in 2021, down to 3.1 per cent in 2022 and settling around 3.8 per cent in 2024.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe region\u2019s growth challenges, the World Bank report said, are rising global commodity prices, which are increasing at a faster pace since the onset of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nIt pointed out that as top world exporters of food staples \u2013 Russia and Ukraine \u2013 for a substantial share of wheat, corn and seed oil imports, all of which may be halted if the conflict persists.\n\n\n\nWhile Sub-Saharan economies are also likely to be impacted by tightening of global conditions and reduced foreign financial flows into the region, the analysis notes that the high fuel and food prices will translate into higher inflation across African countries, hurting poor and vulnerable citizens, especially those living in urban areas.\n\n\n\nThe bank cited one point of concern as the increased likelihood of civil strife as a result of food and energy-fueled inflation, particularly in the current environment of heightened political instability.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs African countries face continued uncertainty, supply disruptions and soaring food and fertilizer prices, trade policy can potentially play a key role by ensuring the free flow of food across borders throughout the region. Amid limited fiscal space, policymakers must look to innovative solutions such as reducing or waiving import duties on staple foods temporarily to provide relief to their citizens,\u201d said World Bank Chief Economist for Africa, Albert Zeufack.\n\n\n\nThe report highlighted the importance of expanding social protection programmes beyond safety nets to strengthen economic resilience and responsiveness to shocks, particularly for poor and vulnerable households.\n\nRecommendations include developing social insurance, savings and labour market programmes that contribute to economic resilience by protecting urban informal workers and help the population invest in their health and education.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n* Relatives: We will resist resumption of train services without rescuing our loved ones\n\nBennett Oghifo in Lagos and John Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nThe 68 passengers abducted by terrorists on March 28 after the bombing of an Abuja-Kaduna train are today 20 days old in the dungeon of the terrorists, with families and friends accusing the federal government and security agencies of not doing anything tangible to free them.\n\n\n\nYesterday, some relations of the abductees based in Kaduna State threatened to resist any attempt by the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) to resume the Abuja-Kaduna train services without rescuing their loved ones.\n\nThe terror attack also left eight persons dead at the scene, two others died in the hospital from gunshot injuries sustained, and with several others still nursing their wounds in hospital.\n\n\n\nThe terrorists had few days ago released a two-minute video, showing scores of abductees sitting in a forest, including men, women and children. Behind them was a group of gunmen standing in a line.\n\n\n\nOne of the abductees said in Hausa: \u201cIt is only us that know the dire situation we are in, there are women and children here; there are aged people with health challenges.\u201d\n\nIn the video, the terrorists said the government knew what they wanted, threatening to kill those in custody if their demands were not met.\n\n\n\nThe video clearly showed the abductees in anguish. Some of them are believed to be carrying bullet wounds. They are being traumatised in a forest, amid mosquitos, hash conditions and many other dangers.\n\n\n\nThere is also a pregnant woman and some children with the terrorists in the very harsh environment.\n\nSources said the abductees were made to trek for five days, resting intermittently in transit camps, before they arrived at the main camp of the attackers around Shiroro Local Government Area in Niger State.\n\n\n\nThe released Managing Director of the Bank of Agriculture, BOA, Alwan Hassan, while recounting his ordeal a few days back, said 41 women, 22 men, 5 kids were with the terrorists.\n\n\n\nThe federal government had assured that it would do everything necessary to ensure the release of those still being held hostage but families and friends of the victims said they had not seen anything concrete being done in this direction.\n\n\n\nThe families, who said the federal government and security agencies had not deemed it fit to get in touch with them, are pleading with the terrorists to allow them negotiate the release of their relations.\n\n\n\nOne of the abducted family members, Aliyu Mohammed, who spoke in Abuja last Thursday, begged the terrorists to give room for families to negotiate the release of their loved ones.\n\n\n\nMohammed said: \u201cIt is the families, and not the government, that will bear the brunt should anything untoward happen to the abductees.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlso last week, some of the victims\u2019 families staged a peaceful protest at the Radio House in Abuja, with placards appealing to the federal government to do more in ensuring that they are released.\n\n\n\nAliyu Mahmud, a relative of a seven-month pregnant woman, had said: \u201cI have my sister who is seven months pregnant with her husband. Words cannot explain what they are going through and what we are going through. Please, the government should do the needful and let this come to an end as soon as possible.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey should try as much as possible to reach out to the perpetrators and rescue our loved ones. There are children there, pregnant women, the sick, the aged and only God knows what they are going through.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhatever we do, we think of them. When we eat, we think of them. When we sleep, anything we do, we think of them. We are pleading with the government to please do the needful so that this situation will come to an end as soon as possible.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnother protester, Aminu Uthman, said: \u201cMy immediate younger brother and his wife are among the victims. It is a nightmare and the most difficult days I have had in my life. I cannot sleep or eat. A lot of things are going wrong.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe bandits called only once and they gave him the phone to speak to us. They are yet to make any request but they called to say he is with them. We voted for this government because of insecurity. We had the trust that they would address insecurity. This protest is not for the family members alone; it is for Nigerians generally. This thing can happen to anybody.\u201d\n\n\n\nSome other relatives of the kidnapped victims also met in Kaduna early in the week and accused the federal government of insensitivity towards the plight of the abductees.\n\n\n\nDr. Abdulfatai Jimoh, who led and spoke on behalf of the kidnapped relatives, said they were yet to establish contact with their loved ones or even the hoodlums since the incident on March 28, 2022.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is better for the government to go into negotiation with the terrorists as they have demanded to secure the release of our loved ones alive.\n\n\n\n\u201cSince this incident happened, we expected that by now, the government, the Nigerian Railway Corporation and the Federal Ministry of Transportation are supposed to have identified relatives of the victims to tell us what effort they are making or not to rescue our loved ones unhurt.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn fact, the primary duty of any government is to protect the lives and property of citizens. We believe our government can do it and it\u2019s capable of doing it. Until a few days ago we had been expecting telephone calls from the abductors because that\u2019s what they promised us but when we saw the video, they made it very clear that they want to discuss with the government; that they have something with the government.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what they want from the government. But it\u2019s now an opportunity and a window for the government to rescue our loved ones by opening a channel of communication with them (terrorists). This is not out of place. It is done everywhere in the world.\n\n\n\n\u201cEven the US, Israel and the most powerful nations of the world, do negotiate when they have issues like this to preserve the lives of their citizens. This, we know our government can do and we are appealing to them to do it. We don\u2019t know what is between them but it is something that can be resolved in the interest of the lives of Nigerian citizens. Life is very sacred even if it is one life that\u2019s involved.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are appealing to the Nigerian government to do everything within its powers and it is something that\u2019s not beyond the government to do.

          "text": "Stella Oduah, a Nigerian Senator and former Minister of Aviation has finalised her defection from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), SaharaReporters has gathered.\n\n\n\nOduah on August 27, 2021, left the PDP for the APC.\n\nStella Oduah\n\nA source told SaharaReporters that the Senator returned to the PDP and secretly obtained the party\u2019s nomination form to return to the Senate.\n\n\n\n\u201cSenator Stella Oduah has finally dumped the APC and moved to the PDP after days of playing hide and seek game. Having used Abubakar Malami, the AGF to frustrate and hang her trial and prosecution at the Federal High Court, Abuja before Justice Inyang Ekwo on allegations of fraud, embezzlement and siphoning of N7.9 billion when she was the Minister of Aviation,\u201d the source said.\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters on Tuesday, March 29, 2022 reported that the former aviation minister had concluded plans to dump the ruling APC for the PDP.\n\nSee Also Politics After Tricking Nigeria\u2019s Attorney General, Malami To Frustrate N7.9bn Fraud Trial, Stella Oduah Moves To Dump APC For PDP\n\nSaharaReporters reported that the Senator had held a closed-door meeting with Anyim Pius Anyim, a PDP presidential aspirant and some party leaders.\n\n\n\n\u201cShe used Senator Anyim to reach out and perfected her new arrangement and agreement with the PDP leadership preparatory to her decampment to PDP in the next few days,\u201d a source had said.\n\n\n\nThe move came a few days after Malami orchestrated different strategies to compromise and frustrate the prosecution of Oduah, who has corruption cases hanging on her neck.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe trio of Abubakar Malami, Governor Mai Mala Buni and Senator Ahmad Lawan are feeling used and dumped by Stella Oduah, having been briefed and realised that she has used them to frustrate her prosecution and betrayed their 'agreement' and 'accord' by finalising arrangements to dump APC for PDP in the next few days,\u201d the source had added.\n\nSee Also Scandal How Nigeria\u2019s Attorney General, Malami Frustrated N7.9bn Fraud Trial Of Stella Oduah After Ex-Aviation Minister Joined Ruling APC\n\nSaharaReporters exclusively reported in 2021 that Oduah\u2019s trial by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) over N7.9 billion fraud might be scuttled going by her secret plot with Senate President, Ahmad Lawan and Malami.\n\n\n\nHowever, SaharaReporters learnt on Friday that Oduah had reached out to PDP members in her zone and her town in Ogbaru Local Government Area to secure the PDP Senatorial nomination form for Anambra North zone.\n\n\n\n\u201cHaving obtained the form secretly so that the office of AGF, Abubakar Malami and also the national leadership of APC will not know that she has used them to stall and frustrate her trial before Justice Ekwo, then having achieved her aim, she has finally used and dumped them,\u201d another source confirmed to SaharaReporters on Friday.\n\n\n\n\u201clt is most disturbing and disheartening that 3 years after the EFCC (Economic and Financial Crimes Commission) concluded its investigation into the case of diversion of N7.9 billion fraud and embezzlement of public funds perpetrated by Stella Oduah, she is still evading trial and justice.\n\n\n\n\u201cShe has been summoned to enter the witness box and take her plea about five times so that the trial can commence, but Malami and Governor Mai Mala Buni (Yobe governor and former chairman of the APC caretaker committee) shielded her from justice and the long arm of the law by frustrating the case.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe same Stella Oduah has now run back to the PDP and obtained PDP nomination form.\u201d\n\nOduah is being prosecuted on 25 counts of money laundering alongside Gloria Odita, Nwobu Emmanuel Nnamdi, Chukuma Irene Chinyere, Global Offshore and Marine Limited, Crystal Television Limited, Sobora International Limited and the China Civil Engineering Construction Company Limited.\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the arraignment of the Senator was aborted at the Federal High Court in Abuja during the last adjourned date (Monday, November 22nd, 2021) over a letter written by Malami.\n\n\n\nWhen Oduah and three others were called into the dock to take their plea, counsel for the 7th and 8th defendants, Ogwu James Onoja (SAN), objected to the arraignment on the ground that his clients were being persecuted by EFCC.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, the aggrieved defendants had petitioned Malami, seeking a review of the charges against them.\n\n\n\nOgwu informed Justice Inyang Ekwo that the AGF, upon receipt of the petition, wrote the chairman of EFCC to remit the case file to his office for a review, adding that in flagrant disregard to the AGF\u2019s letter, the EFCC had bluntly refused to remit the case file to the AGF.\n\n\n\nHe tendered a certified true copy of the AGF\u2019s letter as received by the EFCC chairman and urged the court not to go ahead with the arraignment until the petition had been resolved in the interest of justice.\n\n\n\nHowever, a lawyer for the EFCC, Ofem Uket denied any knowledge of the AGF's letter, adding that as a staff member of EFCC, he was just sighting the letter for the first time in court.\n\n\n\nThe counsel urged the court to disregard the petition by the defendants and proceed to arraign them.\n\n\n\nHe said that the AGF would have come to the court if he had any opposition to the arraignment.\n\n\n\nHowever, Justice Ekwo said since the petition was raised as both a statutory and constitutional matter by the defendants, he would not proceed.\n\n\n\nOduah\u2019s planned arraignment before then in the corruption charges had been stalled five times, largely due to her absence in court.",

          "text": "Stella Oduah, a Nigerian Senator and former Minister of Aviation has finalised her defection from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), SaharaReporters has gathered.\n\n\n\nOduah on August 27, 2021, left the PDP for the APC.\n\nStella Oduah\n\nA source told SaharaReporters that the Senator returned to the PDP and secretly obtained the party\u2019s nomination form to return to the Senate.\n\n\n\n\u201cSenator Stella Oduah has finally dumped the APC and moved to the PDP after days of playing hide and seek game. Having used Abubakar Malami, the AGF to frustrate and hang her trial and prosecution at the Federal High Court, Abuja before Justice Inyang Ekwo on allegations of fraud, embezzlement and siphoning of N7.9 billion when she was the Minister of Aviation,\u201d the source said.\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters on Tuesday, March 29, 2022 reported that the former aviation minister had concluded plans to dump the ruling APC for the PDP.\n\nSee Also Politics After Tricking Nigeria\u2019s Attorney General, Malami To Frustrate N7.9bn Fraud Trial, Stella Oduah Moves To Dump APC For PDP\n\nSaharaReporters reported that the Senator had held a closed-door meeting with Anyim Pius Anyim, a PDP presidential aspirant and some party leaders.\n\n\n\n\u201cShe used Senator Anyim to reach out and perfected her new arrangement and agreement with the PDP leadership preparatory to her decampment to PDP in the next few days,\u201d a source had said.\n\n\n\nThe move came a few days after Malami orchestrated different strategies to compromise and frustrate the prosecution of Oduah, who has corruption cases hanging on her neck.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe trio of Abubakar Malami, Governor Mai Mala Buni and Senator Ahmad Lawan are feeling used and dumped by Stella Oduah, having been briefed and realised that she has used them to frustrate her prosecution and betrayed their 'agreement' and 'accord' by finalising arrangements to dump APC for PDP in the next few days,\u201d the source had added.\n\nSee Also Scandal How Nigeria\u2019s Attorney General, Malami Frustrated N7.9bn Fraud Trial Of Stella Oduah After Ex-Aviation Minister Joined Ruling APC\n\nSaharaReporters exclusively reported in 2021 that Oduah\u2019s trial by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) over N7.9 billion fraud might be scuttled going by her secret plot with Senate President, Ahmad Lawan and Malami.\n\n\n\nHowever, SaharaReporters learnt on Friday that Oduah had reached out to PDP members in her zone and her town in Ogbaru Local Government Area to secure the PDP Senatorial nomination form for Anambra North zone.\n\n\n\n\u201cHaving obtained the form secretly so that the office of AGF, Abubakar Malami and also the national leadership of APC will not know that she has used them to stall and frustrate her trial before Justice Ekwo, then having achieved her aim, she has finally used and dumped them,\u201d another source confirmed to SaharaReporters on Friday.\n\n\n\n\u201clt is most disturbing and disheartening that 3 years after the EFCC (Economic and Financial Crimes Commission) concluded its investigation into the case of diversion of N7.9 billion fraud and embezzlement of public funds perpetrated by Stella Oduah, she is still evading trial and justice.\n\n\n\n\u201cShe has been summoned to enter the witness box and take her plea about five times so that the trial can commence, but Malami and Governor Mai Mala Buni (Yobe governor and former chairman of the APC caretaker committee) shielded her from justice and the long arm of the law by frustrating the case.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe same Stella Oduah has now run back to the PDP and obtained PDP nomination form.\u201d\n\nOduah is being prosecuted on 25 counts of money laundering alongside Gloria Odita, Nwobu Emmanuel Nnamdi, Chukuma Irene Chinyere, Global Offshore and Marine Limited, Crystal Television Limited, Sobora International Limited and the China Civil Engineering Construction Company Limited.\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the arraignment of the Senator was aborted at the Federal High Court in Abuja during the last adjourned date (Monday, November 22nd, 2021) over a letter written by Malami.\n\n\n\nWhen Oduah and three others were called into the dock to take their plea, counsel for the 7th and 8th defendants, Ogwu James Onoja (SAN), objected to the arraignment on the ground that his clients were being persecuted by EFCC.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, the aggrieved defendants had petitioned Malami, seeking a review of the charges against them.\n\n\n\nOgwu informed Justice Inyang Ekwo that the AGF, upon receipt of the petition, wrote the chairman of EFCC to remit the case file to his office for a review, adding that in flagrant disregard to the AGF\u2019s letter, the EFCC had bluntly refused to remit the case file to the AGF.\n\n\n\nHe tendered a certified true copy of the AGF\u2019s letter as received by the EFCC chairman and urged the court not to go ahead with the arraignment until the petition had been resolved in the interest of justice.\n\n\n\nHowever, a lawyer for the EFCC, Ofem Uket denied any knowledge of the AGF's letter, adding that as a staff member of EFCC, he was just sighting the letter for the first time in court.\n\n\n\nThe counsel urged the court to disregard the petition by the defendants and proceed to arraign them.\n\n\n\nHe said that the AGF would have come to the court if he had any opposition to the arraignment.\n\n\n\nHowever, Justice Ekwo said since the petition was raised as both a statutory and constitutional matter by the defendants, he would not proceed.\n\n\n\nOduah\u2019s planned arraignment before then in the corruption charges had been stalled five times, largely due to her absence in court.",

          "title": "Buhari: To resign or not to resign?",
          "text": "Here we go again. On Tuesday, the Northern Elders Forum (NEF) issued a statement asking President Muhammadu Buhari to \u201cseriously consider\u201d resigning over the pervasive insecurity in the land. Several parts of the north have been experiencing devastating terror attacks, communal killings and kidnappings. The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has resumed its campaign of terror \u201cto liberate Nd\u2019Igbo from the Nigerian zoo\u201d while the middle belt is still in the grip of massacres. \u201cWe cannot continue to live and die under the dictates of killers, kidnappers, rapists and sundry criminal groups that have deprived us of our rights to live in peace and security,\u201d NEF said in its press release.\n\nThe response? \u201cThe Presidency does not wish to be drawn into the high-decibel show in the media, taking the nation by the storm from the Northern Elders Forum. Publicity is the oxygen for politicians who have failed to connect with voters in a democracy,\u201d a presidential spokesman said in a press statement. \u201cIt is enough to say from our part, that resignation call on the President is not a solution to the security problems facing the country, something that has built up to a worrisome level following decades of neglect\u2026 People don\u2019t have to destroy what is there in a desperate quest to get power.\u201d High-decibel show in the media? Security problems from decades of neglect? Wonderful.\n\nFlashback. In November, 2014, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, then spokesman for the All Progressives Congress (APC), asked President Goodluck Jonathan to resign. \u201cUnder Jonathan\u2019s watch,\u201d he said, \u201cNigerian territories are being annexed progressively by insurgents, and all that he has demonstrated so far is sheer cluelessness and incompetence. It is time for him to take responsibility and quit in the national interest, to pave the way for a leader who can lead the country to victory.\u201d As information minister, the same Lai Mohammed viciously described calls on Buhari to resign over the Zabarmari massacre of 2020 as \u201cplaying dirty politics\u201d, \u201ccheap\u201d and \u201cirresponsible\u201d.\n\nCaveat. To be sure, it was not as if APC\u2019s campaign to vote the PDP out of power in 2015 was because the Jonathan-led administration had turned Nigeria into a fortress. It was not as if Nigerians were safe and secure. Under Jonathan \u2014 lest we forget \u2014 Boko Haram bombed Abuja six times. In July 2013, they killed 42 students and teachers at a secondary school in Mamudo, Yobe state. They killed 58 schoolboys in Buni Yadi, also in Yobe, in February 2014. They kidnapped hundreds of Chibok schoolgirls. Bombings in Kano and Kaduna killed at least 400. In Zamfara, bandits killed 43 in Kizara village in June 2013 and 79 in Galadima village in April 2014. Just trying to refresh our memory.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut you know why some of us cannot stand the type of politics we play in Nigeria? It\u2019s the hypocrisy for me. When APC weaponised the insecurity to oust Jonathan from power, they did not talk about \u201cdecades of neglect\u201d. All we were told was that Jonathan was incompetent and that an APC government would keep Nigerians safe. Insecurity was one of the things APC deft used to sell its stock. If the 2015 presidential poll had not been moved by six weeks apparently to allow Jonathan regain lost ground, he would have lost to Buhari by a gap of 10 million votes rather than the eventual 2.5 million. And I am quoting estimates from Jonathan\u2019s camp in January 2015.\n\nPause. Nearly seven years of APC in power and what do we have? While Boko Haram is not the force it used to be in the north-east, the north-west has become the new epicentre of insecurity. Thousands have been killed or kidnapped in Kaduna, Zamfara, Kebbi, Sokoto and Katsina states. Niger has been fully sucked in. Plateau killings have not stopped. Benue remains a killing centre. Taraba is coming back into the gory picture. IPOB and Eastern Security Network (ESN) have made parts of the south-east a living hell. The south-west dodged a bullet when Sunday Igboho, the Yoruba militia leader, fled the country, but clashes between herders and farmers are still not over.\n\nThe PDP is now borrowing from APC\u2019s manual. At every turn of killings and kidnappings, they rush out a press statement describing Nigeria as \u201cunsafe\u201d, tagging the APC government as \u201cincompetent\u201d and asking Buhari to resign. Their latest: \u201cThis government would be coming every day to apologise to Nigerians to say \u2018we\u2019re sorry for what we\u2019ve done.\u2019 But this is a government that is arrogant in failure. They\u2019ve failed and they are still arrogant about it. They should bury their head in shame. So, because insecurity predates the APC government, does it mean because they are incompetent and rudderless and completely clueless about the issues, we should accept it?\u201d Classic tit-for-tat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd here is the tragedy of it all: many Nigerians easily get fooled by the political gimmicks of APC and PDP. Politicians must, of course, politick. That is what they do for a living. Anytime I re-read the press statements issued by Lai Mohammed as APC spokesman, I smile and shake my head. If press statements can solve problems, APC would have turned Nigeria to Japan and Singapore combined by now. We would have uninterrupted power supply, unemployment would be next to zero, and our education system would be churning out millions of geniuses daily. Ladies and gentlemen, it is all politics. That is why when I see ordinary Nigerians trading insults because of APC and PDP, I chuckle.\n\nHowever, when the NEF issued the statement asking Buhari to consider resigning, I ignored the politics of it. For sure, I know that some NEF members have sympathies for a number of PDP stalwarts and have never hidden their opposition to Buhari\u2019s government, but I was more worried about the state of the nation than their partisan sentiments. There is no doubting the fact that Buhari has done quite a lot in trying to get the security agencies to tackle the insecurity \u2014 but the plain truth, and nothing but the truth, is that the terrorists and other criminal elements are not relenting. Nigerians are panicking. They just want to be safe and feel safe. The rest is details.\n\nBut will Buhari\u2019s resignation solve the problem? That is what we should be discussing. APC told us if Jonathan resigned or if we voted out PDP, Nigerians would be secure. Is that the case today? Now PDP is telling us if Buhari resigns or if we vote out APC, Nigerians would be safe. Why should we believe either of them that resignation is the antidote? I think we who are not sold to partisan sentiments should re-focus the debate and expend our energies more into diagnosing what the real issues are and proffering workable solutions. Politicians have to politick for electoral gain, but everything cannot be politics and politics cannot be everything. What, then, is the real problem?\n\nThe major point I took away from presidency\u2019s response to NEF is that we are suffering from \u201cdecades of neglect\u201d. When Jonathan made the same point in 2010 and said we needed to build a \u201csecurity architecture\u201d to be able to address the challenges, it did not sell. The fact, at least from my view, is that Nigeria has been in the grip of worsening insecurity since the return to democracy in 1999. Things have only been changing shape but they have kept worsening over time. Under President Olusegun Obasanjo, ethnic, communal and religious riots led to tens of thousands of deaths. I also remember Bakassi Boys were burning people alive in broad daylight in the south-east.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI recall Prof Wole Soyinka saying in 2001 that the sudden burst of violence could be traced to suppressed agitations under military rule which had now found expression in a democracy. Riots and killings did not stop when Obasanjo left and President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua came in. Jos North went on fire again, with over 700 killed as Berom and Fulani communities clashed in November 2008. In July 2009, a crackdown on Boko Haram members and the resultant resistance led to the death of thousands of people in Bauchi, Maiduguri, Potiskum and Wudil. That was the first recorded mass bloodbath in the war against Boko Haram, which had not been classified a terrorist group then.\n\nThe call for Buhari to resign does not excite me because I would rather take a holistic view of the entire gamut. In any case, asking him to resign is just soundbite: he will not. I doubt any Nigerian president would resign, whether from APC or PDP. Moreover, if changing presidents was the solution, how come we are still where we are? Since 1999, presidents have come and gone. Political parties have come and gone. We have spent billions upon billions of dollars on security. We have acquired arms. We have announced to the world several times that we are winning. Yet, we have seen the security situation deteriorate progressively and regressively. Are we missing something?\n\nWhat exactly is the problem? Are we being blindsided by politics? Is there a fundamental defect in the security architecture? Is it a problem of strategy? Is it a problem of equipment? Is it a problem of personnel? Is it corruption? I hear people argue that having state police is the way out. Maybe they have a point. But has there been any time the federal police were asked to tackle criminals and they said they wouldn\u2019t do it because they were not state police? More so, there is an assumption that states run things better, but I wouldn\u2019t say state universities, state hospitals and council elections are better managed. Yes, we need state police \u2014 but can they tackle Boko Haram and ISWAP?\n\nFrom experience, Buhari\u2019s resignation would not put an end to ISWAP/Boko Haram attacks, kidnappings, ethno-religious killings and massacres. But he is the president: the buck stops at his desk. He was not elected to make excuses. If we did not take excuses from Jonathan, then we cannot take from Buhari. The president has to buckle up and double his efforts. However, there\u2019s a deeper issue of state capacity that we are yet to get a grip of. Something is just not working. We would keep changing parties and presidents and nothing would change until we get to the root of it. I wish I had the answers. God forbid that in 2024, we will start saying \u201cthings were not this bad under Buhari\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAND FOUR OTHER THINGS\u2026\n\nFOR ABBA KYARI\n\nExactly two years today, Mallam Abba Kyari, former chief of staff to President Muhammadu Buhari, died from COVID-19 complications. He was fiercely loyal to his boss till the very last minute of his life. There was wild jubilation in the camp of those who said he was Nigeria\u2019s biggest problem. Only God knows how many things would have been pinned on his head if he were still alive. Some of the monsters that were assembled to destroy him in the media have now turned on their paymasters and enablers. My greatest pain is that Kyari \u2014 who never owned a house in Abuja and gave up his only property in Maiduguri for IDPs \u2014 will never be able to tell the story of stewardship. Shame.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFOR OSINACHI NWACHUKWU\n\nWhen Osinachi Nwachukwu, the gospel singer, died a week ago, we were initially told it was from complications of throat cancer. However, horrible stories of domestic abuse started coming out. It is imperative for the police to establish the facts and do justice. Government must also step up action against domestic abuse. Our clerics need to play a more active role. We spiritualise everything. Our culture tells women to take whatever they see in their matrimonial homes as \u201cnormal\u201d. No, violence is not normal. Osinachi, a much-loved singer, featured in the soulful song, \u2018Ekwueme\u2019, in 2017, which has garnered over 71 million views on YouTube. May God comfort her loved ones. Condolences.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFOR DARIYE, NYAME\n\nPresident Buhari came to power in 2015 vowing to fight corruption. This was what Nigerians wanted to hear after what they thought was the worst episode of looting in our history. Before Buhari, the EFCC hardly secured convictions against ex-governors. However, Chief Joshua Dariye and Rev Jolly Nyame, former governors of Plateau and Taraba respectively, were jailed and the Buhari government showcased that as its success story. Buhari has now granted the duo presidential pardon after making a request to the advisory Council of State. It would be a fitting climax to the story of Buhari\u2019s anti-graft war if he goes on to give Dariye and Nyame national honours. Unravelling.\n\nRWANDA BY AIR\n\nThe UK has come under criticism for deciding to ship asylum seekers to Rwanda while processing their applications. Initially, only aspiring male immigrants will be sent to Rwanda. I understand what the UK government is trying to do: people smugglers who collect thousands of pounds to help them sail by boat to Europe in search of asylum can now be contained. Would-be immigrants will now know that sailing illegally to the UK does not mean automatic entry. The UN refugee agency says the policy is against international law. Activists say it is inhuman. Given that 3,000 people drowned last year trying to cross over by sea, we need a permanent solution and something must give. Dilemma.",

There is no doubting the fact that Buhari has done quite a lot in trying to get the security agencies to tackle the insecurity \u2014 but the plain truth, and nothing but the truth, is that the terrorists and other criminal elements are not relenting. Nigerians are panicking. They just want to be safe and feel safe. The rest is details.\n\nBut will Buhari\u2019s resignation solve the problem? That is what we should be discussing. APC told us if Jonathan resigned or if we voted out PDP, Nigerians would be secure. Is that the case today? Now PDP is telling us if Buhari resigns or if we vote out APC, Nigerians would be safe. Why should we believe either of them that resignation is the antidote? I think we who are not sold to partisan sentiments should re-focus the debate and expend our energies more into diagnosing what the real issues are and proffering workable solutions. Politicians have to politick for electoral gain, but everything cannot be politics and politics cannot be everything. What, then, is the real problem?\n\nThe major point I took away from presidency\u2019s response to NEF is that we are suffering from \u201cdecades of neglect\u201d. When Jonathan made the same point in 2010 and said we needed to build a \u201csecurity architecture\u201d to be able to address the challenges, it did not sell. The fact, at least from my view, is that Nigeria has been in the grip of worsening insecurity since the return to democracy in 1999. Things have only been changing shape but they have kept worsening over time. Under President Olusegun Obasanjo, ethnic, communal and religious riots led to tens of thousands of deaths. I also remember Bakassi Boys were burning people alive in broad daylight in the south-east.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI recall Prof Wole Soyinka saying in 2001 that the sudden burst of violence could be traced to suppressed agitations under military rule which had now found expression in a democracy. Riots and killings did not stop when Obasanjo left and President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua came in. Jos North went on fire again, with over 700 killed as Berom and Fulani communities clashed in November 2008. In July 2009, a crackdown on Boko Haram members and the resultant resistance led to the death of thousands of people in Bauchi, Maiduguri, Potiskum and Wudil. That was the first recorded mass bloodbath in the war against Boko Haram, which had not been classified a terrorist group then.\n\nThe call for Buhari to resign does not excite me because I would rather take a holistic view of the entire gamut. In any case, asking him to resign is just soundbite: he will not. I doubt any Nigerian president would resign, whether from APC or PDP. Moreover, if changing presidents was the solution, how come we are still where we are? Since 1999, presidents have come and gone. Political parties have come and gone. We have spent billions upon billions of dollars on security. We have acquired arms. We have announced to the world several times that we are winning. Yet, we have seen the security situation deteriorate progressively and regressively. Are we missing something?\n\nWhat exactly is the problem? Are we being blindsided by politics? Is there a fundamental defect in the security architecture? Is it a problem of strategy? Is it a problem of equipment? Is it a problem of personnel? Is it corruption? I hear people argue that having state police is the way out. Maybe they have a point. But has there been any time the federal police were asked to tackle criminals and they said they wouldn\u2019t do it because they were not state police? More so, there is an assumption that states run things better, but I wouldn\u2019t say state universities, state hospitals and council elections are better managed. Yes, we need state police \u2014 but can they tackle Boko Haram and ISWAP?\n\nFrom experience, Buhari\u2019s resignation would not put an end to ISWAP/Boko Haram attacks, kidnappings, ethno-religious killings and massacres. But he is the president: the buck stops at his desk. He was not elected to make excuses. If we did not take excuses from Jonathan, then we cannot take from Buhari. The president has to buckle up and double his efforts. However, there\u2019s a deeper issue of state capacity that we are yet to get a grip of. Something is just not working. We would keep changing parties and presidents and nothing would change until we get to the root of it. I wish I had the answers. God forbid that in 2024, we will start saying \u201cthings were not this bad under Buhari\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAND FOUR OTHER THINGS\u2026\n\nFOR ABBA KYARI\n\nExactly two years today, Mallam Abba Kyari, former chief of staff to President Muhammadu Buhari, died from COVID-19 complications. He was fiercely loyal to his boss till the very last minute of his life. There was wild jubilation in the camp of those who said he was Nigeria\u2019s biggest problem. Only God knows how many things would have been pinned on his head if he were still alive. Some of the monsters that were assembled to destroy him in the media have now turned on their paymasters and enablers. My greatest pain is that Kyari \u2014 who never owned a house in Abuja and gave up his only property in Maiduguri for IDPs \u2014 will never be able to tell the story of stewardship. Shame.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFOR OSINACHI NWACHUKWU\n\nWhen Osinachi Nwachukwu, the gospel singer, died a week ago, we were initially told it was from complications of throat cancer. However, horrible stories of domestic abuse started coming out. It is imperative for the police to establish the facts and do justice. Government must also step up action against domestic abuse. Our clerics need to play a more active role. We spiritualise everything. Our culture tells women to take whatever they see in their matrimonial homes as \u201cnormal\u201d. No, violence is not normal. Osinachi, a much-loved singer, featured in the soulful song, \u2018Ekwueme\u2019, in 2017, which has garnered over 71 million views on YouTube. May God comfort her loved ones. Condolences.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFOR DARIYE, NYAME\n\nPresident Buhari came to power in 2015 vowing to fight corruption. This was what Nigerians wanted to hear after what they thought was the worst episode of looting in our history. Before Buhari, the EFCC hardly secured convictions against ex-governors. However, Chief Joshua Dariye and Rev Jolly Nyame, former governors of Plateau and Taraba respectively, were jailed and the Buhari government showcased that as its success story. Buhari has now granted the duo presidential pardon after making a request to the advisory Council of State. It would be a fitting climax to the story of Buhari\u2019s anti-graft war if he goes on to give Dariye and Nyame national honours. Unravelling.\n\nRWANDA BY AIR\n\nThe UK has come under criticism for deciding to ship asylum seekers to Rwanda while processing their applications. Initially, only aspiring male immigrants will be sent to Rwanda. I understand what the UK government is trying to do: people smugglers who collect thousands of pounds to help them sail by boat to Europe in search of asylum can now be contained. Would-be immigrants will now know that sailing illegally to the UK does not mean automatic entry. The UN refugee agency says the policy is against international law. Activists say it is inhuman. Given that 3,000 people drowned last year trying to cross over by sea, we need a permanent solution and something must give. Dilemma.",

          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time.

          "title": "Digital Nomads: Julian Owusu\u2019s journey from football to fintech",
          "text": "\u201cPeople don\u2019t know me as a footballer anymore. I\u2019m no longer defined by the game. This, along with the fact that I can build products that real people are using, is a true mark of success.\u201d\n\nAt 14, UK-born Ghanaian Julian Owusu discovered a talent that would earn him money: playing football.\n\nIt\u2019s a dream many young boys have, to gain global recognition and wealth doing something they enjoy, a sport watched by over 1.1 billion people across the world. While football might not be one of the top 20 paying professions in the world, it is the fifth-highest paid sports profession, with pro players getting an average of $3.6 million yearly.\n\nEven though football held a promising future for Julian, it was only one of his dreams. \u201cI grew up playing football,\u201d he says, \u201cBut I\u2019ve always been interested in tech, even long before I started playing professionally.\u201d\n\nAt the beginning of his football career, Julian knew he wanted to tell a different story with his journey. \u201cMost of the other footballers I know have the same story, whether they were rich or poor. They don\u2019t know what else to do when they\u2019re not practising or playing. They don\u2019t know where or if they belong outside the field. I wanted to be different.\u201d\n\nHe started his professional journey at 16 when he joined Eleven Wise\u2014a Division One football league club based in Ghana\u2014as a striker. Julian had joined the club on the recommendation of his agent who thought he would benefit from the club\u2019s rigorous training. \u201cIt was actually my first solo trip to Ghana,\u201d he says. \u201cMy folks had brought me over every year, but coming down to join Eleven Wise was the first time I\u2019d be in Ghana on my own. And I think that trip is really what helped me build my entrepreneurial spirit.\u201d\n\nHe had to forget his UK background and immerse himself in Ghana\u2019s culture. \u201cI had to understand local cultures and become like my teammates. I had to understand what the fans wanted, and what my coaches wanted. So I learned a lot of lessons very quickly about becoming a professional and just having a professional mindset.\u201d\n\nUpon completion of his one-year contract with Eleven Wise, Julian moved to Berekum Chelsea, a premier league club out of Ghana, in 2010 where he helped the team score several goals including the 2010\u20132011 Ghana Premier League cup\u2014the youngest team ever to win the cup\u2014the MTN FA Cup, and the 2011 Ghana\u2019s President\u2019s Cup.\n\nFrom Berekum Chelsea, he glided through other clubs, from Hayes and Yeading United, to Burnham, right until 2014 when he decided to retire.\n\nWhen football players on defining paths, such as Julian, retire, it\u2019s often because of injury. Like in most contact sports, football players are exposed to more than their fair share of harm including muscle sprains and toe fractures.\n\nJulian\u2019s retirement, however, had nothing to do with injury, age, or scandal. He simply wanted to be more.\n\n\u201cI was on holiday one year, writing and thinking through what I wanted to become,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI wondered what I wanted to be when I was in my 30s, 40s, 50s or 60s, and I realised that football wasn\u2019t the only thing I wanted to do.\u201d\n\nHe needed to build knowledge in an industry that could set him up for success, and so he decided to return to school, a transition he didn\u2019t find so difficult, he says. \u201cIt was difficult at the beginning, but all the skills I\u2019d learnt playing football were transferrable. I knew how to work hard. The only reason it was difficult at the start wasn\u2019t because I was studying. It was more because I wasn\u2019t training or going to play a match.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, enrolled at the London School of Business and Management, Julian got introduced to digital product management by executing the website for the New Student Union. But he didn\u2019t fall in love with the field until 2 years later when he landed a product management role at Landon and Fitch, a London-based advertising firm. \u201cIn my first role, I was only managing the teams and scope, and I wanted more. At Landon and Fitch, though, I got hands-on experience with building and ideating, and that\u2019s where everything clicked into place and I knew it was what I would continue doing. There\u2019s something beautiful about the process of taking something from an idea, bringing it to life and seeing real people use it.\u201d\n\nFrom his product management role at Landor & Fitch in 2018, Julian went on to manage other products at Culturetool and Spark44, right until he decided to build a product of his own: Zuberi Pay.\n\nThe idea for Zuberi came to Julian as he drove through the streets of London. \u201cI wasn\u2019t even thinking of building a fintech. I just wanted to tackle a problem every day people had. And when I thought about what problems 90% of people had, it was cash flow, money!\u201d\n\nWhile the product was officially released for beta-testing in January 2021, Zuberi started operation right around the time COVID went mainstream in February 2020. Julian added 10 workers to a WhatsApp group and explained his idea to them: Zuberi would provide them with salary advances, for a small interest fee.\n\nZuberi\u2019s app interface\n\nWithin a few months, the number of people who\u2019d joined the group doubled. He was providing 30 people with advances, using everyday tools like WhatsApp for communication, Excel for data collection, and Taptap Send to transfer payment. \u201cWhen I thought about how much I was doing just on WhatsApp and Excel, I realised that I could learn more and expand better with an app. So I started pitching to investors.\u201d\n\nMonths later, he\u2019d raised about \u00a322,000 ($28,700) from friends and family to build the first iteration of the Zuberi App. At that time, he also brought on as co-founder Nana Adomako\u2014who worked as the Growth Manager for Taptap Send.\n\nBy December 2021, Julian quit his 9\u20135 as a product manager and moved to Ghana to focus on and lead the vision of Zuberi. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be a founder of a startup,\u201d he says, \u201cI think the best role is probably to be a product manager because you\u2019re basically the CEO of the product and you get to know the ins and outs of what you\u2019re building.\u201d\n\nWhile Zuberi is still in its early stages and available to only a select group of users, it has thousands of Ghanaians on its waitlist. \u201cWe are still sorting out regulation and yet to fully launch. We\u2019re working with the Bank of Ghana to get Zuberi up as soon as possible so people can access its benefits.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about his fears, Julian says he has none, even though he\u2019s earning significantly less as a CEO, compared to when he was a footballer or a product manager. \u201cI think I could probably play again if I wanted to, but I\u2019m not interested. I\u2019ve found my calling. Here, I\u2019m building value, actual value I can see in people\u2019s lives. I might not be earning as much but I\u2019m not high-maintenance. As long as I can provide for my family, then that\u2019s all that really matters.\u201d\n\nDigital Nomads is a weekly column on TechCabal where we explore the everyday lives of Africans who leave their home countries to study or work elsewhere, and Africans who leave their conventional jobs for new professions in tech.

          "title": "In the wake of explosive accusations against Africa\u2019s most valuable startup, Flutterwave co-founder speaks",
          "text": "Former CEO of Africa\u2019s most valuable startup Flutterwave, Iyinoluwa Aboyeji, has responded to the recent allegations of fraud and insider trading levelled against the company\u2019s management and current CEO and co-founder, Olugbenga Agboola.\n\nThe accusations were laid out in an article by David Hundeyin, and a Medium post by Clara Wanjiku.\n\nWhile both Wanjiku and Hundeyin\u2019s articles raised important questions about the culture, ethics, and governance at Flutterwave, Aboyeji claims no privileged insight into the company after his time there. He however addressed concerns raised about things that happened while he was CEO of the payment giant.\n\nOne of the many actions Agboola was accused of was creating a ghost \u201cco-founder\u201d identity, who went by the name Greg, to give himself more shares, in the company\u2019s early days. To this, Aboyeji told TechCabal that the agreement between the co-founders was that Agboola would hold some shares in trust for the fictitious Greg.\n\n\u201cWhen I joined the company, I was told there\u2019s a chief technology officer named Greg, who\u2019s from MIT, whom I\u2019d meet someday. It never happened,\u201d Aboyeji said. \u201cAfter a while, it became clear what had happened. By that time it didn\u2019t matter. We [Aboyeji and third co-founder Adeleke Adekoya] had already signed agreements, and I decided to just move on.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, on Wednesday, April 13, Aboyeji had put out a series of tweets, aimed at distancing himself from any involvement in the allegations levelled at Agboola and Flutterwave. He said, in one of them, that some of the allegations made could prevent him from being a company director, and thus affect his livelihood.\n\nHe also said that Hundeyin, the article\u2019s author, didn\u2019t reach out to him for comment.\n\nThe article alleged that Agboola did not resign from his job as Head of Digital Factory and Innovation at Access Bank before working at Flutterwave. It said Aboyeji had been a co-conspirator who had testified, alongside Agboola and Access Bank CEO Herbert Wigwe, before the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), under oath, that Agboola never worked simultaneously at Flutterwave and Access Bank.\n\nAboyeji\u2019s time as CEO\n\nLaunched in 2016 as a Nigerian and US-based payments company, with offices in Lagos and San Francisco, Flutterwave was co-founded by Agboola, Adekoya, and Aboyeji, who had earlier co-founded Andela. TechCabal obtained a copy of Flutterwave\u2019s US certificate of incorporation, prepared by Aboyeji on May 2, 2016.\n\nFlutterwave started when Aboyeji met the other co-founders Agboola and Adekoya while still at Andela.\n\nAccess Bank had hired an engineer from Andela to work on a product that later turned out to be PayWithCapture, a mobile payment solution that permitted customers to make payments by scanning a merchant\u2019s pre-generated QR code using their phone cameras.\n\nAfter a series of conversations about the African payment landscape, Aboyeji, Agboola, and Adekoya teamed up to start Flutterwave, to solve the challenges with African payment. Agboola and Adekoya had the ideas; Aboyeji came on board to execute.\n\nIn the early days of Flutterwave, the co-founders were still working at their previous jobs. Aboyeji explained that although the trio had agreed to a transition timeline towards working on Flutterwave full-time, there were challenges with adhering to that timeline. Flutterwave investors were made aware that Agboola and Adekoya had transitioned from working for the bank to consulting for the Africa Fintech Foundry through an investor update.\n\n\u201cMy co-founders informed me that they\u2019ve resigned from Access Bank, but they had to give some notice to the bank, and since they were handling sensitive positions at Access Bank, what ended up happening was they became consultants to Africa Fintech Foundry,\u201d Aboyeji said. Africa Fintech Foundry is an initiative by Access Bank that nurtures and accelerates the growth of fintech startups in Africa.\n\nAboyeji described the relationship between Access Bank and Flutterwave as a mutually beneficial one. Access Bank was the budding fintech\u2019s banking partner and Flutterwave helped introduce the bank to its Silicon Valley network.\n\nHe also disclosed that, early on, when the company started, there were ongoing conversations with Access Bank to invest in Flutterwave, but due to Nigerian banking regulations that prohibited banks from getting involved in non-banking activities, the deal couldn\u2019t happen.\n\n\u201cThe foundation of Flutterwave was as a result of the collaboration between a bank and the local tech ecosystem. I think that\u2019s an incredible learning opportunity,\u201d Aboyeji said.\n\nTechCabal has reached out to Access Bank to comment on their relationship with Flutterwave\u2019s founders but hasn\u2019t gotten a response as of press time.\n\nSEC investigation\n\nIn an investor update obtained by TechCabal, covering Flutterwave\u2019s activities from May 2016 to June 2017, Flutterwave\u2019s investors were informed that the SEC had opened an investigation into the company and its investors.\n\nAs seen in a legal brief by Orrick, a US law firm, Flutterwave had 85 investors, and there was concern that some of them were not qualified to be investors under US law.\n\n\u201cTo invest in a startup in the US, you have to be a US resident, an international investor who can claim to be a Reg S investor or a close family, friend, or employee of founders,\u201d Aboyeji said. \u201cThe SEC were concerned about whether we had followed the right process in making sure the investors were accredited. We proved that every investor was profiled and qualified under the required exemptions.\u201d\n\nAfter the SEC\u2019s initial enquiries, further investigation on Flutterwave, as related to this matter was closed, according to a letter from the SEC dated September 28, 2017. There was no other investigation made by the SEC outside of this incident during his tenure as CEO, according to Aboyeji.\n\nChange of name\n\nAfter the initial fictitious Greg co-founder incident, there were accusations of instances where Agboola often changed his first name to Greg when communicating with external parties.\n\nAboyeji acknowledged being aware of this happening on a few occasions, stating that it sometimes happened when Agboola, who was already well known as an Access Bank employee\u2014but now with Flutterwave\u2014needed to engage with other banks.\n\n\u201cThat was the context to which I understood him using Greg. Otherwise, as a result of the hostility among banks, other banks can just say, \u2018You\u2019re from Access Bank, we will not use you.\u2019 While we\u2019re not Access Bank. We\u2019re Flutterwave,\u201d Aboyeji said.\n\nExiting Flutterwave\n\nIn October 2018, when the news broke out that Aboyeji was stepping down from his role as Flutterwave CEO, there were rumours that all wasn\u2019t well, and that he had been fired. Aboyeji explained to TechCabal that his departure was due to differing opinions with Agboola on how the company should be run.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very simple. GB [Agboola] and I started butting heads,\u201d Aboyeji said. \u201cHe wanted input on things that I felt were my responsibilities, and he didn\u2019t want input on things he felt were his responsibilities. And I said there can\u2019t be two captains of this ship.\u201d\n\nBy mid-September 2018, during a board meeting, Aboyeji stated that he wanted to leave the company and suggested that Agboola, who was then Chief Product Officer, be brought in as a product-focused CEO.\n\nAboyeji offered to leave Flutterwave within 6 months, to allow for a smooth transition. But the board said that there was no need for that, suggesting he could hand over immediately.\n\n\u201cI thought it was rather sudden, but I agreed because I already wanted to leave,\u201d Aboyeji said.\n\nAfter a few weeks of negotiating the terms of his exit, on October 12, 2018, Aboyeji sent an email announcing his decision to resign as CEO and board member at Flutterwave. A copy of this email was shared with TechCabal.\n\nAboyeji maintains that his exit followed due process and that he currently doesn\u2019t own a stake in the company; he also insists he wasn\u2019t forced to sell his shares at a lower price.\n\n\u201cHow can someone force me to do that? I didn\u2019t sell my shares to GB [Agboola]. I sold my shares to a third party. I fully exited Flutterwave at the $1 billion valuation round last year.\u201d\n\nAboyeji also shared his thoughts on past Flutterwave employee Clara Wanjiku\u2019s recent account of Flutterwave neglecting to remove her as the contact person on their M-Pesa account, resulting in the police hounding Wanjiku and her family after the account recorded a fraudulent transaction.\n\nHe said he doesn\u2019t think it was intentional. Based on his experience, the company\u2019s negligence was due to not having a process to properly off-board employees when they leave.\n\n\u201cI kept getting Flutterwave bank alerts for over a year after I left,\u201d Aboyeji said. \u201cI\u2019ve run into trouble with the authorities because Flutterwave still had me listed as a point of contact, long after I left.\u201d\n\nThese allegations come 2 months after Flutterwave raised $250 million in a Series D round that tripled the company\u2019s valuation to over $3 billion in just 12 months.\n\nCommenting on the allegations raised in Hundeyin\u2019s article, Flutterwave shared this response with TechCabal:\n\n\u201cThe blog post in question is based on recycled and previously addressed claims, and several others that are false. As part of our commitment to operating an ethically responsible company in compliance with all applicable laws, we take all claims of this nature seriously, and are conducting a thorough review. We will take action as and when appropriate. This enables us to maintain the highest workplace standards and remain focused on our mission to create financial possibilities for companies and consumers across Africa.\u201d\n\nLed by Agboola, Flutterwave has grown to become a beacon of success in the African tech ecosystem, with Agboola seen as not just a successful entrepreneur but a notable investor in the African startup space.\n\nIn its last fundraising announcement in February, the company revealed that 900,000 businesses globally use Flutterwave to process payments, in 150 currencies, up from 290,000 businesses, as at March 2021. This threefold increase means that the African payment giant has now processed 140 million transactions worth more than $9 billion since its inception.\n\nUpdates: Flutterwave\u2019s response to the allegations were added to this story by 11:00 PM GMT+1 on April 16, 2022\n\n\n\nFlutterwave is an advertiser with and sponsor of several TechCabal properties. Future Africa, which Iyin Aboyeji leads, and Gbenga Agboola, Flutterwave CEO, are investors in Big Cabal Media, parent company of TechCabal.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

From allegations against Flutterwave\u2019s CEO to MTN getting final approval for its Payment Service Bank to NFT being the new oil, it\u2019s been an eventful week!\n\nTo get a recap or knowledge of what happened, click here to read and here to listen.\n\nFor me, this week has been eventful due to the obvious \u2014 this newsletter. Although eventful, it has been overwhelming.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs someone with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), I knew the first few days would be that way. But, it hasn\u2019t been easy! And honestly, I\u2019ve been looking forward to today.\n\nSo, aside from the fact that it\u2019s Good Friday, I must say that it will be a good one for me because I\u2019ll get plenty of rest and possibly watch some Netflix and chill.\n\nBy the way, I\u2019m available for enjoyment this weekend! If you\u2019re interested, please get in touch with me. Nobody will know. \ud83d\ude05\n\nOkay, jokes apart, how was your week? I believe it was less stressful. If it wasn\u2019t, I think the weekend would be because it is a public holiday. \ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude0a So you have the entire day and weekend to rest and be taken care of.\n\nToday, being a good Good Friday, I\u2019ll be talking about the following:\n\nDriving financial inclusion with embedded finance\n\nUber\u2019s operation suspension in Tanzania\n\nOPay Egypt\u2019s preliminary approval\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year, Techpoint Africa is organising the Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit, where you can learn the basics of Web3 and discover how to build a career in Web3 and blockchain.\n\nThe Blockchain Summit will be held on May 21, 2022, at Four Points by Sheraton, Victoria Island, Lagos. To register, please, click here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDriving financial inclusion with embedded finance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast month, I wanted to get a phone for someone, so I decided to go to a store \u2014 after comparing prices on Jumia and CDcare.\n\nHowever, when I got there, I discovered the phone was more expensive than I had anticipated, and for the first ten minutes, I was blank. I couldn\u2019t think.\n\nI guess the salesperson suspected what was wrong. So, she informed me that I didn\u2019t have to pay upfront and I could spread out my payments over six months or so.\n\nBut I was surprised because I didn\u2019t expect a physical retail electronic store to offer such a financial service.\n\nWhat is the service? The store integrates financial services into its non-financial platform \u2014 essentially embedded finance.\n\nIn simpler words, embedded finance is the use of financial tools or services \u2013 like lending or payment processing \u2013 by a non-financial institution.\n\nConsequently, embedded finance enables customers to obtain financial assistance through a third-party app. Embedded finance plans to simplify financial processes for consumers, making it easier for them to get the services they need when they need them.\n\nThe big question is: Can embedded finance drive financial inclusion in Nigeria? Click on the link to find out.\n\nUber Tanzania suspends operations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYesterday, Thursday, April 14, 2022, ride-hailing company, Uber, suspended operations in Tanzania until further notice after six years in the country.\n\nUber announced the decision in a statement sent to customers across the country, noting that they will not operate in Tanzania until an agreement with the authorities is reached.\n\nWhy the suspension? Uber is suspending operations in Tanzania after the country\u2019s Land Transport Regulatory Authority (LATRA) \u2014 an authority that establishes and approves fares for ride-hailing operators \u2014 approved higher fares as fuel prices reached an all-time high.\n\nA look into the increase: The new fare represents a 50% increase over the previous fare per km. Essentially, its original fare of TSh450/km ($0.19/km) has been raised to TSh900/km ($0.39).\n\nIs this similar? Yeah, it is. Recall that in May 2021, the company increased its fares in Kenya and Nigeria in response to driver demand for a larger share of commissions to offset increased operating costs.\n\nConsequently, it raised its motorcycle ride and delivery services in Kenya by 15%, while ChapChap \u2013 a ride option that allows riders going in the same direction to share a ride if they find a match \u2013 riders will pay an extra KSh 3 ($ 0.03) per kilometre. This followed Uber\u2019s unveiling of electric motorcycles and scooters in Kenya.\n\nIn Nigeria, Uber increased rates on its UberX platform by 13% in Lagos and 20% in Nigeria\u2019s capital, Abuja.\n\nWhat\u2019s the company saying? In the same statement, Uber stated that current transportation regulations had created an unfriendly environment, which has posed a challenge to their business.\n\nMeanwhile, LATRA stated in a March 14, 2022 order that the ride-hailing services fares were approved \u201cin an effort to maintain competition and affordable ride-hailing taxi services.\u201d\n\nHowever, Tanzania\u2019s ride-hailing operators do not perceive LATRA as a regulatory body that promotes competition and low-cost taxi services. Rather, they accuse LATRA of assuming a dictating role by doubling market rates.\n\nAlso, it is accused of regularly threatening to revoke operator licenses, thereby creating an uncertain and hostile business environment.\n\nQuick note: Did you know that Uber launched UberMoto, its on-demand motorbike service in Ibadan, Nigeria, in January 2022 to compete with SafeBoda, MAX.ng, and Gokada?\n\nTake a look at it here: Uber\u2019s gamble on Nigerian motorbikes\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort. Since then, 95 companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, about half of which are financial services providers, and 51 are from Nigeria.\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s data and research arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, has partnered with YC to examine the impact of the California-based startup accelerator on the continent. The report will be released soon.

OPay Egypt, a fintech and electronic payments company, has announced that the Central Bank of Egypt has given it preliminary approval to issue prepaid cards via its OPay app.\n\nWhat does this mean? It means that OPay cards will be linked to OPay\u2019s mobile app, allowing users to request the issuance or cancellation of prepaid cards.\n\nAccording to Hesham Ezz El-Din, Digital & Cards Business Director at OPay Egypt, prepaid cards will assist them in reaching a non-cash society in light of The Central Bank of Egypt\u2019s strategy and the Egyptian state\u2019s directive.\n\nThe prepaid cards will be distributed in collaboration with Egyptian Cards Company, the largest card distributor in the local and regional markets.\n\nWhat is the company hoping to accomplish with this? OPay Egypt aims to provide all electronic payment solutions in the local market.\n\nHow? Customers will be able to deposit money into the cards and then use them for cash withdrawals and purchases without opening a bank account. These cards offer OPay customers a wide range of services to meet their financial and payment needs.\n\nLastly, Ezz El-Din stated that they are working hard to strengthen their presence in the local Egyptian market through this new offering and supporting their customers through an inclusive system that aids in driving forward digital transformation and financial inclusion.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nNestcoin is hiring an Associate UX Researcher.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2017, African eCommerce giant, Jumia, launched JumiaPay, its mobile money option, five years after it had first launched. In a statement on its launch, then co-CEO Jeremy Hodara said the objective was to \u201cprovide a safe, secure and convenient shopping experience to our customers.\u201d\n\nWhile novel in Africa at the time, the model has since been adopted by Nigerian startups as they attempt to capture more market share. If you\u2019re wondering what this model is, it is embedded finance.\n\nAn embedded finance play involves a company, usually not a financial institution, offering a financial service in addition to its existing offers.\n\nFor example, a fashion eCommerce startup could add a wallet that users can use for payments, a lending feature that lets them get loans or an insurance feature to insure expensive purchases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor businesses, the benefits are massive. Using our previous example, the eCommerce startup could witness fewer cart abandonments if customers do not have to use external payment methods. They could also see more people buy from them due to the lending feature.\n\nOn the other hand, customers experience ease while using different services and could get access to products they may have been unable to afford previously. Whichever way you look at it, embedded finance seems like a good deal for everyone involved, so how does that affect financial inclusion in Nigeria?\n\nAccording to the World Bank, financial inclusion means that businesses and individuals have access to financial products and services that meet their needs responsibly and sustainably.\n\nThese needs include the ability to save, make payments, access loans, and get insurance. In a 2021 EFInA study, only 45% of Nigerians had a bank account, with the majority of them living in urban areas.\n\n71% of urban adults have a bank account compared to 40% in rural areas. This disparity also shows in the gender of bank account holders, with 57% of men having bank accounts compared to 45% of women.\n\nOne of the reasons for the inability of Nigerians to open bank accounts is the hassles of getting a Bank Verification Number (BVN). Currently, only banks that are often absent in rural areas can assign BVNs.\n\nPer the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS), only 54,169,047 Nigerians have a BVN. While the CBN has launched BVN 2.0 to cater to people who don\u2019t have all the basic requirements, numerous Nigerians are still unable to get one.\n\nWith more than half of Nigerians under 18, this figure suggests that over 40% of Nigerians are excluded from using financial services. However, considering financial inclusion can be achieved in other ways besides using a bank account, this may not be an accurate representation of financial inclusion in Nigeria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy integrating financial services into non-financial solutions, more Nigerians can be integrated into the financial system without requiring a bank account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "title": "Is Flutterwave\u2019s CEO guilty of insider trading or not?",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nYesterday, I incorrectly stated that Flutterwave is Africa\u2019s most valuable company.\n\nBut per African Financials\u2019 March 2022 market report, South Africa\u2019s multinational telecommunications company, MTN Group, is the most valuable African company in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) by market capitalisation.\n\nSome numbers: As of February 2022, MTN Group\u2019s market capitalisation was estimated at $24 billion, making it the most valuable brand in SSA. This is comparable to Flutterwave\u2019s $3 billion valuation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlutterwave, on the other hand, is arguably Africa\u2019s most valuable startup. That was where I got it wrong. Please keep in mind that, at the time of writing, MTN Group is the most valuable African company, while Flutterwave is the most valuable African startup.\n\nMore importantly, Olugbenga \u201cGB\u201d Agboola, Flutterwave CEO, is the one facing allegations, not Flutterwave.\n\nWe still need you on this: Help Techpoint Africa determine how much African tech workers earn by filling out this form or sharing it with your developer friends.\n\nAnyway, today, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nFlutterwave CEO\u2019s insider trading allegation\n\nHow VC firm, Katapult, invests\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million Series A\n\nIs Flutterwave\u2019s CEO guilty of insider trading or not?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall that on Tuesday, April 12, 2022, David Hundeyin, an investigative journalist, published an article in which he allegedly accused Flutterwave Founder and CEO, Olugenga \u201cGB\u201d Agboola of impersonation, inappropriate behaviour, and insider trading.\n\nSince then, the phrase \u201cinsider trading\u201d has topped my Twitter trend tables. While I\u2019ve seen a variety of perspectives \u2013 some of which appear to be accurate and some false \u2013 the question on almost everyone\u2019s lips is, is insider trading a thing given that Flutterwave is a private, US-based startup?\n\nBefore you exercise your Googling skills, I\u2019d like to do my part to simplify things.\n\nFirst off, insider trading, according to Investopedia, is the purchase or sale of stock in a publicly-traded company by someone who has non-public, material information about that stock.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSidebar: For proper understanding, nonpublic material information is corporate news or information about a company that has not been made public but has the potential to affect its stock price.\n\nFor example, suppose Chimgozirim learns about nonpublic material information from someone who works at ABC company and shares it with Bolu. If Chimgozirim\u2019s informant uses this insider information to profit in the stock market, all three involved are guilty and can be prosecuted.\n\nBesides, insider information is typically available to executives working within or near a public company.\n\nAccording to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), illegal insider trading is the purchase or sale of a security in violation of a fiduciary duty or other relationship of trust and confidence based on material, nonpublic information about the security.\n\nWhat does the law say about insider trading? Insider trading laws apply to private and public companies and transactions involving employees, employee stock plans, and third-party shareholders.\n\nSo, what is your verdict on the allegations against Agboola? Guilty? Or innocent?\n\nWhile I may not be able to delve into some of Hundeyin\u2019s allegations, today\u2019s podcast analysed the article to an extent, leaving us with many unanswered questions. You can listen to it here.\n\nAlso, Ogheneruemu has worked on a piece to fact-check Hundeyin\u2019s story. And I believe it will add context to this. Please read it here: Fact Check: Is there any truth to some of the allegations against Flutterwave Founder, Olugbenga Agboola?\n\nHow VC firm, Katapult, invests\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf my memory serves me correctly, since secondary school \u2013 if not primary school \u2013 some of us have heard the clause \u201cAgriculture is the mainstay of the national economy.\u201d And, of course, I mean the Nigerian economy.\n\nI also remember my secondary school Agricultural Science teachers repeatedly asking my class to discuss what that meant in both tests and exams at one point or another.\n\nSo, how about we talk about what this means for Africa? Do you want to give it a shot?\n\nI\u2019ll go then: Agriculture is the backbone of most African economies, and agricultural performance is inextricably linked to economic performance in these countries.\n\nTo give some context, studies have shown that agriculture is by far Africa\u2019s most important economic activity. It employs roughly two-thirds of the continent\u2019s working population and contributes an average of 30%-60% to each country\u2019s gross domestic product and approximately 30% of export value.\n\nI\u2019m not here to bore you, so this is my final point: Per a Mckinsey research, Agriculture has a massive social and economic impact in Africa. Smallholder farmers account for more than 60% of sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s population, and agriculture accounts for approximately 23% of the region\u2019s GDP.\n\nRegardless of my points, much of Africa\u2019s agricultural potential is still untapped. In 2020, 282 million Africans went hungry due to insecurity, inadequate agricultural infrastructure, and drought.\n\nMoreover, according to the United Nations (UN), it is expected that Africa will be unable to feed 60% of its population by 2025. The African population, estimated at 118 million at the turn of the twentieth century, had risen to 788.5 million in 1997 and is expected to reach 1.5 billion by 2025.\n\n1.5 billion people will go hungry by 2025? Omo X100! But what are we doing to change this narrative?\n\nAlthough food insecurity, climate change, and other agricultural issues persist on the continent, some startups are trying to address some of the sector\u2019s problems. And Katapult Africa, a venture capital firm, focuses on startups developing solutions for agriculture, food, and the environment.\n\nInteresting facts about the VC firm: The firm was founded in 2016 by Norwegian entrepreneur, Tharald Nustad and has invested in 108 startups, including two unicorns \u2013 Esusu and Betterfly. Also, in 2018, the firm began investing in African startups, and it now has 17 startups in its portfolio.\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware that I\u2019m not one to give spoilers. But I trust Chimgozirim to provide a detailed explanation of how Katapult invests.\n\nCheck out his insightful article here: An insight into how Katapult VC invests in African startups\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million Series A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUmba, a digital banking platform based in Lagos, Nigeria, has raised $15 million in Series A funding to expand into new markets like Egypt, Ghana, and Kenya, where mobile money is popular.\n\nWho are the investors? Costanoa Ventures led the round. While firms like Nubank, a credit fintech platform, ACT Ventures, Lux Capital, Palm Drive Capital, Banana Capital, and Streamlined Ventures participated, individuals like Tom Blomfield, the co-founder of Monzo, and Lachy Groom also took part in the round.\n\nWhat does it do? The startup claims it offers transparent and readily available financial products to Africans who are underbanked or unbanked by legacy banks \u2013 locally owned and operated community banks.\n\nWhat is the startup\u2019s model?: Tiernan Kennedy (CEO) and Barry O\u2019Mahony (CFO) launched the company in 2018. And per TechCrunch, the company follows the credit-led model, first solving customers\u2019 liquidity problems before upselling them on a wide range of banking products.\n\nUmba says most of its revenue is generated by charging customers a monthly interest rate of 10%, which the CEO claims is the lowest rate in the market. But how true is this?\n\nTake Payhippo for example \u2013 an AI-powered lending platform that makes it easier to fund small and medium-sized businesses \u2013 claims its loan offering begins with short-term, affordable working capital delivered in 30\u201345 days at a 6% interest rate.\n\nHowever, since Umba\u2019s launch, the company claims it has doubled its revenues every three months, with over 1 million installs on Google Play.\n\nUnlike legacy banks, the company says that its core banking systems, which it designed from the ground up, prioritises customers. Consequently, in both the banking and mobile money markets, it offers customised user experience without delay.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nNestcoin is hiring an Associate UX Researcher.

Following the investment by the investor, the price of the company\u2019s shares witnessed a surge.\n\nWhat is insider trading?\n\nThe scenario above illustrates the concept of insider trading, a phenomenon that is not new to capital markets. Experts say it is one practice that has bedeviled the growth of the securities market in many countries.\n\nBlack\u2019s Law dictionary defines insider trading as the use of material, non-public information in trading the shares of a company by a corporate insider or other person who owes a fiduciary duty to the company.\n\nIn order to ensure fairness in market prices and maintain a level playing field for stakeholders and investors in the Nigerian securities market, Section 111 (1) of the Investment and Securities Act 2007 (ISA) and Rule 110 (e) of the Securities and Exchange Commission Rules 2013 (SEC Rules) prohibits insider trading.\n\nIt is the profitable trading in securities based on some confidential information or special knowledge that is unavailable to the general public that makes the practice unfair and illegal.\n\nWho is an insider?\n\nThe SEC Rules define an insider as any person who is connected with the company during the preceding six months as a director of the company or related company, an officer of the company, or a related company.\n\nIt also refers to an employee of the company or a related company, a person in a position, involving a professional or business relationship with the company, any shareholder of the company who owns 5 percent or more of any class of securities, or any person who is or can be deemed to be an agent of any of the persons listed above.\n\nRule 17 of the Securities and Exchange Commission Code of Corporate Governance Rules provides that an insider includes a director\u2019s immediate family including spouse, son, daughter, mother, or father.\n\nRead also: Umahi suspends perm sec over extortion\n\nWhat is unpublished price-sensitive information?\n\nThis is information that is capable of affecting decisions to be made in relation to a company. It is information that if made available to the public may affect their dealings with the company. Such information is capable of affecting the value of shares of a company.\n\nIs insider trading an offence?\n\nSection 115 ISA states that it is a criminal offense and any person who commits such an offense is liable on conviction to a fine in the case of an individual of not less than N500,000 or an amount equivalent to double the profit derived or loss averted from the use of the information obtained, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years.\n\nIn the case of a body corporate, N1,000,000 or an amount equivalent to twice the amount of profit derived by it or the loss averted. Section 116 ISA adds that a person found guilty shall also be liable to pay compensation at the order of the commission or the Tribunal to any person who suffers a loss as a result of such trade.\n\nWhy is insider trading an offence?\n\nAs an information-driven market, the misuse of confidential information of a company poses serious danger to the capital markets.\n\nIt has been opined that the prices of financial assets such as shares, stock, and bonds, are a reflection of the information that are made known to the public. Information guides the public towards its dealings with a company, and the type of information available will influence decisions with regard to dealings with the company.\n\nPrice-sensitive information is therefore information that materially affects the value of securities. Section 112 of the ISA 2007 prohibits the abuse of non-public price-sensitive information obtained in an official capacity.\n\nAre private companies exempt from insider trading?\n\nIn Nigeria, there seems to be no clear framework on insider trading for private companies. The various laws prohibiting insider trading seem to speak only about public companies.\n\nHowever, where a private company does acts that are similar to that of a public company, then such a company for the purpose of insider trading could be treated as a public company without any public listing as seen in some climes. For instance, a private company offering stock options to its employees could be treated as a public company if the issue of insider trading arises.\n\nHowever, the law has not taken any position on this. Section 22 (1) \u2013 (2) of the Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA) 2020 provides that a private company is one whose memorandum states that it is such and that subject to the provisions in its Articles of association, it may restrict the transfer of shares. Where the provisions of a company\u2019s Articles restrict the transfer of shares, such a company cannot offer shares for sale.\n\nThe repealed 1990 CAMA strictly prohibited the transfer of shares in private companies. But with the new 2020 law, private companies may transfer or sell shares provided it is allowed for by their article of association. A private company will not be doing anything wrong if it sells shares or offers stock options if the Articles of the company allow for it.\n\nThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission recognizes that the law against insider trading applied to private companies. In an announcement made on 12 December 2011, the US SEC announced an enforcement proceeding that serves as a useful reminder that the federal laws against insider trading and misrepresentation applied to private companies purchasing stock from employees and other shareholders as it is done in the public companies.\n\nBy this provision, a private company that is registered in the US and Nigeria could be liable in the US if it breaches insider trading rules.",

He\u2019s a climate-conscious, time-pressed tech executive who adores classic cars, especially the 1961 Austin-Healey 3000 Mk II, Bloomberg reported. The solution is to remodel the vehicle, removing the oily guts and substituting them with a battery.\n\nElectrifying an old vehicle is a time-consuming and costly process. Car designers weren\u2019t thinking about where to put a rechargeable battery sixty years ago.\n\nMoment Motor Co. in Austin has converted four of Henry\u2019s vehicles. The crew begins by scanning the engine bay, transmission tunnel (basically the car\u2019s plumbing), and trunk in 3D.\n\nThe data is then loaded into a CAD model to determine where the power pack should be installed (as is most often the case, multiple small batteries are used).\n\nRead also: 19 African countries access Regional off-grid electricity\n\nCustomization may include reworking the brakes and suspension to accommodate the heavier gear that will be installed. \u201cSome people scream that we\u2019re taking the soul out of the car, but the reality is that we\u2019re preserving it.\u201d Marc Davis, founder of Moment Motor said.\n\nWhy Is It Challenging?\n\nFor good reason, there aren\u2019t many shops like Moment. Modifying a decades-old vehicle to run on electricity necessitates a slew of esoteric skills, akin to a cross between a machinist, an electrician, and a software developer.\n\n\u201cMost professional mechanics can\u2019t make the jump,\u201d says Moment founder Marc Davis, who recruits from tech firms and custom hot rod shops. \u201cWe need people who can crack a laptop as well as turn a wrench.\u201d\n\nThe market for classic automobiles is thriving. According to insurer Hagerty Inc., a record 36,254 vintage vehicles sold at US auctions last year, worth a combined $2.2 billion as stock market riches and pandemic itches joined with driving nostalgia.\n\nThe number of old cars traded on peer-to-peer marketplaces like Craigslist is estimated to be ten times that figure.\n\nFor decades, enthusiasts have been electrifying classic cars, but the recent battery and motor advancements have broadened the market, a Bloomberg report revealed\n\nPutting together an EV\u2019s organs is now a simple shopping experience, and many people are purchasing these vehicles solely to make them greener.",

          "text": "This digest is for artists\n\nThis digest is brought to you by Patrons MCAA. Patrons is a full-suite art advisory firm that helps private and corporate art collectors with diversifying their wealth through art collection, appraisal, packaging & transportation, storage, insurance, maintenance and restoration.\n\nTitle: Break forth from the Cyst | Artist: Steve Ekpenisi | Medium: Shredded mild steel plate\n\nSize: 182 cm | Year: 2021\n\nTaking a cue from Oscar Wilde\u2019s popular quote, \u201cWhen bankers get together for dinner, they discuss Art. When artists get together to dine, they discuss money.\u201d This week\u2019s publication will focus on the dynamics of pricing your art as an artist.\n\nIf you are an artist reading this digest, you would agree that figuring out what your next art piece will be is never really an issue. It is often said that good artists can create art blindfolded. From history, one of the early struggles new and young artists seemingly face at the start of their career is in relation to the business side of their profession; pricing their art.\n\nArguably, it is not easy to set a price on a piece that does not yet have a market value. Being creative, artists may feel that their artworks are priceless but then they quickly realise that they must balance that with monetising their creativity. Overcharging and undercharging collectors is a big concern they have to bear.\n\nAppropriately pricing your artworks ensures that as an artist, you can earn and live comfortably and grow financially through your craft.\n\nHere are 6 tips you can put into practice:\n\nSize based pricing\n\nYou can set a price per square inch. Then, multiply the length and breadth of your artwork in inches. Your total should be multiplied by the price you set per square inch.\n\nLet us use a simple example to simplify this math. First, we will assume that the price per square inch is $2. Next we will assume that the length of your artwork is 14 inches and breadth is 12 inches. Your result from that multiplication will be $2 x 14 x 12 = $336. You can choose to round down the price to $330 or leave it at $336.\n\nDo your research\n\nSometimes, artists undermine the extent and usefulness of their network and fail to leverage it. By reaching out to other artists, especially those at a similar career phase as you are, you can discover much about how they price and run their art business. Beyond just pricing, you can get answers to questions such as these; \u2018What is the average price for framed works? Or sketch works?\u2019 \u2018How about unframed works?\u2019 \u2018Does a stretched painting cost more?\u2019 \u2018How do I price my sculptures?\u2019 Be sure to take into consideration the perception you want to establish for your brand as an artist when taking in suggestions and recommendations from industry peers. What makes you unique as an artist is how you set yourself apart from the crowd.\n\nDo not undercharge\n\nFor fear of an overcharge and the need to make ends meet, a lot of artists undercharge when they sell their works to collectors. At the very least, artists need to ensure the full cost of production \u2013 canvas, paint, framing, logistics, and everything in between \u2013 is covered in their pricing. Deduce how much you are worth per hour, calculate or estimate how many hours it will take you or it took you to get the finished product, then add it to the cost of the artwork. Think of yourself as a consultant who is working for a client, and charge per hour billing accordingly.\n\nFor example, say you place your per hour billing at $8, and you spend a total of 15 hours from start to finish. First, we would calculate the total consultative cost of the artwork based on the number of hours you spent creating it to be $120 ($8 x 15). Next, we would consider the cost spent purchasing the materials used, let us assume $35. Framing the artwork cost $150. Total transportation cost incurred is $100. The total cost price of your artwork will then be $405.\n\nSet a price and stick to it\n\nWhen you set your price, you are basically setting your standard. Be confident in sticking to your standard irrespective of how tempting it may sometimes be for you to sell for less. Collectors can easily spot it when you lack confidence in your self assumed value.\n\nA word of caution here however, do not try to overprice yourself. Based on your acceptance and growth in the industry, you want to set realistic prices without feeling obligated to lower your value. You must always be ready to justify to the collecting community the value placed on yourself and your artworks.\n\nConsider varied pricing\n\nAs an artist you fundamentally know that the more collected your art is, the more conversations you spark within the collecting community, the quicker your value grows. That being said, collectors who may be interacting with you for the first time may be turned off by a significantly priced artwork of yours. To mitigate losing such interests, you may consider creating small sized or miniature pieces priced affordably. A collector who is unable to afford a $3,000 painting may be able to afford a $350 miniature piece by the same artist.\n\nNot only does this ensure you still get to make a sale, it broadens your reach within the collecting community and is a great way to get collectors in the rink. When a collector displays your artwork in his home or office, he will be inclined to fall in love with your artwork and style. It will be a conversation starter when he hosts guests, and thus, you enjoy more exposure as people will be curious to learn more about you.\n\nRepresentation matters\n\nGallerists are very comfortable talking about art and money. They are in the business of art and have mastered the art of pricing. Simply put, gallerists are able to convince collectors that the art they sell is worth the asking price. Having a gallerist represent you as an artist not only brings about more credibility to you as a brand, but also shields you from talking shop.\n\nGalleries are influencing institutions within the collecting community and can chart the course of an artists\u2019 career. They have the reputation, the influence, long standing relationships with collectors, critics, fellow dealers, museums and other institutions within arms length.\n\nPricing is a constant struggle many artists face. If this is you, I hope you found this digest insightful.\n\nIf you are still unsure about how to go about pricing your artwork, Patrons can be a soundboard for you on this. We have 20+ years industry experience in representing artists and in art dealerships.\n\nUntil next digest,",

          "text": "Global financial institution, the World Bank has warned in its latest \u2018Africa\u2019s Pulse\u2019 report, a biannual analysis of the near-term regional macroeconomic outlook, that Nigeria\u2019s increasing fuel subsidy could pose debt sustainability concerns for the country.\n\nThe warning comes on the heels of the national assembly approval of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s request to earmark N4 trillion for petrol subsidy.\n\nThe Bretton Woods institution noted that the rising cost of subsidies could also weaken the country\u2019s public finance.\n\nAccording to the report, \u201cRisk remains high on increasing fuel subsidies, which could weigh heavily on public finance and pose debt sustainability concerns.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, public debt as a percentage of GDP is currently moderate.\u201d\n\nThe Washington-based institution added that the country\u2019s soaring military spending and debt servicing costs could prey on the country\u2019s debt sustainability level.\n\n\u201cPersistent fuel subsidies, increasing military spending for security purposes, and rising debt servicing costs weigh heavily on public finance to keep public debt at a sustainable level in Nigeria,\u201d the report added.\n\n\u201cThe fiscal balance deteriorated considerably in several Sub-Saharan African countries as governments scaled-up spending to mitigate the prolonged effects of the pandemic on firms and vulnerable households.\u201d\n\nOn sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s recovery, the bank noted that it is multi-speed, with wide variation across countries.\n\n\u201cThe recovery of the three largest economies in the region \u2014 Nigeria, South Africa, and Angola \u2014 will continue to be sluggish,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cHigh oil prices will support growth in Nigeria and Angola.\n\n\u201cExcluding Angola, Nigeria, and South Africa, growth is projected at 4.1 per cent in 2022\u2014higher than the growth of the region as a whole.\n\n\u201cNon-resource-rich countries are projected to be adversely affected by rising commodity prices, dragging down growth in the region.\n\n\u201cThe opposite occurs with resource-rich countries whose growth would be propelled by favourable terms of trade.\u201d\n\nThe bank further said the war in Ukraine would further improve the economic performance of resource-rich countries (especially their extractive sector) and decelerate the economic activity of non-resource-rich countries as their import bills soar.\n\n\u201cGiven limited trade exposure, the impacts of the Russia-Ukraine conflict are expected to be negligible,\u201d the bank added.\n\nIt projected a 2.7 per cent growth for Nigeria in 2022.\n\n\u201cOf the region\u2019s three largest economies, South Africa\u2019s growth is expected to decline by 2.8 percentage points in 2022, dragged by persistent structural constraints, while Angola and Nigeria are projected to continue with the momentum of 2021, up by 2.7 and 0.2 percentage points, respectively, thanks partly to elevated oil prices and good performance of the non-oil sector,\u201d the bank said.\n\nAccording to World Bank, growth in Nigeria is forecast to increase to 3.8 per cent in 2022 and stabilise at 4 per cent from 2023 to 2024.\n\n\u201cReal GDP growth was revised up by 1.2 percentage points for both periods compared with the previous forecast. Nigeria\u2019s economy is still dependent on the oil sector,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cOil-related revenue contributes 40 to 60 per cent of fiscal revenue, while oil and gas account for 80 to 90 per cent of total exports. Weak oil production, below the OPEC quota, held back the recovery process.\n\n\u201cAlthough at a slower pace than the average 7 per cent during the boom period, growth prospects for the Nigerian economy are somewhat bright thanks to high oil prices coupled with reforms initiated by the passing of the Petroleum Industry Act and the completion of the Dangote refinery expected in 2023.\u201d",

          "text": "Rights activist Femi Falana, SAN, on Friday in Ikeja urged the Federal Government to extend Thursday\u2019s presidential pardon granted some top Nigerians, to people serving terms for petty offences.\n\nFalana made the call at the 1st anniversary of late Afenifere\u2019s spokesman, Yinka Odumakin\u2019s Lecture and Book Presentation.\n\nHe said doing so for convicts without selectivity, and irrespective of class, would give a reflection of fairness and equality for all before the law.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria reports that the Council of State granted presidential pardon to 159 convicts on Thursday.\n\nAmong them were former governors of Plateau and Taraba States, Joshua Dariye and Jolly Nyame respectively, who were both jailed for allegedly stealing N1.16 billion and N1.6 billion respectively.\n\nMr Falana also advised that there should no discrimination on the basis of belonging to the ruling class.\n\n\u201cAll petty thieves in our prisons should be released. Under Section 17 of the 1999 Constitution, there shall be equality and equal rights for all citizens.\n\n\u201cSection 42 of the Constitution says there shall be no discrimination on the basis of class and gender, so you cannot take out a few people on the basis that they belong to a category or section of the society.\n\n\u201cI can assure you that if the government did not release others, I am going to call on lawyers whose clients are left in custody to come to court and challenge the discriminatory treatment on their clients.\n\n\u201cJust two weeks ago, a Nigerian was jailed for stealing N1,000 in Abuja; the accused pleaded with the judge that he had no food but the judge jailed him for six months.\n\n\u201cWhen we are talking of justice and fair play, if you want to pardon some set of people, then you must also extend presidential pardon to petty thieves in the prisons.\n\n\u201cThis is because if the big thieves are being asked to go, then they must also extend the facility to other Nigerians,\u201d the rights crusader said.\n\nSpeaking on the passing of late Odumakin after a year, Falana described his loss as a monumental tragedy.\n\n\u201cYinka remained a symbol of justice and we are gathered to celebrate his legacy. He was a man of honour, hope and consistency; a man who gave hope to the masses,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nIn his remarks, Ibikunle Amosun said the deceased was a friend who built bridges across ethnic and religious groups.\n\n\u201cHis legacy will still remain and the memory of his demise still lingers. My heart goes to his widow, Joe for staying strong after his demise,\u201d the former Ogun governor said.\n\nSimilarly, Tunde Bakare, the General Overseer of Citadel Global Community Church and a presidential hopeful, said late Odumakin was a fearless person who did not labour in vain, adding that his memory would linger forever.\n\nAlso, Akinwunmi Adesina, president, African Development Bank, said Mr Odumakin was a respected rights activist and a democrat.\n\nLeader of Oodua People\u2019s Congress, OPC, Gani Adams, thanked Mr Odumakin\u2019s widow for erecting a legacy for the deceased.\n\nHe noted that the Foundation would give room for generations to learn about what the deceased fought about.\n\nIn her remarks, the widow, Joe Okei-Odumakin, said her husband devoted to true federalism.\n\nShe described her deceased husband as an encyclopaedia of positive activism.\n\nNAN reports that late Odumakin, died in April 2, 2021, after battling with respiratory problems, occasioned by COVID-19 complications.",

          "text": "As mixed reactions continue to trail Professor Yemi Osinbajo\u2019s declaration to run for the post of President in 2023, a veteran and award winning journalist, Mustapha Ogunsakin has revealed how the VP declined then President Olusegun Obasanjo\u2019s offer to dump Asiwaju Bola Tinubu and become Attorney General of the Federation.\n\nOgunsakin\u2019s revelation is coming on the heels of personal attacks heaped on the VP by some political opponents, trying to brand the VP a betrayer because he threw his hat in the ring.\n\nDetailing how he turned down Obasanjo\u2019s offer, Ogunsakin in an article titled \u201cAttacking Osinbajo\u201d said \u201cin 2005, President Obasanjo invited Osinbajo to take appointment as the Attorney General of the Federation after Chief Akin Olujimi, SAN left office.\n\nHe said Obasanjo was impressed by Osinbajo\u2019s impeccable record and wanted him to replicate the wholesome changes he had implemented in Lagos but Osinbajo was loyal to Asiwaju Bola Tinubu and Lagos state.\n\n\u201cObasanjo saw the sterling qualities and performance that Osinbajo had as Attorney General of Lagos. The President without informing Tinubu offered the post to the Lagos AG. The first thing Osinbajo did was to inform his principal, Tinubu, who gave him a free hand to take his decision.\u201d\n\nContinuing, Ogunsakin said \u201cOsinbajo made a request to Obasanjo: \u201cRelease Lagos Council funds.\u201d Obasanjo replied that Osinbajo should first take the appointment and then advise him as Attorney General of the Federation on the matter.\n\n\u201cOsinbajo went underground and for weeks, Obasanjo could no longer reach him. It was obvious to the President that Osinbajo deliberately avoided him. He went on to appoint Chief Bayo Ojo SAN as his AGF and Minister of Justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cOsinbajo rejected the position of AGF and Minister of Justice and stayed with Tinubu! Nobody complained then,\u201d the award winning journalist noted.\n\nSpeaking further, Ogunsakin said, \u201cthe Vice President not only stood with Tinubu, but stayed loyal to Lagos State. He did not betray Tinubu then\u201d.\n\nCautioning those calling Osinbajo a betrayer, Ogunsakin said \u201cbut now when it is convenient for them, some political and religious bigots are shouting betrayal!\n\nEveryone knows that if you want to hear the story of how your father met your mother, join politics.\u201d\n\nHe urged anyone criticising the Vice President on account of his declaration for the presidency \u201cto do so on valid facts! Not lazy, religious and political lies that reveal your foolishness and hatred for a man who is doing his best to make his country and people better.\u201d",

          "text": "The Yahaya Bello Presidential Campaign Organisation says the governor Yahaya Bello possesses all the attributes that can retain the presidency for the ruling All Progressives Congress in 2023.\n\nThe Director, Media and Publicity of the Campaign Organisation, Yemi Kolapo, added that the well experienced and accomplished leaders of the party would not sacrifice Bello\u2019s winning attributes for \u201cdestructive\u201d politics.\n\nShe said this in a statement she signed and made available to journalists on Friday.\n\nAccording to her, the party, in its wisdom, knows that, after eight years, it must present that candidate that can win the next election, considering the \u201cwe against them\u201d attitude of citizens in many countries to the government of the day, which usually makes retaining power, under a free and fair environment, difficult.\n\nHighlighting the attributes that distinguished Governor Bello as the candidate to beat, the media directorate said aside from Bello\u2019s plethora of obvious achievements in Kogi State, he enjoyed the massive support of Nigerian women and youths, which must not be ignored, considering their numerical strength.\n\nHis uncommon loyalty to the President, his colleagues, and allies, among others, as well as his clean records as regards the issue of betrayal of any form, among others, were some of the attributes listed in his favour.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cThe stage is almost set for Nigerians to, once again, choose the leaders that will steer the affairs of the nation at all levels for another four years. But before the general elections, the struggle is within the parties, and in that regard, many have put their hats in the ring.\n\n\u201cThe presidential race in the ruling All Progressives Congress is populated by known heavyweights in Nigeria\u2019s politics, and in the next few weeks, depending on what the party decides, all aspirants that have had the courage to declare so far and those still preparing to do so, would have to jostle for just one ticket.\n\n\u201cSome groups have even almost concluded that this ticket belongs to a particular zone as a result of some prior unwritten agreement, but those who have the interest of the nation at heart have said, times without number, that there is no zoning in the constitution of the party, and more importantly, that the best must get the job, regardless of his zone, if the wellbeing of the country is the target.\n\n\u201cOn the 2nd of April 2022, His Excellency, Governor of Kogi State, Alhaji Yahaya Adoza Bello, formally declared to run for the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in 2023 under the platform of the APC. In his signature bold manner, the declaration ceremony at the Eagle Square, Abuja, has been described, even by unrelenting critics as the first-of-its-kind in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis was even more significant because, while others veiled their declaration under other programmes, others, afraid to test their popularity the way of Governor Bello, settled for video recordings of their declaration speeches.\n\n\u201cIt is indeed commendable that despite the fears that there would be an irreversible crack in the APC after the last Convention, the party, under the able leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari, proved naysayers wrong and had a rancour-free exercise, which has produced leaders of note to man the different offices in the party.\n\n\u201cThe party, in its wisdom, knows that, after eight years, it must present that candidate that can win the next election, considering the \u201cwe against them\u201d attitude of citizens in many countries to the government of the day, which usually makes retaining power, under a free and fair environment, difficult for incumbents. There are, however, many reasons the choice of Yahaya Bello would make the journey easier for the ruling party.\n\n\u201cThe party needs a candidate that can connect massively with women and youths, considering their combined numerical strength and that candidate is no other than Governor Yahaya Bello.\n\n\u201cThe preference of Nigerians, regardless of tribe, religion or party affiliation, for a younger leader is also very clear. Of the pool of aspirants, as the country stands today, even across party lines, Governor Yahaya Bello is the best bet for the younger generation if this dream must be actualized.\n\n\u201cThis consideration has made millions of youths across Nigeria resolve to put their numbers behind the Governor, and this is verifiable with the number of active youths with PVCs currently on the Bello Ambassadors Network, Rescue Nigeria Mission, and Yahaya Bello Network, among many other support groups.\n\n\u201cAgain, the North-Central, where Governor Bello comes from, has not produced a democratically elected president in the history of Nigeria, and so, irrespective of what people are made to believe, they will support their own when it is time to take a stand. The North Central believes strongly that the time for them to occupy the Aso Rock Villa is now. Being the strongest contender from the region places Governor Bello in a vantage position to clinch the presidential ticket.\n\n\u201cYahaya Bello is an acclaimed unifier. It is a well known fact that, for the first time in the history of Kogi State, the sharp, bitter division between the three major ethnic groups gave way to unity and harmony under the Governor. He united the tribes, starting from his cabinet, and today, everyone is first a Kogi indigene before being identified with his ethnic group. Nigeria needs a unifier now more than ever.\n\n\u201cThe Governor is ever ready to build on the President\u2019s efforts in this regard. How he turned the state from a notorious state, where kidnappers and criminals built empires, to one of the safest in Nigeria today and, conveniently, the safest in the north, is a question that has been on the lips of many Nigerians. Therefore, in terms of the main issues confronting the nation, Governor Yahaya Bello has excelled remarkably in Kogi State.\n\n\u201cThe loyalty of Governor Bello to the leader of the party, President Muhammadu Buhari, has often been described by critics as \u201cannoying\u201d, but this is the stuff our aspirant is made of. He is loyal to his friends, colleagues and allies, and more so, to the APC. He has demonstrated this on so many occasions, even in very difficult situations. He has no record of betrayal to his party members and his principles. He is a fair game player.\n\n\u201cThe current well experienced and accomplished party leaders would definitely not sacrifice these laudable attributes for \u201cdestructive\u201d politics. They will rally round Governor Yahaya Bello and retain the presidency with a wide margin come 2023.\u201d",

          "text": "The 68 passengers abducted by terrorists on March 28 after the bombing of an Abuja-Kaduna train are today 20 days old in the dungeon of the terrorists, with families and friends accusing the federal government and security agencies of not doing anything tangible to free them.\n\nOn Friday, some relations of the abductees based in Kaduna State threatened to resist any attempt by the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) to resume the Abuja-Kaduna train services without rescuing their loved ones.\n\n\n\nThe terror attack also left eight persons dead at the scene, two others died in the hospital from gunshot injuries sustained, and with several others still nursing their wounds in hospital.\n\n\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nThe terrorists had few days ago released a two-minute video, showing scores of abductees sitting in a forest, including men, women and children. Behind them was a group of gunmen standing in a line.\n\nOne of the abductees said in Hausa: \u201cIt is only us that know the dire situation we are in, there are women and children here; there are aged people with health challenges.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn the video, the terrorists said the government knew what they wanted, threatening to kill those in custody if their demands were not met.\n\nThe video clearly showed the abductees in anguish. Some of them are believed to be carrying bullet wounds. They are being traumatised in a forest, amid mosquitos, hash conditions and many other dangers.\n\nThere is also a pregnant woman and some children with the terrorists in the very harsh environment.\n\nSources said the abductees were made to trek for five days, resting intermittently in transit camps, before they arrived at the main camp of the attackers around Shiroro Local Government Area in Niger State.\n\n\n\nThe released Managing Director of the Bank of Agriculture, BOA, Alwan Hassan, while recounting his ordeal a few days back, said 41 women, 22 men, 5 kids were with the terrorists.\n\nThe federal government had assured that it would do everything necessary to ensure the release of those still being held hostage but families and friends of the victims said they had not seen anything concrete being done in this direction.\n\nThe families, who said the federal government and security agencies had not deemed it fit to get in touch with them, are pleading with the terrorists to allow them negotiate the release of their relations.\n\nOne of the abducted family members, Aliyu Mohammed, who spoke in Abuja last Thursday, begged the terrorists to give room for families to negotiate the release of their loved ones.\n\n\n\nMohammed said: \u201cIt is the families, and not the government, that will bear the brunt should anything untoward happen to the abductees.\u201d\n\nAlso last week, some of the victims\u2019 families staged a peaceful protest at the Radio House in Abuja, with placards appealing to the federal government to do more in ensuring that they are released.\n\n\n\nAliyu Mahmud, a relative of a seven-month pregnant woman, had said: \u201cI have my sister who is seven months pregnant with her husband. Words cannot explain what they are going through and what we are going through. Please, the government should do the needful and let this come to an end as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cThey should try as much as possible to reach out to the perpetrators and rescue our loved ones. There are children there, pregnant women, the sick, the aged and only God knows what they are going through.\n\n\u201cWhatever we do, we think of them. When we eat, we think of them. When we sleep, anything we do, we think of them. We are pleading with the government to please do the needful so that this situation will come to an end as soon as possible.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnother protester, Aminu Uthman, said: \u201cMy immediate younger brother and his wife are among the victims. It is a nightmare and the most difficult days I have had in my life. I cannot sleep or eat. A lot of things are going wrong.\n\n\u201cThe bandits called only once and they gave him the phone to speak to us. They are yet to make any request but they called to say he is with them. We voted for this government because of insecurity. We had the trust that they would address insecurity. This protest is not for the family members alone; it is for Nigerians generally. This thing can happen to anybody.\u201d\n\nSome other relatives of the kidnapped victims also met in Kaduna early in the week and accused the federal government of insensitivity towards the plight of the abductees.\n\nDr. Abdulfatai Jimoh, who led and spoke on behalf of the kidnapped relatives, said they were yet to establish contact with their loved ones or even the hoodlums since the incident on March 28, 2022.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is better for the government to go into negotiation with the terrorists as they have demanded to secure the release of our loved ones alive.\n\n\u201cSince this incident happened, we expected that by now, the government, the Nigerian Railway Corporation and the Federal Ministry of Transportation are supposed to have identified relatives of the victims to tell us what effort they are making or not to rescue our loved ones unhurt.\n\n\u201cIn fact, the primary duty of any government is to protect the lives and property of citizens. We believe our government can do it and it\u2019s capable of doing it. Until a few days ago we had been expecting telephone calls from the abductors because that\u2019s what they promised us but when we saw the video, they made it very clear that they want to discuss with the government; that they have something with the government.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what they want from the government. But it\u2019s now an opportunity and a window for the government to rescue our loved ones by opening a channel of communication with them (terrorists). This is not out of place. It is done everywhere in the world.\n\n\u201cEven the US, Israel and the most powerful nations of the world, do negotiate when they have issues like this to preserve the lives of their citizens. This, we know our government can do and we are appealing to them to do it. We don\u2019t know what is between them but it is something that can be resolved in the interest of the lives of Nigerian citizens. Life is very sacred even if it is one life that\u2019s involved.\n\n\u201cWe are appealing to the Nigerian government to do everything within its powers and it is something that\u2019s not beyond the government to do. We are appealing to them to come out to open a channel of discussion with the bandits and get our loved ones out as quickly as possible.\n\n\u201cWe have been in serious anguish in the past 15 days. Many of us have not been sleeping, we have not been sleeping. We are like living corpses.\u201d\n\nNo fewer than 362 passengers were onboard the train at the time terrorists struck on March 28.\n\nBennett Oghifo in Lagos and John Shiklam in Kaduna",

          "text": "The World Bank in its latest Africa\u2019s Pulse, a biannual analysis of the near-term regional macroeconomic outlook, has projected a 2.7% growth for Nigeria in 2022.\n\nOf the region\u2019s three largest economies \u2013 Angola, Nigeria, and South Africa \u2013 only\n\nNigeria is projected to enjoy a fairly good growth in 2022.\n\nThe report said growth in South Africa is expected to decline by 2.8 percentage points in 2022, dragged by persistent structural constraints.\n\nAngola is projected to continue its growth in 2022, but at just 0.2 per cent.\n\n\u201cAngola and Nigeria are expected to continue their growth momentum in 2022, up by 2.7 and 0.2 percentage points respectively, in part due to elevated oil prices and good performance in the non-oil sector. Resource-rich countries, especially their extractive sectors, will see improved economic performance due to the war in Ukraine, while non-resource rich countries will experience a deceleration in economic activity,\u201d said the World Bank.\n\n\n\nIn the report, the World Bank, estimates growth in Sub-Saharan Africa at 3.6 per cent in 2022, down from 4 per cent in 2021, as the region continues to deal with new COVID-19 variants, global inflation, supply disruptions and climate shocks.\n\nThe bank explained that recovery remained uneven, incomplete and was happening at varied rates of speed across the region.\n\nIt said this was due in part to elevated oil prices and good performance in the non-oil sector.\n\n\n\nIt said: Excluding Angola, Nigeria and South Africa, regional growth is projected at 4.1 per cent in 2022, and 4.9 per cent in 2023. The Eastern and Southern Africa sub-region shows sustained recovery from the recession, at 4.1 per cent in 2021, down to 3.1 per cent in 2022 and settling around 3.8 per cent in 2024.\u201d\n\nThe region\u2019s growth challenges, the World Bank report said, are rising global commodity prices, which are increasing at a faster pace since the onset of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nIt pointed out that as top world exporters of food staples \u2013 Russia and Ukraine \u2013 for a substantial share of wheat, corn and seed oil imports, all of which may be halted if the conflict persists.\n\nWhile Sub-Saharan economies are also likely to be impacted by tightening of global conditions and reduced foreign financial flows into the region, the analysis notes that the high fuel and food prices will translate into higher inflation across African countries, hurting poor and vulnerable citizens, especially those living in urban areas.\n\n\n\nThe bank cited one point of concern as the increased likelihood of civil strife as a result of food and energy-fueled inflation, particularly in the current environment of heightened political instability.\n\n\u201cAs African countries face continued uncertainty, supply disruptions and soaring food and fertilizer prices, trade policy can potentially play a key role by ensuring the free flow of food across borders throughout the region. Amid limited fiscal space, policymakers must look to innovative solutions such as reducing or waiving import duties on staple foods temporarily to provide relief to their citizens,\u201d said World Bank Chief Economist for Africa, Albert Zeufack.\n\n\n\nThe report highlighted the importance of expanding social protection programmes beyond safety nets to strengthen economic resilience and responsiveness to shocks, particularly for poor and vulnerable households.\n\nRecommendations include developing social insurance, savings and labour market programmes that contribute to economic resilience by protecting urban informal workers and help the population invest in their health and education.\n\nNdubuisi Francis in Abuja",

          "text": "Twitter Inc. moved to prevent Elon Musk from significantly increasing his stake, a day after he unveiled a $43 billion unsolicited takeover bid for the social-media company.\n\nThe company on Friday adopted a so-called poison pill that makes it difficult for Mr. Musk to increase his stake beyond 15%. The billionaire founder of Tesla Inc. already owns a more-than 9% stake that he revealed earlier this month.\n\nPoison pills, also called shareholder-rights plans, are legal maneuvers that make it hard for shareholders to build their stakes beyond a set point by triggering an option for others to buy more shares at a discount. They are often used by companies that receive hostile takeover bids to block an unwanted suitor or buy time to consider their options.\n\nTwitter said in a statement that the rights plan doesn\u2019t prevent the company from engaging with potential acquirers or accepting a takeover bid if the board determines it is in the best interest of shareholders. It earlier confirmed it received Mr. Musk\u2019s offer and is reviewing it.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Twitter was weighing installing a poison pill.\n\nMr. Musk may not be the only suitor for the company, as people familiar with the matter say that Thoma Bravo LP and other private-equity firms are now circling as well. But just because they are running the numbers doesn\u2019t mean any of the firms will make a formal bid or that such a deal would come together.\n\nTaking Twitter private would be no small feat; indeed, private-equity firms have explored and decided against it in the past. It would rank as one of the largest leveraged buyouts of all time, and Twitter doesn\u2019t have the attributes of a typical LBO target like strong, stable cash flow. It is possible the buyout firms are also eyeing something short of a full takeover.\n\nThe New York Post earlier reported on Thoma Bravo\u2019s interest in Twitter.\n\nThe private-equity firm, which specializes in the technology sector and manages roughly $100 billion, has been busy lately at a time of heightened buyout activity. It agreed to buy Anaplan Inc. for $10.7 billion in March, and SailPoint Technologies Inc. just days ago for $6.1 billion.\n\nMr. Musk, the billionaire founder of Tesla and privately held rocket company SpaceX, offered to pay $54.20 a share for Twitter and said that was his \u201cbest and final\u201d bid. He has been criticizing how Twitter moderates content, among other things, and briefly agreed this month to join its board before backing out.\n\nHis takeover offer has prompted speculation that a white-knight bidder such as another technology company or private-equity firm could surface as an alternative to a deal with the unpredictable and outspoken entrepreneur.\n\nOne possible outcome is that Twitter rejects Mr. Musk\u2019s offer as too low but leaves the door open for him to return with a higher one, some of the people said. Mr. Musk said if the offer isn\u2019t accepted, he will reconsider his position as a shareholder of the company. He also has said he has a Plan B, without detailing it.\n\nOne big question mark is how Mr. Musk would fund any deal. Though he is the world\u2019s richest man, much of his wealth is tied up in Tesla shares and his offer didn\u2019t have details on financing plans, which, like other aspects of the bid, is unusual. The Journal reported Thursday that Morgan Stanley would provide some debt financing for the bid and that Mr. Musk has received approaches from investors interested in backing it.\n\n\u201cThere are a plethora of multibillionaires eager to fund Elon for whatever he wants to do,\u201d said Joe Lonsdale, an Austin, Texas, venture capitalist and co-founder of Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nOne big name who doesn\u2019t plan to put in money is Peter Thiel, a longtime associate of Mr. Musk dating back to their days as executives at PayPal Holdings Inc.\n\nWhile Mr. Thiel, a fellow billionaire who has invested in several of Mr. Musk\u2019s companies, has expressed to friends broad support for Mr. Musk\u2019s anything-goes vision for Twitter, he doesn\u2019t plan to back any bid, according to people familiar with his plans.\n\nExisting Twitter shareholders supportive of Mr. Musk could also roll over their holdings into any deal.\n\nBut in a sign that Twitter\u2019s investors overall appear less than enthusiastic over Mr. Musk\u2019s bid, the company\u2019s shares closed down nearly 2% Thursday at $45.08. The market was closed Friday for the Good Friday holiday.",
