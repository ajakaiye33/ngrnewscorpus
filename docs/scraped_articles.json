          "text": "The Lagos State Government has inspected facilities at the Synagogue Church of All Nations for COVID safety and prevention protocols compliance in preparation for the funeral of its late founder, Prophet Temitope Joshua.\n\nThe delegation from the Lagos State Government was led by the Commissioner for Health, Prof. Akin Abayomi, and the Director-General of the Lagos State Safety Commission, Lanre Mojola.\n\nSpeaking after the inspection of the church facilities and meeting with the church officials, Abayomi said the inspection was in line with the third wave mitigation strategy of the Lagos State Government to prevent the importation and spread of new deadly strains of COVID into Lagos and Nigeria.\n\nAbayomi added that the inspection and meeting with officials of SCOAN was to limit any possibilities of the introduction of foreign COVID variants among the congregation and by extension to the community.\n\nHe said, \u201cOn behalf of the Lagos State Government we want to offer our deep condolences to the family of the prophet and members of the congregation. In these very precarious times that we are in, with a global pandemic that is evolving dynamically; what we now know is that there are different strains of the virus circulating around the world, and Lagos State has a very strong third wave prevention strategy.\n\n\u201cThe likely cause of a third wave is going to be an importation from visitors who are infected with the virus, so we are particularly careful about working with the Synagogue to make sure that we have a collaboration that will reduce the opportunity to zero of us either importing a virus or even allowing someone who is positive to interact with the community.\n\n\u201cSo we have had series of engagements with the officials and executive of SCOAN, we are also in touch with the Federal Government; the Presidential Steering Committee, and the Federal Ministry of Health.\n\n\u201cAnd the Incident Commander, Governor has said that this a priority event and we have to ensure that we give SCOAN all the support it requires to make sure that the series of planned events for the funeral scheduled between the 5th of July to the 11th of July are performed under the strictness guidelines to limit any possibilities of introduction of foreign COVID variants amongst the congregation or the movement of the virus in such an environment that would make transmission easier.\n\n\u201cSo, we\u2019ve engaged with several stakeholders, we are looking at the airport, we are looking at the land borders, we are looking at event preceding the five or seven days of the funeral, we are looking at the funeral activities itself, we have a detailed account of the programme, we are putting some guidelines in place.\n\n\u201cAny visitor coming into the country has to go through the mandatory seven days of isolation plus testing before they can participate in any of the activities. We\u2019ve inspected all the accommodation, we\u2019ve looked at the auditorium and we\u2019ve calculated how to completely eliminate the chance and the risk of infectious transmission.\u201d",

          "text": "The mother of the 14-year-old girl killed allegedly by a stray bullet during the Yoruba Nation rally in Lagos on Saturday has expressed sorrow on receiving the news of her daughter\u2019s death.\n\nAgitators for Yoruba self-determination had gathered at the Gani Fawehinmi Park in Ojota amid the presence of armed policemen and soldiers.\n\nThis was after the Lagos State Commissioner of Police, CP Hakeen Odumosu, had addressed newsmen at the venue, where he announced that no rally is allowed in the state.\n\nHowever, his announcement was defied by the agitators who flaunted their banners and chanted all sorts of slogans to express their determination towards the breakaway of the Yoruba group from Nigeria.\n\nThis displeased the security operatives at the venue who fired teargas canisters and used water cannons to disperse the crowd.\n\nThis didn\u2019t deter the agitators who returned to their converging point and carried on from where they left off.\n\nThe next action from the security operatives had everyone at the rally scampering to safety as gunshots sounded from different directions.\n\nWhen the situation became a bit calm, a young girl who was displaying drinks at a shop close by was seen lying in a pool of blood.\n\nShe was reported to have been hit by a stray bullet when security operatives were dispersing the crowd at the rally.\n\nReacting, the Lagos State Police Command issued a statement through the Public Relations Officer, Olamuyiwa Adejobi, denying that the girl died as a result of the actions of security operatives.\n\nAdejobi said, \u201cThe said corpse was found wrapped and abandoned at a distance, far from Ojota venue of the rally, behind MRS Filling Station, inward Maryland, on the other side of the venue, with dried blood stains suggesting that the corpse is not fresh.\n\n\u201cAfter a close look at the corpse, a wound suspectedly sustained from a sharp object was seen on it.\n\n\u201cThe news is false and mischievous. The Command, therefore, urges the general public to disregard the news and go about their lawful normal daily activities while investigation to unravel the incident will commence immediately.\u201d\n\nHowever, the umbrella body of Yoruba self-determination groups, Ilana Oodua, through a statement by its Media Communications Secretary, Mr. Maxwell Adeleye, faulted the police for the young girl\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cWe want to inform the whole world that a stray bullet fired by officers of the Nigerian Police killed a yet-to-be-identified soft drinks seller at Ojota, venue of the Yoruba Nation rally held July 3rd, 2021,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, a video circulating on social media has shown a woman alleged to be the girl\u2019s mother weeping and inconsolable.\n\nSpeaking in Yoruba, the wailing mother said, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d as some people held her to prevent her from collapsing.\n\n\u201cMy life is ruined. I\u2019m already mourning a child at a young age. Who did this to me, oh God?\u201d She wailed on.",

However I grew up in Ibadan, Abeokuta, Ijebu Ode. I actually attended a lot of schools, this was because my late dad was a policeman, so we changed our schools a lot.

The perfect off-white colour can act as a backdrop for your living room decor while creating a cozy living environment.\n\n\n\nMUSTARD YELLOW\n\nPlay with colours in your living room by painting your walls with a warm, mustard yellow. While you might feel hesitant to paint your walls bright yellow, a dark shade of yellow can add a peaceful glow to your space.\n\n\n\nSHADES OF GREY\n\n\n\nWhile grey tones can come off cool and dreary, the right shade of grey will open up your living room and add a little silver lining to the space. Choose a lighter shade of grey for a feminine feel or go bold with a dramatic dark shade for the perfect neutral.\n\n\n\nRICH RED\n\n\n\nMake a statement by selecting a rich, deep red for your living room walls. If you\u2019re not ready to commit to an entirely red room, try painting an accent wall for a warm hint of red.\n\n\n\nSOFT BLUE\n\n\n\nSoft, light shades of blue bring an airy, relaxing vibe to a room. When sorting through living room colours to warm up your space, a pale shade of blue can appear cool, but still provide a calming atmosphere that is cozy and effortless.\n\n\n\nMOODY GREEN\n\nTraditionally, a dark green-hued space invites serenity and style to your space. Try mixing moody green paint into your living room for a hint of elegance that works well with neutral tones and rich browns, and experience the coziness.",

          "text": "The National Industrial Court, Abuja, has voided and nullified the dismissal of one Ayeni Moses Akinwande from the federal government-owned Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSTF) on grounds of illegality and denial of fair hearing.\n\nJustice Obaseki Osaghae, while voiding the dismissal carried out on February 15, 2017, declared it unlawful, illegal, null and void and of no effect having been effected in breach of mandatory laws on employment\n\nDelivering judgment in the suit marked NICN/ABJ/57/2020 instituted on March 4, 2020, Justice Osaghae held that the Staff Regulations Rule 06.02 was violated in dismissing the plaintiff, a Deputy Manager of the NSTF while on admission at the Ekiti State University Teaching Hospital for health challenges.\n\nThe court held that the Acting Managing Director, who dismissed the plaintiff through a letter issued by one Grace Benson, an Assistant General Manager of NSTF in 2017, lacked the requisite powers to do so in the face of the provisions of laws guiding employment.\n\nAmong others, the court found an indisputable fact that the plaintiff was in hospital for two weeks and that an excuse letter was duly issued and served on his employer by the hospital.\n\nJustice Osaghae also found as fact that the plaintiff was not issued with a query or be made to appear before any disciplinary committee before his dismissal thereby breaching section 36 of the 1999 Constitution in denying him fair hearing as claimed by the plaintiff.\n\nThe court also held that the nature of the allegation of \u201cserious misconduct \u201d used to justify the dismissal was not explained in the dismissal letter and in the defence filed by the NSTF and its Management Board who are the 1st and 2nd defendants respectively in the matter.\n\nJustice Osaghae said that rather than addressing the issues of potent laws raised by the plaintiff to fault his dismissal, the defendants only challenged the jurisdiction of the court in the use of originating summons instead of complaints in a matter relating to labour and employment issues.\n\nAccording to the Judge since none of the averments of the plaintiff are challenged or controverted, they are deemed admitted in the face of the law and therefore held that the purported dismissal of the plaintiff without following due process of law was liable to be nullified and set aside.\n\nJustice Osaghae consequently granted all the reliefs sought by the plaintiff against the defendants with declarations.\n\nThe Judge declared the letter with reference No. NSITF/Aa/8854/10/TR dated 15/2/17 and which dismissed the plaintiff as illegal, null and void and of no effect having been issued by an inappropriate authority/person or official of the defendants, in total disregard of the provisions of Rule 06.02 of the defendant\u2019s extant Staff Regulations and Conditions of Service Handbook.\n\nHe set aside the letter of the purported dismissal and reinstated the plaintiff to the service immediately.\n\nThe court also declared that the appropriate authority/person, entity or official of the defendants that can dismiss the claimant from the service or employment of the defendants, in compliance with Rule 06.02 of the defendant\u2019s extant Staff Regulations and Conditions of Service Handbook, is the Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund Management Board, or the Management Board delegating the power of dismissal to the Managing Director.\n\nThe court further declared that the Acting Managing Director or any official acting in his stead is not the appropriate person or authority under Rule 06.02 of the defendants\u2019 Staff Regulation and Conditions of Service Handbook, so conferred with powers of dismissal of the claimant.\n\nJustice Osaghae declared that the claimant\u2019s employment with the defendant subsisted and remained unbroken with all the rights and privileges of his office and with no loss of seniority.\n\nHe also ordered the defendants to pay the claimant within 30 days all his outstanding salaries, allowances, emoluments and all other perks or increment arising or attached to his position as Deputy Manager, or arising or attached to the current positions enjoyed by his colleagues from the 13th February 2017, till date.\n\nThe defendants were further ordered to place the claimant in the same position as his colleagues who were Deputy Managers when his employment was unlawfully terminated.\n\nA cost of N100,000.00 was awarded to be paid to the claimant by the defendants.\n\nAkinwande had through his counsel, Mr Ibrahim Idris dragged NSTF to court to challenge his summary dismissal from work without following due process of law.\n\nHe prayed the court to void the purported summary dismissal, order his reinstatement to his rightful position and payment of salaries and emoluments of the five years of his unlawful sack which the court granted.\n\nThe defendants through their counsel, Rita Adie challenged the jurisdiction of the court on the ground that the plaintiff used originating summons instead of complaints and sought dismissal of the suit.\n\nJustice Osaghae however invoked section 7 of the Industrial Court Act 2006 and section 254 (c) of the 1999 Constitution to assume jurisdiction on the ground that there was no substantial or material dispute of facts to necessitate the use of complaints, pleadings and oral evidence.\n\nHe disagreed that the plaintiff violated order 3 Rule 7 of the court in using originating summons and dismissed the challenge to the court jurisdiction.",

          "text": "By Rita Okoye\n\nNollywood actress, Chioma Grace Ifemeludike has recounted the challenges she encountered as a celebrity.\n\nIn this interview, the Jos, Plateau State-born movie star shares the good, the bad and the ugly sides of her sojourn in the movie industry. Enjoy it.\n\nWhat do you consider your pains and gains as an actress?\n\nI have paid my dues. There were times that challenges of sexual harassment came. I had dated one or two guys in Nollywood, but I didn\u2019t date them because I wanted to act. These are people that I felt emotionally attached to, and along the line, something happened. There were also people who approached me for sex for roles, but I couldn\u2019t start sleeping with everyone. There were times I made mistakes in the course of my career, but I made sure I held my dignity at least to a certain level that I could defend.\n\nBasically, people judge you for what they see and not for who you are. For instance, you could borrow a car and attend shows and you gain respect. Some years back, I didn\u2019t have a car, but I had a voice. But then it can\u2019t be amplified. Back then, they saw me as just a random girl, but I knew I would get there because I kept pushing. Challenges in the industry are so many, from sexual harassment to not being treated fairly, and being belittled. I went through psychological harassment. I know some people are still going through the same thing. It has also been gainful; I\u2019m not going to deny that. Being in the spotlight or being identified as an actor or influential, people tend to see you as someone who has edge over others. I have made wonderful friends and I count that as great gains.\n\nDespite the high rate of marital crisis in the industry, are you scared of marriage?\n\nNever. I am not scared. I love the concept of marriage and I think the concept is spiritually, physically and relevantly important. Family is the smallest unit of the society; it shouldn\u2019t be undermined or underestimated. I love the idea of having people to nurture, train and care for. You never know what the nation would need them for and you watch yourself creating humans that are helpful, impacting and innovative. I am not afraid of marriage. When I was younger, I almost ventured into marriage, but it didn\u2019t work out. I have been so scared, I don\u2019t want to fail my God, children or husband, and yes I am ready for marriage. Being a celebrity doesn\u2019t stop me from going home to cook, then do other things that I was taught as an Igbo child. My culture requires I\u2019m respectful to my husband and family, and saying sorry when I am wrong.\n\nAs a single lady, do you experience lonely nights?\n\nI don\u2019t experience lonely, cold nights. I am in a very serious relationship. I\u2019m in a relationship where I\u2019m friend with my boyfriend. We are very close for quite a while now. For some good reasons, he\u2019s been around, although he doesn\u2019t stay in the country. So, I can\u2019t remember the last time I had a cold night. For me, it\u2019s been warm nights all through.\n\nCan a man control you?\n\nNot that I can\u2019t be controlled, I can be controlled if the person I\u2019m in a relationship with understands the point that we need balance and freedom. It shouldn\u2019t be control, but guidance. If you have someone you love that is an adult, then advise her not control.\n\nWhat\u2019s your take on liposuction?\n\nBig boobs and backsides are now the new beauty regimes. The hourglass body is what every girl in Nigeria wants. I think it\u2019s low self-esteem. I don\u2019t have any issue with liposuction because it\u2019s a personal issue. I respect every person who chooses to do so, but personally I feel it starts from low self-esteem. I have awkward front teeth, and growing up, I have always felt low. If tomorrow I arrange it that means I feel less confident in myself. The same thing applies to bleaching. If you are proud of your skin colour, you would be like Chimamanda (Adiche), Ini Edo; these are brown skin girls who are standing on their feet, looking at the world with the gold girl attitude. But a lot of girls who have beautiful skins go to change it probably because they don\u2019t love the way they are. If you have money, go for it, but bear it in mind that you weren\u2019t confident on how God created you.\n\nDid you have any awkward experience that almost made you to dump acting?\n\nWhen you are doing a job and you see that the earnings do not match your expenditures, it becomes frustrating. How can the work you put so much energy, time and passion into not pay you enough to take care of yourself? For the past three years, I have been asking myself that if I had devoted this energy, time, resources in the banking sector, would I not be a branch manager by now?\n\nNowadays, girls are buying big, luxury cars that they post on social media; what\u2019s stopping you from getting your own?\n\nI haven\u2019t been able to buy any of such luxury cars. I have told myself that one day I would ask somebody, because the cars I see online are just so intimidating. They include Range Rover, Benz and the likes. Sometimes I ask myself if it\u2019s my village people that are behind my slow progress. I\u2019m a very strong, spiritual person. I\u2019m not religious, but then I put my head down. I would get there; its the reassurance that keeps me going.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

Has government adjusted the delivery deadline?\n\nIt is true that we have had to readjust the timeliness for the completion because of COVID-19. Not only because of the time we lost, but because of the way people have to work and also because of the limited number of people because social distancing rules still apply at our construction site because we are not out of it yet. So, I plan to pay a visit, to inspect the project. But we are looking at the second quarter of next year. There are still so many variables. Some of the variables may not be visible to you. We are moving transmission lines. To move those transmission lines, you have to shut down power. We have to do it in collaboration with Ministry of Power and the Transmission Company of Nigeria. So, it is not just the road. There are so many other things like compensation, relocation. There are lots of things we are responding to.\n\nAre you not worried about trailers parking on the bridges in Lagos?\n\nWell, we are worried about it and that is why I said earlier that we are compelled to address so much at the same time. The president is so clear in his mind that unless you quickly bridge this infrastructure gap, it is going to be difficult to release the energy of Nigeria. Once the roads are better, the train is moving, airports are bigger and more comfortable, there will be energy and so on and so forth. Our economy is growing, but the port in Lagos was built in 1975. What was our population then? What was our GDP? The best way I will explain it to people is that in 1975, I was 13. So, I am now 58. So, that is 43 years after. So, imagine me at 43 trying to wear the jeans I was wearing when I was 13. It is going to be uncomfortable. That is the discomfort we feel now. Until we have port expansion, it is going to be uncomfortable. That is why you see the government aggressively pushing the Lekki Port. That is what will give relief. The trailers don\u2019t want to park on the bridge. They want to go into the ports. They want to drop cargo or pick up cargo, but there\u2019s a queue because the place is not large enough. The turnaround is not quick enough to process them. Then, unfortunately, the road that used to evacuate the ports -the Apapa-Oworonshki Road \u2013 had collapsed; even going to the port through Oshodi/Mile 2 had collapsed when we came in. Now, the road to evacuate the port is not through the city road. Because that road had collapsed, you see them coming through the city and then, on the bridge. Apapa, through Mile 2, to Tollgate, is quicker for them than to come through Western Avenue. So, they will soon go back to that road because we are working, through another Public Private Partnership arrangement to finish that road. So, you need to understand why. We know that there have been some wear and tear on the bridge. But, there is a contract to rehabilitate them. So, it is a tough turf. Do we close down the ports? Or what do we do? As we do the repairs, the Ministry of Transportation, under Rotimi Amaechi, is now bringing the rail to the ports. So, that is the final solution; not just the expansion of the ports to take the cargo off the road. So, we are heading there.\n\nWhat then is the solution to Lagos-Badagry Expressway, a major economic gateway for Nigeria that is now in shambles because you started the rehabilitation as governor?\n\nAs I\u2019ve told you, we have dozens of projects. I can\u2019t remember everything offhand. And I represent Lagos in the Federal cabinet, but my work is across the whole of the country. So, I disagree with you that Lagos-Badagry is in shambles. This is the point. I think we have to be specific. Lagos-Badagry is about 50 something kilometres. Is it the whole road that is in shambles? That is the point. This is what helps us. If you tell us specifically this is where it pains, it helps us in addressing the point of pain. It is like saying \u2018I have a headache,\u2019 but instead of saying that I have a headache, you are saying the whole body is paining me. How do you get a good treatment? So, I get the point. Yes, you are right. I started that project as governor and we got approval to do it. We have done up to the first 20 kilometres to Okokomaiko. We ran into some difficulty around that area because of the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation pipeline. But, I can tell you we have since awarded the remaining sections. We have a contractor there now. The contractor has been there since two years ago. Now, we are facing the same problem. I agree with you it is a very strategic road. That is the Lagos-Abidjan Highway. Actually, it is one of the 12 trans-Saharan African highways. About four of them pass through Nigeria. That is one of them that links Lagos to Abidjan through Ghana through Benin Republic. So, we have awarded the contract now. It is funds challenge first of all. So, we are trying to see if we can move that project into the Sukuk. You see, it is a fallout of so many things at the same time. But the important thing to also note is that people are focused on pavement. But the real problem is the drainage. So, we are constructing the drainage from the Badagry end to town because the character of the road has changed from the 1970s. There were no houses, no shops, no malls at that time. So, right now, the road can\u2019t drain. So, it is just a matter of finance.\n\nAs a Senior Advocate of Nigeria and now a politician, do you see politics through the prism of law?\n\nThere is no aspect of human endeavour that is not regulated by law. I can\u2019t think of anything. There are some things you can\u2019t publish. It can become defamatory of somebody. What you wear is regulated by law. You can\u2019t get up and say that you can\u2019t wear clothes. What you eat is regulated by law. Who you marry is regulated by law. To that extent all the bridges we are talking about are regulated by law. Everything we do. So, why are we complying with COVID-19 protocols? It is because it is a law. So, that mindset helps me in my job. You are building a house, there are specifications on how you mix your cement. It is a law. Even the politics you are talking about is law. You must have a political party. Law is everywhere in human endeavour. Law separates us from animals.\n\nThere is an unwritten agreement between the North and the South with regards to the Presidency. Which region should take it after Buhari?\n\nYou are the one telling me.\n\nThere is an unwritten agreement between the North and South?\n\nYou are the one telling me.\n\nIn your first term, you managed three ministries. In your second coming, you are managing two. How do you feel? Are you relieved?\n\nWell, it\u2019s two, it was three and then it\u2019s one, it\u2019s zero.\n\nHow do you feel right now?\n\nI feel it\u2019s two.\n\nWhat is your relationship with Lagos APC and Asiwaju Bola Tinubu?\n\nLagos APC\u2026we are cool\n\nWith Asiwaju?\n\nWe are cool.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "title": "Big lessons I learnt from politics \u2013Dr Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu",
          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nChief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu is a typical example of jack of all trades and master of all, having excelled in the field of sports, airline, politics, main professional calling, engineering and many more.\n\nHe spoke to Sunday Sun on wide range of issues comprising Igbo presidency, his journey into politics, why he can no longer accept any appointive or elective positions, his biggest regret in life, why Nigeria is not country of his dream, the escalating insecurity in the Southeast and the secret of his successes in many areas of human endeavour.\n\nHow will you describe your journey into politics, rough, tough, smooth?\n\nI became a politician by accident because by profession, I am an engineer and scientist. It is a profession I love so much, that elevated me and even gave me money. What happened was that when the then military president, Ibrahim Babangida, lifted ban on political activities, many of the old Igbo politicians were still banned and there was nobody to represent the Igbo. Ekwueme was among the foremost Igbo politicians that people hoped Shehu Shagari would hand over to him in line with what was mutually agreed. But Ekwueme was among those Babangida clamped ban on. I was the only person people considered to have the resources, credibility and the reach to be able to carry the political mantle of the Igbo race. That was how I actually came into politics and when the ban on political activities was lifted, I was more or less compelled then to join political association. I must also say that I have tremendous support from the Igbo, Yoruba, Hausa and across every ethnic nationalities in the country. The Igbo leaders at that time, the leadership of Ohanaeze spearheaded by the trio of Jerome Udoji, Francis Ibiam and Prof Nwabueze, took me to Nnamdi Azikiwe, the greatest political figure of Igbo extraction then, for endorsement. Most prominent traditional rulers were also part of the delegation to kick-start that my entry into politics. Our political association metamorphosed into a political party, the NRC, and because I was planning to run for the presidency, I didn\u2019t contest the position of the party\u2019s national chairmanship. Tom Ikimi eventually emerged the chairman. I contested the primaries under the then popular Option A4, but Adamu Ciroma emerged the party\u2019s candidate despite my winning substantially in some states. We finally agreed that I will be the running mate to Ciroma, but surprisingly, the presidency made announcement banning all of us. It practically threw us out of the party, creating room for Bashir Tofa to emerge our party\u2019s presidential candidate. After the election, Abiola\u2019s SDP won. But we resolved that instead of instituting legal action, we are going to support Abiola even though we know that there were irregularities like in every election. Since we are very keen to get democracy back, we agreed to support whoever wins. However, the election was annulled. I still contested for president a number of times, totalling three. I can tell you that politics is like infectious madness, once you start, you won\u2019t know when to stop. My final attempt to contest president was in 1999 under the platform of APP. The Igbo have strong aspirants in both APP and PDP with names like Alex Ekwueme and myself, but then the military hierarchy had made up their minds that the presidency must go to Yoruba land to compensate them for the Abiola June 12 debacles. There was, however, no Yoruba candidate in our party strong enough to win the ticket. They pleaded with me, but I told them that I won\u2019t surrender the ticket to anybody. They manoeuvred the system and brought Ogbonnia Onu. I don\u2019t know what they told him, but it was shocking how somebody who lost the governorship ticket in Ebonyi State to Sam Egwu could become the presidential candidate of our party. We have not even voted when they announce him winner. I left Kaduna, the venue of our primaries disappointed and finally joined the PDP. I have remained with the PDP ever since. Interestingly, while Onu was still jubilant and hopeful that he was going to run, they replaced him with Onu Falae as the party candidate. He was really disappointed too.\n\nWill it be right to say that you met your target going into politics?\n\nNo. I did not meet my target and I don\u2019t feel fulfilled as such because I did not win any election to actualise my dream of making the country a better place. Nigeria is nowhere a better society. It seems the country is even worse today than what it was then. I am not a happy man because there is no change. In fact, this is not the Nigeria of my dream.\n\nWhy have you not left the PDP to join the APC?\n\nI have been in the PDP since 1999. Today, I am the oldest person in the Board of Trustee of the PDP and I am also the oldest person in the NEC of the PDP. I am 79 years going to 80 years next year. At the moment, I am the chairman, Elders Council of Ohanaeze Ndigbo and by that position, I should be non-partisan. So, even if I leave the PDP today, I am not going to join any other party because firstly, I am too old at 80 to run for any election, I won\u2019t accept any political appointment and I can only do the job of Ohanaeze or other responsibility within my community and state as well. I won\u2019t join any party now, but I will be very happy if our people will address certain issues concerning the youths in politics. At the appropriate time, I will give advice to younger politicians on what I think they should do to make politics a huge success.\n\nIs Igbo presidency in 2023 a mission possible?\n\nThe truth about Igbo presidency is that younger generation of Igbo are losing their self-esteem. They feel that something is wrong because it is not only the challenge of presidency that they are facing. One of my sons had asked me why the Southeast should have five states while other geographical zones have six? I had difficulty answering that question and it is the embarrassment we constantly get from the young generation of Igbo. This is among the things I believe our political leaders can handle and there will be no problem if they are handled. There must be ethnic balancing especially in Nigeria with multi-ethnic and religious group to ensure that everybody feels accommodated. Igbo presidency is not all that matters. In fact, you will be surprised that the Igbo president may not even be the person to solve the various agitations from the region. After all, the northern part of Nigeria has produced presidency more than other regions but it does not reflect much in the development of the area. The fact is that if anybody tells you that Igbo presidency will do miracle in the Southeast or Igboland, the person must be lying. He is going to work with the constitution and all eyes will be on him. The only good thing in Igbo presidency is that it is going to be a psychological boost for the younger generation, feeling that they too can assume the highest position in the land. It will be against their current feelings that they cannot aspire for the position of presidency once you are an Igbo person. That is what we must try to avoid.\n\nWhat is the biggest lesson you learnt in politics?\n\nI learnt so many lessons in politics. Even though I did not win in the previous attempts I made, I will not say that my journey into politics was a waste. It was a very useful enterprise I ventured into. Without my involvement in political activities, I will not have had the kind of influence I have today. I enjoy enormous influence across all parts of the country. I am very highly respected regarded and equally appreciated by the youths across the country. I have been honoured three times by the Federal Government because they know and worked with me. I am a very detribalised person and have been able to work very well with persons from different tribes and religions. I am one person that can work and produce result across barrier of ethnicity and religion. I will encourage anybody who can go into politics because it is a good venture regardless of whether you win or loss. I don\u2019t regret going into politics even though it is very expensive and costs me so much money.\n\nWhat is the way forward to the insecurity in the Southeast?\n\nI don\u2019t actually want to talk about that now because it is very complex. I believe that the situation will soon be brought under control.\n\nWhat is the secret of your successes in multifaceted areas like politics, sports, airline, publishing and engineering?\n\nIt boils down to leadership because I found that out early in my life. I started with class prefect because I was very humble and quiet. I was also academically very bright which attracted me to many of my teachers. I believe more in actions than words. More importantly, I learnt how to use the best hands to achieve results. I went for the best hands when I established my airline. I paid them well and allowed them to run the business. When I went into publishing, I did the same, employing best brain in journalism with Henry Odukumaya as the first Managing Director of Champions newspaper. In most cases, especially in engineering, I employed expatriates when I could not get Nigerians to manage. I know that how to run business is basically having good staff. I appointed board of directors who may not be equity holders in the company, but I remunerate them very well and gave them some bonus share sometimes. This method made me to prosper and most times, I could be sleeping and people will be happily working for me because they know that they are working for themselves too.\n\nWhat do you consider your biggest regret in life?\n\nThis is a very deep question that I may not answer in haste. I cannot actually point at anything I will single out as my biggest regret, but I can say that the saddest period of my life was when I lost my wife, Lady Uduora Iwuanyanwu. She was a very good woman and my girlfriend in the university. We courted for six years before we got married. We were married for over 40 years before she died. I was shattered and devastated. However, when I prayed God to give me another comforter, He gave my present wife, Nonye, who has proved to be very good. She has a very adorable son I gave the name Emmanuel having seen all my reflexes in him.\n\nHow do you want to be remembered?\n\nI want to be remembered for what I have done to give happiness to humanity and improve the world. My greatest ambition is to make the world better than I met it and I have been able to do that. I feel completely fulfilled and accomplished. I am not a very rich person, but I have been able to have enough to carry out my philanthropic work. I have trained over 5,000 persons in higher institutions. I have been able to build structures in many schools, universities, medical institutions, churches and many more. I made substantial contributions in the building of the Anglican cathedral in Owerri and singlehanded built the one in my dioceses where I spent over N1 billion. I built a blood bank in Imo State when there was nowhere to get blood many years ago and the ones sourced elsewhere were affecting the people. The good news is that the Federal Government has taken it over and expanded it. Another thing that gives me joy is the Imo Airport. It was my brainchild because I conceived the idea and presented it to then military administrator, General Ike Nwachukwu, a man with amazing leadership qualities. The government did not have money to build it, but he was able to galvanise the Imo communities comprising the present day Abia, Imo and some parts of Ebonyi states that started to build the airport. It was largely built by community contribution. After creating Abia, I had to give out N2 million in the name of Owerri zone when the project ran into a hitch. I had to transfer $2 million from my account in New York to be able to make it up. That time, Naira was stronger than Dollar. My interest in airline business was just to make Imo Airport to function. They had refused to open it after completion. They insisted that we had to get an airline. I had a private jet I usually use to shuttle Nigeria and my offices in New York and London, but not an airline. I had to procure four Aircraft that I started the Oriental Airline with just to facilitate the opening of the Imo Airport. Graham Douglas, the then Aviation Minister helped me to secure the operating licence. My entry attracted the like of Okada, Kabo, among others. It was not profitable initially until later. When they all joined I had to stop the airline business because I was not actually interested in it, but I just floated it to make sure Imo Airport becomes operational. I also feel fulfilled that I started Champion newspaper.\n\nWhen was the turning point of your life?\n\nWell, the turning point of my life was when I was able to execute some contracts as an engineer. I did lots of things like designing of bridges, I also established companies into production, but essentially, engineering actually gave me a lot of my money.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "title": "New Draft Electoral Law Bars Electronic Transfer of Results",
          "text": "\u2022Lawmakers set for showdown this week\n\nDeji Elumoye and Chuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nA new Electoral Act Amendment Bill which provides for total ban of electronic transmission of votes is to be introduced at the Senate next Tuesday.\n\nThe provision forms part of the 121-page document to be laid before the upper legislative chamber at plenary by the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Senator Kabir Gaya.\n\nThe proposed piece of legislation is titled \u201cA Bill for an Act to repeal the Electoral Act No 6, 2010 and enact the Electoral Act 2021, to regulate the conduct of Federal, State and Area Councils in the Federal Capital Territory elections, and for related matters\u201d.\n\nBut this current draft, which is said to be at variance with what was earlier agreed to by the committees of the two chambers of the legislature, THISDAY gathered, might result in a showdown amongst the lawmakers, when the draft is tabled for debate this week.\n\nThis is as the Senate Committee chaired by Senator Kabiru Gaya was said to have concluded plans to clear Ms. Laureate Onochie as an INEC national commissioner.\n\nThe bill, which has 153 sections, is divided into eight parts including Establishment and function, etc of INEC, Staff of the Commission, National register of Voters and Voters\u2019 education and procedure at election.\n\nOther parts of the bill are political parties, Electoral Offences, determination of election petitions arising from election petitions and Miscellaneous.\n\nThe draft bill, a copy of which was sighted by THISDAY, allowed for electronic voting by secret ballot but ruled out electronic transmission of the votes cast at the poling units.\n\nThis is contained on Page 25 of the document and subtitled procedure at election under Section 50(2) of bill which states: \u201cVoting at an election under this bill shall be in accordance with the procedure determined by the Commission (INEC) which may include electronic voting provided that the Commission shall not transmit results of election by electronic means\u201d.\n\nAccording to section. 50 (2) of the new draft, \u201cVoting at an election under this Bill shall be in accordance with the procedure determined by the Commission, which may include electronic voting, PROVIDED that the Commission shall not transmit results of election by electronic means\u201d.\n\nThe draft bill further stated that, \u201cVoting at an election under this Bill shall be by open secret ballot\u201d and that \u201cA voter on receiving a ballot paper shall mark it in the manner prescribed by the Commission.\n\n\u201cAll ballots at an election under this Bill at any polling station shall be deposited in the ballot box in the open view of the public.\n\n\u201cNo voter shall vote for more than one candidate or record more than one vote in favour of any candidate at any one election. (2)Where the number of votes cast at an election in any polling unit exceeds the number of accredited voters in that polling unit, the Presiding Officer shall cancel the result of the election in that polling unit.\n\n\u201cWhere the result of an election is cancelled in accordance with subsection (2), there shall be no return for the election until another poll has taken place in the affected polling unit.(4)Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (2) and (3), the Commission may, if satisfied that the result of the election will not substantially be affected by voting in the area where the election is cancelled, direct that a return of the election be made.\n\n\u201cWhere a voter makes any writing or mark on a ballot paper by which he or she may be identified, such ballot paper shall be rejected provided that any print resulting from the staining of the thumb of the voter in the voting compartment shall not be or be deemed to be a mark of identification under this section.\n\n\u201cThe Commission shall use indelible ink for any thumb mark by voters on ballot papers\u201d, the draft bill stated.\n\nTHISDAY findings revealed that this clause was sneaked into the draft bill by some leaders of the legislature without the knowledge of the committee members.\n\nA ranking Senator and member of the Senate committee on INEC, upon enquiry, told THISDAY that at no time was that provision discussed at the committee level talk less of inserting it in the draft bill.\n\nThe Senator, who spoke on condition of anonymity said, he now understood why the delay in presenting the bill after the committee had long concluded its work.\n\nHis words: \u201cThis is not funny at all. I now know why the presentation of the report had been delayed this long after we finished our work at the committee level. They have been playing hide and seek on the matter.\n\n\u201cFor all I know and other committee members can bear me witness, the issue of ban on electronic transfer of votes was not part of the report we wrote. So, that means the committee Chairman is culpable and owes the committee members an explanation over the strange insertion\u201d.\n\nThe bill, which has been in the works for some time would be laid before the Senate next Tuesday by Chairman of the Senate Committee on INEC, Senator Gaya.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that the bill would then be scheduled for debate on Wednesday with the former governor of Kano State and committee Chairman, Senator Gaya, leading the debate by summarising the provisions of the bill.\n\nHowever, the bill may run into crisis as there are plans by some Senators especially, members of the Senate Committee on INEC to oppose the strange clause included in the draft.\n\nTHISDAY gathered at the weekend that the Senators had already begun to reach out to their colleagues, explaining that they were not part of the inserted clause.\n\nThey have, therefore, pledged to resist the clause banning electronic transmission of votes cast during the general debate of the bill this Wednesday.\n\nIn a related development, despite the protests against the person of Ms Onochie, the source claimed the Senator Gaya-led committee has concluded plans to approve her appointment as an INEC national commissioner.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Marafa: Buni\u2019s chairmanship illegal, threatens court action\n\n\u2022Kyari: Matawalle can\u2019t be our leader, Buni lacks power to dissolve EXCO\n\n\u2022PDP says defector gov\u2019s statement confirms APC is behind insecurity\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja and Sylvester Idowu in Warri\n\nLast week\u2019s defection of Governor Bello Matawalle from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC) has set off a new leadership struggle in Zamfara States as Senator Kabiru Marafa and former Governor Abdul-Aziz Yari have opposed a directive that the defector governor has automatically become the leader of APC in the state.\n\nSenator Kabir Marafa contended that the APC constitution in section 17(4) forbade Governor Mai Mala Buni from being the chairman of APC.\n\nHe also said he had told President Muhammadu Buhari of the banana peel on the path of Buni as chairman of APC, threatening legal actions for his continued stay in office as APC Chairman.\n\nAccording to Marafa, \u201cYou see, let me tell you something that is likely to happen, as far as I\u2019m concerned. APC should let the sleeping dog lie. Mai Mala Buni, the chairman, doesn\u2019t have the powers under the constitution to make certain pronouncements and that is number one.\n\n\u201cNumber two, issues will come up and we are going to challenge even the legality of his being a chairman of APC. When you look at our APC Constitution, sections 17 sub 4 in particular forbids Mai Mala from being the chairman of the party. I have warned.\n\n\u201cI have alerted Mr President a long time ago that, we should be very wary of these banana peels, because if things are pushed to their limits, there will be consequences. Now when you push a man to the wall, definitely he is going to fight back. So, we are going to ask these fundamental questions, when the need arises to do so,\u201d he said.\n\nSpecifically, Marafa said there was no APC in Zamfara and no governor for the state now.\n\nSpeaking on Arise TV network, Marafa, who had earlier taken APC to court, resulting in the disqualification of the party in the 2019 governorship election said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have any governor for now,\u201d insisting that Matawalle\u2019s defection violated the 2019 Supreme Court Judgement.\n\nOn his part, Yari too has rejected Mataealle as the leader of APC in the state.\n\nFeaturing on BBC Hausa Service, Yari rejected Buni\u2019s declaration, saying Matawalle was not the leader of the party.\n\nSpeaking after a meeting with the Kaduna State Governor, Malam Nasir El-Rufai, Yari said; \u201cIt\u2019s one thing that we are challenging which is the declaration by Governor Mai Mala. His declaration was not part of what we discussed with six governors before he (Matawalle) defected.\n\n\u201cWhat we all agreed during our meeting with the six governors was that Matawalle should be received into our fold and afterwards we should discuss how to integrate both his people and ours. But during the defection, we were told that the party executives should be dissolved. You just don\u2019t dissolve executives of a party, because nobody has the power to do so,\u201d Yari said.\n\nCorroborating this, Marafa said the declaration of Matawalle as the leader of the party in the state was tantamount to deception, insisting that they would not accept it.\n\n\u201cWe said for proper integration, there should be a meeting for proper consultations but all of a sudden, announcement was made that the party executives had been dissolved and someone was named as leader of our party. This is incorrect,\u201d he maintained.\n\nMeanwhile, the PDP has said the claim by Matawalle, that he joined the APC in order to get the federal government to end insecurity in his state, reinforced public\u2019s stance that the APC and its government were responsible for the banditry, terrorism and kidnapping ravaging the state.\n\nAccording to the PDP, stating that now that he has finally joined the APC, he would \u201chave the full backing of the federal government to fight insecurity\u201d, further exposed that the APC was never committed to fighting insecurity but apparently fueling it for political gains.\n\nPDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan said, the statement by Governor Matawalle further confirmed that the APC has been promoting insecurity particularly, terrorism and kidnapping for ransom, in various parts of the country as a way to create an emergency situation to cover their atrocities, siphon public funds as well as intimidate and coerce state governors elected on the platform of other political parties to join their fold.\n\nThe PDP recalled how Matawalle had been under pressure by the APC-led federal government with the imposition of no flight as well as threats of state of emergency in the state.\n\n\u201cNigerians now know those behind the violent abductions, kidnapping and other acts of terrorism in the state and other parts of the country as well as why the situation has continued to escalate under the APC.\n\n\u201cIt is indeed atrocious and most unpardonable that the APC is using the blood of innocent and helpless Nigerians for its political gains as well as to create a gory merchandise for its leaders and cronies,\u201d he said.\n\nPDP held that by this claim, it was clear that Matawalle did not defect to the APC, because the party has any democratic credential as erroneously claimed by the APC national leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, but only surrendered to intimidation and cowardly joined those behind the killings and acts of violence in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOf course, the APC as a party of political bandits, does not have any democratic credential to attract well-meaning and patriotic Nigerians.\n\n\u201cGovernor Matawalle must, however, note that joining such individuals, who have brought so much anguish and pain to his people, is an unpardonable act of betrayal which will continue to act as an albatross particularly, against the backdrop of his own vows,\u201d the PDP said.\n\nOn the reclaiming of the governorship mandate, the PDP described Matawalle\u2019s boast as the feeble kick of a disoriented and confused deserter, stressing that the 1999 Constitution (as amended) is clear on the responsibilities of a deputy governor that finds himself under an absconding governor like Matawalle.\n\nIn Delta State, a former governorship aspirant of the PDP, Chief Sunny Onuesoke said yesterday that defection was no solution to the myriads of problems confronting the nation at the moment.\n\nOnuesoke, who spoke while reacting to the series of defections across party lines by political office holders said those doing so with prevailing social and security problems across the country were callous and wicked.\n\n\u201cDefection is no solution to the myriads of problems facing the country at the moment, Nigerians are hungry. For the past five, six years, Nigerians have been subjected to untold hardship and hunger due to the incompetent handling of governance by those entrusted with such responsibilities, instead of increase in living standard, Nigerians are experiencing massive decrease, Prices of basic commodities have shot astronomically high from what was obtainable in the past.\n\n\u201cThere have been lots of job losses with firms either downsizing or folding up completely. Nigerians cannot sleep with their two eyes closed due to insecurity occasioned by the activities of marauding killer herdsmen, bandit and kidnappers, which is currently ravaging every facet of our national life.\n\n\u201cInstead of looking for ways to salvage the situation, politicians from both the ruling party APC and the opposition PDP are busy crisscrossing between political parties like political prostitutes\u201d Onuesoke stated.\n\nThe former governorship aspirant called on politicians to wake up and face the reality of tackling the problems facing the country instead of pursuing their selfish and personal interest.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says govt must be sincere in handling the issues\n\nSylvester Idowu in Warri\n\nA former leader of the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND), Chief Government Ekpemupolo otherwise known as Tompolo, has warned the federal government over palpable tension and fear in the region, following the inability of the government to constitute a substantive board for the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC).\n\nTompolo, who has continued to appeal to the agitators and stakeholders in the region to sustain the existing peace in the region, said it was important for the federal government to quickly accede to their request as well as handle issues of development in the region with sincerity.\n\nTompolo, the Ibe-Ebidouwei of Ijaw Nation, who made the appeal on Friday night in a statement he personally signed, however, accused multinational oil companies of conspiracies with the federal government.\n\nThe Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, had promised stakeholders and agitators in the region that President Muhammadu Buhari would inaugurate a new board for the interventionist agency in June.\n\nThe promise by Akpabio on behalf of the federal government was not kept as at June ending thereby fueling tension in the now relatively peaceful Niger Delta region.\n\nHowever, in spite of government\u2019s failure, Tompolo appealed to the people of the region to exercise patience, adding that the people of the region must avoid a renewed crisis.\n\nHe lamented that the people of the region were suffering as a result of government\u2019s failure to cater tothe welfare of her citizens, noting that the situation was not different in other parts of the country,where government had also failed them.\n\nThe Gbaramatu-born chief, in the statement titled: \u201cNiger Delta Agitators\u2019 Ultimatum to the Federal Government of Nigeria: A Call for Restrain\u201d reiterated his call for the urgent constitution of the board of the commission to arrest looming crisis in the region.\n\nHe noted that since the expiration of his ultimatum, he had been in constant touch with agitators and relevant stakeholders in the region on the need to keep the existing peace in the oil-rich region.\n\n\u201cIt has become expedient that I speak on the above subject matter. It could be recalled that I issued ultimatum to the Minister of the Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, the National Assembly and President Muhammadu Buhari to do the needful on the issue of the NDDC board by constituting the substantive board of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) as an urgent matter of public importance and interest to avoid a breakdown of law and order in the region, sometime ago.\n\n\u201cMy ultimatum led to a consultative meeting between major stakeholders from the region and Senator Godswill Akpabio in Oporoza town, where a truce was reached, as the Minister profusely pleaded that he should be allowed to start and fast-track the process of constituting the board within the month of June, 2021.\n\n\u201cJune 2021 has come to an end. The people of the region are yet to see any tangible move towards the constitution of the NDDC board by the federal government. The people are seriously agitated. There is palpable fear and tension in the region.\n\n\u201cI wish to reiterate my earlier position that, the government should as a matter of urgency, constitute the substantive board of the NDDC to avoid unnecessary bickering and crisis in the region.\n\n\u201cSince I reluctantly accepted the outcome of the consultative meeting, I have done so much to keep peace in the region which some major stakeholders in the security circle are aware of.\n\n\u201cI have been in constant touch with my fellow agitators in the region to give peace a chance, knowing full well that there cannot be any meaningful development in an atmosphere of rancor and acrimony.\n\n\u201cAs it stands now, the one thing the government must do in this issue is to be courageous enough to constitute the NDDC board. Government must be sincere in handling developmental issues in the Niger Delta region as the people have suffered enough, being neglected for several decades.\n\n\u201cThe truth of the matter is that there is so much bitterness in the land owing to the lackadaisical attitude of this government in handling matters of great importance to its citizens,\u201d Tompolo said.\n\nWhile prevailing on his colleagues to maintain the prevailing peace in the region, Tompolo declared:\u201cAs for my follow agitators, please permit me to borrow the biblical words of Jesus Christ, that we should be wise as serpent and gentle as dove to continue our agitation for a better living for our people.\n\n\u201cWe must avoid anything that may throw the only relatively peaceful region in the country now into chaos, because of government\u2019s nonchalant attitude towards the security and welfare of its citizenry as constitutionally provided.\n\n\u201cThe average Nigerian citizen is a government of his or her own as the citizens provide everything for themselves today. The government is unfair to a greater number of its citizens. The Nigerian Government must create an enabling environment for the citizens to live a prosperous and peaceful life.\u201d\n\nThe former MEND leader further accused multinational oil companies operating in the region of alleged conspiracy to further impoverished the people of oil-bearing communities by not performing their obligation to their hosts.\n\n\u201cMultinational oil companies operating in the Niger delta region are not left out in the troubles of the region. They are clearly part of the conspiracy in the marginalisation of the region. They must perform their statutory obligations to the people of the region by promptly delivering cooperate social responsivities to the people.\n\n\u201cMost of the companies are operating under the cover of the Nigerian Military, which has further exacerbated the relationship between Multinationals and their host communities. They must do their business in a most friendly atmosphere, and not to set neighbouring host communities against one another\u201d, Tompolo wrote in the statement.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Segun James\n\nThe scheduled Lagos mega rally by Yoruba nation agitators turned bloody yesterday as a 14-year-old girl was killed, apparently, by stray bullet from the Nigeria Police.\n\nThe rally could not hold on a large scale as planned because of heavy police presence at the Gani Fawehinmi Freedom Park, Ojota, a situation that led to a confrontation between the agitators and security agents.\n\nThe rally was planned by Yoruba activist, Mr. Sunday Adeyemo, popularly known as Sunday Igboho. But barely 24 hours before it was due to commence, the police denied the planners a permit. The police claimed the timing of the rally was wrong, as the state was still in pains following the huge destruction suffered during the last #EndSARS protests.\n\nThe girl, a yoghurt seller simply identified as Jumoke, was said to be running following gunshots by the police to disperse the protesters, when she was hit by stray bullet from the back. It was gathered that the girl was not part of the protest and efforts to speak to a man, who said he was the father of the girl, failed, as he declined speaking to the press.\n\nThe State Police Command is yet to react to the development.\n\nThe Yoruba activist, Sunday Igboho, did not come to the rally due to the refusal of the police to grant the marchers a permit.\n\nDespite the unfavourable disposition of the Nigeria Police to the agitation for Oduduwa Republic, protesters in Lagos and others from outside the state were able to gather at Ojota for the rally, dressed in traditional attires, with some decorated with charms. They voiced their position and declared they were tired of the Nigerian union.\n\nThe protesters, who initially appeared to be nowhere near the venue of the rally, Gani Fawehinmi Freedom Park, suddenly started gathering close to the Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Mr. Hakeem Odumosu, as he addressed newsmen on reasons the state government was opposed to the rally.\n\nTHISDAY checks revealed that policemen and soldiers were drafted to the venue of the rally since Friday night, and there was reinforcement Saturday morning. Over 25 trucks belonging to the Nigeria Police, Nigerian Army, and members of the Lagos State security outfit, Rapid Response Service (RRS) were seen stationed at the park and around it.\n\nPolicemen and soldiers stood at strategic positions, cuddling their guns as the service lane from Ketu to Ojota was cordoned off to prevent people coming close to the venue.\n\nAt Berger Bus Stop, policemen embarked on a stop and search exercise, even as operatives of the joint military patrol, Operation MESA, were drafted to patrol Berger, Ojota, Maryland, Ikeja and parts of Lagos-Abeokuta Expressway, an exercise that created a heavy gridlock on the road.\n\nSome of the protesters, who spoke with newsmen, complained about the high level of insecurity and injustice in the country, saying they are tired and ready to leave Nigeria for Oduduwa Republic.\n\nOne of the agitators, Mr. Taiwo Abiodun Obanla, who rolled on the ground in frustration as he spoke, said, \u201cWe are not going home, we want Yoruba Nation, we are no more Nigerians. We don\u2019t want Nigeria, we are suffering, we don\u2019t want to die.\u201d\n\nA leader of the rally, simply identified as Opeoluwa, who led a group of Osun worshippers to the march, was seen approaching some police officers at the venue with a letter to the Inspector-General, Baba Alkali, as he appealed to them to cooperate with the protesters and let them hold their peaceful rally. Opeoluwa said the protesters were men and women of peace.\n\nHe said, \u201cI have a letter for the IG. We don\u2019t have anything against the police, we don\u2019t have anything against the army, we don\u2019t have anything against the security agencies. We want you to protect us.\n\n\u201cWe want to hold a peaceful rally. We are for peace; we are men and women of peace. Please, cooperate with us; we are not here to fight you.\u201d\n\nPolice used water cannons and fired gunshots to try to disperse the protesters.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

This has been our position for the past two years. I\u2019m happy to say that this is being done, not in the coordinated manner that I wanted, because I wanted this to happen at the same time in all seven states of the North-west.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, we don\u2019t have enough planes. We don\u2019t have enough soldiers. We don\u2019t have enough to do this simultaneously. So it\u2019s been done gradually, but there has been a lot of degradation of the bandits\u201d, he said.\n\n\u201cI assure you we are killing them. We are wiping out their camps, and the military and the the the air force particularly and the Nigerian army with special forces have been doing a great job.\n\n\u201cMany people don\u2019t know how many attempted kidnaps we have foiled many people don\u2019t know because we don\u2019t talk about it. They only know the ones that have succeeded\u201d, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Kaduna State chief executive has withdrawn his children from Kaduna Capital School following security reports of a plot by bandits to attack the school and kidnap his children.\n\nHe told BBC that available security reports revealed that three bandit groups were planning to abduct his son from the school, a situation which he also noted would expose other children to danger.\n\nThe governor, had, in a bid to revamp public education in the state enrolled two of his children, Abubakar Sadiq and his younger sister, Nasrine.\n\n\u201cMy son is registered in the school because his sister also became six years of age and we registered her in the school but we\u2019ve had to temporarily withdraw them for the security of the school because we got intercept from at least two groups that are planning to attack the school to kidnap my son.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they will succeed because there will be enough security there to prevent it but other children may be placed in danger. We have no idea what weapons they will come with,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor said the children, who had taken to home study, were withdrawn from school following security reports made available to him.\n\nGovernor el-Rufai said the state government had maintained its position against payment of ransom to kidnappers.\n\nThe governor had disclosed in an earlier media interview that the plot to abduct his children was designed to see if he would not pay ransom.\n\n\u201cWe have a feeling that the renewed attacks in Kaduna are not unconnected to the position that we have taken as a government that we will not negotiate with criminals.\n\n\u201cWe will not give them any money and they will not make any profit from Kaduna. Anyone that comes to Kaduna will not get a penny from the state government, except he will get a bullet instead.\u201d\n\nSeven killed in Chikun, Kajuru, Giwa LGAs\n\nIn a related development yesterday, armed bandits reportedly killed seven persons within the last 72 hours in Chikun, Kajuru and Giwa local government areas of Kaduna State, an official of the state said last night\n\nAccording to him, the developments were reported to the Kaduna State Government by security agencies on yesterday.\n\nThe source said the bandits shot four kidnapped citizens at the outskirts of Tsohon Gayan general area of Chikun LGA.\n\n\u201cTwo were identified as Solomon Bamaiyi and Francis Moses from Kakau village of the same LGA. The third was identified as being from Kachia town and the fourth remains unidentified.\n\n\u201cIn I Station, Kajuru LGA, two citizens, Reuben Tanko and Sani Jibrin were also shot dead by a group of armed bandits.\n\n\u201cOne Danjuma Alhaji, a native of Tsohon Farakwai of Igabi LGA was similarly killed by bandits at the outskirts of Galadima general area of Giwa LGA\u201d, he added.\n\nGovernor Nasir El-Rufai was said to have sent condolences to their families and prayed for the repose of their souls.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, security agencies have carried out confidence building visit to Iri Station, where some citizens were killed and an unspecified number kidnapped.\n\n\u201cThe Commissioner Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, who led the delegation assured the community of government\u2019s commitment to the security and peace of the general area\u201d, the official explained.\n\nHe also said that collaboration between communities and security agencies is critical and must be cultivated towards enhancing security in areas that are difficult to access across the state.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Our client should also be paid N500m as reparation for damage to his exotic cars that include Mercedes Benz G-Class and 2019 Lexus car. We also demand a public apology.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe lawyer further said every Nigerian was aware that in all of Igboho\u2019s rallies and open agitations for the self-determination of the Yoruba Nation, he always preached peace and warned his followers never to resort to violence.\n\nHe added, \u201cHe always said that It is God and alale that will fight for the Yoruba Nation. We can boldly say that as people who followed his campaign, but not necessarily supporting dismemberment of Nigeria, that no casualty has ever occurred wherever such rallies were carried out. This must have been done in more than 20 Yoruba towns and cities as at date.\n\n\u201cNo demand to enter was made but rather they shot their way into the house allegedly killing seven people though DSS spokesman admitted killing two people which involved an old Imam that used to lead Muslim occupants in prayers and observing Tahjud at the time of the barbaric raid. A lady among the invaders was allegedly shouting, 'If you get him gun him down.'\"\n\nAlliyu also alleged that the operatives were disappointed that they couldn\u2019t find a single gun or ammunition in his client\u2019s house, hence arrested two police escorts of Igboho\u2019s guests and added their \u201cguns to those harvested from their armoury to make members of the public believe that our client keeps militia or as stated by them, he is about waging war on Nigeria. Will this be with his mere amulets? People who know our client of over 20 years will testify that Igboho oosa does not carry gun on his person!\u2019\u2019",

          "text": "Uju Kingsley Chima, a lawmaker representing Ohaji-Egbema/Oguta/Oru West federal constituency, says the 30 percent allocation for oil exploration will benefit all Nigerians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChima, who was also a member of the ad-hoc committee on Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), stated this on Friday during a media briefing on the bill.\n\nControversies emerged over 30 percent allocation to the frontier basins exploration fund from the proposed 10 percent by the two chambers.\n\nThe reduction in host community funds from the proposed 5 percent to 3 percent also caused fierce arguments during the bill\u2019s passage at the senate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStakeholders had clamoured for 10 percent for oil-producing states during the public hearing of the PIB.\n\nSpeaking on the frontier basin controversy, Chima said lawmakers consulted experts and the executive before taking the final decision.\n\n\u201cIt is a win-win approach for all stakeholders. The frontier basin is not an exclusive reserve of a part of a country. These are areas with oil prospects, they said we have about six basins.,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYes, we can say the bulk of the basins are domiciled in a section of the country. Let me give you what will impress you today, whatever funds made available to these basins are reserved for future explorations.\n\n\u201cThe fund will be used for seismic operations, this involves geological analysis and to some extent, sub exploration, to convince investors that Nigeria has oil in commercial quantity in those places.\n\n\u201cThe wish of the people of Niger Delta is, let oil be found in every community in Nigeria, if it is benefits that the people of Niger Delta are enjoying, let everyone enjoy it.\u201d\n\nAccording to the bill, NNPC Limited would pay 30 percent of its profit in the production sharing, profit sharing and risk service contracts to the frontier exploration fund.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the 5 percent allocated to host communities by the house of representatives, the lawmaker said the fund would address some of the challenges facing oil-producing communities.\n\nHe said the fund would be sent directly to the host communities and not through proxy.",

          "text": "Nigeria-based TeamApt, which offers agent banking services with plans to roll out consumer-focused digital banking features, has raised an undisclosed sum in a Series B round.\n\nIn a statement, co-founder and CEO Tosin Eniolorunda said the funding \u201callows us to extend our solutions to other parts of Africa.\u201d The company currently operates only in Nigeria but has its sights set on breaking ground in a francophone African country later this year.\n\nOfficially undisclosed \u201cfor business reasons\u201d according to a TeamApt representative in an email, Eniolorunda had indicated in June that it was \u201ca couple of tens of millions of dollars\u201d in size. Two people familiar with the company\u2019s fundraising process confirmed it is at least $20 million.\n\nNovastar Ventures, the Kenya-based firm, led the round with the participation of Global Ventures (a firm in the United Arab Emirates), CDC Group (the UK\u2019s development finance institution), Soma Capital, Kepple Africa Ventures and Oui Capital.\n\nDutch entrepreneurial development bank FMO also got in on the action with a $2 million punt, according to TechCrunch.\n\nTosin Eniolofunda, CEO TeamApt.\n\nThis recent funding announcement follows TeamApt\u2019s $5.5m Series A round closed in 2019 led by Quantum Capital Partners, a Lagos-based investment firm owned by Jim Ovia, the founder of Zenith Bank.\n\nThough under the radar for much of its six year existence, TeamApt boasts numbers that would place it among Nigeria\u2019s most active and best performing financial technology startups.\n\nTeamApt\u2019s pivotal business at the moment is Moniepoint, a software solution that powers agent banking in Nigeria. The company says that it processed $3.5bn in May and is the leading agent banking platform on volume of transactions, citing an April report from the Shared Agent Network Expansion Facility (SANEF) \u2013 the body authorised by the Central Bank of Nigeria to oversee agent banking in Nigeria.\n\nSANEF\u2019s reports are not public and it is not clear which other companies are captured in it. But the agent banking space is thought to include Firstmonie, Paga and OPay, the Opera-backed fintech.\n\nIn March 2021, TeamApt said it processed over \u20a61trillion ($2.4 bn) for the first time. The $3.5 bn processed in May was from a base of 68 million transactions. Underlying these transactions is a network of agents numbering about 100,000 across Nigeria\u2019s 36 states.\n\nIn the twelve months ended April 2021, the company said it had processed a total of $16bn across its platforms which includes Monnify, a service that provides virtual accounts to fintechs and other service providers to facilitate instant notification of bank transactions.\n\nBut the majority of the company\u2019s operations (and revenue) is from Moniepoint, forming the basis for plans to evolve the platform into the consumer digital banking space. While Moniepoint will continue to power agent banking, TeamApt plans to build a consumer app side of it for individuals as a digital bank.\n\nBesides geographical expansion and a product launch, what else does TeamApt have up its sleeves?\n\nLast week, the company\u2019s founders were announced as the newest members of the Endeavor Nigeria network, which means they qualified to receive investment from the network\u2019s Catalyst Fund (There\u2019s precedent: Endeavor\u2019s investment in Flutterwave\u2018s Series B in January 2020).\n\nPlans for more funding are already underway.\n\nA TeamApt representative said \u201ca series C conversation is ongoing [and] should be completed in the coming months and we\u2019ll be happy to announce at that time.\u201d\n\nEniolorunda, the CEO, anticipates that they could soon rise to become a billion-dollar startup. \u201cWe expect the company to reach unicorn-type valuations soon,\u201d he told TechCabal in June.\n\nDid you enjoy reading this article?

          "text": "FairMoney, like many other Nigerian fintechs, started out in the lending business and is about completing its evolution into being a full-fledged digital bank.\n\nToday it announced a $42 million Series B round. It was led by Tiger Global Management with existing investors like DST Partners, Flourish Ventures, Newfund, and Speedinvest participating.\n\nThe investment comes after FairMoney raised $11 million Series A two years ago and $16 million in total within its first four years.\n\nFor Tiger Global which led the round, this is its fourth investment in an African startup after iRoko (2013), Takealot (2014) and Flutterwave (2021). Notably, this is the first time the investment firm is investing in two African startups within a year. A sign of its renewed interest in the African continent after a long hiatus.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to partner with FairMoney as they build a better financial hub for customers in Nigeria and India,\u201d Scott Shleifer, partner at Tiger Global, said in a statement. \u201cWe were impressed by the team and the strong growth to date and look forward to supporting FairMoney as they continue to scale.\u201d\n\nFairMoney\u2019s Performance\n\nFounded in 2017 by Laurin Hainy, Matthieu Gendreau, and Nicolas Berthozat, FairMoney started its operations in Nigeria before expanding to India last year.\n\nFrom having a little over 100,000 users in its first year of operation, FairMoney has grown to have 1.3 million unique users who have made more than 6.5 million loan applications. Last year, the company disbursed a total loan volume of $93 million.\n\nWithin the short time its being in India, the company has processed more than 500,000 loan applications from over 100,000 unique users.\n\nThis year, FairMoney achieved one of its crucial goals by acquiring a microfinance bank license in Nigeria. The license allows FairMoney to operate as a financial service provider in Nigeria.\n\nLooking forward\n\nComing off a fantastic 2020, the company says it is projecting to disburse $300 million worth of loans this year. It\u2019ll finance this by raising bonds.\n\nFairMoney has come a long way since it started as a credit provider, it\u2019s ambition according to co-founder Laurin Hainy is that \u201cby the end of the year, its customers will have a full-fledged banking experience from P2P transfers and lending to debit cards and current accounts.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also working on a number of additional services including savings, stock trading, and crypto-trading products. These are subject to regulatory approvals.\n\nWith this new funding, rather than expanding into other countries, FairMoney wants to focus and consolidate its position in Nigeria and India. While it\u2019s not expanding further geographically, its talent pool is, with about 150 open positions.\n\nFairMoney is not alone in its ambitions to dominate the Neobank scene in Nigeria, Kuda in March raised $25 million.\n\nWith more players coming onto the Neobank scene in Nigeria, one might get a feel that it\u2019s a space that\u2019s getting crowded but the fact that about 56% of Nigerian adults are unbanked hints that there\u2019s room for many to play in this space.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Faith Keza is leading Irembo to fully digitise Rwanda",
          "text": "My Life In Tech is putting human faces to some of the innovative startups, investments, and policy formations driving the technology sector across Africa.\n\nIf you were living in Rwanda today and needed to get a government-issued certificate, you can simply fill out some forms and make your payment \u2013 all online. Your certificate will be sent to your inbox when ready.\n\nIrembo is leading this digitisation of services in Rwanda. And steering the Irembo ship is Faith Keza.\n\nIt\u2019s 2 pm in Lagos when we sit to talk over Google Meet. Due to scheduling conflicts, our conversation had been delayed for some weeks but I was excited to be speaking with her.\n\nAfter getting her degree from MIT, she worked at Oracle, Delphix, Google and is now the CEO of Irembo. Faith is also on the board of the Rwanda National Bank and the Rwanda Development Board.\n\nSo how is she able to do all this? In an interview with UNICEF, she gives a very poignant response.\n\n\u201cThe word is grit,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you can persevere day in and day out, the days will be long but the years will be short and you\u2019ll get to somewhere exciting.\u201d\n\nFrom growing up in Rwanda to moving to the US for her university degree, her journey has been one of grit, excellence and a dedication to impacting the lives of people.\n\nHer name is Faith Keza and this is her life in tech.\n\nFor the love of math\n\nFaith Keza\u2019s mother was born away from home in Uganda and lived there until Faith was born. After the genocide in 1994, the family made their way back to Rwanda to start over.\n\nFaith was only about 3 years old at the time and she tells me she doesn\u2019t remember a lot from that time.\n\n\u201cI just have a memory of living with all my cousins in one house. And at that point, a lot of families used to live together because they were all moving. So as a kid, that was fun but I guess for the adults it wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nFaith started school in Rwanda and quickly discovered she loved mathematics. She liked the logic of it all. There were rules to follow and they could be replicated.\n\n\u201cWhen I got to high school, my passion for maths grew stronger. I really enjoyed it. Even in my free time, I would take on further maths.\u201d\n\nAnd while she enjoyed maths, she dreaded subjects like biology where the rule was to memorise scientific names and characteristics. No logic, just retention.\n\nAs she rounded up her O-levels, a scholarship opportunity presented itself. A Scottish billionaire had visited Rwanda around that time and had liked the country so much that he decided he wanted to sponsor two children to attend a royal school in the North of Scotland; a school his children attended.\n\nTests were done to determine the top students in the country and in the end, Faith Keza and another student were on their way to Scotland to start a new life and see the world through different lenses.\n\nWhile in the UK, at the end of her A-levels, Faith had to choose five schools to apply to. Following advice from her counsellor, she decided against applying to top schools like Oxford or Cambridge due to their low acceptance rates and in a bid not to \u201cwaste two of her chances.\u201d\n\nHer mother was not having any of that.\n\n\u201cWhen my mom heard about it she said \u2018No, Faith, you have to go to a top tier school\u2019\u201d\n\nBut applications to schools in the UK were closed at this time and Faith let her mother know that much. This was not a deterrent.\n\n\u201cAmerica is open. You should apply to America,\u201d her mother said to her.\n\nWhen Faith tells me about this encounter, she reveals that she did apply to America but at the time it was something she had done only to make her mother happy.\n\nThe letters followed soon. Brown had waitlisted her. But MIT\u2019s letter was a glowing acceptance. She was going to Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nIf you love maths let it go\u2026\n\nWhen I ask Faith about memories linked to MIT. She tells me she doesn\u2019t have great memories.\n\n\u201cEven today, I have Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,\u201d she laughs \u201cI think a lot of people [from MIT] have it to some varying degree.\u201d\n\nMIT has a reputation. The school\u2019s acceptance rate is 6.7%, which is typical of most top schools. But it is also the alma mater to many great minds including the famous astronaut Buzz Aldrin and former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan.\n\nThis means that MIT students get into the university with a lot to prove. In the middle of studying, there is also the debilitating imposter syndrome that is often commonplace.\n\n\u201cBecause wherever you come from, you\u2019re used to being the best at something. You get there and you\u2019re really competing with kids who have done insane things and some of them are actual geniuses.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo it was very hard to suddenly have to know how to study because most of the time [in high school] I would sit in class and get what was going on. Realising this, that was when the all-nighters and coffee addiction really began. So no, I don\u2019t have great memories.\u201d\n\nAfter a semester at MIT, Faith realized her maths major wasn\u2019t for her.\n\n\u201cI wanted to do something more practical so I asked what was the other biggest major that everyone was excited about? And at that point, I think 50% of the class of MIT was computer scientists.\u201d\n\nSo computer science it was.\n\nIt starts at Oracle in the USA and ends at Irembo in Rwanda\n\nFaith\u2019s first job out of the university was as a software engineer with the tech giant, Oracle. Here she learnt real-world applications of a lot of the coding she had been doing at MIT.\n\nAfter two years at Oracle, she wanted a taste of the startup life and took up a software engineering role at Delphix. It was at Delphix that Faith started toying with the idea of returning to Africa. She had briefly considered moving to Nigeria where her partner Obinna Ukwuani was living at the time. They had both met in college.\n\nShe took a job at Google that was supposed to bring her back to an African country. But a lot of plans were stalled and so Faith decided to return on her own to Rwanda and while there, she joined Irembo as CTO.\n\nHer task was simple \u2013 Irembo was getting software from a third party and the prices were getting too high. They needed in-house software development. Faith was on the job.\n\n\u201cSo what we have been doing for the past five years is working with the government of Rwanda to digitise all their services.\u201d\n\nIn building these solutions, there have been some uphill tasks. An experience that stands out for Faith was during the process of digitising certificates, many people questioned the security of the online method. This was a teachable moment for her. She learnt that it was necessary to carry everyone along \u2013 explain things to them, learn their concerns, just make sure everyone feels heard and is involved.\n\nSitting on boards and looking to the future\n\nFaith loves audiobooks because \u201cyou can listen to them while you do other things.\u201d And with a life as busy as hers, who can blame her for multi-tasking.

          "title": "Inside Branch\u2019s ambitious '20% investment' challenge to Nigerian banks",
          "text": "When Branch launched in Nigeria in 2017, it was a single product company with a money lending license to offer loans to individuals. Loans start from as low as \u20a61,000 (~$2) and increase gradually up to \u20a6500,000 (~$1,200) as the borrower repays.\n\nFour years, \u20a640 billion (~$97 million) and three million loans later, the business is evolving.\n\nThe company which also operates in Kenya, Tanzania and India acquired a Nigerian microfinance bank license this year. In doing so, Branch has joined the growing number of Nigerian fintechs maturing into digital banks after some years in the lending app nursery. Carbon and Fairmoney are in this class too.\n\nBranch\u2019s mobile app (available only for Android) now includes a wallet that offers users unlimited money transfers and commission-free bill payments, in addition to instant loans (it is quite instant; I have tried it more than once between April and now) that are collateral-free.\n\nBut the Branch feature that catches the eye is the \u201cInvest\u201d tab. Clicking the button, users are invited to \u201cEarn 20% per annum by investing with Branch.\u201d\n\nFor example, a user who keeps \u20a61 million in this product for a whole year receives \u20a6200,000 at the minimum. Returns are paid every Monday and if left in the Branch wallet, compound for the next payment.\n\n20%?! How are they able to offer that?\n\nYou are not alone in asking. It was the first question Dayo Ademola, Branch Nigeria\u2019s managing director, faced on CNBC in May. It was the main curiosity as well on a Zoom call with journalists earlier this month.\n\nAccording to a June 18, 2021 Central Bank of Nigeria fact sheet, Heritage Bank offers 13.88% on fixed deposits, the highest of any Nigerian deposit money bank. But that\u2019s an outlier; Access Bank\u2019s 7.28% is about the average rate.\n\nZenith Bank\u2019s 3.94%, though one of the lowest, is better than what Stanbic IBTC, Standard Chartered and First Bank all offer. So how is Branch, a startup, able to go so high on retail investments?\n\nInvestor capital, low costs\n\nTo assure customers that their funds are safe, Ademola explained that Branch\u2019s finance money license from the CBN permits them to offer fund management services and they \u201conly invest customer funds in principal securities and low-risk securities.\u201d\n\nShe does not specify what these securities are. Low-risk securities could be government treasury bills. But since practically every other bank makes the same claim and that the yield on instruments like treasury bills are stifled by inflation, Branch\u2019s extra margin has to come from elsewhere.\n\nSo, on CNBC as with the call with journalists, Ademola offered two reasons why Branch can afford its promise: investor capital and a profitable, lean business operation.\n\n\u201cOur investors have effectively taken a long view of our business in Nigeria,\u201d Ademola said.\n\nDayo Ademola, managing director of Branch Nigeria.\n\nBy this she points to the fact that Branch, which is a San Francisco-based company, has been funded by, among others, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), one of the biggest Silicon Valley venture capital investment firms and early Facebook investor.\n\nBoth organisations participated in Branch\u2019s two big funding rounds \u2013 a $170 million Series C round in April 2019 and a $70 million Series B a year earlier, attracted by Branch\u2019s branding as a \u201c$2 loan\u201d service for emerging markets. $50 million of that 2018 raise was a debt facility from a firm that focuses on alternative credit.\n\nVISA is also an investor in Branch and has driven their Nigeria expansion. But beyond leaning on investor capital, Ademola said Branch is able to depend on its balance sheet from lending to support other ambitions. \u201cOur lending business is profitable here.\u201d\n\nThis profitability, she explains, has been possible because of the lowered cost of not having to operate physical bank branches across Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe operate on a lower cost structure than your typical commercial bank and are able to pass some of these savings on to our customers,\u201d Ademola said.\n\nBetter than your bank?\n\nBranch Nigeria\u2019s pitch, then, is that it is \u201cbetter than your bank.\u201d\n\nDigital banks tend to tease variations of this tagline \u2013 Kuda, for example, is the \u201cbank of the free.\u201d But as Ademola said, no other Nigerian fintech startup offers a 20% annual return on investment products.\n\nCarbon offers a number of options that offer between 9 and 11% earnings. There is not yet an investment product on Fairmoney.\n\nInvestment offerings on digital platforms Branch and Carbon. Source: Screenshots from both companies\u2019 mobile apps.\n\nBecause I have borrowed easily on Branch, there is an appeal to adventure along on their bold investment claim. But it may be necessary to approach promises of high-returns with a sense of caution.\n\n\u201cFintechs don\u2019t have cheap sources of deposits in the form of current and savings accounts (CASA), hence they may try to attract customers with high-reward, yet possibly high-risk deposit products,\u201d Adedayo Bakare, an investment analyst, tells me.\n\nWhile a 20% return is an enticing high reward, it also signals the high-risk nature of the models fintechs have to adopt in order to beat banks. \u201cHigher risk is also why they charge borrowers high rates on loans. Because it is not backed by collateral,\u201d Bakare adds.\n\nIndeed, Branch\u2019s microloans charge a 20% interest. A \u20a62,000 (~$5) loan for one month, for example, will be paid back with \u20a62,400 \u2013 a 20% interest rate. By contrast, Guaranty Trust Bank is able to lend to its customers at a 1.5% monthly rate.\n\nAnd how about investor capital as a pillar? Bakare is skeptical: \u201cIf you look at the structure of funding for banks, investor capital is not even up to 30% of funding in many cases.\u201d\n\nReaching every smartphone\n\nBranch doesn\u2019t have audited accounts in the public domain showing their non-performing loan (NPL) ratio and capital adequacy ratio (CAR).\n\nBoth numbers would give a clearer picture of the returns on their three million loans. Going by its profitability and investor capital, it would appear both metrics are in good health.\n\nIt will then be intriguing to see customer reaction to the newly launched investment offer. Nigerians have fallen for ponzi schemes at an alarming rate that suggests legitimate platforms offering high-reward returns can find an audience.\n\nAdemola, who became Branch\u2019s MD for Nigeria in March, is confident of being the country\u2019s go-to platform, extending financial access wherever a smartphone receives an internet signal.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Kenyan eCommerce startup, Copia Global, has announced the expansion of its services to Uganda. Having established its presence in the Kenyan market, where it claims to serve over one million customers, the startup has its sights on Uganda\u2019s growing middle class.\n\nCopia Global operates a different model from most eCommerce platforms. Rather than depending on a website, it uses a network of agents spread across the country. When customers need an item, they visit an agent with a digital device to place their order.\n\nAfter placing their order, the agent sends it to Copia Global, who processes and delivers it within two days when the customer returns to pick it up. By adopting this model, the company can serve people who do not own digital devices or cannot access the Internet. Interestingly, it does all this using USSD technology.\n\nWhile the startup has a website, it is mainly for customers who live in urban areas. This way, they can order goods and have them delivered to people living in rural communities where Copia Global has agents.\n\nThis model is perfect for Uganda, where despite 47% of the population owning mobile subscriptions, only 12 million Ugandans use the Internet. However, its combination of an online and offline model is not exactly novel. In 2019, eCommerce giant, Jumia, partnered with Vivo Energy to use its service stations as pick-up and drop-off points for customers.\n\nAccording to Founder and Chairman, Tracey Turner, \u201cUganda has one of the fastest-growing middle classes in the world with a hardworking population and a dynamic entrepreneurial culture. Copia is designed specifically to serve this high growth but underserved consumer base who want access to high-quality products at the best prices.\u201d\n\nAccording to Crunchbase, the startup has raised $53 million in funding from investors, including LGT Lightstone, Endeavor Catalyst, and Goodwell Investments.\n\neCommerce startups in Africa have primarily struggled to show a viable market for their services, with Konga sold in 2018 and Jumia\u2019s business struggling despite listing on the New York Stock Exchange. While models like Copia Global\u2019s that seek to serve low-income consumers might seem like the way to go, eCommerce startups need to serve a larger market to make as much revenue as the giants do.",

          "title": "There\u2019s no such thing as a bad investment \u2013 TEN13\u2019s Stewart Glynn talks startup funding",
          "text": "As the pace of innovation in the African tech ecosystem ramps up, more attention would be given \u2014 and for a good reason \u2014 to the brave founders and innovators building Africa\u2019s future. However, angel investors and venture capitalists are a similarly courageous group of individuals who are seldom celebrated.\n\nTwice a month, we speak with an angel investor or venture capitalist backing Africa\u2019s innovators to draw insights from them. For this week\u2019s edition, I talked to Stewart Glynn, a Partner at TEN13, an Australian venture capital firm.\n\nGlynn grew up in Harare, Zimbabwe\u2019s capital and most populous city, in an entrepreneurial family. When it was time for university, he went to Australia to gain a degree in business, banking, and finance at the Queensland University of Technology.\n\nAfter that, he worked with General Electric and KPMG. During this time, he did a lot of work around helping businesses develop sustainable structures and mergers and acquisitions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis time in the corporate sector exposed him to technology and its disruptive effects in various industries. He was approached by Steve Baxter, \u2018Shark\u2019 on Shark Tank, and an Australian serial entrepreneur who founded SENet and Pipe Networks, which was acquired for about $400 million.\n\nBaxter had started investing in technology startups through his family\u2019s office, Transition Level Investments, but wanted to do more and so he tapped Glynn. Together, they invested in about 40 ventures around the world.\n\nIn December 2019, after wondering how to institutionalise their investments, Baxter and Glynn decided to start TEN13. Having seen the value that Baxter could bring with his experience as a founder, they chose to do things differently.\n\nRather than raise a seed fund, TEN13 has a network of over 200 entrepreneurs and corporate executives who supply more than funds to the startups that they invest in. These investors provide the companies with an extensive network and advice as they navigate their startup journeys. Investments at TEN13 are made on a deal by deal basis.\n\nSince its launch in the last 18 months, TEN13 has deployed about $20 million in 13 startups, including Australian edtech unicorn, Go1; fintech startup, ImaliPay; and Africa- focused fintech unicorn, Chipper Cash.\n\nAccording to Glynn, the idea is to get behind visionary founders at the earliest stage and provide them with the resources to take their companies to the next level. The average ticket size is between $250,000 and $1 million, with the possibility of more investment further down the road.\n\nOn bad investments and common mistakes founders make\n\nFor now, Glynn explains that the goal is to fund ten companies every year. An arduous task, as he claims they get about 70 to 80 startups looking for funding monthly. When I asked if there were any deals they had missed out on that hurt, he explained it is the norm in venture capital.\n\n\u201cIn our game, it\u2019s really about having a framework for decision making because as early-stage investors, you\u2019re making decisions with limited data. As an investor, you want to see a lot of companies in the anti-portfolio because that means you are seeing the right deals,\u201d he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn investor\u2019s anti-portfolio are the deals which they pursued but did not invest in, either of their own volition or because other investors shut them out.\n\nAccording to research, nine out of 10 startups fail. Knowing this, I asked Glynn how TEN13 deals with investments that do not go according to plan.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s such a thing as a bad investment. We understand that while the companies we back have a high potential for success, there\u2019re a lot of reasons why startups fail. When we invest in startups, we provide support for the founders to ensure that the startups have a good chance of success,\u201d he says.\n\nMost founders have grand plans to take on the world at the early stage, but without previous startup experience, they are likely to make mistakes. Glynn advises that this is the point when they need to narrow their focus and not spread themselves too thin \u2014 something they make sure these startups know.\n\nInstead, he advises that they identify one thing that would put them on the right path and focus on doing it for the next three to six months.\n\nHow to reach TEN13\n\nFor founders looking to get TEN13 on board as investors, he recommends that they reach out via email [email protected] or LinkedIn. He stresses that they are sector-agnostic and back founders who are building products for a global market. With a renewed focus on emerging markets, he recommends that founders in these markets building remarkable products should reach out to him.",

          "title": "Senate in credibility question over wishy-washy probes",
          "text": "At the inauguration of the 9th Assembly, Ahmed Lawan, the Senate president, made promises to Nigerians, part of which was to make the upper chamber to be more responsive to Nigerians they represent and make the Senate function better.\n\nLawan had said the 9th Assembly would be different and characterised by fewer controversies and more positivity.\n\nHowever, the reverse appears to be the case in the last two years he has been in office. The general belief among observers is that the Lawan-led Senate has not done well in this regard.\n\nPresently, public confidence in probes by the Senate is at its lowest ebb. There is the perception among Nigerians that perhaps, the committees\u2019 findings or reports are compromised and hidden from public knowledge by the leadership of the Senate.\n\nRead Also: PIB: Host Communities Trust Fund divides Senate\n\nTo be clear, parliamentary probes are not prosecutorial in nature but expository. They expose things that prosecuting agencies should use. It is said that its probes are to make better laws.\n\nBut then, when a probe is not conclusive and the criminals are shielded, it becomes difficult for prosecuting agencies to set in motion necessary machinery to prosecute.\n\nFor example, last year, the Senate and House of Representatives set up a committee to investigate how the Interim Management Committee (IMC) of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) allegedly squandered N40 billion within three months.\n\nMoreover, Nigerians witnessed drama over the probe of the Niger Delta Development Corporation (NDDC) on fraud, even Kemebradikumo Pondei, the acting MD, brought comic relief to the probe when he collapsed during the probe. There were allegations by Joy Nunieh against Godswill Akpabio, minister of Niger Delta, as well as Akpabio\u2019s counter allegation against the Senate.\n\nThe Senate set up an ad-hoc committee presided over by Senator Olubunmi Adetunbi (APC, Ekiti North) to look into financial transactions carried out by the IMC on behalf of the commission within the period and to present a report in four weeks.\n\nThe Committee had asked the then IMC of NDDC to refund N4.923 billion alleged illegal payments made to staff of the commission and contractors in breach of the procurement process.\n\nThe committee became necessary following complaints and a motion sponsored by Senator Thompson George Sekibo (PDP, Rivers East a motion about urgent need to investigate financial restlessness in the NDDC.\n\nThe IMC had also been accused by stakeholders and public interest groups of allegedly laying off of personnel and their replacement with unqualified and inexperienced persons.\n\nHowever, it is interesting to note that more than a year after the Senate committee had been set up, nothing tangible had been achieved.\n\nObservers decry that the fund has not been remitted to the NDDC account, rather more stealing is said to be going on there despite the forensic exercise going on.\n\nAnother of such cases is the special job slots allegedly shared to Senators by different agencies and MDAs in December 2019. The issue generated discussion and controversy among Nigerians across the country at that time.\n\nThe indicted Senators, including Lawan, had publicly denied the allegation.\n\nThe Senate Committee on Federal Character and Intergovernmental Affairs was tasked to investigate the case by grilling the indicted agencies. The chairman of the panel, Danjuma La\u2019ah, had promised to expose all those who had been involved in the scandal.\n\nInterestingly, for more than a year and half, there have been no reports, nor notice of extension of the committee time. The issue appears to have died a natural death in the upper chamber.\n\nThe issue had continued to generate debates among Nigerians, with many questioning the leadership of the Senate, while others said it was a general reflection of the failure of the All Progressives Congress (APC) government.\n\nThis year alone, and in the first half of 2021, the Senate has probed over 20 fraud-related cases with majority of them inconclusive, dragging towards the end of the year and likely going to end with little reprimand of the culprits.\n\nToday, politicians, government officials, public servants and corporate executives who embezzle funds are not scared of appearing before a Senate probe panel as many of such probes have amounted to nothing.\n\nIn April 2021, Umar Danladi, chairman, Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT), assaulted Clement Sagwak, a security guard, at Banex Plaza in Wuse, Abuja. The assault, which was captured by camera, went viral the same day.\n\nDespite the efforts and petition brought to the Senate by Senator Istifanus Dung Gyang, from Plateau North, where the security guard hails from, the Senate Committee on Ethics, Privileges and Public Petitions led by Senator Ayo Akinyelure is still expecting reports on the simple case it should have trashed immediately.\n\nAlso, in June, the Senate Public Accounts Committee began a probe of Maritime Academy of Nigeria, Oron, Akwa Ibom State for alleged illegal diversion of N1.05 billion.\n\nThe Senator Mathew Urhoghide-led panel said the move was premised on two queries by the Office of Auditor-General of the Federation which reportedly exposed the unauthorised withdrawals in its 2018 audited report.\n\nThe document indicated that the N457 million released to the academy on December 13, 2012 was diverted, while N608 million was irregularly withdrawn without concrete.\n\nBut the probe committee demanded details of the case from Duja Effedua, the rector of the academy, who accused his officials of frustrating the investigation.\n\nFor Imohimi Onogie, an Abuja-based criminal expert and law lecturer, the Senate probes have not been effective because they often give culprits opportunity for unnecessary defence.\n\nCiting the Maritime Academy of Nigeria, Oron\u2019s alleged illegal diversion of N1.05 billion, Onogie said that the committees always give culprits opportunity for unnecessary defence.\n\n\u201cImagine, the Senate committee on the Oron probe asking the rector to go and bring details. The fact that the rector and others parties appeared before the probe panel with little details make them culpable. What other evidence are they looking for, because sending them back means the case will delay and offer room for money to change hands and case possibly quashed for lack of evidence\u201d, Onogie said.\n\nThe case, according to the lawyer, will die a natural death or linger till the 10th Senate.\n\nIn his argument, Mathias Obikali, a Port Harcourt based public affair analyst, noted that the rector of the academy cannot say he cannot kick-start something he does not have any information about, because the Office of Auditor-General of the Federation have already indicted him in its report and petition sent the senate.\n\nConsidering the unperturbed attitude of most alleged culprits, he decried that appearing in senate probe committees nowadays does not scare anyone again because of the little or no result from the probes.\n\n\u201cIf the probe committee speeds its investigation process, acquit the innocent, recover stolen wealth, jail culprits and make laws prohibiting any culprit from holding public and political offices, Nigerians will sit-up. But the Senate will not because its members are often involved or may have been compromised,\u201d Obikali said.\n\nOf course, due to weak institutions, corruption is thriving and public funds are being stolen every day, implying more probes for the Senate committees.\n\nSome of the ongoing probes include; the Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF) for alleged N61.1 billion diversion, probe of N1.8 trillion intervention fund in power sector, investigation of $30 billion alleged revenue leakage from payments on account of foreign currency denominated contracts by companies, to name a few.\n\n\u201cFor lack of the right word, I think the Senate is like a toothless bulldog, if not why are people still stealing public fund, the senate can even influence the EFCC to stop its investigations if it goes contrary to their interest,\u201d Nathan Onyeche, another lawyer, said.\n\nHis thought is captured in Gabriel Suswam\u2019s outcry during one of his committee\u2019s probe on the power sector.\n\n\u201cYou know that the federal government has over the years intervened at various times in different sums: N701 billion, N600 billion and this year there has been N380 billion and N213 billion.\n\n\u201cAll of these monies were federal government interventions in the power sector with the intention and hope that the power sector will become efficient and Nigerians will have access to electricity.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, in spite of these huge amounts of monies that have been expended, the result in what we see today is that the performance is below expectations,\u201d Suswam, chairman, Senate Committee on Power, lamented.\n\nBut the irony for Onyeche is that despite the lack of accountability and evident embezzling of the power sector funds, the government kept allocating more, while the Senate kept probing.\n\n\u201cWho is fooling who; the one who allocates, the looter or the probing Senate? The probes are not working, and even the EFCC hunts have not been able to stop public funds from being embezzled even in Buhari\u2019s corruption-fighting administration\u201d, Onyeche said.\n\nAdelaja Adeoye, a public affairs analyst, strongly believes that nothing good would come from the Senate because they were controlled by the executive who put them there.\n\nHe stressed that the action of the leadership of the Senate was a clear demonstration of the soft approach by the Buhari\u2019s administration to corruption despite his campaign on anti-graft war.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe National Assembly of today is being remote-controlled by the Buhari administration, and the much-talked about anti-corruption is nothing but a gimmick to hoodwink the opposition. Since Buhari came to power, how many people have you seen him prosecute, apart from the opposition that keeps defecting from PDP to his party?\n\n\u201cRecall that Adams Oshiomhole once said that if you are in PDP and another party, once you cross to the APC all your sins would be forgiven. A Senator from Delta, Peter Nwaobosi, who has been accused of several contract padding and refusal to execute the awarded contracts, recently jumped from the hammer of prosecution by crossing to the APC.\n\n\u201cThere are so many examples to this effect, but the National Assembly would be sitting and debating over nothing, despite the huge resources at their disposal. We are only hoping that Nigerians will wake up in 2023, and elect a government that can serve them without lies, oppression or vendetta, like we are currently witnessing.\u201d\n\nSeun Lawal, political analyst, said he was not surprised by the turn of events by the Lawan-led Senate, adding that the way the leadership was elected shows they would fail.\n\n\u201cFor me, I am not surprised with what is happening there, you can see the way Lawan was chosen by Buhari; so, he could protect him because the 8th Senate gave him a tough time. The failure of the committees shows they are not accountable to Nigerians who they are representing.\n\n\u201cTo me, this is one of the worst since 1999; how many bills have they passed in the two years they have been there? That should tell you where this administration is going,\u201d Lawal said.\n\nToday, a lot of people are not taking invitation by the Senate as a serious matter, because they know it is an exercise in futility and just to fulfill all righteousness.\n\nA few months ago, envoys and oil companies\u2019 managing directors shunned Senate invitation, and considered it a sheer waste of their time.\n\nIn April this year, the Senate Committee on Local Contents had invited managing directors of oil companies to investigative hearing. The representatives they sent could not give reason for their absence.\n\nIt has also come to a point that people would go to the Senate not prepared to face thorough scrutiny, because they knew from the word go that nothing serious would come out of the exercise. They may just flippantly make some statements, which they would later deny. This can only happen in Nigeria\u2019s National Assembly where things are done in a wishy-washy manner.\n\nWith the seeming weak handling of probe cases, the Senate appears to lack the credibility, and seems also to have lost the trust of many Nigerians to ensure accountability, encourage development through meaningful probes and make appropriate legislation to check the humongous corruption going on in the system.",

          "title": "Bingeing on forbidden taxes",
          "text": "A group of friends hit the Cubana Lounge in Port Harcourt for Thank God It\u2019s Friday (TGIF). Hours later and a few bottles of Moet and Ciroc gulped, the bill is settled. Five percent of the total amount, as of 2019, was remitted as Value Added Tax (VAT) to the Federal Government. This was subsequently shared among the three tiers of government. That year (2019), N150.24billion worth of alcohol was consumed in Nigeria and VAT amounted to N7.5billion.\n\nIn Kano, Jigawa, Yobe, Zamfara, or any of the 12 Sharia states in Nigeria, those alcoholic drinks are frequently confiscated when found and destroyed. But, it doesn\u2019t stop them from sharing in the revenue that accrues from the same alcoholic beverages sold elsewhere in Nigeria.\n\nBusinessDay\u2019s analysis of a range of datasets has shown, for perhaps the first time, that the Sharia states are allocated 30.26 percent of revenue from alcohol sold all over Nigeria, whereas they account for as expected, a meagre 2.92 percent of consumption. In many cases, Sharia states got more revenue than non-Sharia states where alcohol was actually sold and consumed.\n\n\u201cPeople are benefitting from what they consider to be illegal,\u201d said Emmanuel Ijewere, who in 1991 was chairman of the committee set up by the military regime of Ibrahim Babaginda to conceptualize the introduction of VAT in Nigeria.\n\nIjewere told BusinessDay his committee had recommended that VAT, which was to replace sales tax, be aggregated every month then each state given its own money, less 5 percent as administrative cost. However, politicians within the regime scuttled the proposal.\n\n\u201cThe idea of VAT was to replace sales tax in states,\u201d said Ijewere and, \u201cany aspect that is illegalized, the tax will not be collected for those and the state can\u2019t benefit from it.\u201d\n\nHowever, for Shamsudeen Yusuf, an Islamic Law lecturer at the Al-Qalam University in Katsina, sharing money from gambling or alcohol is allowed since it is a national allocation by virtue of being part of \u2018One Nigeria\u2019. But, the Muslim state should not directly collect that tax or even allow that investment to take place inside its state.\n\nIslam forbids alcohol because it can distort the mental capability of a person, and for 12 states in Nigeria where Sharia law is in place, keeping alcohol out of their domain has been religiously enforced.\n\nTwo main data sets were employed for analysis; the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) disbursement reports for 2019 and the Consumption-Expenditure Pattern in Nigeria report for 2019, published in May 2020, both from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). The detailed methodology is presented later in the article.\n\nIt does not matter how much alcohol is destroyed in Kano, or any of the other Sharia states; their revenue is guaranteed. As long as consumers in the other 24 states (and FCT) keep gulping gin, beer, or vodka non-stop, taxes will drop into government coffers faster than merry-seekers can refill their cups.\n\nOversight or illogical allocations?\n\n\u201cAlcohol is prohibited in Islam, so there should be no taxes from it since it is haram, that is, prohibited,\u201d said Iysa Bello, a professor of Islamic Law.\n\n\u201cWhatever is haram, whatever accrues from it will be haram too,\u201d emphasized Bello, who is head, Department of Common and Islamic Law, Osun State University.\n\nTo demonstrate how prohibited alcohol is, in November 2020, the Kano state government destroyed thousands of beer bottles valued at over N200 million. In that ceremony, the government emphasized that consumption of beer in all parts of the state is banned.\n\nRead also: New Digital Tax: Protecting the Nigerian dataspace (II)\n\nA year earlier, Kano received N280million as its share of taxes accruing from alcohol in Nigeria, more than the N200million worth of alcohol it destroyed at once.\n\nA distributor, John Simon, told Punch in an interview that he lost N35million because of what the Kano state government did. \u201cWhere will I source the money to continue selling beer?\u201d he said.\n\nKano, like other Sharia states, is guaranteed hundreds of millions of naira by a revenue-sharing formula indifferent to whether the income source is illegal based on religious practices or local laws. Though bought, consumed, and taxed elsewhere, states that ban these goods still get their cut, in many cases, even more than those responsible for the sales.\n\nAssuming each state received all the taxes charged on alcohol consumed without sharing a kobo with the federal government. This, for example, means Kano would have got N6.7million in 2019, from the 5 percent tax charged on the N134million worth of drinks it is estimated the state consumed. Instead, it got N280million from the national pool of VAT on alcohol, 42 times more than what it would have earned.\n\nConversely, even though Anambra consumed N13.5billion worth of alcohol in the same year, it ended up with N153million in VAT on alcohol. If Anambra were to receive its alcohol VAT directly, the state would have pocketed N678million; more than four times what it ended up with.\n\nIt gets even more interesting. The Sharia states of Borno, Jigawa, Katsina, Sokoto, Yobe, and Zamfara consumed zero naira worth of alcohol, according to NBS data.\n\nYet, each state not only benefited from VAT accruing from alcohol sales across Nigeria but also in some cases, got more revenue than states where billions of naira worth of alcohol were consumed.\n\nFor instance, while Borno was not captured at all by the NBS consumption expenditure report, because \u201csecurity issues prevented collecting a representative sample,\u201d by getting 2.49 percent of VAT allocations for 2019, its share from alcohol sold that year would be N158million. Whereas, it would have been zero revenue if the principle of earning by sales were to truly apply.\n\nFurthermore, Jigawa, Katsina, Sokoto, Yobe, and Zamfara all had zero alcohol sales recorded, at least officially. Yet, alcohol VAT accruable to these states was N166million (2.6 percent of VAT), N194million (3.05 percent), N145million (2.28 percent), N118million (1.85 percent), and N122million (1.92 percent) respectively.\n\nZamfara, the birthplace of Sharia in Nigeria, with its revenue of N122million from alcohol taxes got more than Bayelsa, where N8.1billion worth of alcohol was consumed but the state ended up with N93million in revenue, even when it could have earned four times more (N409million) directly.\n\nThe Sharia states have for 22 years since they adopted that law, been bingeing heavily on alcohol taxes, even when the intoxicating substance is banned from being sold in their domains. When found, alcohol consignments are destroyed. Loss of revenue is the least of worries for those caught during such operations by Hisbah; the religious police.\n\nHowever, minute as it may be, a portion of state revenue used to pay salaries of the Hisbah officials, and other social amenities they enjoy like the rest of society, come from revenue accruing from alcohol taxes.\n\nPiecing the data together\n\nGetting data was always tricky, and for years, it was a mystery if and what Nigeria\u2019s Sharia states benefited from banned goods such as alcohol. Finding what each state earned from VAT, one of the main variables, was easy. This was to be calculated as a percentage of alcohol consumption, which was the elusive part.\n\nIn Nigeria, Value Added Tax was first introduced in 1993. Though the current VAT rate became effective in February 2020, this article uses data for 2019, hence, calculates VAT based on 5 percent, the previous rate.\n\nVAT is centrally collected \u2018on behalf\u2019 of all the states in Nigeria, and shared monthly based on a formula that gives the Federal Government 15 percent, States share 50 percent and Local Governments share the balance of 35 percent.\n\nTwo main data sets are employed; the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) disbursement reports for 2019 and the Consumption-Expenditure Pattern in Nigeria report published in May 2020, both from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).\n\nThe FAAC reports, analyzed for every month in 2019, showed how much each state got as VAT and the corresponding percentage. Also, disbursements disaggregated by Local Government Areas were summed in giving a total view of disbursements to each State.\n\nThe Consumption-Expenditure report, on the other hand, gave a first-of-its-kind insight into how much Nigerians spend on different goods. What they spent on alcohol was used to determine the value for VAT on alcohol.\n\nSubsequently, each state\u2019s percentage share of total VAT allocation was plugged into the alcohol VAT value to determine what each state was getting from alcohol sales.\n\nIf all that was hopefully, not fuzzy, complete data sets can also be viewed here.\n\nHow does it end?\n\nIshaq Akintola, a professor of Islamic Eschatology and founder, Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC), usually very vocal on Islamic topics in Nigeria, declined comment on whether or not it is appropriate for Sharia states to benefit from alcohol taxes.\n\nThis is because \u201cthere is no Sharia in the southwest, the Christians don\u2019t allow us to practice our Allah-given fundamental human rights, so we don\u2019t know what obtains anywhere else\u201d.\n\nHe said only Islamic scholars from states where Sharia is being practiced can comment on it.\n\nBut, is it possible for Sharia states to indicate they do not want alcohol and other forbidden taxes included in what is shared with them monthly?\n\nYusuf, at the Al-Qalam University, reiterated that to the extent it is national allocation, Sharia states could accept alcohol taxes. For Kano to share its revenue with Lagos for instance, but not collect from Lagos (say, because of alcohol), it will be injustice, he said.\n\nOn the other hand, Bello, who has taught Islamic law for decades, sighed deeply and responded, \u201cIt is possible for the state to do that (i.e. reject alcohol taxes), and an Islamic state should actually do that.

          "title": "Microblogging and the Nigerian State: Matters Arising",
          "text": "The Nigerian government\u2019s suspension of the use of Twitter, a microblogging platform has resurfaced questions around the growth of information technology and how it can best be deployed for the greater good of the many.\n\nThe vice president, Yemi Osinbajo (SAN) recently declared that the Nigerian government is ready to introduce a new mechanism to widen the tax net.\n\nThis mechanism involves the collection of taxes on the Nigerian income of global technology giants not based in the country, but with significant economic presence. According to Section 4 of the Finance Act 2019, \u201cthe finance minister, may by the order of the president, determine what constitutes the significant economic presence of a company other than a Nigerian company\u201d.\n\nThe Nigerian government is set to utilize this legal provision by taxing profits made in the country by global technology and digital firms such as Google, Twitter, Facebook, Microsoft, Netflix, among others.\n\nOver the years, efforts have been made to widen the tax net, including the creation of the Voluntary Assets and Income Declaration Scheme (VAIDS), which was an attempt to bring more people into the tax net, and hiking the VAT rate from 5.0 percent to 7.5 percent.\n\nRead Also: How Nigeria\u2019s Twitter ban will stifle digital ecosystem\n\nNotably, total tax revenue increased by 59.1 percent to N5.3 trillion between 2016 and 2019. However, due to COVID-19 and the resultant effects on the economy, tax revenues declined by 5.8 percent to N4.9tn in 2020, driving an urgent need to broaden the tax base.\n\nThe storm and the teacup\n\nThe problem of the power of social media, as a product of private enterprise, remains a prickly global issue as governments\u2019 worldwide struggle to establish the balance between individual rights and social responsibility.\n\nWhile governments have been accused of muzzling free speech, social media entrepreneurs commit the same offence with less or no public outrage.\n\nOn Friday, June 04, 2021, at about 04:34 PM (WAT) the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) through the minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, announced the indefinite suspension of the use of Twitter in Nigeria. The announcement first appeared on the ministry\u2019s Twitter handle @FMICNigeria and cited the use of the platform for activities that were capable of undermining the country\u2019s corporate existence as a reason for the suspension.\n\nHowever, Nigerians generally believed that the government responded to Twitter\u2019s decision to delete a tweet by the Nigerian President where he was alleged to have threatened violence against a section of the country.\n\nThe President was alleged to have responded to the violence erupting in parts of the country by saying on June 01, 2021, that: \u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian Civil War. Those of us in the fields for 30months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.\u201d\n\nThis statement was believed by Twitter managers to be inappropriate and breached the company\u2019s policy on acceptable speech on its platform. In a swift reaction to the company\u2019s decision to delete the Nigerian President\u2019s tweet on its platform, the Nigerian Federal Ministry of Information directed the National Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) to immediately commence the process of licensing all OTT (Over the Top) and social media operations in Nigeria and suspend the operations and use of Twitter in the country.\n\nRead Also: Digital entrepreneurship: a \u2018diamond in the rough\u2019 for SMEs in Nigeria\n\nLater that week, the Association of Licensed Telecommunication Operators of Nigeria (ALTON) confirmed that its members had received formal instructions from the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), the sector regulator, to suspend access to Twitter, while the attorney-general of the Federation (AGF) and minister of justice, Abubakar Malami had reportedly issued a statement ordering the prosecution of violators of the Twitter suspension order in Nigeria insisting that users of the platform would be prosecuted.\n\nThe presumption that social media is a socially and politically neutral platform for societal conversation is false. Owners of microblogging platforms have recognizable biases that range from the innocuous to the sinister and these biases could have severe consequences for social and political stability in different parts of the world.\n\nFrontier and emerging market economies appear to face the blunt force trauma of the biases of owners of microblogging platforms more powerfully than more mature countries.\n\nMore recently one of the most publicized battles with a social media platform was the bust-up between the United States of America\u2019s President Donald Trump and Twitter in which the social media platform banned the US President from using its platform to tweet until 2023.\n\nThe action of Twitter to bar the then US President inspired several global conversations over the power social media wielded and the capacity of the owners of social media to use it to shape the public conversation, perception, and action.\n\nWhile the Twitter ban could be seen as putting the US President in check over what generally were considered incendiary tweets, it showed that private enterprises managing social media platforms could wield enormous power over what societies consider acceptable or unacceptable speech or conduct, it hands such institutions a sword that could swing both ways.\n\nIt is this inherent capacity of social media enterprises to sway collective opinion and subtly affect people\u2019s decisions that make social media institutions as dangerous as they are liberating.\n\nNo Time for Excuses\n\nBe this as it may, the Federal Government of Nigeria\u2019s action to suspend microblogging platform Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria was precipitated and clever by half.\n\nA local Nigerian adage says that the answer to a headache is not cutting off the head. The answer to Twitter\u2019s removal of a Nigerian Presidential Tweet that did not comply with the company\u2019s governance guidance should certainly not have been the suspension of its operations in the country.\n\nIndeed, by the suspension, the government has highlighted its intolerance and its tendency to act before introspection, both characteristics unbefitting of an administration that claims to respect citizens\u2019 rights and the rule of law.\n\nThe suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria conflicts with Chapter 2 section 22 of the Nigerian 1999 constitution as amended in 2011. The section declares that \u201cThe press, radio, television and other agencies of the mass media shall at all times be free to uphold the fundamental objectives contained in this Chapter and uphold the responsibility and accountability of the Government to the people\u201d.\n\nMicroblogs are channels by which media platforms hold governments accountable and so suspending such microblogs goes against the spirit of the country\u2019s constitution which guarantees citizen\u2019s access to information.\n\nConcerns about national security are valid but they must be viewed within the wider context of balancing national security interests with the rights of citizens to information. So far, this has been a delicate global trapeze trick. However, governments cannot use this as an excuse to plug the mouths and stop the keyboards of subscribers to social media.\n\nThe Twitter Red herring\n\nThe Twitter saga is an unfortunate diversion from major social issues such as the wantoning killing of Nigerians across the federation by marauding herdsmen. The killing of almost 50 citizens in Oyo state, another 100 citizens in Benue state, 3 citizens in Ogun state and 10 in Kaduna state within forty-eight (48) hideous hours camouflages behind the issue of a Twitter suspension.\n\nHowever, both issues are tangentially linked. Microblogging platforms provide Nigerians with up-to-the-minute information on human carnage going on across the country. The social media tool enables citizens to weigh national insecurity and the nature and effectiveness of the government\u2019s response.\n\nThe threat to Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence is not Twitter but the government\u2019s refusal to frontally address the issue of insecurity. The fact that the government wants to wish Twitter away does not resolve the existential challenge of a rampaging band of terrorists unleashing asymmetric war on the country.\n\nRather than spend time squandering local and international goodwill in fighting an obscure and relatively unimportant battle with Twitter, the federal government would do well to address the Goliath knocking the breath out of its credibility.\n\nThose celebrating the action as a show of might by Nigeria over a global tech giant are either naive, short-sighted or both. Nigeria and Nigerians would be better served if the country shows itself to be in control of the safety and livelihoods of its citizens and in control of its territorial borders than flexing muscles with a perceived digital enemy.\n\nA local adage suggests that the federal government has avoided finding an enduring cure for its festering ringworms (security and economic distress) as it casually continues to pick at its pimple (Twitter).\n\nThere is a place for ego and a place for temperance and good choices, Nigeria needs to shun the former and embrace the latter. Both physical security and enterprise security are of greater strategic importance than bruised tweets. The earlier the administration stops throwing red herrings the faster it can get to work on addressing Nigeria\u2019s more pressing problems.\n\nIn the light of these facts, BusinessDay analysts are of the opinion that, given the local reach of the technology giants, the mechanism can potentially yield some results \u2013 increasing the revenue contribution from tax and easing the burden on public debt. However, taking into account the recent Twitter ban, this may send unfriendly policy signals to foreign technology businesses and may have negative implications for already weak FDI flows.\n\nWe recommend that the government focuses more on the underlying causes of the country\u2019s weak tax base and implement policies to improve the ease of doing business, support business growth and attract foreign investors, which strengthens the tax base.",

          "text": "ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe lawyer of a self-styled Yoruba activist, Sunday Adeyemo, also known as Sunday Igboho, has asked Nigeria\u2019s secret police, SSS, to apologise to his client over the invasion of his home.\n\nThe lawyer, Yomi Aliyu, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), also demanded N500 million damages from the security operatives for destroying his Ibadan residence during a midnight raid on Thursday.\n\nHis vehicles, including his G-wagon, Prado Jeep, and some valuable properties including furniture, and windows were reportedly destroyed.\n\nThe attack occurred barely 72 hours before the planned rally in Lagos by Mr Igboho and others to further canvas a Yoruba nation.\n\nThe spokesperson of the SSS, Peter Afunaya, who confirmed the raid in a press conference in Abuja, said a total of seven AK 47 rifles were recovered, alongside pump action guns, 5,000 rounds of ammunition and other weapons.\n\nHe said security operatives recovered the weapons after a \u201chot gun duel between them and Igboho\u2019s guards.\u201d\n\nThe SSS also admitted that two of Mr Igboho\u2019s men were killed in the process while a security agent was shot on the right hand and is currently responding to treatment.\n\nMr Igboho was also declared wanted by the secret police.\n\nLawyer speaks\n\nMr Aliyu in a statement released on Saturday titled, \u2018Illegal and Grossly Unconstitutional Invasion\u2019 noted that his client has \u201calways preached peace and warned his followers never to have recourse to violence saying that \u2018it is God and alale (ancestors) that will fight for Yoruba Nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is nowhere in the civilised world that a citizen who had no prior invitation by security agent or had resisted arrest will be so invaded with his rights to dignity of human persons, ownership of property and sanctity of life trampled upon during the invasion.\n\n\u201cNo demand to enter was made but rather they shot their way into the house allegedly killing seven people though a DSS spokesman admitted killing two people.\u201d\n\nMr Aliyu also said the security operatives paraded guns harvested from their armoury with a view to making members of the public to believe that \u201cour client keeps militia or as stated by them, he is waging war on Nigeria. Will this be with his mere amulets? People who know our client of over 20 years will testify that Igboho Oosa does not carry a gun on his person!\u201d\n\n\u201cOne thousand euro, two million naira, expensive jewellery worth millions, travel documents, amulets, iPhone 12 belonging to him, phones of about 15 others living in the house including those killed by the raiders and other belongings yet to be identified belonging to his wives were carted away. The only guns were those of the police escorts of his guests.\n\n\u201cWe hereby demand that the Federal Government orders an investigation into the actions of the various security operatives led by DSS that raided Chief Sunday Adeyemo\u2019s house with a view to sanctioning them and release all the innocent people arrested and compensate the families of those murdered.\n\n\u201cOur client should also be paid N500 million as reparation for damage to his exotic cars that include Mercedes Benz G-Class and 2019 Lexus Car. We also demand a public apology,\u201d he wrote.",

Kennedy, Eisenhower, Harry Truman, Thomas Jefferson make up the rest.\n\nThe report must be shattering for Trump, who always described his presidency in positive superlatives, and he the best president America ever had, after Lincoln.\n\nAccording to a report by Fox News, The Historians Survey took input from 142 historians, professors, and observers of the presidency.\n\nThey ranked the presidents from one (not effective) to 10 (very effective) on 10 qualities.\n\nThese included public persuasion, crisis leadership, economic management, moral authority, international relations, administrative skills, relations with Congress, vision/setting an agenda, \u201cpursued equal justice for all,\u201d and performance within context of times.\n\nThe responses were then averaged in their given categories and contributed to the presidents\u2019 final scores.\n\nThe survey showed that Trump\u2019s worst categories were moral authority and international relations, with him being ranked dead last among the 44 presidents included in the survey.\n\nTrump\u2019s co-equal in the ranking, Franklin Pierce was known for signing the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which allowed territories to determine whether they would legalize slavery upon their application for statehood.\n\nHere is the full ranking as culled from C-SPAN\u2019s website.",

          "text": "Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has filed a lawsuit, asking the court \u201cto compel President Muhammadu Buhari to disclose spending details of the overdrafts and loans obtained from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) since May 29, 2015, including the projects on which the overdrafts have been spent, and repayments of all overdrafts to date.\u201d\n\nSERAP is also seeking an order to compel the president to \u201cexplain and clarify whether the $25bn (N9.7trn) overdraft reportedly obtained from the CBN is within the five-percent limit of the actual revenue of the government for 2020.\u201d\n\nThe suit followed SERAP\u2019s Freedom of Information (FoI) request to President Buhari, stating that: \u201cDisclosing details of overdrafts and repayments would enable Nigerians to hold the government to account for its fiscal management and ensure that public funds are not mismanaged or diverted.\u201d\n\nIn the suit number FHC/ABJ/CS/559/2021 filed last week at the Federal High Court, Abuja, SERAP is also seeking: \u201can order directing and compelling President Buhari to disclose details of overdrafts taken from the CBN by successive governments between 1999 and 2015.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Bandits Kill Seven, Kidnap 10 In Fresh Kaduna Attacks\n\nIn the suit, SERAP is arguing that: \u201cSecrecy and the lack of public scrutiny of the details of CBN overdrafts and repayments is antithetical to the public interest, the common good, the country\u2019s international legal obligations, and a fundamental breach of constitutional oath of office.\u201d\n\nJoined in the suit as respondents are the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, SAN; the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed; and the Governor of CBN, Godwin Emefiele.\n\nSERAP is also arguing that: \u201cEnsuring transparency and accountability in the spending of CBN overdrafts and loans would promote prudence in debt management, reduce any risks of corruption and mismanagement, and help the government to avoid the pitfalls of excessive debt.\u201d\n\nAccording to SERAP: \u201cBy the combined reading of the Constitution of Nigeria 1999 (as amended), the Freedom of Information Act, the UN Convention against Corruption, and the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights, there are transparency obligations imposed on the government to disclose information to the public concerning details of CBN overdrafts, loans and repayments to date.\u201d\n\nSERAP is also arguing that: \u201cThe Nigerian Constitution, Freedom of Information Act, and these treaties rest on the basic principle that citizens should have access to information regarding their government\u2019s activities.\u201d\n\nThe suit filed on behalf of SERAP by its lawyers Kolawole Oluwadare and Ms Adelanke Aremo, read in part: \u201cTransparency and accountability in the spending of CBN overdrafts would also ensure that public funds are properly spent, reduce the level of public debt, and improve the ability of the government to invest in essential public goods and services, such as quality education, healthcare, and clean water.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is the primary responsibility of the government to ensure public access to these services in order to lift millions of Nigerians out of poverty and to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.\u201d\n\n\u201cTransparency and accountability in the spending of CBN overdrafts and loans would also improve the ability of the government to effectively respond to the COVID-19 crisis. This means that the government would not have to choose between saving lives or making debt payments.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe recent overdraft of $25.6bn (about N9.7trn) reportedly obtained from the CBN would appear to be above the five-percent limit of the actual revenue of the Federal Government for 2020, that is, N3.9trn, prescribed by Section 38(2) of the CBN Act 2007. SERAP notes that five-percent of N3.9trn is N197bn.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile Section 38(1) of the CBN Act allows the Bank to grant overdrafts to the Federal Government to address any temporary deficiency of budget revenue, sub-section 2 provides that any outstanding overdraft \u2018shall not exceed five-percent of the previous year\u2019s actual revenue of the Federal Government.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cSimilarly, Section 38(3) requires all overdrafts to \u2018be repaid as soon as possible and by the end of the financial year in which the overdrafts are granted.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThe CBN is prohibited from granting any further overdrafts until all outstanding overdrafts have been fully repaid. Under the CBN Act, \u2018no repayment shall take the form of a promising note or such other promise to pay at a future date, treasury bills, bonds or other forms of security which is required to be underwritten by the Bank.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the Fiscal Responsibility Act provides in section 41 that the government \u2018shall only borrow for capital expenditure and human development.\u2019 Under the Act, the government \u2018shall ensure that the level of public debt as a proportion of national income is held at a sustainable level.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cSection 44 of the Fiscal Responsibility Act requires the government to specify the purpose of any borrowing, which must be applied towards capital expenditures, and to carry out cost-benefit analysis, including the economic and social benefits of any borrowing. Any borrowing should serve the public good, and be guided by human rights principles.\u201d\n\n\u201cSERAP has consistently recommended to the Federal Government to reduce its level of borrowing and to look at other options of how to finance its budget, such as reducing the costs of governance, and addressing systemic and widespread corruption in ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) that have been documented by the Office of the Auditor-General of the Federation.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur requests are brought in the public interest, and in keeping with the requirements of the Nigerian Constitution; the Freedom of Information Act; the Fiscal Responsibility Act; the Central Bank Act; the Debt Management Office Act; and the country\u2019s international legal obligations.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a statutory obligation on the respondents, being public officers in their respective public offices, to proactively keep, organize and maintain all information or records about CBN overdrafts, loans, and repayments in a manner that facilitates public access to such information or records.\u201d\n\n\u201cMandamus lies to secure the performance of a public duty in the performance in which the applicant has a sufficient legal interest.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnless the reliefs sought by SERAP are granted, the respondents will not provide SERAP with the information requested and will continue to be in breach of their constitutional responsibilities and the country\u2019s international legal obligations and commitments.\u201d\n\nNo date has been fixed for the hearing of the suit.",

This is after all the city of the socialist man of the masses, Mallam Aminu Kano, and many of his disciples. Kano is also the home of the richest man in Africa, Alhaji Aliko Dangote.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Buhari Lauds Late Ado Bayero As Son Wears Emir Of Kano Crown\n\nCongratulating the Emir of Kano on his coronation, the Vice President said: \u201cYour Royal Highness, it is this great city over which God has given you the good fortune of being Monarch, a privilege which you know comes with the obligation of preserving these rich traditions of the brotherhood of all tribes and tongues.\n\n\u201cYou inherit not only one of the most revered thrones in Africa, but on a more personal level, your great father was known for his wisdom, courage and integrity. He loved his people and served them with honor and complete commitment. You have a goodly heritage but a particularly difficult act to follow. But we are confident that by the grace of God you will exceed the reputation of your illustrious forebears.\n\n\u201cSo today, as you ascend the throne of your fathers, carrying with you the love and trust of your people, I can only offer you a prayer: I pray that this land will prosper in your reign, I pray that the Almighty God will be merciful to you and to the people of this land and that his hand will be upon you to guide and direct you daily. Your family and tribe will increase, your days will be long, and as your days so shall your strength, your wisdom and your favour with God in Jesus name. Amen.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo also congratulated Kano State Governor, Umar Ganduje for \u201cmidwifing a generational change of guards that only a few will experience in their lifetimes,\u201d adding that \u201cthe swearing-in and handing over of the Staff of Office to the new Emir of Kano is in fulfillment of the extant law and practice of the installation of Emirs.\u201d\n\nThe event was attended by the Senate President, Ahmed Lawan; Chief of Staff to the President, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari; governors of Katsina, Aminu Bello Masari; Kebbi, Abubakar Atiku Bagudu; Bauchi, Bala Mohammed; Jigawa, Mohammed Badaru Abubakar; Kogi, Yahaya Bello; Lagos, Babajide Sanwo-Olu; Sokoto, Aminu Tambuwal; Zamfara, Bello Matawalle.\n\nAlso present were the Ministers of Aviation, Hadi Sirika; Defence, Maj Gen Bashir Salihi Magashi (Retd.); and Agriculture and Rural Development, Sabo Nanono; as well as the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha; the Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammadu Abubakar III, and other traditional rulers.",

They are also often deployed to deliver humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.\n\nThe accident comes after a Black Hawk helicopter crashed last month during a night-time training flight, killing all six on board.\n\nThree pilots and three airmen died when their S70-i went down near the Crow Valley training range north of Manila, prompting the grounding of the entire fleet.\n\nThe Philippines ordered 16 of the multi-role aircraft from a Polish firm that made them under licence from the Sikorsky division of US defence manufacturer Lockheed Martin.\n\nEleven have been delivered since late 2020.\n\nAl Jazeera\n\nREGIONAL\n\nKaduna Governor El-Rufai Wants Carpet Bombing of Forests to Eliminate Bandits in Northwest Nigeria\n\nKaduna State Governor Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State has declared that the military must launch a grand offensive against armed bandits in the North-west in order to free the region of the scourge of kidnapping perpetrated by bandits.\n\nHe said though the military had sustained the decimation of the criminal elements using air strikes and ground troops, insufficient attack aircraft and troops had derailed a final clearance operation.\n\nThis is coming as the Kaduna State chief security officer raised the alarm that bandits were planning to attack his children\u2019s school and kidnap them.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with the British Broadcasting Service (BBC), el-Rufai said a military-led offensive must be initiated to eliminate once and for all bandits operating in North-west forests.\n\n\u201cWe must kill all the bandits who must go to the forest and carpet bomb and kill everyone there. This has been our position for the past two years. I\u2019m happy to say that this is being done, not in the coordinated manner that I wanted, because I wanted this to happen at the same time in all seven states of the North-west.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, we don\u2019t have enough planes. We don\u2019t have enough soldiers. We don\u2019t have enough to do this simultaneously. So it\u2019s been done gradually, but there has been a lot of degradation of the bandits\u201d, he said.\n\n\u201cI assure you we are killing them. We are wiping out their camps, and the military and the the the air force particularly and the Nigerian army with special forces have been doing a great job.\n\n\u201cMany people don\u2019t know how many attempted kidnaps we have foiled many people don\u2019t know because we don\u2019t talk about it. They only know the ones that have succeeded\u201d, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Kaduna State chief executive has withdrawn his children from Kaduna Capital School following security reports of a plot by bandits to attack the school and kidnap his children.\n\nHe told BBC that available security reports revealed that three bandit groups were planning to abduct his son from the school, a situation which he also noted would expose other children to danger.\n\nThe governor, had, in a bid to revamp public education in the state enrolled two of his children, Abubakar Sadiq and his younger sister, Nasrine.\n\n\u201cMy son is registered in the school because his sister also became six years of age and we registered her in the school but we\u2019ve had to temporarily withdraw them for the security of the school because we got intercept from at least two groups that are planning to attack the school to kidnap my son.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they will succeed because there will be enough security there to prevent it but other children may be placed in danger. We have no idea what weapons they will come with,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor said the children, who had taken to home study, were withdrawn from school following security reports made available to him.\n\nGovernor el-Rufai said the state government had maintained its position against payment of ransom to kidnappers.\n\nThe governor had disclosed in an earlier media interview that the plot to abduct his children was designed to see if he would not pay ransom.\n\n\u201cWe have a feeling that the renewed attacks in Kaduna are not unconnected to the position that we have taken as a government that we will not negotiate with criminals.\n\n\u201cWe will not give them any money and they will not make any profit from Kaduna. Anyone that comes to Kaduna will not get a penny from the state government, except he will get a bullet instead.\u201d\n\nSeven killed in Chikun, Kajuru, Giwa LGAs\n\nIn a related development yesterday, armed bandits reportedly killed seven persons within the last 72 hours in Chikun, Kajuru and Giwa local government areas of Kaduna State, an official of the state said last night\n\nAccording to him, the developments were reported to the Kaduna State Government by security agencies on yesterday.\n\nThe source said the bandits shot four kidnapped citizens at the outskirts of Tsohon Gayan general area of Chikun LGA.\n\n\u201cTwo were identified as Solomon Bamaiyi and Francis Moses from Kakau village of the same LGA. The third was identified as being from Kachia town and the fourth remains unidentified.\n\n\u201cIn I Station, Kajuru LGA, two citizens, Reuben Tanko and Sani Jibrin were also shot dead by a group of armed bandits.\n\n\u201cOne Danjuma Alhaji, a native of Tsohon Farakwai of Igabi LGA was similarly killed by bandits at the outskirts of Galadima general area of Giwa LGA\u201d, he added.\n\nGovernor Nasir El-Rufai was said to have sent condolences to their families and prayed for the repose of their souls.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, security agencies have carried out confidence building visit to Iri Station, where some citizens were killed and an unspecified number kidnapped.\n\n\u201cThe Commissioner Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, who led the delegation assured the community of government\u2019s commitment to the security and peace of the general area\u201d, the official explained.\n\nHe also said that collaboration between communities and security agencies is critical and must be cultivated towards enhancing security in areas that are difficult to access across the state.\n\nKingsley Nwezeh in Abuja",

          "text": "England produced a magnificent display as they thrashed Ukraine in Rome to set up a Euro 2020 semi-final against Denmark at Wembley.\n\nManager Gareth Southgate\u2019s side followed up the landmark victory over Germany in the last 16 by producing a performance of composure and the highest quality to continue their impressive progress in this tournament.\n\nHarry Kane was back to his predatory best after struggling in the group stage, following up his goal against Germany by poking home a superb pass from Raheem Sterling after only four minutes.\n\nUkraine barely threatened and England \u2013 having reached the last four at the 2018 World Cup \u2013 were on their way to a second successive semi-final when Harry Maguire powered home a header from Luke Shaw\u2019s free-kick seconds after the break.\n\nAnd the outstanding Shaw was the creator once more four minutes later with a perfect cross that was headed in from six yards by Kane.\n\nEngland were so impressive as they simply overpowered Ukraine with substitute Jordan Henderson getting the fourth \u2013 his first international goal, in his 62nd appearance \u2013 when he arrived with perfect timing to head in Mason Mount\u2019s corner.\n\nTo add to England and Southgate\u2019s satisfaction, they kept their fifth successive clean sheet to maintain their record of not conceding a goal at Euro 2020.\n\nThey will now meet Denmark in the last four at Wembley on Wednesday.\n\nEngland manager Southgate never wavered for a second in his belief that captain Kane would have a significant impact on Euro 2020, even when he looked off the pace and out of sorts when failing to score in group games against Croatia, Scotland and the Czech Republic.\n\nSouthgate\u2019s faith was rewarded when Kane got off the mark with England\u2019s crucial second in the 2-0 win over Germany. It was the catalyst for the real Kane to come alive in the tournament \u2013 and he punished Ukraine in trademark style.\n\nKane pounced for his first, rose to power in a second for his 47th England goal and almost completed a hat-trick in spectacular fashion with a left-foot volley that was turned on to the post by Ukraine keeper Georgi Bushchan.\n\nHe was a constant threat, his link with Sterling increasingly impressive, and has timed his return to peak form perfectly as England now stand only 90 minutes away from their first major final since they won the World Cup in 1966.\n\nKane is the man defences fear \u2013 and even the in-form Danes will regard this display as ominous.\n\nManchester United\u2019s Shaw has had to fight to revive his England career \u2013 having been behind Chelsea\u2019s Ben Chilwell for some time, he missed out on a start against Croatia in the Euro 2020 opener, when Southgate used Kieran Trippier in the left-back role.\n\nIt has all changed since he was brought into the side for the goalless draw against Scotland. Shaw has made a magnificent contribution to England\u2019s run to the semi-final and will be one of the first names on the teamsheet for the game against Denmark.\n\nShaw has been solid in defence while proving to be a potent creator of goals, setting up Sterling\u2019s vital opening goal against Germany then setting up two more here, first with pitch-perfect delivery from a free-kick and then a perfect cross.\n\nIt has not been a smooth ride for Shaw, who emerged as a teenager at Southampton before his big-money move to Manchester United in June 2014.\n\nHe has suffered serious injury at United, and was never trusted by Jose Mourinho when he was their manager, but is now delivering for England in a major tournament \u2013 proof of his character, and an achievement that makes that long road even more worthwhile.\n\nSouthgate has manoeuvred his England squad with great expertise throughout Euro 2020, demonstrating the riches he has at his disposal.\n\nIn Rome, he was able to give a first start in the tournament to Jadon Sancho, the 21-year-old who has just agreed a \u00a373m move to Manchester United from Borussia Dortmund.\n\nSancho slotted in perfectly, showing huge confidence and ambition in a timely reminder of what he can offer.\n\nChelsea\u2019s Mount also returned the England side, with two creators in the shape of Aston Villa captain Jack Grealish and Manchester City\u2019s Phil Foden left on the bench.\n\nHenderson, the vastly experienced Liverpool captain, made his mark while Marcus Rashford was also introduced off the bench.\n\nIt was proof, amid an imperious victory, that Southgate\u2019s England squad has the sort of quality and depth that will make them confident they can finally end that 55-year wait for success.\n\nGareth Southgate is just the second manager to take England to the semi-final of both the World Cup and the European Championship, after Alf Ramsey in 1966 and 1968.\n\nThe Three Lions have kept seven consecutive clean sheets for the first time in their history. They have not conceded for 662 minutes.\n\nThis was Ukraine\u2019s joint-biggest defeat in a match at a major tournament, equalling their 4-0 defeat by Spain in the group stages of the 2006 World Cup.\n\nRaheem Sterling has been involved in 22 goals in his past 21 games for England (15 goals, seven assists), while Harry Kane has been involved in 27 in his past 26 for the Three Lions (18 goals, nine assists).\n\nSterling has provided six assists for Harry Kane for England in all competitions, more than any England player has assisted another in the 21st Century.\n\nLuke Shaw\u2019s assist for Harry Maguire was the first time two Manchester United players have combined for an England goal at a major tournament since David Beckham assisted Paul Scholes against Portugal at Euro 2000.\n\nEngland keeper Jordan Pickford has kept five clean sheets at Euro 2020 \u2013 no keeper has ever kept more in a single staging of the competition before.",

Twenty-four people are known to have died and 121 are missing.\n\nNo survivors have been pulled from the rubble at the site in the Miami suburb of Surfside since the first few hours after the structure\u2019s collapse.\n\nThe families of the missing were told in advance of the decision to pause the search effort, Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Cava Levine said.\n\nThe decision to bring forward the demolition of the remaining block was made after concerns were raised over the approaching Tropical Storm Elsa, which is expected to reach the west coast of Florida on Tuesday.\n\nThe mayor of Surfside, Charles Burkett, said strong winds in the coming days could bring down additional debris from the unstable structure, endangering the lives of the search teams.\n\n\u201cIt was obvious that the building was a problem,\u201d he said on Saturday, adding: \u201cWe agreed that the only solution for that problem was to eliminate it.\u201d\n\nMr Burkett said the controlled demolition could take place \u201cas early as [Sunday]\u201d, and should be completed within days.\n\nAnnouncing the temporary pause in the search operation, Mayor Cava Levine said the latest developments \u201cdo not signify that we are no longer focused on search and rescue\u201d.\n\nShe said preparations for the demolition included \u201cdrilling into columns in the unsafe structure\u201d and a pause was needed while the process was under way.\n\n\u201cWe will begin the search and rescue once again on any sections of the pile that are safe to access as soon as we\u2019re cleared,\u201d she said.\n\nDrones and 3D imaging equipment are being brought in to help those combing the rubble for signs of life.\n\nThe mayor signed a demolition order on Friday. She initially said she expected the demolition would not happen until late July.\n\nThere are no details so far about compensating the owners of the apartments. Meanwhile, officials are investigating other tower blocks in the area for structural faults.\n\nOn Friday, a firefighter carried the body of his own seven-year-old daughter from the rubble of the collapsed block. He had kept vigil at the site for nine days and was there when she was extracted.\n\nStella Cattarossi, who was reportedly with her mother, grandparents and an aunt visiting from Argentina, was the third child to be recovered from the site.\n\nWhat caused the 40-year-old Champlain Towers South to crumble remains unclear. A 2018 inspection, however, warned of \u201cmajor\u201d design flaws in the original design.\n\nThe building association\u2019s board has said it will appoint an \u201cindependent receiver\u2026 to oversee the legal and claims process\u201d.",

(2)Where the number of votes cast at an election in any polling unit exceeds the number of accredited voters in that polling unit, the Presiding Officer shall cancel the result of the election in that polling unit.\n\n\u201cWhere the result of an election is cancelled in accordance with subsection (2), there shall be no return for the election until another poll has taken place in the affected polling unit.(4)Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (2) and (3), the Commission may, if satisfied that the result of the election will not substantially be affected by voting in the area where the election is cancelled, direct that a return of the election be made.\n\n\u201cWhere a voter makes any writing or mark on a ballot paper by which he or she may be identified, such ballot paper shall be rejected provided that any print resulting from the staining of the thumb of the voter in the voting compartment shall not be or be deemed to be a mark of identification under this section.\n\n\u201cThe Commission shall use indelible ink for any thumb mark by voters on ballot papers\u201d, the draft bill stated.\n\nTHISDAY findings revealed that this clause was sneaked into the draft bill by some leaders of the legislature without the knowledge of the committee members.\n\nA ranking Senator and member of the Senate committee on INEC, upon enquiry, told THISDAY that at no time was that provision discussed at the committee level talk less of inserting it in the draft bill.\n\nThe Senator, who spoke on condition of anonymity said, he now understood why the delay in presenting the bill after the committee had long concluded its work.\n\nHis words: \u201cThis is not funny at all. I now know why the presentation of the report had been delayed this long after we finished our work at the committee level. They have been playing hide and seek on the matter.\n\n\u201cFor all I know and other committee members can bear me witness, the issue of ban on electronic transfer of votes was not part of the report we wrote. So, that means the committee Chairman is culpable and owes the committee members an explanation over the strange insertion\u201d.\n\nThe bill, which has been in the works for some time would be laid before the Senate next Tuesday by Chairman of the Senate Committee on INEC, Senator Gaya.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that the bill would then be scheduled for debate on Wednesday with the former governor of Kano State and committee Chairman, Senator Gaya, leading the debate by summarising the provisions of the bill.\n\nHowever, the bill may run into crisis as there are plans by some Senators especially, members of the Senate Committee on INEC to oppose the strange clause included in the draft.\n\nTHISDAY gathered at the weekend that the Senators had already begun to reach out to their colleagues, explaining that they were not part of the inserted clause.\n\nThey have, therefore, pledged to resist the clause banning electronic transmission of votes cast during the general debate of the bill this Wednesday.\n\nIn a related development, despite the protests against the person of Ms Onochie, the source claimed the Senator Gaya-led committee has concluded plans to approve her appointment as an INEC national commissioner.\n\nDeji Elumoye and Chuks Okocha in Abuja",

          "text": "Recent fighting in the Tigray region of Ethiopia has resulted in a famine that is now affecting more than 400,000 people, UN officials say.\n\nIn its first public meeting on the crisis, members of the UN Security Council warned that as many as 33,000 children were severely malnourished.\n\nOfficials said that a further 1.8m people were on the brink of famine as a result of the eight-month conflict.\n\nThey also warned of further clashes despite the declaration of a ceasefire.\n\nThe Ethiopian government, which has been fighting regional forces in Tigray, declared a unilateral ceasefire on Monday.\n\nHowever, rebels vowed to drive their \u201cenemies\u201d from the region and there have been reports of sporadic clashes as pressure builds internationally for all sides in the conflict to pull back.\n\nThe fighting between the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF) and government forces has already left thousands of people dead and more than two million people have been displaced.\n\nAll sides in the conflict have been accused of carrying out mass killings and human rights violations.\n\nOn Friday, several thousand captured Ethiopian soldiers were paraded through the streets of the Tigrayan regional capital Mekelle.\n\nOn Friday, the UN\u2019s acting humanitarian aid chief told members of the Security Council at a meeting in New York that the situation in Tigray had deteriorated dramatically in recent weeks.\n\nThe region was experiencing \u201cthe worst famine situation we have seen in decades\u201d, Ramesh Rajasingham said.\n\n\u201cClose to 5.2 million people still require humanitarian assistance \u2013 the great majority of them women and children,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Ethiopian government has denied allegations that it is been blocking aid after Tigrayan rebels took control of much of the northern region earlier this week.\n\nThe UN political affairs chief, Rosemary DiCarlo, told the meeting that further clashes were likely between Tigrayan forces, the Tigray Defence Forces (TDF), and Ethiopian troops, supported by Eritrean soldiers and Amhara regional forces.\n\n\u201cThere is potential for more confrontations and a swift deterioration in the security situation which is extremely concerning,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cWe urge the TDF to endorse the ceasefire immediately and completely.\u201d\n\nThe fighting began last November, when rebels rejected political reforms and captured army bases. Government forces captured Mekelle later that month.\n\nFollowing a rapid offensive, rebels retook Mekelle and earlier this week entered the town of Shire, about 140km (90 miles) to the north-west, according to UN officials.",
