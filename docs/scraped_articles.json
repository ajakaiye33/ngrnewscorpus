          "text": "Adebayo Folorunsho-Francis\n\nDrug distributors and importers have expressed concerns over the rising number of COVID-19 cases in India, which has inevitably led to a massive death toll and temporary closure of factories.\n\nAmong other things, they warned that patients, especially those with chronic ailments such as cancer, tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus, and diabetes, were at risk due to an impending drug scarcity.\n\nThis is just as physicians in the country called for understanding, adding that the situation could be managed without being panicky.\n\nAs of Friday, India\u2019s coronavirus infection had hit 30 million cases, with around 4,000 deaths daily.\n\nWorried by the development, the Pharmaceutical Wholesalers and Distributors Association of Nigeria on Thursday raised the alarm that Nigeria risked running out of its current stock of pharmaceutical and medical supply.\n\nThe association premised its warning on the rising cases of COVID-19 in India, which is arguably Nigeria\u2019s biggest drug importing hub.\n\nThe President of the Nigerian Association of Pharmacists and Pharmaceutical Scientists in the Americas, Dr. Anthony Ikeme, had also last year emphatically stated that the country expended an estimated $600m (about N276bn) annually on imported drugs from China and India.\n\nIkeme warned that unless the Federal Government developed and executed a blueprint for the economic development of the pharmaceutical industry, the country might pay heavily for its over-reliance on the South Asian country for most medical and pharmaceutical supplies.\n\nSpeaking with Sunday PUNCH, PWDAN Chairman, Dr. Ernest Okafor, expressed concerns that with the temporary closure of some factories, shipping drugs from India was becoming a daunting task.\n\nHe said, \u201cNow that COVID-19 is seriously ravaging the country, we cannot even call our Indian partners for products. They won\u2019t answer you because they are not operating right now.\n\n\u201cThe truth is, once you miss your source for water, that channel dries up. We are the feeder end, not the source. Among the world powers, it is said that when America sneezes, Africa catches a cold. The same thing is playing out. I am not a prophet of doom but I fear more is coming.\n\n\u201cI say that because we have more of Indian representation than Chinese in the products portfolio that we are importing into the country.\u201d\n\nAccording to the pharmacist, the pandemic has resulted in massive disruptions in global supply chains, adding that Nigeria, in particular, is vulnerable as over 70 per cent of its drug supply is imported from India and China.\n\nHe said, \u201cI may not have the proper statistics but, give or take, about 60 per cent of imported products being circulated in the country are from India. Just as we have PWDAN, Indian representatives also have their own association here in the country.\n\n\u201cThat is why I said whatever affects that region will definitely affect Nigeria, not to talk of the scarcity of active pharmaceutical ingredients. Instead of giving incentives to manufacturers, what the government should do is put resources together to build a petrochemical industry.\n\n\u201cIf the Federal Government can take care of electricity and the petrochemical industry, they will rev up the economy and create employment,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother drug distributor, Ogheneochuko Omaruaye, also confirmed the development.\n\nOmaruaye, who doubles as PWDAN Vice Chairman, said drugs like paracetamol or branded essential medicines were gradually leaving pharmacy shelves.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe generic drugs are becoming scarce as a result of the pandemic ravaging the Indian population. It is naturally expected that things like this might happen.\n\n\u201cHowever, when the drugs become available again, our responsibility in PWDAN is to make them available in the same way and manner that they have been manufactured to retailers with patients as the end-users. We are hoping to properly address this matter.\u201d\n\nA pharmacist and the National Chairman, Association of Pharmaceutical Importers of Nigeria, Nnamdi Obi, also said most factories in India were functioning below optimal level because of the situation in the Asian country.\n\n\u201cOnce we exhaust the stock we have presently in the market space and the situation in India doesn\u2019t improve, the reality will dawn on Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother pharmacist, Olabanji Obideyi, said certain drugs had already been out of stock due to the situation in India.\n\n\u201cFor HIV, TB and diabetes patients, they are going to be badly hit, because there is no drug security. Some drugs have been scarce in recent times. There is no way the situation in India won\u2019t affect us. Most of the drugs we consume in Nigeria are from India,\u201d he said.\n\nDoctors allay fear, eye China, Europe\n\nHowever, some doctors have allayed the fears of Nigerians over how the situation in India affects the importation of drugs into Nigeria.\n\nThe doctors said the drugs usually imported from India could also be purchased at European countries and China, though at higher prices.\n\nA consultant clinical oncologist at the Federal Medical Centre, Abeokuta, Dr Alabi Babatunde, said the drug importers who would be affected were those procuring their drugs from pharmaceutical representatives and hospital pharmacies.\n\nHe said, \u201cThey procure their drugs from pharmaceutical representatives and hospital pharmacies. It is likely they will be affected, especially when the products are coming from India. As it were, I know that Indian drugs are usually cheaper than those from European nations.\n\n\u201cWhat it means is that most patients would be left with no choice but to buy the expensive ones available. I understand that India\u2019s human capital is seriously affected by the pandemic. When that happens, a nation will have no choice but to close shops.\u201d\n\nAlso, a clinical oncologist at the College of Medicine, University of Lagos, Prof Francis Durosinmi-Etti, said there was no cause for alarm.\n\nHe said the probability of the country running out of cancer drugs, for instance, was low.\n\nHis optimism was equally shared by the Director of the Federal Medical Centre, Ebute Metta, Dr Adedamola Dada.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true a large volume of pharmaceutical products comes from India, and the ongoing pandemic would affect drug supply and prices all over the world. But we are coping, and we will continue to cope. I am convinced Nigerians would continue to get all necessary drugs,\u201d he stated.\n\nLASG converts COVID-19 wards to TB, HIV sections\n\nMeanwhile, the Lagos State Government has officially decommissioned the remaining volunteer health workers managing COVID-19 patients at the Infectious Disease Hospital in Yaba.\n\nThe decommissioning became necessary after the isolation facility discharged the last set of COVID-19 patients, according to the state Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Gbenga Omotoso.\n\nOmotoso also confirmed that many of the previous ICUs that accommodated infected persons had been converted to admission wards for TB and HIV patients.\n\nThe commissioner told our correspondent that he did not see anything strange in readmitting TB and HIV patients in the former isolation wards because the facilities were originally established to accommodate infectious disease patients.\n\nThe development at the isolation facilities had taken a twist last week when some of the decommissioned volunteers, in separate interviews, accused the state of subtly throwing them out of the facilities without paying their three-month remunerations.\n\n\u201cHow fair is it to decommission people who had worked from January to March, taking care of COVID-19 patients, without paying them?\u201d one of them identified only as Bimpe had queried.\n\nWhen our correspondent visited the facility to verify the claim, it was gathered that only a few volunteers recruited from the private sector were paid two of their three-month remunerations.\n\nOne of the workers who spoke on condition of anonymity disclosed that IDH started admitting HIV and TB patients on April 30, which was their last day at the facility.\n\n\u201cThey have wards A, B and C. The TB and HIV patients were admitted at wards A and B while Ward C was reserved for suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases. As of the time we left, they no longer had COVID-19 patients again. They were only taking care of HIV and TB patients,\u201d the worker said.\n\nMortality rate for \u2018very\u2019 sick COVID-19 patients in Africa higher than normal \u2013Study\n\nMeanwhile, a new groundbreaking study on COVID-19 by Africa-based professors has indicated that adult mortality from 30 days of the coronavirus, after being admitted to critical care with suspected or confirmed infection, appeared considerably high in Africa.\n\nA critical factor in these excess deaths may be a lack of intensive care resources and underuse of it, the researchers noted in the study, published on Friday in the British medical journal, The Lancet.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria reported that the study focused on 64 hospitals in 10 countries \u2013 Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Libya, Malawi, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, and South Africa.\n\nProf Akinyinka Omigbodun of the University College Hospital, Ibadan, Oyo State, and Prof Adesoji Ademuyiwa of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital were the leads in the Nigerian study.\n\nThe researchers said the challenges faced by critically ill Nigerian COVID-19 patients could be partly mitigated by ensuring the availability of the human and material resources needed for their care.\n\n\u201cIt can be demoralising for health personnel to watch helplessly as patients succumb to the shortage of oxygen needed to keep them alive till the body can tackle the virus,\u201d they said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Why severe pneumonia can cause death \u2013Physician",
          "text": "Tobi Aworinde\n\nRetired chief consultant and chest physician, Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Dr Cyril Chukwu, speaks to TOBI AWORINDE on the dangers and prevention of pneumonia\n\nWhat is pneumonia?\n\nFor the layman, we say anytime you have germs that are multiplying in the lungs, that is pneumonia. The medicine language, which says exactly the same thing but using medical terminology, is inflammation of the lungs. Inflammation just means germs are multiplying.\n\nAre there specific places one can pick up these germs or are they everywhere?\n\nThe germs float in the air, so you can\u2019t see them with the naked eye. You can only see them with a microscope. The air we breathe is not germ-free, so you breathe air plus germs, and then if your body\u2019s natural immunity is able to hold back the germs from multiplying, you don\u2019t even know anything happened.\n\nBut sometimes, these germs overpower the body\u2019s defence system and that is when you have pneumonia. When we talk about germs, there are many types of germs. We call them microbes, that is, microscopic organisms. There are also viruses of which there are so many types. Similarly, there are many types of bacteria, fungi and parasites. So, when we say germs or microorganisms, they are in the millions.\n\nWhat are some of the symptoms of pneumonia?\n\nThe commonest one is cough. All chest complaints, whether it\u2019s asthma, tuberculosis or cancer of the lungs, have cough as a common symptom. With pneumonia, there is also fever and chest pain. Some people can be breathless. Having said that, the beauty of medicine is that, sometimes, people don\u2019t show all these symptoms. The only symptoms they show may just be cough. Sometimes, the only symptom they show is just pain. Sometimes, the only symptom they show is a fever or cough. Sometimes, especially in the elderly, they may not show cough, have fever or chest pain, they just show confusion. You just see an elderly person who is confused; it could be pneumonia. The training to be a doctor is to recognise the cough of pneumonia from that of TB, asthma, or cancer of the lungs, because they all present with cough.\n\nHow do you diagnose pneumonia?\n\nThe first thing is history. By history, we mean the patient tells you what is wrong with him: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe. I have a fever. I have a cough. I have chest pain.\u201d In essence, the patient tells you his complaints. Then we do what we call a physical examination. Most people see doctors carrying stethoscopes and putting it on the chest. That is what we call physical examination. Sometimes, with history and examination, you can confirm that it is pneumonia. Sometimes, it\u2019s not quite clear, then you go ahead and do tests. The tests will include an X-ray of the chest, blood test, and if they are coughing up sputum, you can take the sputum to the lab. Those three are the most important ones.\n\nHow dangerous can pneumonia be if left untreated?\n\nWe can\u2019t generalise. It can be very severe that it kills the patient. It can also be so mild that the patient doesn\u2019t even go to a hospital. The patient says, \u201cI have a little cough,\u201d and it just wears off. It\u2019s a balance between the infecting germ, how bad the germ is, and the body\u2019s defence against the germ. So, what a patient feels is the balance between the germ fighting to establish itself within the lungs and the body\u2019s defence trying to defend itself against the germ. We all have different defences; there are different kinds of germs with different kinds of power. But of course, I am just talking in layman\u2019s terms. In medicine, there is nothing like that. The word we use in medicine is virulence, so it depends on the virulence of the microorganism and the body\u2019s ability to defend itself against that particular organism. That determines how severe it is, so it is variable.\n\nIs pneumonia contagious?\n\nNot usually, but if somebody has pneumonia and coughs the sputum onto a surface and that sputum dries up, the germ that caused the pneumonia can float in the air and infect other people. So, usually, it is not contagious, but in a few instances, it can be, depending on the nature of the organism that is causing it. For instance, we all know about COVID-19; which is contagious because it is a virus. If you are just breathing in and out, the virus comes out, unlike some other germs that don\u2019t come out when you breathe in and out. Again, it depends on the organism causing the pneumonia. Some are contagious and some are not.\n\nCoughing is a symptom that pneumonia and COVID-19 have in common. How can one distinguish between the two or is it something you can only do when you visit the hospital?\n\nCorrect. In fact, COVID-19 is a type of pneumonia. Now, it is one thing to distinguish bacterial pneumonia from viral pneumonia or fungal pneumonia and so on. But to ascertain the type of fungal pneumonia or bacterial pneumonia, for instance, is another thing altogether because bacteria and viruses are in their millions. That is what training to be a doctor is all about. Sometimes, a doctor may not be sure and he has to refer to a higher doctor, what we call a specialist, who will then distinguish. So, it is not something a layman can do. Sometimes, you even need a specialist chest doctor to distinguish the kind of pneumonia it is.\n\nIs pneumonia deadly?\n\nYes, if untreated. But that does not mean that everybody who has pneumonia will die because like I said earlier on, it is a fight because the germ or organism causing the pneumonia and the body defending itself. It is like two factors fighting, which is winning? If the body is winning, you may not even go to hospital. But if the germ is winning, then you are very sick and if you don\u2019t go to hospital, it will kill you.\n\nWho is most at risk of pneumonia?\n\nLittle children, the under-fives, are most at risk because their defence is still not strong, and the elderly, because their defence is weakening. Then people with other chest complaints are at risk, for instance, if you have human immunodeficiency virus, are diabetic, have an infection elsewhere in the body, drink a lot of alcohol, have liver disease or have kidney disease.\n\nWhat treatment is available for people with pneumonia?\n\nIt is very simple. That is what we call antibiotics. There are a million and one antibiotics.\n\nHow common is pneumonia in Nigeria?\n\nI can say, in a week, I may see two or three patients with pneumonia. It is very common \u2013 some mild, some moderate, some severe.\n\nHow can pneumonia be prevented?\n\nThat is a good point, but it is difficult to do. The first one is good, well-ventilated houses. When you talk about ventilated houses, security comes in. You know, most times, you close your windows and doors for added security, but that again is in favour of pneumonia, so you have to balance it. When buildings are too close to one another, it is also in favour of pneumonia. But it is easier said than done. People build houses so close together. So, if houses are far apart, well-ventilated, and there is good security such that you can, in theory, leave your doors and windows open and go to sleep, that helps. But we know, in our own situation, you can\u2019t do that. You have to lock up the whole place.\n\nThen dust and smoke. Dust is a problem for people moving on untarred roads, which raise dust and carries germs. Another cause is smoky cars, machines and vehicles, which points to the need for maintenance. So, you see that most of it is outside medicine. Is it the doctors or medical practitioners that will make sure the roads are tarred? Is it the doctors and medical practitioners that will make sure that houses are spaced out like in government reserved areas? Is it the doctors or medical practitioners that will make sure everybody services his car, the public buses and diesel vehicles are well-maintained, and generators, especially industrial generators, don\u2019t emit smoke? Those pollutants carry germs, which cause pneumonia.\n\nAlso, ideally, your kitchen, depending on what you use to cook, should not be near living spaces because of the smoke. If you live in a face-me-I-face-you, where people sometimes cook with kerosene along the corridor, that exposes one to pneumonia. So, ideally, in a good place, we should all have electric cookers so that there is no burning anything bringing in smoke, but that is a tall order.

          "text": "Tobi Aworinde\n\nRetired chief consultant and chest physician, Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Dr Cyril Chukwu, speaks to TOBI AWORINDE on the dangers and prevention of pneumonia\n\nWhat is pneumonia?\n\nFor the layman, we say anytime you have germs that are multiplying in the lungs, that is pneumonia. The medicine language, which says exactly the same thing but using medical terminology, is inflammation of the lungs. Inflammation just means germs are multiplying.\n\nAre there specific places one can pick up these germs or are they everywhere?\n\nThe germs float in the air, so you can\u2019t see them with the naked eye. You can only see them with a microscope. The air we breathe is not germ-free, so you breathe air plus germs, and then if your body\u2019s natural immunity is able to hold back the germs from multiplying, you don\u2019t even know anything happened.\n\nBut sometimes, these germs overpower the body\u2019s defence system and that is when you have pneumonia. When we talk about germs, there are many types of germs. We call them microbes, that is, microscopic organisms. There are also viruses of which there are so many types. Similarly, there are many types of bacteria, fungi and parasites. So, when we say germs or microorganisms, they are in the millions.\n\nWhat are some of the symptoms of pneumonia?\n\nThe commonest one is cough. All chest complaints, whether it\u2019s asthma, tuberculosis or cancer of the lungs, have cough as a common symptom. With pneumonia, there is also fever and chest pain. Some people can be breathless. Having said that, the beauty of medicine is that, sometimes, people don\u2019t show all these symptoms. The only symptoms they show may just be cough. Sometimes, the only symptom they show is just pain. Sometimes, the only symptom they show is a fever or cough. Sometimes, especially in the elderly, they may not show cough, have fever or chest pain, they just show confusion. You just see an elderly person who is confused; it could be pneumonia. The training to be a doctor is to recognise the cough of pneumonia from that of TB, asthma, or cancer of the lungs, because they all present with cough.\n\nHow do you diagnose pneumonia?\n\nThe first thing is history. By history, we mean the patient tells you what is wrong with him: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe. I have a fever. I have a cough. I have chest pain.\u201d In essence, the patient tells you his complaints. Then we do what we call a physical examination. Most people see doctors carrying stethoscopes and putting it on the chest. That is what we call physical examination. Sometimes, with history and examination, you can confirm that it is pneumonia. Sometimes, it\u2019s not quite clear, then you go ahead and do tests. The tests will include an X-ray of the chest, blood test, and if they are coughing up sputum, you can take the sputum to the lab. Those three are the most important ones.\n\nHow dangerous can pneumonia be if left untreated?\n\nWe can\u2019t generalise. It can be very severe that it kills the patient. It can also be so mild that the patient doesn\u2019t even go to a hospital. The patient says, \u201cI have a little cough,\u201d and it just wears off. It\u2019s a balance between the infecting germ, how bad the germ is, and the body\u2019s defence against the germ. So, what a patient feels is the balance between the germ fighting to establish itself within the lungs and the body\u2019s defence trying to defend itself against the germ. We all have different defences; there are different kinds of germs with different kinds of power. But of course, I am just talking in layman\u2019s terms. In medicine, there is nothing like that. The word we use in medicine is virulence, so it depends on the virulence of the microorganism and the body\u2019s ability to defend itself against that particular organism. That determines how severe it is, so it is variable.\n\nIs pneumonia contagious?\n\nNot usually, but if somebody has pneumonia and coughs the sputum onto a surface and that sputum dries up, the germ that caused the pneumonia can float in the air and infect other people. So, usually, it is not contagious, but in a few instances, it can be, depending on the nature of the organism that is causing it. For instance, we all know about COVID-19; which is contagious because it is a virus. If you are just breathing in and out, the virus comes out, unlike some other germs that don\u2019t come out when you breathe in and out. Again, it depends on the organism causing the pneumonia. Some are contagious and some are not.\n\nCoughing is a symptom that pneumonia and COVID-19 have in common. How can one distinguish between the two or is it something you can only do when you visit the hospital?\n\nCorrect. In fact, COVID-19 is a type of pneumonia. Now, it is one thing to distinguish bacterial pneumonia from viral pneumonia or fungal pneumonia and so on. But to ascertain the type of fungal pneumonia or bacterial pneumonia, for instance, is another thing altogether because bacteria and viruses are in their millions. That is what training to be a doctor is all about. Sometimes, a doctor may not be sure and he has to refer to a higher doctor, what we call a specialist, who will then distinguish. So, it is not something a layman can do. Sometimes, you even need a specialist chest doctor to distinguish the kind of pneumonia it is.\n\nIs pneumonia deadly?\n\nYes, if untreated. But that does not mean that everybody who has pneumonia will die because like I said earlier on, it is a fight because the germ or organism causing the pneumonia and the body defending itself. It is like two factors fighting, which is winning? If the body is winning, you may not even go to hospital. But if the germ is winning, then you are very sick and if you don\u2019t go to hospital, it will kill you.\n\nWho is most at risk of pneumonia?\n\nLittle children, the under-fives, are most at risk because their defence is still not strong, and the elderly, because their defence is weakening. Then people with other chest complaints are at risk, for instance, if you have human immunodeficiency virus, are diabetic, have an infection elsewhere in the body, drink a lot of alcohol, have liver disease or have kidney disease.\n\nWhat treatment is available for people with pneumonia?\n\nIt is very simple. That is what we call antibiotics. There are a million and one antibiotics.\n\nHow common is pneumonia in Nigeria?\n\nI can say, in a week, I may see two or three patients with pneumonia. It is very common \u2013 some mild, some moderate, some severe.\n\nHow can pneumonia be prevented?\n\nThat is a good point, but it is difficult to do. The first one is good, well-ventilated houses. When you talk about ventilated houses, security comes in. You know, most times, you close your windows and doors for added security, but that again is in favour of pneumonia, so you have to balance it. When buildings are too close to one another, it is also in favour of pneumonia. But it is easier said than done. People build houses so close together. So, if houses are far apart, well-ventilated, and there is good security such that you can, in theory, leave your doors and windows open and go to sleep, that helps. But we know, in our own situation, you can\u2019t do that. You have to lock up the whole place.\n\nThen dust and smoke. Dust is a problem for people moving on untarred roads, which raise dust and carries germs. Another cause is smoky cars, machines and vehicles, which points to the need for maintenance. So, you see that most of it is outside medicine. Is it the doctors or medical practitioners that will make sure the roads are tarred? Is it the doctors and medical practitioners that will make sure that houses are spaced out like in government reserved areas? Is it the doctors or medical practitioners that will make sure everybody services his car, the public buses and diesel vehicles are well-maintained, and generators, especially industrial generators, don\u2019t emit smoke? Those pollutants carry germs, which cause pneumonia.\n\nAlso, ideally, your kitchen, depending on what you use to cook, should not be near living spaces because of the smoke. If you live in a face-me-I-face-you, where people sometimes cook with kerosene along the corridor, that exposes one to pneumonia. So, ideally, in a good place, we should all have electric cookers so that there is no burning anything bringing in smoke, but that is a tall order. If you have no choice but to use firewood or kerosene, you use it. But the prevention of pneumonia is outside medicine and the doctors and more of government regulation and personal choice.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Southern governors' communique and its discontents",
          "text": "By Ropo Sekoni\n\nThe recent meeting of southern governors at which a communique was released to address some of the issues that have been rattling constituents in the region is more re-assuring of peace, stability, and national prosperity than the views of the communique\u2019s discontents. This meeting\u2019s communique constitutes one bright spot and a remarkable progress in state craft in the governance of the country in recent times, even though it may not be expected by many to bring most of the worries in the country to an immediate halt. It, however, signals the possibility of calming nerves and lowering the antenna of anxiety across the country, thus alerting the country especially the federal government to the need for action on the way forward for the country.\n\nObviously, there are three target audiences for the communique: the people of the three regions in the southern part of the country; the people of the three regions in the northern part of the country; and the leaders of the central government. Although it is too soon to obtain a verifiable account of the impact of the southern governors\u2019 meeting because of the shortness of time between May 11 and the writing of this piece; nonetheless, it is possible to gauge the barometer that various reviews of the communique signal.\n\nThere is no hyperbole in acknowledging that before the meeting of May 11, many southerners have felt like orphans in Nigerian politics. The region has produced various forms of resistance politics loud enough to startle any democratic government\u2014calls for secession, de-amalgamation of Nigeria, and a call for a new Union Charter. And such calls have not been without good reasons: southern populations have been unsafe in their homes, on their farms, and on the roads\u2014federal and subnational; they have been bombarded by threats from the region that is home to tormentors of farmers and travelers in the southern region; and somewhat neglected or ignored by the governors they believe they elected to govern them and represent their interests at forums with northern governors and representatives of the federal government. Many people including this writer have expressed frustrations about the reticence or loud silence of the governors over issues that citizens in the region have seen as an undeniable threat to life and limb in southern states for far too long in a democracy.\n\nIt is, therefore, not surprising that the governors have crafted a communique that is targeted at the people of the region as one of the target audiences. One hears from the communique some assurance from the governors that they have not completely given up on the importance of federalism in the development of a united and prosperous multiethnic Nigeria, where no region should serve as subalterns or subordinates to the other(s).\n\nFor example, the communique\u2019s call on President Buhari to provide leadership for a national dialogue in respect of calls for restructuring and imperative of equity in making appointments to security agencies should be clear to minders of the central government. Citizens have cried loud enough about what appears to be a scheme to transfer the right hand of the Nigerian state to the northern part, with the consequence of making the people in the south marginal to planning and implementation of nation-wide policies in respect of security of life and property. It is salutary that the southern governors have raised the matter of marginalization of southerners in the most important aspect of modern governance.\n\nLetting the president hear such concerns directly from leaders of southern subnational governments suggests that there is imbalance in the design of national security and that such imbalance is suggestive of a return to the reality that subnational governors are reincarnations of military administrators, but elected state actors with mandates from their electors. Put more bluntly, this communique is capable of dousing the feeling that southern governors are more concerned about being in the good books of President Buhari for what they can get as individuals, rather than as representatives of the people that had given the governors the power to speak for and on behalf of people of the southern regions.\n\nRead Also: Ohanaeze Ndigbo blasts Malami over attack on Southern Governors\n\nWith respect to the second level of audience\u2014the people and governments of the northern cluster of states, the responses from non-state actors in the region and the silence from northern governors indicate that other sections of the country are paying attention to the southern governments that have for long been famous or notorious for waiting and seeing or in, local parlance, \u201csiddoning and looking.\u201d The sudden speaking up of southern governors as a block, in the tradition of their northern counterparts, is the stuff of which dialogues are made.\n\nMore specifically, the indication that some states in the northcentral states share understanding of the concerns raised by southern governors is emblematic of possibility of handshakes across the Niger and Benue rivers, a necessary condition for the beginning of nation-wide dialogue that needs to give citizens the assurance that Nigeria can still be saved, despite the anxiety that insecurity had created in the last one or two years.\n\nIn addition, the reported agreement of the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), the cultural voice of the people of the north for half a century, is in order, because the ACF has been and remains the custodians of the permanent interests of the states in the north. Members of organizations like the ACF and the Northern Elders Forum (NEF which has not spoken) are closer to the heartbeats of the people at the grassroots in relation to their desire for a Nigeria that works to meet the material needs of the millions of people in the northern and southern states.\n\nThese organizations are expected to see the potential in a dialogue that can facilitate integrated development that can engender peace and stability and increase national prosperity that can address the human needs, rather than engaging in inordinate wrangling over the issue of sustaining the legacy of military rule, especially the centralism that has made nonsense of subregional governance since the exit of military rule in 1999. So is the report that Miyetti Allah, the official voice of the organization that has become a synonym for terrorism of southern farmers, likely to douse the tension that has been rife across the country for the past two years.\n\nEven if the federal attorney-general\u2019s condemnation of the southern governors\u2019 communique is an official response on behalf of the executive branch or the Senate President\u2019s theory that elected members of government should put in abeyance their right to speak for the regions they govern is designed to serve the interest of the central government, citizens\u2019 reviews of the communique suggest that citizens are listening to southern governors with rapt attention.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe significance of the long overdue meeting of southern governors may not be felt noticeably at present. But it is bound to raise morale of all political actors in the south, especially those whose relevance has been a source of concern to members at the grassroots in southern states, for failing to speak up as actively as their northern counterparts at critical junctures. There is no better way to run subnational governments in a federation than for any section of the subnational governments not to seem to lose its capacity to speak up on matters that have dehumanized its constituents.\n\nIf the communique from southern governors to achieve its goal of opening a new window of communication between the central and subnational governments is to mean much, the logical thing to do now is for president Buhari to respond to the call for national dialogue on the way the country is governed, soon after the president arrives from Paris.\n\nThough rather belated, this column congratulates the southern governors for banning open grazing of cattle and other ruminats in the region and committing to support and facilitate modern ranching in the region.",
          "summary": "It is salutary that the southern governors have raised the matter of marginalization of southerners in the most important aspect of modern governance.\nEven if the federal attorney-general\u2019s condemnation of the southern governors\u2019 communique is an official response on behalf of the executive branch or the Senate President\u2019s theory that elected members of government should put in abeyance their right to speak for the regions they govern is designed to serve the interest of the central government, citizens\u2019 reviews of the communique suggest that citizens are listening to southern governors with rapt attention.\nADVERTISEMENTThe significance of the long overdue meeting of southern governors may not be felt noticeably at present.\nThere is no better way to run subnational governments in a federation than for any section of the subnational governments not to seem to lose its capacity to speak up on matters that have dehumanized its constituents.\nThough rather belated, this column congratulates the southern governors for banning open grazing of cattle and other ruminats in the region and committing to support and facilitate modern ranching in the region.",

          "title": "Why my first marriage crashed \u2013Yeni Kuti",
          "text": "By Christy Anyanwu\n\nTomorrow May 24, Yeni Kuti will hit a milestone. The first child of Afrobeat legend, Fela Anikulapo- Kuti and choreographer per excellence will on that day turn 60.\n\nIn this exclusive interview, YK Power as Yeni is fondly called, opened up on her life journey to the Elders Club. Enjoy it.\n\nYou\u2019ll turn 60 this week Thursday, but you don\u2019t look it, what is the secret of your ever looking young?\n\nThere is no secret to it. I just like to live happily. I don\u2019t hold grudges; I like to be happy with myself. I like to smile and laugh a lot. Those that know me know that I love fun. If you say I look young, maybe, that is the reason.\n\nDoes it have anything to do with your genes?\n\nThat could be a very good factor as well. That probably has a major factor.\n\nGenes from your dad or mum?\n\nGenes from both of them. My grandmother passed away at 95 and she didn\u2019t really look it except when she got ill. She was smart and outgoing. I remember when she turned 70; Fela said: \u2018mum, you are not looking a day older.\u2019 My father too was quite younger than his age.\n\nHow was your growing up, coming from an influential family, were you a spoilt child?\n\nWho wants to spoil you in my family? Nobody! You will only get correct slap. I started to fend for myself at a very early age. At 18 or 19 years, I\u2019ve started fending for myself.\n\nDoing what?\n\nTrying to survive. Working and paying house rents.\n\nWere you not staying in your parents\u2019 house?\n\nMy father\u2019s house was burnt. He didn\u2019t have a house. My mother didn\u2019t have a house either. We (children) stayed with our mother and we had to pay rents. My siblings and I contributed money to pay rent. We never even had any house help growing up. We had to fetch water, wash our clothes by ourselves. We lived in Ikate, Surulere then and Ikate was known for not having running water, and nothing like house help to help fetch water.\n\nWhat lessons have you learnt about life?\n\nLife is transient. Do what you have to do when you have to do it and enjoy what you have. Try to give a good account of yourself so that when you go, you will be remembered for what you do.\n\nIn your teenage years, what was the perception like being Fela\u2019s daughter?\n\nA lot of people didn\u2019t want to be our friend because were Fela\u2019s children. A lot of people looked down on us because we\u2019re Fela\u2019s children. It\u2019s a totally different ball game now. Growing up, it wasn\u2019t like that. If you went to your friends house and they knew you\u2019re Fela\u2019s child, the children will be warned not to mingle with you. That is if they didn\u2019t tell it to your face there and then. Even now at 60, I still remember the incident that happened one day. My uncle, Prof Olukoye\u2019s son introduced me to a girl, Bisola, and there and then she snapped into anger, telling my cousin never in his life should he introduce her to such people again. It\u2019s an experience that stuck with me for a very long time. I was 17 then and I\u2019m 60 now, but I still remember that episode very well.\n\nWas it the same perception that also affected your first marriage?\n\nNo, not at all. It\u2019s just irreconcilable differences between my husband and me. It\u2019s not about being Fela\u2019s daughter.\n\nYou used to teach ladies how to dance Afrobeat. Do you still dance?\n\nOf course yes, I still dance. But you know, we have been on lockdown, so that part remains hazy for now.\n\nAre you saying you still have stamina to dance?\n\nYes. I\u2019m even going to do a video of the old Positive Bands dances. I am going to do a short video to show that I can still dance. I would post it on Instagram soon.\n\nA few years ago, you reportedly got married, what happened to the relationship?\n\nWe are married spiritually not legally. I think spiritual marriage is more important than legal, because we are tied together spiritually.\n\nWere you married in a church or mosque?\n\nThat one is just on paper! We didn\u2019t need church or mosque to get married. Our spirits are married. We are fully committed to each other. You don\u2019t need any church, mosque or registry to join you together. Just to let you know, we are driving out of town for the weekend.\n\nHow did you cope during the COVID-19 lockdown?\n\nVery badly! It was terrible. We lost a lot of money. But that is life; we have ups and downs. I thank God we are no longer in lockdown. I think the Lagos State government felt our pain and so they eased the lockdown. You lock people up and they don\u2019t have palliatives like that of abroad. How are they going to survive? In Nigeria, people make money daily, how are they going to survive without going out on a daily basis? I think we shouldn\u2019t be copying Oyinbo people. But I\u2019m glad that Lagos State government took the initiative to open up.\n\nWho influenced you more growing up, your dad or your mum?\n\nBoth. They both had values that I emulated and live for today. My father was more political. My mother was on the home front. She loved us unconditionally. For my mum, it\u2019s her children first. She sacrificed for us her children. That was why when she died, I gave up dancing so that I could take care of my daughter. My political belief and the way I think as an African woman is what I took from my father. My grandmother too influenced me a lot, in the way I think and act.",

          "title": "2023: Why APC won\u2019t ignore zoning \u2014Odigie-Oyegun",
          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nFormer National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, is an asset and embodiment of everything rolled into one. He is a quintessential public servant, an astute political party administrator, a political icon and many more.\n\nFielding questions from Sunday Sun in this no-hold-barred interview on the state of the nation held in Abuja, he touched virtually on every aspect of national life.\n\nFrom the controversial zoning arrangement in the ruling party ahead of the 2023 presidential poll, the peace of the graveyard in the APC household in his home state, Edo, the kind of president he wants in 2023 to the worrisome, disturbing spate of insecurity in the country.\n\nHis straightforwardness, brazenness and courage in tackling the issues actually left no one in doubt that he is still a delight any day anytime. In fact, it is Chief Oyegun at his best.\n\nSome people that were surprised when you attended the Edo APC dialogue meeting recently asked whether you are still a member of the APC?\n\nThis is the real deep problem we have in this country. It is a pity that people think that way especially that you cannot have a deep, but very sincere difference of opinion because you are on the same platform. We were not charging the APC, but only saying that the decision that was about to be taken was wrong. We only have a difference of opinion, but did not differ as to the quality of the APC and the desirability of the APC, no, not at all. We both wanted the APC to win in Edo State, but unfortunately some of us felt that it was taken wrongly. I have never at any point announced that I have left the APC because if I did, the media will know. I did not do that and I don\u2019t intend to do that. While the issue that created the problem was resolved by the people, we just moved on. In this country, we must get used to misinterpreting difference of opinion to mean disloyalty. They are entirely two different things and if that is not allowed to happen, that is if you can\u2019t have different opinions, then you cannot have people of principle in the party who will tell you things as they really are not as you want it. As for the meeting, when you do something based on principle, there will be no regret and I suppose the same thing happened on the other side. They also strongly believe that what they were doing was right. It was a simple difference in opinion and principle strongly felt and pursued to a logical conclusion. The people became the arbiters as to who was right and who was wrong. There was nothing personal attached to it at all. It was not a personal quarrel and once the struggle was over, we moved on.\n\nWill it be right to conclude that the APC in Edo is now peacefully united under one umbrella?\n\nYes, it is under one united umbrella, but you cannot at any stage in any human organisation or grouping claim that there is total unanimity of opinions and direction. It is impossible for that to happen and that never happens. The reality, of course, will be that those who felt that they have lost something because of the way the election went will continue to feel residue of either regret for doing what they did or bitterness that somebody else, a third party, was the cause of their misfortune. That will always happen, but it is residual and will disappear over time. We have the future ahead of us and if we continue to live in the past, we will never arrive in the future. Yes, it is over and it is over, but that bitterness will naturally be there especially in a human organisation as I said earlier.\n\nWith what happened to Governor Obaseki, will you still say that this is the APC of your dream?\n\nIt could not have been the APC of my dream. The decision taken against Obaseki was not based on principle. There was too much of personal bitterness and that was the way it looked. You want a particular result at all costs and it is wrong to do politics like that. You must take your person out of it and deal with principle, deal with what is right and what is wrong not because somebody offended you or did not offend you that made you prefer something else. The truth is that we have a sitting governor and you must have a provable, incontrovertible disloyalty to the party before you treat a sitting governor in that manner, but there was no such thing on the table. As I said before, I hope the country and the whole political parties must have learnt from that experience, especially that the people are not as reverent as they used to be. We underestimate them to our own peril or detriment. They think, they know what is right and wrong and an individual or group should not force things willy-nilly down their throat. It can\u2019t just work. You can see all over the place that the issue of godfatherism is creating problems for virtually every political party and we are hoping that the Edo experience will make lots of people learn that there are limits to the perceived or so-called exaggerated influence of godfathers. This relationship has failed in many cases unfortunately to the detriment of the people. You can have mentors, but when you have mentored somebody and he has become an adult, please allow him to make his own mistakes and learn. You cannot continue to carry him on your back because his weight will even be too much for you. If you mentor somebody, step back and let him make mistakes and if he does, give him advice, but don\u2019t decapitate him because you mentored him.\n\nWill it be right to say that the Edo saga kept the APC in its present condition of having a Caretaker Committee arrangement as its national leadership?\n\nIt was not just an Edo experience. There were lots of other issues, but I don\u2019t want to go into that because I am somebody who looks at the future not the past in the hope that we have learnt from the past and will not be repeating the mistakes later in the future. Inasmuch as I don\u2019t want to go back to what happened, you know very well that there were lots of issues from all sides before the situation became untenable and what happened happened. It was very unfortunate, but I don\u2019t think going into the past will help matters.\n\nWill you encourage Governor Obaseki to return to the APC?\n\nObaseki was chased out of the party and if he decides to come back, what is surprising in that. I don\u2019t know if he wants to come back and I am not telling you he wants to come back. But, if he decides to, there is nothing wrong with it. How many people have gone to one party and come back. It is a daily occurrence. When we formed the party, how many governors came from the PDP, there were lots of them, but today many have returned to the PDP. If he decides of his own accord to come back, I am very sure he will be well received very warmly.\n\nDo you share the apprehension in many quarters that the APC is facing a bleak future ahead of 2023 with the divisions within the party?\n\nTell me the political party who does not have disagreement within its fold now. We all have disagreements, but if what you are saying is that the nation under the governing party is going through difficult times, there is no question about that. We are certainly going through difficult and challenging times. We must find answers to the security problem in the country because things cannot just continue the way they are. It is obvious, but the solution does not rest in condemning. The solution to this difficulty must be found because the people are unhappy and hungry and APC as the party in power must find the solution to all of these.\n\nWill you say that the APC government has failed Nigerians?\n\nOf course, the party has not failed Nigerians. Yes, there are issues and they must find answers to those issues, yes things are difficult and lots of nations go through difficulties, but that does not automatically become a failure or total failure. Yes, we made some promises but you should remember what the economists use to say, that all things being equal and things cannot be equal because the world economy tumbled, oil price tumbled and lots of things happened totally outside the control of the party. Yes, I totally agree that we probably could have handled things better and I am not going to be the one who will say that everything is going on well 100 per cent, but to say that the APC government has failed is an unfair judgment. Yes, we would have done better but we still have time to correct it. God help us if we don\u2019t succeed in correcting or ameliorating the situation then we will have a bit of trouble.\n\nJudging by the situation now, will it be a mission possible for the APC to retain the power beyond 2023?\n\nHow will I know, we don\u2019t know who the candidate will be. He could turn out to be a charismatic person. Anything can happen and we should not start playing God between now and 2023. Let us leave judgmental politics of 2023 for now and concentrate on the future of this country and how we are going to get out of our present predicaments.\n\nCan you re-emphasis your stand on the ragging issue of restructuring?\n\nWell, we have made our submission and recommendations on restructuring. It is very clear and has been accepted as APC policy, but I am not in the system directly now and may not be able to tell you what is holding it back. Restructuring is part of the APC until it is rescinded and it has not been rescinded to the best of my knowledge. We have a booklet on restructuring which deals with every single aspect of it. It defines restructuring from confederation to devolution of powers to the state and people, even wanting the geopolitical zones to become the confederating units. So, we decided to define what restructuring meant to the APC and went on to make recommendations how it can be handled. It is clear there. The report was approved by the NEC of the party and it is just the implementation that we are looking for. We will continue to wait hoping that one day it will have to be implemented. We can\u2019t run away from it.\n\nWhat do you advise the APC Caretaker Committee on the controversy in conducting the national convention?\n\nWhat is the controversy in conducting a national convention when they are preparing to do it? They have said they are proposing a committee of 70 members to conduct the convention. As far as I am concerned, there is no controversy in organising the convention. They will do it.\n\nHow best can the government handle the spate of secessionist agitations across the country?\n\nIt is something that must be brought under control otherwise all sorts of characters and interests will start exploiting the situation from their own end. And the different groups have different objections whether it is Boko Haram, IPOB or the rest. The fact that there is relative instability is giving that urge to exploit the situation. It is something that the government must have to bring under control. And the earlier we do that the better for the country. One point I must make is the horror with which I view the seeming methodical attacks on our national police. It is becoming something of worry and it is an institution that must be defended. It needs lots of reorganising, but it should not become targets of attack for all and sundry. That totally is not in the national interest, it is not acceptable and whatever needs to be done to protect the Nigerian police must be done with all the issues and problems that they have. This is because without the police, we will have anarchy. So, they must be protected and preserved.\n\nWhat is your take on the controversial issue of zoning of the 2023 presidential ticket in the APC?\n\nIt is the media that are making zoning a serious issue and problem. First and foremost, one thing clear is that it is the responsibility of the person interested in an office to make his intention very clear and work towards it because nobody is going to bring that office on a platter to say congratulations, it is your turn. The person must struggle for it. Otherwise, zoning is not an issue because it happens in everyday life all over the world. It comes with various names like balancing, gender equality or anything, targeted at giving a sense of belonging to disadvantaged areas or persons. In USA, they call it the industrial, agricultural, urban or rural bed. In choosing people, they take votes from these areas into consideration. In Nigeria, it is an existential problem. The situation is such that you must make everybody feel a sense of belonging, sense of participation, sense of equal access even up to ward level. In my ward, we have large rural areas. You cannot take all the representatives from Benin City because it is where the elite and knowledgeable people are. It is simple common sense and I don\u2019t understand why we make all these noise over zoning when it is part of our everyday life. As for the APC arrangement, zoning does not have to be in the constitution even though it is there with all the balancing and federal character. It is only a very stupid party that will continuously take its candidate from a particular zone. Any party that wishes itself out of existence can say that there is no zoning. We will continue arguing over it and the media will continue feasting on it. When they want extremists to make a statement that will shake the whole place they will go to them. But at the end of the day, the parties are not stupid and they don\u2019t wish themselves out of existence. They will still do the balancing required to convince the nation of the need to stay together and tell people that they belong and have equal access. It is inevitable.\n\nIs it possible for the youths to constitute themselves into a third force and take over power from your generation?\n\nIt must happen. The youths must take over whether my generation likes it or not because if we don\u2019t leave, nature will send us away. Of course, we will not live forever. But who do you call youths? List all the serving governors and tell me their ages. Are they old men? No. Go to the National Assembly and tell me how many of the lawmakers are moving with walking sticks. It is the samething at the State Assembly and local government areas, the youths are there. They can take over everywhere but they have to work for it just like I said about zoning. There is no alternative to that. There is no way the elders at 80 or 70 years will voluntarily handover the mantle of leadership to the youths and move away. It does not work that way. Nature arranges it. But, it is how well the youths present themselves to even the voters, not just the leaders of the nation, at that material time that matters.\n\nIs it over for you in any elective position?\n\nIt is very, very much over for me. We just talked about the youths taking over and I am no longer a youth by any stretch of imagination. I am on extra time now. You amuse me when you say what if Nigerians clamour for me to contest for president. Nobody will do that because at my age it is totally and completely out of the question.\n\nWhat are those things you will consider your unfulfilled dreams?\n\nThat should be a question for another day. There are so many and very difficult to list them and I will rather say what I was hoping will be my situation today and that is that I will say, thank you Lord because our country is finally on the path to greatness, but I cannot say that now and that is one regret I have. So, I am thanking God for what I have been able to achieve personally rather than where our nation is currently. As far as personal achievements are concerned, I am fulfilled. I only went into politics because I want to do my bit to help place Nigeria squarely by the time I am on my deathbed. I will have that complete conviction that we are now on the path to greatness. We are the largest black nation in the world. I am not thinking of my personal achievements because God has been absolutely kind to me and I have absolutely no reason to complain about that. The sole motivation for being in politics and public service is to see Nigeria on the path to greatness. I joined politics reluctantly. It is a mission not a job.\n\nWhat is your advice to the electorate and candidates ahead of 2023?\n\nI don\u2019t have any advice for them until I know who and who that are coming out to aspire to lead us. I cannot even advise myself now until I know who and who wants to lead us. We need a very strong candidate, a candidate of character, who understands governance and who can deliver on the hopes of the people of the country.\n\nWhat is your dream president for Nigeria in 2023?\n\nI kept telling people that the next Nigeria president must be slightly crazy because Nigeria is a difficult country.\n\nDid it surprise you hearing the PDP governors describe the APC government as incompetent and rudderless?\n\nWell, that is PDP and they are the opposition and I didn\u2019t expect them to do anything differently. This is what we did to them to get them out of office and they are just paying us in our own coins. They are opposition party and it is when we have such reactions within the party that such issues will be of any concern.",

The bodies were then conveyed to the church and mosque respectively for the Christian and Muslim for funeral prayers.\n\nAfter the funeral services, the bodies were then moved to the National Military Cemetery.\n\nBurial ceremony started with the arrival of the Minister of Defence, Major General Bashir Magashi, who represented President Muhammadu Buhari; the Senate President, Ahmed Lawan; Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha; Chief of Staff to the President, Prof Ibrahim Gambari, very senior retired and serving officers and former Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General ubuike Ihejirika. Others who were present were Chief of Defence Staff, General Lucky Irabor; Minister for Information, Alhaji Lai Mohammed and the Inspector General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba. Also in attendance were Lt. General Dambazau; Kaduna State governor Nasir el-Rufai, presidents of the Defence and Police Officers Wives Association (DEPOWA), Nigerian Officers Wives Association (NAFOWA) and Naval Officers Wives Association (NOWA).\n\nIn his address on the occasion, the Chief of Defence Staff, General Irabor, said the officers died as a result of their love for the country. He said their deaths would not be in vain. He assured that the war on insecurity must be won. He described the late COAS as \u201cnot just a fine officer but one with passion, very professional, had love for the job and a very dependable colleague.\u201d\n\nHe assured the families of the deceased that the armed forces, the Federal Government and the Nigerian nation would not abandon them.\n\nAlso speaking, the Minister of Defence, Magashi, said the demise of the COAS and the other officers was a huge blow to the nation, but assured of government\u2019s continuous support to the officers and men of the military and their families.\n\nMeanwhile, a torrent of condolence messages have continued to pour in as governors and other notable Nigerians expressed shock and grief over the tragic demise of COAS Attahiru and the other members of his entourage and the four-man crew of the military aircraft.\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo, expressed sadness over the death of the Lt. General Ibrahim Attahiru, and the other military officers in an air crash.\n\nHis words: \u201cTheir death while in active service in the defense of our country reflects the depth of sacrifice our military officers, men and women of the other ranks are often prepared to make.\n\n\u201cWe honour the service of the Army Chief and all those involved in this unfortunate accident even as we continue to demonstrate our profound appreciation to all in our military services and in harm\u2019s way. The gallantry of these heroes would always be remembered.\n\n\u201cI join the President and Commander-in-Chief of the Nigerian Armed Forces to commiserate with families, friends and colleagues of these gallant officers and men who died in the crash. I pray that God grants them the fortitude to bear the loss. May the memories of the departed remain ever blessed.\u201d\n\nThe Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mustapha, and members of the Federal Executive Council (FEC), have described death of Lt. Gen. Attahiru and 10 other senior military officers and service member, as shocking.\n\nIn a statement by the Director, Information, Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Willie Bassey, the cabinet members noted that COAS was passionate and professional in the discharge of the responsibilities of his office especially the prosecution of internal security operations across the country, since his appointment in January 2021.\n\nImo State governor Hope Uzodimma in a condolence letter to President Muhammadu Buhari, described the late COAS as among the best, a true officer and gentleman who epitomised the finest qualities of the Nigerian Army.\n\n\u201cIndeed to lose such a gallant general whose services to the nation had just reached its peak is most disheartening. It is even more heartrending, when he was tragically sent to the world beyond with other officers on the same day,\u201d Uzodimma said.\n\nSimilarly, former military administrator of Delta State (rtd), Air Commodore Luke Ochulor, noted that the late COAS died when he was mostly needed, adding that the nation would miss him.\n\nGovernor of the State of Osun, Mr. Adegboyega Oyetola, on his verified Twitter handle and Facebook page commiserated with President Buhari and the families of the deceased and urged Nigerians not to mourn like unbelievers.\n\nGovernor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State who also commiserated with President Buhari and the Nigerian Army, described the tragic death of Attahiru as \u201cdeeply saddening.\u201d\n\nThe governor also condoled with the deceased\u2019s Doka community, the people of Kaduna North Local Government Area and Kaduna State government over the tragedy.\n\nChairman of the South East Governors Forum and Ebonyi State governor Dave Umahi described the COAS\u2019s death as not only a colossal loss, but a national calamity. He called on Nigerians to pray for the repose of the souls of the late Army Chief and other gallant members of the Armed Forces who died in the plane crash. He urged the Federal Government to immediately commence investigation into the matter.\n\nSimilarly, Rivers State governor, Nyesom Wike, said he was saddened by catastrophic crash that claimed the lives of Lt. General Attahiru and the other members of his entourage, saying their demise was a colossal loss to the nation.\n\nHe recalled how Attahiru visited the Government House, Port Harcourt, and with clarity articulated his vision and strategy to end insurgency in the country.\n\nIn his condolence message, Benue State governor, Samuel Ortom, said the death of the COAS and the other very senior officers was a major setback to the fight against insecurity in the country. Ortom posited that the late COAS demonstrated commitment to tackling the wave of insecurity since his assumption of office earlier this year.\n\nThe All Progressives Congress (APC) described Attahiru as a \u201cgallant soldier that served Nigeria with honour and dignity. The party in a statement signed by the National Secretary, Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, James Akpanudoedehe, said that it was in deep shock over the demise of the COAS, which it described as a great national loss.\n\nThe People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday, demanded an extensive probe into the plane crash that killed, Lt General Attahiru and 10 others, as well as other air mishaps involving military officers, in recent times.\n\nThe PDP, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said it was grieved by the death of the COAS and other officers in the military plane crash on Friday.\n\nThe party described \u201cAttahiru and the other officers as heroes who gave their lives for the security of our nation,\u201d adding that the tragic incident was a huge blow to Nigeria.\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA, Brig. General Mohamed Buba Marwa (retd), in a statement by NDLEA\u2019s Director, Media and Advocacy, Femi Babafemi, said that the death of Attahiru was a great loss to the country. Marwa, who sent his condolence message from Vienna, Austria, where he is attending a meeting of the United Nations Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, recalled his recent meeting with Gen. Attahiru, saying that he was impressed with the late army chief\u2019s plans for tackling the security challenges confronting the country.\n\nAlso grieving over the death of Attahiru and members of his entourage, the National Rescue Movement (NRM), said: \u201cThe death of these gallant soldiers is most regrettable, especially considering the height of insecurity in the land and ongoing efforts of the Lt. General Attahiru\u2019s led army, to contain same, since his assumption of office a few months ago as the Chief of Army Staff.\u201d\n\nNRM called for a thorough investigation into the incident, to unravel the circumstances that resulted in the painful national disaster in order to forestall future occurrence.\n\nThe North Central Governor\u2019s Forum in a statement by the chairman of the forum and Governor of Niger State, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, described the plane crash which claimed the lives of Attahiru and the other senior officers who perished with him as \u201cnot only worrisome but a great set back to the nation at this trying moment of security challenges bedeviling the nation.\u201d\n\nOgun State governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, while condoling the President Buhari, and the bereaved families, said: \u201cThese accomplished officers died while their services were most needed in the nation\u2019s search for peace and security. They served meritoriously in the military and their untimely exit is very painful.\u201d\n\nEkiti State governor, Kayode Fayemi, who also condoled the family of Attahiru, described him as a \u201cpatriotic and fearless officer who was always ready to go the extra mile to protect the sovereignty of his beloved country, a quality that was the hallmark of his military career.\u201d\n\nMembers of the House of Representatives called for a thorough probe of the air crash that claimed the life Attahiru, while urging the government to immortalise him by intensifying the war against insurgency.\n\nThe minority caucus, in a statement by the minority leader, Ndudi Elumelu, described the late Attahiru and the other officers involved in the crash as \u201cvery courageous and patriotic soldiers, who gave all in the defence of our dear fatherland. Our caucus calls for a system-wide investigation into the cause of the crash as well as the last two crashes of our military planes which also led to the loss of lives of our gallant and promising officers.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the Chairman, House Committee on Defence, Babajimi Benson, said the demise of the officers was a colossal loss to the country while the Chairman, House Committee on Army, Abdulrasak Namdas, described the deceased COAS as \u201can energetic officer, who was committed to improving the security of the country, especially prosecuting the war against insurgency.\u201d",

General Ibrahim Attahiru, for his gallantry in the war against insurgency and described him as a military chief, who led from the front.\n\nSpeaking at the burial of the fallen officers and men, President Buhari, who said it was a sad day for Nigeria, hinted that the late army chief was appointed as successor to Lt. Gen. Tukur Buratai, because of his bravery.\n\nIn the same vein, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, who joined millions of people across the world to mourn the passing of Attahiru and others said, their deaths in service reflected the depth of their sacrifice.\n\nThis is as former President Goodluck Jonathan, in a message of condolence to the families of the deceased officers, described them as patriots, who died with their boots on.\n\nBut the Borno State Governor, Professor Babangana Zulum, said the late chief of army staff was evidently committed to the fight against Boko Haram and was determined to significantly contribute to ending the insurgency.\n\nIn his remarks, the Chief of Defence Staff, General Lucky Irabor, who said the death of the army chief and other personnel was a sad day for the military, however, promised that sacrifices of the deceased would not be in vain.\n\nThe late army chief and ten other military officers, who died in an air crash in Kaduna, while on official assignment, were laid to rest at the National Military Cemetery, Abuja, at a ceremony attended by the Senate President, Dr. Ahmed Lawan; Governor of Kaduna State, Mallam Nasir el-Rufai and the Chief of Staff to the President, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari.\n\nOthers were the Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni; Minister of Defence, Bashir Magashi; the Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammadu Sa\u2019ad Abubakar; Inspector General of Police, Usman Alkali baba and the Comptroller General of Immigration, Muhammed Babandede, amongst other serving and former public office holders, top military officers, families, friends and associates of the deceased.\n\nThe senior military officers, who died in the crash include the army chief, Attahiru, Brig-General Idris Abdulkadir, Brig Gen Olayinka, Brigadier-General Kuliya, ADC to the late COAS, Major LA Hayat, Major Hamza and Sergeant Umar.\n\nThe list of the crew members are Flight. Lt. T.O Asaniyi, Flt. Lt. AA Olufade, Sgt Adesina and ACM Oyedepo.\n\nBuhari, who was represented by the Minister of Defence, Major General Bashir Magashi (rtd), said the army chief and the officers served the nation gallantly.\n\n\u201cLieutenant General Attahiru was an epitome of gallantry and bravery which culminated in his being appointed the chief of army staff.\n\n\u201cHe led the Nigerian Army from the front and was emulated by others. He will be remembered for his landmark contributions to the unity of the nation\u201d, he said, expressing his heartfelt condolences to the families of the departed officers and men and all Nigerians.\n\nIrabor, who said the death of the army chief and other personnel was a sad day for the military, described the late army chief as a reliable, professional colleague. He recalled the time both of them served at the army\u2019s Training and Doctrine Command in Minna.\n\n\u201cI called him my second in command. We had dreams to take the military to greater heights. This is what we were doing when we were called by the defence minister to report to Abuja. He has left at a time he was needed most\u201d, he said.\n\nThe defence chief said the military establishment mourned with the families of the army chief and others.\n\n\u201cWe say to you, weep not for the sacrifices of our colleagues will not be in vain\u201d, he said, assuring them that the president and the military would continue to support them, adding that the the military remained undaunted by the development with regards to its fight against criminal elements.\n\n\u201cThe armed forces remained undaunted. The war against insecurity must be won.

We need to work ahead with our President for the future of our country\u201d, he said, noting that the territorial integrity of the state has been interfered with and that it was his responsibility to \u201cresocket\u2019 the state back to its proper disposition.\n\nHowever, the national leadership of the PDP, a source claimed, believed that Ayade lost the control of the party structures in the state due to his complacent attitude to party issues.\n\nThe source said it has always been the party policy that governors control political party structures in their state, but \u201cthe governor was very complacent and members of the National Assembly in the state moved and took the party structures from him.\n\n\u201cIt was after this slumber that he woke up and demanded that the NWC should intervene and restore the party structures to him. He was the architect of himself missing out in the power structures to members of the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cAs a governor, he ought to have moved to take full charge of affairs in the state.

          "text": "\u2022 Global Rights accuses govs of paying criminals to buy peace\n\n\u2022 Says impunity now motivation for criminal activities\n\nGboyega Akinsanmi\n\nNo fewer than 340 operatives of the defence and security services died during separate armed attacks that took place nationwide between January and April 2021, Global Rights, an international human rights organisation based in Washington D.C., has revealed in a new report.The report, which covered the violent incidents nationwide, also revealed that the numbers of lives lost between January and April, painted a dreary picture of the declining state of security and increase in human rights infractions across the federation.\n\nThe incidents were revealed in the Mass Atrocities Casualties Tracking Report, a publication of Global Rights, obtained by THISDAY at the weekend, signposting unprecedented deterioration in the state of security when compared with the previous year.\n\nIn its 2020 report, for instance, Global Rights claimed that Nigeria\u2019s sub-national governments had lost confidence in the capacity of the federal government to provide security amid rising cases of mass atrocities that claimed 4,558 lives nationwide in 2020.\n\nIt had also claimed that the reported cases of mass atrocities in 2020 represented a 42.9% increase above 3,188 incidents recorded nationwide in 2019, thereby making 2020 a brutal year for most Nigerians amid the outbreaks of COVID-19 and the eruption of #EndSARS protests\n\nIt had revealed that mass atrocities-related killings by region affected no fewer than 1527 (33.5%) in the Northwest with Katsina, the home state of President Muhammadu Buhari, recording second highest after Kaduna; 1508 (33.08%) in the Northeast, 685 (15.03%) in the North-central, 443 (9.72%) in the South-south, 231 (5.07%) in the South-west and 162 (3.55%) in the South-east\n\nHowever, according to the update released to THISDAY by the organisation, the country\u2019s defence and security services incurred loss of 340 security personnel fatalities nationwide between January and April 2021 alone.\n\nOf the 340 security personnel fatalities, the report revealed that the Nigerian Army lost 193 officers to violent incidents; the Nigeria Police 131; the Nigeria Navy four; the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) three; the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) three and the Nigerian Correctional Service two and Civilian JTF four.\n\nWhile the report put the security personnel fatalities at 340 between January and April 2021, it revealed that violent killings claimed 2,260 lives nationwide within the same timeframe equivalent to 50.4% of total fatalities that occurred in 2020.\n\nBased on geo-political zones, according to the report, 989 violent fatalities were recorded in Northwest; 332 in Northeast; 331 in North Central; 256 in Southeast; 191 in Southwest and 161 South-south.\n\nGlobal Rights, in a remark by its Executive Director, Abiodun Baiyewu, concluded that Nigeria \u201cis clearly a fragile state, and remains vulnerable to combustion from several forms of atrocities. The question to ask is: what are its government and citizens doing to stem the tide?\u201d\n\nWith the huge records of unresolved crimes, the organisation observed that Nigeria\u2019s penchant of covering multitudes of crimes with the blanket of impunity and amnesty does not augur well for the country.\n\nRather, according to the Washington-based rights organisation, the reign of impunity has emboldened perpetrators to increase their activities and serves as a motivation for other actors to cash in on the monopoly of violence.\n\nIt, therefore, noted that lack of trust in the government to ensure justice \u201cis a motivation for reprisal attacks by aggrieved persons and communities.\n\n\u201cIn spite of the hundreds of armed pillages that have occurred in the North, security agents have barely been able to make arrests. There have been no prosecutions for these crimes. The same lens would apply to kidnaps, and communal conflicts.\u201d\n\nIn spite of its continued denial, the organisation noted that several sources \u201chave documented attempts by some state governors to placate organized criminal groups \u2013 paying fat ransoms to kidnappers and offering cashback to bandits in exchange for their weapons and assurance of security.\u201d\n\nIt, however, warned that huge ransoms paid \u201cto kidnappers by the government sets a dangerous precedent that will encourage criminality rather than quell it.\n\n\u201cOrganised criminal groups who maim people, rape women, destroy properties and cause severe humanitarian crises should be made to face the wrath of the law rather than be mollycoddled,\u201d the organisation recommended.\n\nIt added that the latest mass kidnapping from schools in recent weeks called to question the implementation of the \u201cSafe School Initiative\u201d which was launched with millions of Naira invested, after the Chibok girls were abducted to bolster security in schools in the Northeast.\n\nIt said Nigeria\u2019s perpetual battle against insecurity \u201cis at a high cost, with both security operatives and civilians paying with their lives. That cost continues to be too high.\n\n\u201cAccording to S 14(2)(b) of the 1999 Constitution, the primary objective of the government is to ensure the security and welfare of citizens.\n\n\u201cDespite the government\u2019s claim of being on top of the security situation in the country, the spread and context of insecurity have metastasized and shown no signs of abating, blackholing the enormous budgetary allocation to security.\u201d\n\nThe organisation, therefore, observed that it would take more than security hardware to end insecurity across the country.\n\n\u201cAt the core of the various forms of mass atrocities in Nigeria is impunity and at the core of impunity is the failure of state institutions to ensure the safety and security of all Nigerians, as well as justice for crimes perpetrated\u201d, the group added.\n\nOn these grounds, the organisation recommended that Nigeria would need \u201can effective long-term investment in a holistic security architecture that should comprise the efficiency of all aspects of governance and the promotion of human rights.\n\n\u201cThe state\u2019s continued failure to proactively fulfil and respect human rights has led to mass grievances that are compounding the nation\u2019s insecurity and jeopardizing its peace and security,\u201d the organisation suggested.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The General Overseer, the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, has come under fire for reportedly describing the Governor of Kogi State, Yahaya Bello as a man of faith.\n\nAdeboye said Bello's handling of the coronavirus pandemic was an inspiring indication of stoic faith, a rare demonstration from a political leader.\n\nApplauding the governor for his approach to governance, especially as it relates to the issue of religious plurality, Pastor Adeboye described the governor as having tolerance to the extent that the first-ever chapel in Kogi State Government House was built by the governor.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have heard and seen your show of faith in God, particularly in dealing with the coronavirus. It takes the man of faith to have acted the way you did and we are very very pleased with you. We have also heard the news of how you\u2019ve been relating to people of every faith to the extent that you built the first chapel in the government house, Lokoja, we are delighted, Sir.\n\n\"I want to assure you that we will keep on praying for you, we will keep on praying for the people of your state and I believe that the Almighty God will answer our prayers for you. Thank you for granting us audience,\u201d Adeboye said.\n\nHowever, Nigerians on social media have condemned the statement made by the cleric, saying Bello's administration is notorious for human rights violations, depriving workers of their salaries, and lack of developmental projects.\n\nThere have also been violence and killings during elections, which have been linked to the governor, amongst other failures.\n\nRecently, a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party, Usman Okai, alleged that Bello treats workers of the state like slaves.\n\nHe also alleged that local government workers, secondary school teachers, and other workers in the employ of the state government are paid stipends by the state and local governments without any explanation.\n\n\n\nThe PDP chieftain said officers on salary Grade Level 13 in the state are paid between N26, 000 and N30, 000 per month and that many categories of workers are still owed salaries and other allowances.\n\nHe said top state government officials have to practically beg to get some stipends to run the affairs of their offices.\n\n\n\nAlso, Bello's administration and the state police command violated the rights of two President Muhammadu Buhari-Must-Go protesters, Larry Emmanuel and Victor Udoka, by assaulting, arresting and arraigning the peaceful protesters in court, without giving them access to their lawyers.\n\nThe two Buhari-Must-Go protesters were mobbed by hoodlums sponsored by the state government and thereafter taken to the police command.\n\nThe police in their desperation to harass the peaceful protesters also ensured that they were remanded at the Kabba Prison \u2013 without the knowledge of their lawyers or family members.\n\nAdeboye's comment, as a revered cleric, has attracted the outrage of many Nigerians who noted the failures of the governor.\n\nMany have opined that Adeboye was simply soiling his image, as they interpreted his comment to mean he was endorsing Bello's presidential ambition.\n\nA tweep, @AREMO_OLUSHOLA said, \u201cThat was how he prayed for Buhari to become President. Why does Baba always dabble into the world of politics to soil his image?\u201d\n\nAnother Twitter user, @LAQuadri1 wrote, \u201cRCCG overseer is entitled to his opinion. But for the sake of his reputation, he should distance himself from politicians. The worst he can be at this age of his is a spin doctor. He can pray for a damaged soul, but he shouldn't endorse a damaged soul.\u201d\n\n@julietezenwonu said, \u201cPastors are one of the root causes of Nigeria's problems! Evil pastors deceiving their followers! I just pity the gullible members who still listen to them!\"\n\n\n\nAnother user, @omimi110 tweeted, \u201cThe narrative here is to sell Yahaya Bello into the consciousness of the people so the North can make him president with the guise that the presidency has come to the South again but Yeye Bello is worse than Buhari.\"\n\n@A3Adewunmi wrote, \u201cSo, Pastor Adeboye can visit Yahaya Bello (not Yahaya Bello visiting Adeboye). Will the pastor say he doesn't know what is happening in Kogi State & (who) our tyrannical Bello is?

          "text": "Two weeks after the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) said it had issued 54 million people their national identity numbers, it is in the process of deploying a Device Management System (DMS).\n\nThe NCC said in a statement, \u201cTo curtail the counterfeit mobile phone market, discourage mobile phone theft, enhance national security, protect consumer interest, increase revenue generation for the government, reduce the rate of kidnapping, mitigate the use of stolen phones for crime, and facilitate blocking or tracing of stolen mobile phones and other smart devices, one of the means to achieve this is through the deployment of Device Management System.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe implementation of a Centralised Equipment Identity Register otherwise known as Device Management System will serve as a repository for keeping records of all registered mobile phones\u2019 International Mobile Equipment Identity and owners of such devices.\u201d\n\nDespite the government hinging the policy on fighting insecurity, there are privacy concerns that the government can easily abuse access to such data.\n\nDoes this new requirement infringe on privacy?\n\nAs of March 2020, Nigeria was one of eleven countries with mandatory biometric SIM registration laws. One of the arguments against compulsory registration is that it allows the government to track SIM card owners and makes it easier to track calls and messages.\n\nA Device Management System will take this step even further, allowing the government even more access to what should be private information. While the argument from the government is that it improves security, there\u2019s the risk that the government can spy on its citizens.\n\nGeneralized surveillance in countries like Nigeria with weak security agencies controlled by the executive can become police states where opposition leaders can be tracked and arrested. But with the rise in crime in Nigeria in the past year, it is easy to understand the government\u2019s argument.\n\nDoes the government\u2019s argument make sense?\n\nIn a 2016 paper, \u201ccomplete mobile phone registration has many generalised benefits to the society especially in combating crime.\u201d\n\nWith increasing reports of kidnappings taking place around the country, a centralised registry may help to find bad actors even quicker, and it could help combat the sale of stolen phones.

          "text": "Exceptional results require a high-performance team but how do you build one?\n\nIn what can be termed a mini-MBA session, Seni Sulyman and Chichi Offodile in an edition of TechCabal Live shared expert advice on how to build high-performance teams.\n\nSeni Sulyman is the founder and community manager of Black Ops, a network of top African operators building great companies and cultures across the world. Before starting Black Ops, Seni helped scale Andela\u2019s operations from series B to series D with over 1,000 team members across US and Africa offices.\n\nChichi Offodile is the COO of Helium Health. She has over 15 years of experience working at EMC/Dell and Deloitte.\n\nTheir Journey at Helium Health and Andela\n\nThe conversation begins with Chichi and Seni talking about their journeys at Helium Health and Andela respectively. They both stepped in when each company had a viable product/service, some traction, and funding.\n\nFor Chichi, she was brought in when Helium Health had figured out what it was doing but was uncertain about how to move forward. Her strength lies in figuring out how to build a sustainable company and that\u2019s what she set out to do via a transformation plan.\n\nSeni joined Andela in 2016 when the company was in only two markets \u2013 Nigeria and Kenya. At that time there had been a few leadership exits and the general employee morale was low. His mandate was to stabilize the ship. Which he did before focusing on operational expansion.\n\nHow do you begin the transformation process?\n\nFor Seni, he believes the transformation process should start with the why\u2014 otherwise known as communicating a vision that galvanises everything. At Andela, he had to create a modified version of the vision that was more compelling to the team.\n\nAfter clearly articulating the vision, decide on the steps to take to achieve the vision. This involves setting performance indicators and reviews, so it\u2019s clear what the goals are and whether people are hitting them.\n\nHow does a high achiever culture permeate a company?\n\nBoth Seni and Chichi believe that it starts with hiring people with the potential to be high achievers and then setting a good example as a leader.\n\nGiving people room to execute the tasks they\u2019ve set out to do is also an important factor.\n\n\u201cI make sure that leadership allows people to be creative. Allow people to execute. If you don\u2019t give people the opportunity to succeed, you\u2019ll be stifling them. I motivate people by allowing them to set their goals and fix a timeline to achieve it,\u201d Chichi said.\n\nBuilding cohesiveness within the team\n\nGreat things are rarely ever done by one person. How do we ensure that the team sticks together?\n\nSeni believes the people have to align on the why. This alignment has to start from the top, there has to be a unified strategy at the top level.\n\n\u201cStrategy is a lot more of what you\u2019re saying No to than what you\u2019re saying Yes to,\u201d he said.\n\nCiting an example of when he had to build cohesiveness within a team, he said that during his time at Bristow he noticed that two senior executives weren\u2019t aligned on the company\u2019s direction. One person wanted a high-end airline, while the other person wanted a low-cost airline.\n\nTo resolve this issue, he had to call both of them together to iron out their differences before the company could move forward.\n\nHow do you get teams to keep going without burning out\n\nA common challenge high-performance teams face is that they experience burnout due to the intense and fast-paced nature of work.\n\nSeni responded to this question by stating that he thinks that the issue with the pandemic and people experiencing burnout is that a lot of people were thrown into remote work without warning.\n\nThe solution to this is to encourage people to take time off work since the line between work and rest can be blurry. As a leader, you have to practice what you preach.\n\nIn order to encourage people to take some time off work, he often schedules his emails sent in the middle of the night to go out by the next morning to avoid creating unnecessary work or a sense of urgency.\n\nAnother activity that helps is social gatherings, it\u2019s important for companies to have occasional fun hours. One-on-one sessions are also helpful. These are open-ended meetings with employees, where the manager finds out how they\u2019re doing as human beings and what\u2019s going on in their lives.\n\nHe ends with a caveat \u2013 it\u2019s a little difficult to build a high-performing team without working really hard.\n\n\u201cYou cannot work 80 hours a week every week, you\u2019ll burn. You also can\u2019t work 40 hours every week and materially change the world.\u201d\n\nYou have to be thoughtful and deliberate in getting work done.\n\nChichi adds that she believes companies also need to do two things.\n\nThey have to be deliberate with capacity planning. If you\u2019re growing as a company, you can\u2019t expect to have the same set of people working at the same level while the company is expanding. You need to hire more people or adjust people\u2019s roles.\n\nBe open about flex working. The output is the most important thing, let people work in ways that work for them.\n\nAt what point should a company hire an operations lead?\n\nChichi\u2019s response to this question is that the first thing to do is to have a thought process to manage operations but as soon as you have funds for it, please hire.\n\nWatch the full conversation here",

          "title": "Stax wants you to enjoy USSD with better design, without ever dialling codes again",
          "text": "The BackEnd explores how tech products are built in Africa, highlighting uniqueness, user behaviour assumptions, pilots, pivots and challenges during the product cycle. A new edition every other Thursday.\n\n\u2014\n\nMost people who started using mobile phones in the 2000s became familiar with USSD through loading and checking airtime balance. With time, mobile banking became a major use case; again for airtime transactions, but also for buying internet data, sending money and paying bills.\n\nUnlike mobile apps that need to be downloaded and installed, USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data, if you insist) is lightweight and straightforward to use.\n\nDial the code for the desired service, follow the instructions e.g. \u201cpress 1 to Check Balance\u201d on each page and, provided there isn\u2019t some \u201cconnection failure\u201d or \u201centry error\u201d, your wishes will come true.\n\nA misconception is that USSD is for people who use basic phones but the feature has become mainstream even among smartphone users in Africa. A study of smartphone users in Bangladesh, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa showed that 87% of all financial-related transactions were conducted via USSD, with only 13% via mobile app.\n\nSo, USSD works well. But it still has its fair share of frustrating glitches that you normally wouldn\u2019t encounter on an app. For one, you need to memorise the code for each service you want to access. You could minimise an app to get information from, say, your notes app. But you mostly can\u2019t minimise a USSD session once it\u2019s started.\n\nUSSD\u2019s original design did not foresee \u201chow the introduction of smartphones would bridge the worlds of computing and telecommunications to form an entirely new industry,\u201d Wiza Jalakasi explains.\n\nBut that\u2019s not to say we should throw it away. On the contrary, some companies recognise that USSD is here to stay in Africa. As such, they are merging the best of both worlds: stacking the visual appeal and interactivity of smartphones on top of USSD\u2019s simple and efficient backend.\n\nOne such company is Hover, a US-based company, and their solution is called Stax.\n\nMaking USSD smart\n\nStax is a mobile app currently available only to Android users in 10 countries, including Nigeria, Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. It has three use cases: buy airtime, send money, and request money. All without ever dialling any USSD code.\n\nStax\u2019s main promise is that users never have to dial a code again\u2026 while enjoying USSD.\n\nIt\u2019s not a digital wallet or account, so it doesn\u2019t ask for an email address or phone number. But \u2013 and this is an important but \u2013 Stax needs certain phone permissions.\n\nWhat permissions? Three precisely: to make and manage phone calls; send and view messages; and access your contacts.\n\nWith those enabled, you can input how much airtime you want to buy, choose the bank or fintech-powered account you want to debit and input the phone number to credit or select from your phonebook.\n\nIt would be great if this is where it ends but \u2013 somewhat unfortunately \u2013 Stax asks for two other permissions to complete this task of buying airtime. Permission to display on top of other apps on your phone and another to connect with mobile money and telecom services on your behalf.\n\nThis gave me pause and maybe it is because of the copy: \u201cAllow Stax to have full control of your device?\u201d\n\nThree paragraphs beneath that question describe why the permission is needed. But all the bad news I have absorbed about privacy risks over the past four years flashed before my eyes, discouraging me from clicking \u201cAllow.\u201d\n\nJess Shorland, co-founder of Hover, agrees that some work needs to be done to make users more comfortable with the permissions. But she has an explanation for why they are necessary:\n\n\u201cIt allows us to automate the USSD session on behalf of the user. We\u2019ve basically built a different interface for USSD. The user interacts with that interface in a way that is a lot more screen-reader friendly.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s one big permission request\n\nIn other words, the accessibility permission is what enables Stax to do these things on the user\u2019s behalf.\n\nWhen a user gives Stax access, the app activates a screen reading functionality and acts as a web browser. USSD is still happening in the background but instead of presenting those USSD screens, Stax\u2019s SDK reads the USSD dialog, runs the functions and shows the user a familiar app interface.\n\nBut what are the risks? Because there is no way to convince a user that giving up control doesn\u2019t somehow make them a little vulnerable. Shorland says Stax only takes the information needed to enable the user complete their transaction.\n\n\u201cEverything happens client side, not on our servers. It\u2019s also what enables us to be offline,\u201d she says, emphasizing that the app is open-source as a sign of transparency.\n\nWho in Africa needs Stax?\n\nI guess it\u2019s kind of cool that Stax, a fintech app, works offline like regular USSD. But with the internet being more central to the digital and financial services space today, why should we cheer for Stax?\n\nHover CEO and co-founder Ben Lyon says they are \u201cbuilding for the world as it is today so that we can bridge it to where it ought to go.\u201d\n\nIn 2020, there were 159 million monthly active mobile money accounts in Africa, according to the GSM Association. Africa represents more than half of the global mobile money usage.\n\nLyon thinks such numbers and smartphone usage \u2013 expected to double to 678 million by the end of 2025 \u2013 will make USSD even more mainstream. \u201cIt is a standard view of the tech industry that USSD is a bygone thing. It is actually just categorically wrong.\u201d\n\nIf that view is wrong as he insists and if USSD\u2019s user experience needs to be modernised for the smartphone age, then solutions like Stax would seem right on time.\n\nStax wants the app to be under 10MB so that it will work easily on every (Android) phone. Average transaction time is supposed to be 12 seconds.\n\nMy airtime purchase this morning took a bit longer. It showed a transaction failure message at the end and my bank debited me two seconds later. But I got the airtime.\n\nStax is\u2026 a work in progress\n\nAs of today, Stax currently supports transactions for eight banks (Access, First, Guaranty, Keystone, Sterling, UBA, Wema, Zenith), OPay and Paga.\n\nBeing in the USSD business in Nigeria means getting into the CBN (banks) vs NCC (telcos) scuffle around who pays for USSD services. What does Hover think about this debate?\n\n\u201cBecause we believe that USSD is about accessibility and inclusion, I believe strongly that consumers should not pay to access the channel,\u201d Lyon says.\n\n\u201cI hope NCC and other players come around to this view that consumers should not pay.\u201d\n\nOutside of that and other potential headaches, Stax\u2019s focus will be on convincing individuals and businesses that the app is reliable for all seasons and geographies, regardless of internet connection, says Peace Itimi, who leads growth for the product.\n\n\u201cWe are not monetizing Stax yet and it\u2019s not on the near term roadmap to monetize it,\u201d Lyon says. \u201cThere is a WhatsApp sized opportunity here and our first priority is to make sure we can seize the opportunity at the appropriate time.\u201d\n\nBen also name-drops WeChat as a possible inspiration for monetization. With a large user base, Stax could begin enabling discovery and access to third party services, in what could make Stax a super app of sorts.\n\n\u201cWhen people understand what the product can do, they will fall in love with it,\u201d Itimi says.\n\nThat depends: on how they fix those curious accessibility permissions, and if people really feel the need to switch from basic USSD \u2013 which works okay \u2013 to a shinier, app-enabled life.",

          "text": "This might be it!\n\nFinally, a financial app that considers the lifestyle of regular people, the harsh economic situation in the country, and everyday financial challenges that influence how people borrow, save or invest.\n\nCan we pique your interest?\n\nLet\u2019s start with savings. Some of us have been saving from when we were kids and it was cool to have a piggybank. Beyond piggybanks and other traditional ways of saving like Esusu, it has become common to save with banks and almost everyone has a savings account. Some even have up to three. But what value do you get from those savings accounts or the Esusu contribution? How much interest do you earn from them in a month?. Probably nothing. In most cases, you even pay more on annoying charges. The good news is that savings has evolved. It\u2019s no longer enough to just keep money anywhere and call it savings. Financial apps like Branch, PiggyVest and Kuda have shown that your savings can be an investment which allows you to earn actual interest, no matter how small. People hardly have enough to money to meet their financial needs and this clearly influences the service features on majority of these financial apps.\n\nHowever, they all differ in the interest they offer on their platforms. If you\u2019re familiar with all the top ones, a quick research will show you that while several savings and investment apps offer sumptuous interest rates with up to 15% per annum being the highest, Branch sets the pace with 20% interest rate per annum. Branch is also the only financial app so far that offers flexible withdrawals, which means your money doesn\u2019t have to be locked for any minimum duration. Afterall, we save for rainy days, don\u2019t we? So if the rainy day comes you should have access to your money.\n\nAll the things your bank won\u2019t do.\n\nHere are a few more things that sets Branch apart from both your regular banking and other financial apps.\n\nAt your beck and call, for a cost: Trust your bank to be on top of their game when they send you notifications but obviously at a cost. Branch has no such thing as SMS alert fees.\n\nPay, to pay bills: Every month, you pay all sorts of bills like DSTV and PHCN on your regular financial apps and banking apps. But of course, it always comes at a cost \u2013 N100 here, N50 there. Some banks even say this cost is negligible, but everyone knows if you stack up enough N100 notes, you\u2019ll eventually have enough to do something that is not negligible. Again, with Branch, this service is free!\n\nTransfer fees: How many transfers have you made in the last month alone? How many did you make last year? If you add up all the charges you pay for making transfers in a month, you can at least buy airtime or data with it. If you add up all the cost for a year, who knows what you can buy with it. The point is, in the end, all these costs and charges add up to something. So if you can make unlimited transfers for free, why would you rather pay for it? Branch doesn\u2019t think you should pay for it though.\n\nAnybody home? \u2013 Customer service with most banks would leave a sour taste in your mouth. They will put you hold. They will tell you the problem can\u2019t be solved remotely and you should go to a branch near you. When you get to the bank branch, you\u2019ll be in a queue, then you\u2019ll fill forms. Finally, they\u2019ll tell you to go wait at home that it will be done in a few days. That doesn\u2019t happen with Branch. Branch customer service team is available 24/7 and all problems are resolved in-app.\n\nBonus programs: Most financial apps have some form of bonus program but none of them is like Branch. Branch has a second-generation referral system that makes referrals a win-win for all parties. Whereas other financial apps pay one-time bonuses for referrals, Branch pays you N500 when friends you refer pay up their first loan. The friends you invited also earn N500. In addition, you earn N50 for every deposit of N300 and above. How cool is that?\n\nThe money part: Branch gives you up to N500,000 in loans within seconds of applying on the app. No collateral or paperwork required. Start with small loan amounts and get higher amounts the more you repay.\n\nClearly, Branch offers you more flexibility and a lot more profit than other financial apps. So if you\u2019ve been suffering from poor financial services, it\u2019s time to make a switch. Branch can be downloaded on the Google Play Store",

TradeDepot\u2019s mission is to consolidate this fragmented informal\n\nretail supply chain, connect the world\u2019s top consumer goods manufacturers to micro retailers on the streets of Africa\u2019s cities and support the informal retail sector with inventory financing to scale and grow.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nGhanaians to re-register SIMs | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "text": "This article is a Brand Press post. Brand Press is a paid service for brands that want to reach Techpoint Africa's audience directly. Techpoint Africa's editorial team doesn't write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email [email protected]\n\nBitnob is a Nigerian startup that lets users buy, save and invest in bitcoin. Users can access these features and much more through the mobile app that\u2019s available for Android iOS.\n\nBitnob offers a ton of other options, like loans, Dollar-Cost-Averaging plans, and many much more. At first glance, the Bitnob app feels fantastic, with a simple UI and easy-to-find functions. But how does it handle the functions that truly matter, like buying BTC and saving?\n\nWe\u2019re about to find out.\n\nGetting started with Bitnob\n\nLet\u2019s begin with the onboarding process\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCreating a new account on Bitnob\n\nSetting up your Bitnob app begins with installing it from your app store. When you open it for the first time, you\u2019ll need to create an account. Unlike many other apps, Bitnob doesn\u2019t let you just sign up with an email and get on with it.\n\nInstead, you\u2019ll need to supply your first name and last name. Your first name will be used to create a username that\u2019s unique to you (more on the username later.)\n\nYou\u2019ll also provide your phone number and receive an OTP for verification. Once that\u2019s clear, you can create a secure password and five-number transaction pin.\n\nI love this part because the app makes you choose something secure and up to 8 characters. Once you have all this dialed-in, you can get to the fun part.\n\nDepositing money on Bitnob\n\nAs an app for savings and investment, I expected Bitnob\u2019s deposit system to be as simple as inputting debit card information. Unfortunately, I was wrong.\n\nIf you remember, the topic has been complicated in Nigeria since the CBN has ordered banks to close accounts of crypto traders back in February. To protect its users, Bitnob doesn\u2019t let you buy BTC straight from your bank account.\n\nInstead, you\u2019ll first buy a recharge voucher from Ovarr. One thing I love is that the cards are sold in bundles ranging from $10 to $500. This way, users can buy within their financial limits.\n\nTo buy the voucher, you have to fill in your user information and then pay using a debit card.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter buying the voucher, you\u2019ll get a pin that you can paste into Bitnob to activate your purchase.\n\nSo while the process is slightly longer than I expected, it works all the same.\n\nWithdrawals on Bitnob\n\nWithdrawals aren\u2019t quite as tedious, and you can complete them in a few short steps.\n\nTo get started, you\u2019ll need to select \u2018withdraw\u2019 in the plan of your choice. You can withdraw to a BTC wallet or a USD wallet. To get cash in my local bank account, I had to first select a USD wallet and then send the cash to my local account.\n\nYou can send BTC to your blockchain wallet by selecting \u2018send\u2019 and pasting the BTC address in the provided field. You can also use the QR code scanner instead of pasting the BTC address.\n\nSending BTC to another user follows this same procedure. You simply paste their address or scan their Bitnob BTC wallet address.\n\nCustomization options\n\nYou can make changes to your Bitnob account through the \u2018account\u2019 icon. From here, you can change your name and user name, and fill in next of kin details,\n\nYou can also add your bank accounts and mobile money accounts here. I love that you get to choose between the two options.\n\nBitnob Features\n\nNow we get into the staple features of Bitnob\n\nAccessing loans\n\nBitnob offers Nobcredit, which is an awesome way for users to get quick cash while still HODLing their BTC. You can access Nobcredit from the app\u2019s home page, and the process is quite quick.\n\nThe loan amount you get depends on how much BTC you have as collateral. You can then pay back before the tenure expires to reclaim your BTC.\n\nYour interest rate is calculated based on your loan-to-value ratio, or the amount of collateral you have. Average rates are between 16 and 17.2%, and loan tenures range between 3 and 12 months.\n\nI love that you can check your interest rate and collateral volume using the in-app loan calculator. This makes sure that you have all the information you need before moving forward.\n\nPlans\n\nOne of Bitnob\u2019s main features is that you can create a savings plan for your BTC. You can name the plan, choose the amount you want to save in USD, and pick the frequency of savings. The available options are daily, weekly, and monthly.\n\nYou can also select a maximum duration for the lock. WIthdrawing before the maturity date will earn you a 3% penalty. The penalty is one more reason to keep saving.\n\nThe plans work based on the concept of Dollar-Cost-Averaging, which simply allows you to invest large sums over a period. The longer your investment tenure and the more often you make deposits, the bigger your overall portfolio.\n\nUnfortunately, you can only fund your plan with money from your USD wallet, which means you\u2019ll have to buy vouchers that cover your savings amount.\n\nUsers can create as many plans as they need, and adjust the deposit amount, frequency, and maturity date for a bigger payout.\n\nReferrals\n\nBitnob allows you to earn up to $1,000 via referrals alone. And it\u2019s quite easy to get started because you get a referral code immediately when you sign up. You can copy the code right from the home screen.\n\nWhen a new user signs up with your referral code, you get a small USD reward based on how much your referral deposits. I love the referral system because it\u2019s as easy as sending your code to whoever you invite.\n\nSecurity and Support\n\nHow does Bitnob handle security and customer care?\n\nReaching customer care\n\nHave you ever tried to reach customer care only to be kept on hold for an unreasonable amount of time? I loved that Bitnob went a different route by allowing you to live chat with customer care right in the app.\n\nI got a response within 2 minutes (I actually checked) of sending the message which was quite impressive. You can also access the FAQs section from within the app.\n\nSecurity features\n\nIf you have trouble remembering your passwords don\u2019t worry. Bitnob automatically activates fingerprint login for every user with a biometric-enabled device. If you\u2019d rather log in old school, you can turn this feature off in the accounts tab.\n\nOne cool but annoying security feature is that the app logs you out every time your screen goes to sleep. I found this quite irritating because I use the app a lot and I have to log in every few seconds.\n\nBut I also can\u2019t stay mad because it protects my BTC even more. Once my screen turns off, no one can access or even see my funds, which makes me feel good.\n\nOther standard security features also apply. For example, you can\u2019t change passwords unless you provide the old password.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nOverall, the Bitnob app delivers an impressive performance. My only reservation is the convoluted process associated with depositing. However, it\u2019s completely understandable given the current financial laws.\n\nBefore you go, I wanted to tell you one quirky thing I found about the app. It displays these short but interesting messages on the login page and your dashboard, and they really add character to the app. Two of my favourite are \u2018we care about you,\u2019 and \u2018my favorite human, cheer up.\u2019 Be sure to look out for these when you download the app.\n\nGhanaians to re-register SIMs | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

You can access Nobcredit from the app\u2019s home page, and the process is quite quick.\n\nThe loan amount you get depends on how much BTC you have as collateral. You can then pay back before the tenure expires to reclaim your BTC.\n\nYour interest rate is calculated based on your loan-to-value ratio, or the amount of collateral you have. Average rates are between 16 and 17.2%, and loan tenures range between 3 and 12 months.\n\nI love that you can check your interest rate and collateral volume using the in-app loan calculator. This makes sure that you have all the information you need before moving forward.\n\nPlans\n\nOne of Bitnob\u2019s main features is that you can create a savings plan for your BTC. You can name the plan, choose the amount you want to save in USD, and pick the frequency of savings. The available options are daily, weekly, and monthly.\n\nYou can also select a maximum duration for the lock. WIthdrawing before the maturity date will earn you a 3% penalty. The penalty is one more reason to keep saving.\n\nThe plans work based on the concept of Dollar-Cost-Averaging, which simply allows you to invest large sums over a period. The longer your investment tenure and the more often you make deposits, the bigger your overall portfolio.\n\nUnfortunately, you can only fund your plan with money from your USD wallet, which means you\u2019ll have to buy vouchers that cover your savings amount.\n\nUsers can create as many plans as they need, and adjust the deposit amount, frequency, and maturity date for a bigger payout.\n\nReferrals\n\nBitnob allows you to earn up to $1,000 via referrals alone. And it\u2019s quite easy to get started because you get a referral code immediately when you sign up. You can copy the code right from the home screen.\n\nWhen a new user signs up with your referral code, you get a small USD reward based on how much your referral deposits. I love the referral system because it\u2019s as easy as sending your code to whoever you invite.\n\nSecurity and Support\n\nHow does Bitnob handle security and customer care?\n\nReaching customer care\n\nHave you ever tried to reach customer care only to be kept on hold for an unreasonable amount of time? I loved that Bitnob went a different route by allowing you to live chat with customer care right in the app.\n\nI got a response within 2 minutes (I actually checked) of sending the message which was quite impressive. You can also access the FAQs section from within the app.\n\nSecurity features\n\nIf you have trouble remembering your passwords don\u2019t worry. Bitnob automatically activates fingerprint login for every user with a biometric-enabled device. If you\u2019d rather log in old school, you can turn this feature off in the accounts tab.\n\nOne cool but annoying security feature is that the app logs you out every time your screen goes to sleep. I found this quite irritating because I use the app a lot and I have to log in every few seconds.\n\nBut I also can\u2019t stay mad because it protects my BTC even more. Once my screen turns off, no one can access or even see my funds, which makes me feel good.\n\nOther standard security features also apply. For example, you can\u2019t change passwords unless you provide the old password.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nOverall, the Bitnob app delivers an impressive performance. My only reservation is the convoluted process associated with depositing. However, it\u2019s completely understandable given the current financial laws.\n\nBefore you go, I wanted to tell you one quirky thing I found about the app. It displays these short but interesting messages on the login page and your dashboard, and they really add character to the app. Two of my favourite are \u2018we care about you,\u2019 and \u2018my favorite human, cheer up.\u2019 Be sure to look out for these when you download the app.\n\nGhanaians to re-register SIMs | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "title": "Does the Nigerian government want safety or surveillance with its new IMEI policy?",
          "text": "From July 2021, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) will require Nigerians to submit their IMEI numbers to a Centralised Equipment Identity Register.\n\nIn May 2021, the Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy released a Revised National Identity Policy for SIM Registration (PDF) that requires Nigerians to submit their IMEI numbers to a Centralized Equipment Identity Register (CEIR), otherwise known as Device Management System (DMS), which the NCC would manage.\n\nSome of the reasons given for the Ministry\u2019s action include curtailing the counterfeit mobile phone market, discouraging mobile phone theft, enhancing national security, protecting consumer interest, increasing revenue generation for the government, reducing the rate of kidnapping, mitigating the use of stolen phones for crime, and facilitating the blocking or tracing of stolen mobile phones and other smart devices.\n\nThis move follows the Nigerian government\u2019s previous initiatives for digital identities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecall that in December 2020, the Nigerian government released a statement mandating all Nigerians to obtain their National Identification Number (NIN). Predictably, there was a rush as Nigerians all over the country attempted to get their NIN before the deadline at the end of 2020.\n\nThe directive caused a massive uproar among Nigerians because it was given in the heat of the COVID-19 pandemic. Perhaps as a result of that, the deadline was moved to February 2021. Since then, it has been moved thrice, with the new deadline now June 30, 2021.\n\nThe NCC\u2019s IMEI policy will definitely have major implications for the entire nation if implemented.\n\nWhat does this mean for you?\n\nThe International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) is a unique number used to identify a mobile phone. It is usually found inside the battery compartment of most phones but can also be gotten by dialling *#06#. With an IMEI number, a phone can be tracked, but more than that, it can also be used for identity theft and even cloning a phone.\n\nEver since the news broke, there has been an understandable outcry, with IMEI and Isa Pantami trending on Twitter.\n\nHowever, while the government requires Nigerians to share this data, they do not have to, as your IMEI is part of the data transmitted to your network operator as soon as you make a call, use data, or send a text.\n\nThis information is rarely ever used beyond providing the details that your phone needs to work. However, security operatives can use it in the case of theft or while tracking terrorist activity.\n\nA few countries, including Azerbaijan, India, Cambodia, Chile, Columbia, Ecuador, Indonesia, Iran, Pakistan, Thailand, Turkey, and Lebanon, already have some form of this database.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf a phone owner possesses their IMEI number, they could provide law enforcement agencies with this information to track these phones if they are stolen.\n\nWhile the reasons given by the government for this new policy appear genuine at first glance, Nigerians are bothered about the possible ways the government can exploit this data.\n\nAn article on The Insider details how the Saudi government uses IMEI numbers to track the location of women who have run away from abusive partners. Most of the doubts expressed regarding the use of this information for surveillance.\n\nIt has not always been used negatively. The ITU reports that implementing this in Great Britain and Turkey resulted in a reduction in mobile phone theft while it increased the number of legally imported mobile devices in Ukraine by 95%, as well as increasing revenues from the import of mobile devices\n\nAccording to a data privacy expert, some of the questions that should be asked include whether there are sufficient safeguards in the absence of a comprehensive data protection law. Also, is the government going to be transparent about its use of this data and what happens in the case of a violation?\n\nOne must remember that with the government mandating Nigerians to link their SIM cards to the NIN, the government already has rich insights into the activities of its citizens. Adding IMEI data to this would mean that they can also get real-time location data on anyone.\n\nWith Nigeria\u2019s poor human rights history, Nigerians may be right to be suspicious about the motives behind this policy.\n\nGhanaians to re-register SIMs | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "title": "The Week Ahead",
          "text": "MPC Meeting Set to Kick-Off On Monday \u2013 Q1\u201921 GDP Numbers Expected\n\nIn the coming week, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will hold its third set of meetings for the year on Monday and Tuesday (24th and 25th of May, 2021).\n\nThe Committee is expected to review the domestic and external macroeconomic conditions and financial markets developments since its last meeting in March and provide forward guidance on how it intends to balance the competing goals of price and exchange rate stability.\n\nRead Also: FX, inflation possible consideration for a \u2018hold\u2019 as MPC meets Monday\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the committee is expected to keep the monetary policy parameters unchanged and affirm the continued adoption of its secondary \u201ctoolbox\u201d in addressing the imbalance in the external account and restoring macroeconomic stability.\n\nAlso, GDP figures for Q1 \u201921 are expected to be released by the NBS on Monday alongside other release dates indicated on the NBS release calendar as follows:\n\n\u00b7 Monday 24th May, 2021: Nigerian Gross Domestic Product by Output report (Q1 2021) & Road Transport Data (Q1 2021)\n\n\u00b7 Tuesday 25th May, 2021: Company Income Tax (Q1 2021)\n\n\u00b7 Thursday 27th May, 2021: Pension Asset and Membership Data (Q1 2021)\n\n\u00b7 Friday 28th May, 2021: Telecoms Data: Voice and Internet per State, Porting and Tariff Information (Q1 2021).\n\nOIL PRICES UNAFFECTED DESPITE 3-DAY PLUNGE\n\nOil prices nudged up on Friday, recovering from three days of losses as investors braced for the return of Iranian crude supplies after officials said Iran and world powers made progress on talks to revive a 2015 nuclear deal. Brent had a weekly decline of -2.76%. However, Brent crude oil futures are currently up 1.86%, trading at $66.32 while U.S. West Texas Intermediate is currently up 2.20% trading at $63.30.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Minister of State for Petroleum, Timipre Sylva said subsidy on petrol will soon be withdrawn and the passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill will not go beyond June.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Nigeria Governors Forum okay full deregulation of petrol (with the fuel selling between N380 and N408.5 per litre), wants the three refineries privatised after rehabilitation, and recommended the purchase of 113 buses to cushion the likely effects of the price increase.\n\nData from the Nigerian Oil Spill Monitor and Response Agency (NOSDRA) using a satellite-powered tracker showed that out of the 3363.03 barrels of oil spilled recorded from December 2020 through April 2021, 3140.10 barrels, representing a staggering 93.4 per cent, were from oil theft.\n\nOutlook\n\nIn the coming week, oil prices are expected to dip marginally as Iranian oil is set to flood the market as the country and world powers make progress in a nuclear deal.\n\nDATA FROM KEY INTERNATIONAL MARKETS ALTER GOLD PRICES\n\nGold prices are expected to be mixed in the coming week, pressured by the dollar and U.S. treasury yields.\n\nThe precious metal recorded significant losses at the last trading session of the week as an improvement in the global economic outlook strengthened investors\u2019 risk appetite.\n\nGold futures plunged by 0.38% to $1,874.75 an ounce. The weaker greenback that often moves inversely to gold, inched down today, thereby capping the precious metal\u2019s losses. Gold bugs seem to be taking a wait-and-see approach amid solid economic reports from key international markets that include the Eurozone, the United Kingdom, and the United States, as investors increased their buying pressures on riskier assets like global equities.\n\nRecent price action, however, suggests gold bugs are pretty much in play, with the bullion assets springing above $1,850 an ounce amid signs of inflationary pressures. Market experts envisage that a break above $1,900 an ounce is still in the works on the bias that the precious metal is supported by \u201cirrational\u201d behaviour in response to a COVID-19-stressed global economy that threatens the value of fiat currencies.\n\nIn addition, gold traders seem to keep some of their bullish bets amid the reality that postulates COVID-19 is still far from being under control, triggering a flocking back to the safe-haven asset, despite the significant progress that was made in the past few months, and several COVID-19 vaccines already in the market.\n\nAGRICULTURE\n\nCocoa prices are expected to decline in the coming week as a result of weak demand from Europe. Sugar prices on the other hand, are expected to rise next week due to the sugar supply shortage in Brazil. Corn prices are also expected to be bullish next week as a result of continued demand from China.\n\nIn the previous week, Cocoa prices and sugar prices dipped by -1.57% and -1.83% respectively. However, Corn prices climbed by 1.49% Week on Week (W-o-W).\n\nMORE OF THE SAME FOR THE NAIRA\n\nOverall, it was a bearish market for the Naira both at the official window and BDC window this week.\n\nOn a W-o-W basis, the Naira remained flat against the dollar and the Euro at the BDC window, however, against the Pound it was bearish. It depreciated against the British Pound by -0.44%, closing at \u00a31/N680 at the BDC window.\n\nAt the I & E FX window, the Naira was depreciated marginally by -0.08% at the end of the week. The Naira closed the week at $/N412.0 at the I&E FX window, at the NAFEX (spot market) it closed at $/N410.71.\n\nMore of the same is expected in the week ahead as the Naira is anticipated to continue to hover around N406/$1-N412/$1 threshold.\n\nMONEY MARKET OUTLOOK\n\nFunding rates are expected to trend in double digits in the coming week.\n\nFunding rates declined at the start of the previous week which was supported by system liquidity. Funding rates fell significantly at the close of the week. Open Buyback (OBB) closed at 16.50% while Overnight (O/N) rates closed at 17.0% indicating a Week-on-Week (W-o-W) decline of -38.62% for OBB and -41.14% for O/N rates.\n\nTREASURY BILLS MARKET OUTLOOK\n\nActivity in the treasury bills market is expected to remain subdued in the coming week as system liquidity remains relatively tight.\n\nThe Nigerian Treasury Bills market continued its bearish sentiment for most of the previous week, however, the sentiments improved slightly at the end of the week. At the close of the week, the average benchmark yield for T-bills rose by +13.68% to close at 5.76% while OMO bills rose by +7.10% W-o-W to close at 8.62%. Yield for Special bills rose significantly by +17.80% W-o-W to close at 8.87%.\n\nMORE OF THE SAME FOR THE FGN BOND AND EUROBOND MARKET\n\nMarket sentiment is expected to remain soft in the absence of any trigger in the week ahead.\n\nThe Bond market started the previous week on a relatively quiet note as attention was drawn to the Bond auction. At the close of the week, the market was bearish with selling interest seen majorly at the short end of the curve. The overall average benchmark yields closed at 9.52% for the week which increased W-o-W by +4.61%.\n\nThe Eurobond market traded on a relatively weak note last week with sell-off seen across all SSA papers following the rise in US treasury yields coupled with a decline in crude oil prices. The average benchmark yield closed at 6.17% at the end of the week increasing marginally W-o-W by +0.82%.\n\nNIGERIAN CAPITAL MARKET OUTLOOK\n\nIn the coming week, we expect a likelihood of undulating trading sessions during the week. Bargain hunting is also expected as the profit taking run would create attractive entry points. However, press releases from listed companies and macroeconomic developments are likely going to impact investors\u2019 decisions. In addition, market analysts expect investors to monitor the movement of yields in the fixed income market.\n\nNigeria\u2019s all share index fell further last week as investors sustained their profit taking on the exchange. The Nigerian bourse closed the week negative with a decline of -2.93%. The Nigerian Stock Exchange lost N603.48bn thus, year-to-date return deteriorated to -4.83%, while market capitalization settled at N19.98 trillion. The volume and value of stocks traded on the exchange last week declined by -20.61% and -33.09% respectively.\n\nPerformance across sectors tracked was broadly negative last week as the NSE Oil and Gas was the highest gainer for the week with +7.39% while NSE-IND recorded the highest decline with -3.34%. NSE Banking, NSE-30, NSE Insurance and NSE Consumer Goods closed the week negative with -1.53%, -1.48%, -0.74% and -0.03% respectively.\n\nTHE NIGERIAN ECONOMY IN RETROSPECT\n\nTo give an account of unremitted funds to the Consolidated Revenue Fund, the Senate Committee on Finance sent invites to over 60-government owned firms to start appearing before it. Prominent amongst the invited government-owned firms include the Central Bank of Nigeria, the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation, the Nigeria Customs Service, and the Nigerian Maritime and Safety Administration Agency. The Chairman of the Senate panel, Solomon Adeola, noted that it was important for the government to raise money to fund the budget. Furthermore, he emphasized that the full-scale investigation hearing would also enable the National Assembly to identify various leakages of government revenue that had been leading to a yearly budget deficit.\n\nIn addressing the failure of MDAs to remit proper funds to Consolidated Revenue Funds, the Fiscal Responsibility Commission reported that ministries, departments, and agencies of the Federal Government are withholding about N1.2trn. According to the Commission, about 32 listed MDAs are yet to present their audit reports to it since 2007 when it was established. Some of the affected MDAs include the Administrative Staff College of Nigeria, Bank of Agriculture, Bank of Industry, Cement Technology Institute of Nigeria, Centre for Black African Arts and Civilization, Chad Basin National Park, Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria, etc.\n\nNigeria\u2019s inflation declined to 18.12% in April 2021 from 18.17% in March 2021. Also, food inflation declined from 22.95% in April 2021 to 22.72% in March 2021. The rise in the food index was attributed to the increases in prices of coffee, tea and cocoa, bread and cereals, soft drinks, milk, cheese and egg, vegetable, meat, oil and fats, fish and potatoes, yam, and other tubers. Furthermore, core inflation which excludes the prices of volatile agricultural produce stood at 12.74% in April 021 from 12.67% recorded in March 2021. The highest increases were recorded in prices of pharmaceutical products, vehicle spare parts, hairdressing salons, and personal grooming establishments, garments, furniture and furnishing, medical services, shoes, and other wears, motor cars, major household goods, and fuel and lubricants for personal transport equipment.\n\nThe House of Representatives at the plenary on Wednesday resolved to investigate the alleged abandonment of the Eastern Rail Line, the Port Harcourt-Maiduguri section after the Federal Government awarded the reconstruction contract for N72.34bn. It was noted that the panel would also confirm the status of the entire contracts awarded for the 1443km Eastern Railway Line for approximately N72.34bn to Messrs Esser Contracting and Industry Company (Turkey), CGGC Global Projects Nigeria Limited, and Lingo Nigeria Limited (in association with Strasky Husty and Partners Ltd of Czech Republic).",

          "title": "How National Assembly\u2019s blind loyalty to presidency destroys separation of powers",
          "text": "The sing song in Nigeria nowadays is the call for implementation of separation of powers as enshrined in the Nigerian Constitution.\n\nMany observers say that it appears that the Executive arm has swallowed up the judiciary and legislative arms, a sad development which has continued to frustrate governance.\n\nPerhaps, at no other time since the return of the country to civil rule in 1999 has Nigerians experienced a total absence of the legislature in governance than now.\n\nThe bicameral National Assembly, made up of 109 Senate members and 360 members of the House of Representatives, has sold itself to the Executive under the control of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nAt best, it can be said that the federal legislature is non-existent in Nigeria as the 9th Assembly has proven to be a rubber stamp of the Executive.\n\nThe legislative house is now ruled by primordial sentiment. Religion, ethnicity, and party affiliation have ruined the chambers.\n\nIn the United States of America, where Nigeria copied its version of presidential system, the Senate president and Speaker of the House of Representatives work independent of the executive arm. None is subservient to the other. They all work in harmony for the good of the country.\n\nIf it were not for strong institutions in place, the general election in the US last year would have flopped. But National Assembly played their role; the electoral body played its role appropriately and the country was saved from going into crisis.\n\nIn Nigeria\u2019s case, the nation\u2019s Judiciary and National Assembly are extension of the Executive. They are tied to the apron string of the Executive. They have no mind of their own.\n\nWhen the Senate President or Speaker goes to see the President and they kneel down to greet the President, almost fidgeting, it means they do not know their job and their powers. There is nothing like father-son relationship when it comes to separation of powers. They are supposed to be a check on the Executive.\n\nOn a number of occasions, the National Assembly had discussed the seriousness of the insecurity situation in the country. Suggestions had also been made to summon the President, but that has not happened, because a greater number of the legislature, because they are of the same party, religion or ethnic leaning with the President, they shut down the plan.\n\nSome members of the National Assembly had also called for the impeachment of the president on the ground of incompetence, but that has also been shut down.\n\nRecently, Senator Smart Adeyemi (APC-Kogi) cried on the floor of the Senate while speaking on the worsening security situation in the country, and he urged his colleagues to take a drastic action by calling the President\u2019s attention to a menace that he noted was threatening the lives of every citizen. But he was not taken seriously by fellow party members.\n\nA National Assembly that worth its salt protects the interest of the masses by prevailing on the Executive to do what is right. But Nigeria\u2019s case is different as the federal legislators collude with the Executive to drive long nail into the head of citizens, as it were.\n\nThe National Assembly allows the Executive to run rough shod over the citizens. Incessant increase in pump price of fuel amid biting poverty in the land is part of government\u2019s insensitivity. Increasing electricity tariff without commensurate supply of power is insensitive. Many companies are not functioning optimally; the healthcare system has collapsed, unemployment rate has become scandalous, and government pays deaf ear to people\u2019s plight. In all of these, the federal legislators are not restraining the Executive even with the level of hardship in the country.\n\nThe Federal Government is not complete without the National Assembly. In other words, the executive, and the judicial arms, whose powers are vested by the Constitution of Nigeria in the National Assembly, cannot function well without the check and balances provided by the legislature. But this is missing, in the real sense of the word.\n\nA clear instance of primordial sentiment featured on the floor of the House of Representatives Thursday, when Idris Wase, deputy speaker of the House, who presided over the plenary, shut down a motion by Solomon Bob (PDP, Rivers) to call the Attorney-General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami to order over his comments on the ban on open grazing by Southern Governors.\n\nWase, who was intolerant of the motion, was said to have shouted down his colleague who was irked by Malami\u2019s comments and raised a point of order (Order 6 of House Rules Book) at the plenary, accusing the Attorney-General of the Federation of making inciting comments.\n\nWase reportedly shouted: \u201dThe order which you are bringing this matter is wrong. It\u2019s either you bring it as a full motion but coming under matters of privilege is wrong so take your seat.\u201d\n\nIt was the same Wase who resisted Mark Gbillah, a Tiv lawmaker from Benue State in March from raising a motion on behalf of Tiv indigenes in the diaspora, who were condemning the rate of killing in their state and displacement of their people from their ancestral land.\n\nWase vehemently resisted Gbillah and rejected their petition against the Federal Government of the alleged takeover of their ancestral lands.\n\nSuch actions by Wase do not convey that elected members have the right to air their views in the chambers, just because the principal officers are being sentimental or trying to please some individuals or groups.\n\nAdelaja Adeoye, a politician and political analyst, decried the rubber stamp status of the legislature in the country.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cFor Nigeria to effectively function as a country, there must be full separation of powers, amongst the Executive, Legislators and the Judiciary as demanded by the 1999 constitution, which is still subject to review and amendment.\n\n\u201cThe Executive arm both at the Federal and State has formed the habit of using the legislators as rubber stamp in carrying out their agenda, which in most cases do not reflect the wishes of their constituencies.\u201d\n\nA number of issues of national importance that affected the lives of Nigerians have been glossed over by the National Assembly.\n\nNigerians are expecting that there should be total independence of the National Assembly, but that is not the case as their refusal to play their oversight role on the Executive, has worsened the bad governance by the Buhari administration, leaving the nation\u2019s economy in tatters.\n\n\u201cNigerians have the right to think that there is a predetermined position on the proposed constitution amendment process for instance, because the federal legislators have not acted like they have the mind of their own since they came into power,\u201d Adeoye said.\n\n\u201cVery worrisome is the fact that, they tend to do esprit de corps as APC members than to show loyalty and concern for the Nigerian people.\n\n\u201cThis is where I will call on all opposition Senators and Reps members in the PDP and others to stand to be counted and not allow anything that will further polarise the country,\u201d he added.\n\nHe further urged Nigerian voters to work hard in 2023, to ensure that credible people and of robust knowledge are voted from all the constituencies across Nigeria to the National Assembly to avoid a situation where loyalty will be to the President rather than to the country.\n\nKunle Okunola, a political analyst, said it was quite unfortunate that the National Assembly that ought to seriously serve as a check on the President and the entire executive operates like a rubber stamp arm of the government.\n\n\u201cAlthough the NASS in a presidential system work in harmony with the Executive for the progress of the country, that should not be taken to a level that it becomes unhealthy for the development of the country. The separation of powers provision must be adhered to,\u201d Okunola said.\n\nHe further said that, \u201cBlind loyalty to the president is immoral, unconstitutional and illegitimate because their loyalty should be to the people who elected them to represent their interest.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly\u2019s excessive loyalty to the President is inimical to the development of the country and so, they need to work more for people\u2019s interest than the president\u2019s interest.\u201d\n\nBut Ahmed Lawan, Senate president, does not believe the 9th Assembly under his leadership has missed the mark.\n\nSpeaking at an event recently, Lawan said: \u201cThis relationship is misunderstood by many. Some, out of mischief, describe the National Assembly as a rubber stamp, some out of misunderstanding. For us, what is utmost in our minds in the ninth Assembly is: how do we work with the executive to make Nigeria better? If the price to pay is the names that we get, then let it be the price, because we believe that Nigerians deserve better service, better infrastructure development in the country and it is difficult if not impossible in this country or indeed in any democracy without understanding and harmony in the way and manner the two arms of government work.\u201d",
          "summary": "But National Assembly played their role; the electoral body played its role appropriately and the country was saved from going into crisis.\nIn Nigeria\u2019s case, the nation\u2019s Judiciary and National Assembly are extension of the Executive.\nOn a number of occasions, the National Assembly had discussed the seriousness of the insecurity situation in the country.\nA National Assembly that worth its salt protects the interest of the masses by prevailing on the Executive to do what is right.\nSome, out of mischief, describe the National Assembly as a rubber stamp, some out of misunderstanding.",

          "text": "That Nigeria\u2019s economy is in the doldrums is no longer news. The Federal Government has announced to the federating units that share revenues at the end of every month that it was finding things very difficult. The central government has also announced its plans to cut salaries of civil servants in its employ.\n\nThe states are not faring better, compelling many of them to be considering some options to live within their means.\n\nUnfortunately, many of the states have also refused to pay the mandatory N30,000 minimum wage.\n\nAs part of the measures, some states have elected to carry out retrenchment of some staff. This is the crux of the impasse between the Kaduna State government and the leadership of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC).\n\nIn recent times, there has been a seeming tug of war between Nasir El-Rufai, governor of Kaduna State and the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC).\n\nIn the last one week, Labour occupied the state, protesting the \u201cunlawful\u201d retrenchment of thousands of civil servants in the state by the governor.\n\nDespite NLC\u2019s threats and strike, the governor is insisting that there is no going back on the \u2018rightsizing,\u2019, while lamenting that over 90 percent of the state\u2019s federal allocation is currently being spent on civil servants; an issue many think relevant authorities should probe.\n\nWhile El-Rufai is taking retrenchment approach in tackling the dwindling revenue to the state, many of his colleagues prefer owing salaries, apart from Lagos, which depends less on the monthly federal allocation because of its ever-increasing internally generated revenue.\n\nFrom Abia, Imo, Ekiti, Jigawa, Niger to many others, the cry has been the same, while the implementation of the minimum wage is out of it.\n\nRecently, Nyesom Wike, governor of Rivers State, was under attack for promising N10 million each to Damini Ogulu (Burna Boy), Grammy award-winning artiste, and others who performed at a homecoming party for the music star, just a week after public school teachers protested over five years non-payment of salaries by the state government.\n\nConsidering the way the Kaduna State case is going, observers fear that if Governor El-Rufai succeeds in sacking the workers, other governors who are crying over lack of funds to pay salaries may follow Kaduna\u2019s bad example.\n\nMagnus Orjiako, a labour leader in FCT, Abuja, decried the El-Rufai example, saying it is inhuman, and should be challenged, as no government has sacked workers in such massive swoop before now and not to talk of thousands as done by El-Rufai.\n\n\u201cGovernment is blaming large scale unemployment in the country for the high rate insecurity and the same government wants to sack those engaged. If El-Rufai succeeds, his action will boost the number of unemployed out there and insecurity too. But the grave danger is that other state governors may copy the bad example,\u201d Orjiako said.\n\nInstead of sacking the workers, Inua Yakubu, a Minna, Niger State-based lawyer, advised that the governors and politicians should reduce the huge number of personal aides, unnecessary appointments and curb inflation of contract fees.\n\n\u201cGovernor El-Rufai is talking of rightsizing, but he has been sacking workers since assuming office. If he is serious about rightsizing, he should start by sacking all his aides and political appointees,\u201d Yakubu said.\n\nBut looking at the facts and data, Bode Anjorin, a Lagos-based economist and economic analyst, queried how state governors use the funds from the monthly federal allocation.\n\n\u201cIn April, the Federal Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC) said it has doled out in excess of N9.13 trillion to states in the past four years. So, where did all the trillions go if governors cannot pay simple salary?\u201d Anjorin asked.\n\nQuoting the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), Anjorin noted that the bureau disclosed that three South-South states \u2013 Delta, Akwa Ibom and Rivers- are the recipients of the larger portion of the federal allocations in the past four years, yet the three states also owe workers\u2019 salary and have not implemented the minimum wage.\n\nFor the economist, states that sack workers for lack of money to pay their salaries should not be given the monthly federal allocation or half of the allocation because the people the money is meant to benefit have been sacked.\n\nUgonma Onwubiko, an Abia State health worker, is worried over El-Rufai\u2019s approach because she thinks her governor, who has the culture of owing salaries would most likely consider the sack option.\n\n\u201cAt present, our salaries and pensions are not paid as regular as they should be. The irregularity has made it difficult for most parents to pay school fees of their children, pay house rent and carry out other responsibilities. So, if they now sack us, they are encouraging untimely deaths, wayward children, and insecurity,\u201d the mother of four said.\n\nShe also disclosed that workers\u2019 salaries, even when you add ghost workers, are not as much as the money politicians steal through inflated contracts, retinue of political appointees, allocation for buying votes, and money laundering.\n\nIn the same vein, Anjorin advised governors to cut their unnecessary expenses, focus on projects that will empower people and not elephant projects like airports, seaports and railway, which are humongous and conduit pipe of stealing government funds.\n\n\u201cIf Governor El-Rufai wants to sack Kaduna workers, he should start from his relations and friends in the state civil service. But I think that plan is unthinkable because he has sacked many in his rightsizing exercise. He should copy the Lagos State internally generated revenue model to boost his earnings and pay people well, including minimum wage,\u201d Anjorin said.\n\nHowever, an Abuja-based top government official who pleaded for anonymity expressed his disappointment over the planned sack by El-Rufai, noting that the Federal Government gave states bailout; they still receive federal allocation, yet they complain of lack of fund to pay poor workers\u2019 salary.\n\n\u201cIt is not fair to threaten the poor with sack when we all know that politicians are moving money in bullion van. The EFCC should arrest any governor who threatens to sack workers and probe what they have been doing with their allocations, starting with El-Rufai,\u201d he said.\n\nExplaining the reason for picketing Kaduna, Ayuba Wabba, the NLC national president, said it was partly because of the sacking of 7,000 workers from local governments in the state.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe are also aware that in the Primary Health Care Development Agency, 1,700 workers were sacked. All these are happening in the face of exorbitant increment in tuition fees, high cost of living and other uncalled-for actions in ministries and agencies in the state.\u2019\u2019\n\nWabba further said: \u201cWe cannot accept the bitter pills; \u2026because the labour law in Nigeria says before you can declare redundancy, labour shall be consulted and we were never consulted.\u201d\n\nHe however, noted that it was not strange to relieve workers of their job when it becomes difficult to retain them. He argued that necessary steps should be followed in line with Labour laws in the country.\n\nWabba accused Kaduna of sacking the workers without paying them severance allowances to cushion their suffering.\n\nHe also faulted the claim that those sacked were mainly workers who no longer fit into the 21st century workforce as a result of their qualifications.\n\nThe NLC boss said that since such workers were interviewed and hired on the basis of the qualification they had at the point of entry, compensation must be paid to them to enable them start a new life.\n\nThe NLC had, last Monday, embarked on a five-day warning strike over the sack of thousands of workers and refusal to pay entitlement to retrenched workers in the state.\n\nEl Rufai said the sacks were part of the government\u2019s process to \u2018rightsize\u2019 the state\u2019s civil service.\n\nHe condemned the industrial action that lasted for three days before it was called off Wednesday evening by Wabba. The NLC chairman said the strike was called off to give room for negotiations after the Federal Government waded in.",

          "title": "INTERVIEW: How Nigeria can be \u2018restructured\u2019 for optimal performance, enhanced security \u2013 Director, IIJ",
          "text": "The Director of the International Institute of Journalism, (IIJ), Abuja, Emman Shehu, in this interview, bares his mind on the contentious issues of restructuring and devolution of powers. He also proffers solutions to Nigeria\u2019s current challenges. Excerpts:\n\nPT: What is your position on the rising calls for restructuring and devolution of powers in the Nigerian polity? What do you think this means?\n\nShehu: As you rightly noted, restructuring has become a difficult topic in Nigeria today. There is no clear definition of what restructuring means. It starts from one extreme to the other: the extreme of fracturing the country into as many parts as possible from one extreme of breaking up the country into countless fragments like a China plate dashed on the floor, to the other extreme of going back to the old regions.\n\nI call it extreme because it is impracticable as we would see when we try to closely analyse the situation. The regions were split into states to reduce the cumbersomeness of size and governance, and it allowed several communities that had been repressed to get a leeway.\n\nDo you think those communities would now willing surrender themselves to the old subjugation? What would even happen is that politicians would now create a new hierarchy of leadership over the regions, for example a Governor General of a number of states with all the appurtenances including a multitude of aides, which means more bloated governance.\n\nUnderlying all of this is the fact that changes have to take place as the country evolves. Even the American nation, in terms of democracy, their constitution has evolved. We like talking about the American constitution but even their constitution has evolved. It isn\u2019t what it was by the time it was created by the founding fathers. But it changed gradually and dispassionately to avoid crises\n\nSo every country evolves as anything that is living evolves. But the Nigerian problem is that there is too much politicisation of almost any issue you can think of. And this is made worse when we approach general elections. It is like people who have lost in the previous elections try to use restructuring as a threat to get what they want at all costs, throwing caution overboard.\n\nSo a lot of time and energy are spent trying to stop the overheating of the polity, rather than focusing on constructive engagements that would yield meaningful progress for the greater good. We have to agree that there is no country that was just created on its own.\n\nThat is the reason history is replete with accounts of conquests from ancient times across all parts of the world. Countries were created out of one form of colonialism or the other. When we try to say Nigeria is an artificial creation, every country is an artificial creation, if we are to take it that way. One needs to read the history of how countries came about to understand this. That is why you have conquests littering the history of countries.\n\nIn the Nigerian context, we have gone from the colonial creation, as we like to say to our own creation, creation of regions and creation of states. And we still seem not to be satisfied. Those creations came as a result of agitations.\n\nPT: What are the causes of these agitations?\n\nPeople are looking for justice, they are looking for a situation where they can be recognised as human beings and as partners in the progress of the nation.\n\nFor me the solution lies in devolution (of powers) which is what happens in most countries. The three major areas that should be addressed are: the judiciary, state legislatures, and the local governments.\n\nPT: What about the security architecture?\n\nShehu: I am coming to that. I think the devolution should start from the local governments. And people are being dishonest. This current administration has asked that there should be such a devolution. The governors have refused. When you empower the local government, allow them the freedom to operate, this is going to reduce some of the pressures.\n\nThen, of course the judiciary, allow the judiciary the freedom to operate and then the state legislatures that are held ransom by the various state governors. That way we would have progress.\n\nOn the issue of security, this is a very important aspect of devolution. Some people are crying about state police without looking at the ramifications on a wider level. You only need to look across the nation to see the confrontation the governors have with the opposition or the people that they are not on good terms with.\n\nIt frightens one to think of what the governors would do if they have the police at their beck and call. I have never been a supporter of state police. It is still too early in our stage of development. I also speak from the position of being a religious minority in the core north. Even this Sharia that we have now (in some states) we can see what it is like when the state governors are in control of law enforcement.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nImagine if they now have state police across the country. It is going to create more insecurity rather than stemming the current insecurity.\n\nPT: So how do we tackle the issue of insecurity then?\n\nThe first step is to create a justice system that is fair to everybody. That is number one. The justice system does not work fast enough to ensure that people who are involved in misdemeanour are punished appropriately and on time.\n\nThe other way is to ensure people trust the law enforcement agents. At the moment, there is a deficit of trust which is obvious if you have had any reason to be involved with law enforcement agencies. You will know that anything can happen even to you who has a genuine case.\n\nWe also need to empower numerically the law enforcement agencies. We don\u2019t have enough to actually police our various communities. This is the major deficit. It is not about creating state police. We could overhaul the police, do the same thing with the military.\n\nAlso their roles should be properly defined. The military should not be playing the role of the police. This complicates issues. We also have situation where policemen are acting as bodyguards for the elite in the society, it is unacceptable. For security to be properly addressed, there should be an overhaul of the security architecture to also enhance intelligence gathering.\n\nPT: So, who should initiate these measures, the government in power as the opposition would argue or the parliament as the government usually pushes back?\n\nShehu: We should take any exercise that comes with changing aspects of the constitution seriously. You know at the moment, the parliament has started a process of constitutional amendments. Are people taking this serious, that is the issue. People are not taking it serious.\n\nWhen the exercise is closed, people will now say the parliament has done nothing. So let us work with what is available. It is like my brothers in the East who keep complaining. Have they ever held their parliamentarians accountable?\n\nMost times it is the failure of the parliamentarians and failure of the citizens to hold their parliamentarians accountable. The provisions are there but who holds his representative responsible? We all focus on the federal government. We don\u2019t even hold our governors accountable. A lot of things can be done even at the state level.\n\nAlso note, that devolution is a process and we cannot pack too many things into the process. Even in other countries that practises devolution, you will see that they take things one step at a time to avert overloading the process and ending up with disastrous consequences. Even in the United Kingdom there are age-old agitations but the underlying approach is one of caution.",

We see that has greatly subsided and students are more focused on their academic activities and I think that is very impressive.\n\n\u201cThat is what will explain for the higher level of interest that is displayed by the number of students that are seeking admission, because nobody will want his or her children in a university where there is a high rate of cultism and bad behaviour.\n\n\u201cSo, I will like to congratulate the Governing Council on your particular achievement of curbing the rate of insecurity which is one challenge that we are now currently dealing with along the length and breadth of not just this state, but the country at large,\u201d the governor stated.\n\nAbiodun who disclosed that his administration has acquired buses for the smooth transportation of students on campuses, added that the buses would soon be handed over to the institutions as soon as issues on the management of the buses are sorted out with respective institutions.\n\nWhile appreciating the Governing Council for the changes it has made in the curricular of the institution, the governor also commended the Council members for what they were able to achieve in terms of students\u2019 welfare.\n\n\u201cI want to appreciate some of the changes that you\u2019ve made in curricular; you have mentioned that you have introduced Nursing, Music and Linguistics and that it is doing very well.

          "text": "The Accident Investigation Bureau, Nigeria has been ordered by the Nigerian Air Force to oversee inquiry into the crash of a military aircraft in which the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru, and 10 others died on Friday in Kaduna.\n\nTunji Oketumbi, the AIB spokesperson, said on Saturday that the Flight Data Recorder and the Cockpit Voice Recorder of the crashed Beechcraft 350 aircraft had been recovered and investigation had commenced.\n\n\u201cInvestigators will download and analyse vital information contained in the recorders at the AIB-N\u2019s world-class flight safety laboratory in Abuja,\u201d Oketumbi said in a statement.\n\nHe made it known that the authorization given to AIB-N was based on the Memorandum of Understanding it signed with the military on July 1, 2020 covering areas of mutual assistance.\n\nOketumbi said, \u201cThis is not the first time we will be asked to investigate a military crash. We were asked to do so some years ago. As usual, both the preliminary and final reports of this crash will be submitted to the military which invited us to do it. It is the military that will decide what to do with it thereafter.\u201d\n\nOketumbi had earlier told said that despite that the fact that the crash happened at the civil aviation arm of the airport, the AIB-N would not be able to investigate it except it was invited to do so, because the crash involved military aircraft.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are civil and we investigate civil aircraft occurrences. So, we do not deal with military aviation except they invite us.\u201d\n\nIt was reported that the aircraft, with registration number 5N-R203, was billed to land at the Nigerian Air Force Base in the Mando area of Kaduna before it diverted and attempted to land at the Kaduna International Airport.\n\nAn Air Traffic Controller source stated that the NAF jet deflected from the military airport to the civil one due to bad weather, touched down but skidded off Runway 05 and burst into flames.\n\nOketumbi told our correspondent that there was nothing unusual in a military aircraft landing at a civil airport.\n\nHe said, \u201cMost of the airports are joint military and civil aviation airports. Their (military) airports are not entirely different from that of civil aviation. Most of them are joint military/civil aviation airports.\n\n\u201cSo it does not matter where a military aircraft lands. It is still belonging to the military. It has not reduced the status and has not removed the tag of being a military aircraft.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cEven if a civil aircraft lands in a military airport, that does not remove the fact that it is a civil aircraft. And if there\u2019s a need for investigation in this sense, it is going to be done by the AIB.\n\n\u201cSo it is the aircraft that we are interested in. Therefore all they need to do is to liaise with the airport and say their aircraft crashed into that position and possibly ask if the AIB could be allowed to investigate it.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria has assured air passengers that the Kaduna airport was still in operation despite the crash of the NAF jet at the civil aviation airport.\n\nOn whether the Kaduna airport was open to operations after the accident on its civil aviation arm, the General Manager, Public Affairs, FAAN, Henrietta Yakubu, noted that domestic airlines were being expected at the facility on Saturday afternoon.\n\n\u201cKaduna airport has not been shut, they are expecting Air Peace to land soon,\u201d she stated. ,,",

          "text": "Pro-democracy group, Coalition For Defence Of Democracy In Nigeria, CDDN, has called for caution over the southern governor\u2019s resolution on open grazing and the statement of the attorneys-general of the federation and minister of justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami (SAN).\n\nAccording to the group, the AGF is the chief law officer of the country and must have spoken strictly on the lawfulness of cattle rearing in the country.\n\nThe AGF had in an interview on Channels Television compared cattle rearing in the southern part of the country to spare parts business in the north.\n\nHe spoke following the ban of open graze ng by southern governors after a meeting in Asaba.\n\nChief Isaac Ikpa, National Convener, CDDN, at a press conference in Abuja, said it is illogical to act in that regard and urged the governors to revisit their stand in the overall interest of unity and peaceful coexistence among all Nigerians.\n\nChief Ikpa said, \u201dWe therefore, as a Coalition seek to make the following clarifications on the interview because we noticed from the comments since the interview was granted that so many Nigerians misconstrued the point the AGF was trying to drive home by comparing cattle business with spare parts traders in the north.\n\n\u201dThe context of the use of \u201cspare parts\u201d is about freedom of movement of goods and ownership. Does it not violate the respective rights of the Fulani and Ibo people if you restrict their rights to movement of their possessed goods that are not legally outlawed?\n\n\u201dFulanis own cattle which they move around in possessive sense. Spare part dealers move spare parts in ownership and possessive sense. We submit that it is the encroachment of the right of others that has ever been punishable and not the act of lawful grazing. Identifying encroachment with an ethnic toga is dangerous and mischievous and it has ever been. A spare parts dealer that encroaches into other peoples land to store his wares has committed an act of trespass not because he is an Igbo man but because of his unlawful act.\n\n\u201dAs AGF, his role is to set out the law in precise terms and if we must understand, he is not the one that made these laws because it is not his duty to do so.\n\n\u201dWe also make bold to say that the Southern Governors\u2019 declaration is a blanket statement lacking in precision and legally wrong. The statement of the AGF in the interview was aimed at showing this.\n\n\u201dWe believe the AGF spoke strictly on the lawfulness of cattle rearing. Based on our laws, every lawful business is free and guaranteed by the 1999 Constitution. We are not also unmindful of the fact that in the course of doing business an act of criminality may occur and if that happens, it can be dealt with according to the extant law. We believe it is wrong from for the Southern Governors to throw a blanket ban because criminals have infiltrated a business. It is illogical to act in that regard and we urge the Governors to revisit their stand in the overall interest of unity and peaceful coexistence among all Nigerians.\n\n\u201dAt this stage of our national life when tackling insecurity is at the front burner of governance, the Governors should not distract citizens with the issue of open grazing. They should rather focus their energy on granting autonomy to States Legislature, Judiciary and Local Governments . By this we mean that the Governors should immediately implement the provisions of Executive Order 10 as signed by President Muhammadu Buhari. They should respect the democratic principles of independence of State Legislature and Judiciary in line with Section 121 (3) of the Constitution. Nigerians seek nothing less. The divisionary and diversionary techniques should be over.\n\n\u201dWe believe the AGF spoke strictly on the lawfulness of cattle rearing. Based on our laws, every lawful business is free and guaranteed by the 1999 Constitution. We are not also unmindful of the fact that in the course of doing business an act of criminality may occur and if that happens, it can be dealt with according to the extant law.

          "text": "The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to direct the Minister of Finance, Budget, and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed to disclose spending details of the $700 million looted funds reportedly recovered by the Federal Government in the past four years.\n\nThe agency is also asking for the location of projects completed with the money, as well as details of the contractors that executed the projects.\n\nSERAP urged the President to \u201cDirect Mrs. Ahmed to disclose how the government plans to spend the returned \u00a34.2m Ibori loot, including details of planned capital expenditure, and whether there is any plan to ensure that the money and any future returned Ibori loot would be spent to achieve justice and effective remedies for victims of corruption in Delta State.\u201d\n\nThe Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice Mr. Abubakar Malami, SAN, had last week stated that the Federal Government recovered over $700m looted funds, disclosed the return of \u00a34.2m linked to James Ibori, and the plan to repatriate more than \u00a380m of Ibori loot.\n\nREAD ALSO: Nigeria Receives \u00a34.2m Ibori Loot\n\nIn the Freedom of Information request dated 22 May 2021 and signed by SERAP deputy director Kolawole Oluwadare, the organization said: \u201cDisclosing spending details of the recovered $700m loot, and spending plans for the \u00a34.2m Ibori loot would promote transparency, accountability, and be entirely consistent with your constitutional oath of office to ensure the well-being of Nigerians.\u201d\n\nSERAP said: \u201cRather than borrowing another N2.3trillion ($6.18bn) external loan, SERAP urges you to ensure transparent and accountable use of recovered loot to fund the 2021 budget, improve the country\u2019s economy, and address widespread poverty. This would promote a just and honest government, and ensure that recovered loot is not re-stolen at the expense of the poor.\u201d\n\nThe letter, read in part: \u201cSERAP, therefore, urges you to withdraw your latest request seeking the approval of the National Assembly to borrow another $6.1billion in the public interests, and to ensure accountable fiscal stewardship of Nigeria\u2019s money for both current and future generations.\u201d\n\n\u201cProviding the information and widely publishing the details would also enhance your government\u2019s authority and credibility to demand the return of more looted public funds from abroad, as well as facilitate the repatriation of potentially billions of dollars still stashed in rich countries.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour government has a legal obligation under the UN Convention against Corruption to ensure that recovered stolen public money is not embezzled again, and that any returned loot is spent for the benefit of the real victims of corruption\u2014the ordinary Nigerians whose commonwealth has been stolen, and who continue to suffer the consequences of grand corruption.\u201d\n\n\u201cSERAP notes that the consequences of corruption are felt by poor citizens on a daily basis. Corruption exposes them to additional costs to pay for health, water, education and administrative services. Another consequence of corruption is the growing inequality in the country, where the privileged few have access to all public resources, while the vast majority of citizens are deprived of access to public services.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur requests are brought in the public interest, and in keeping with the requirements of the Nigerian Constitution 1999 [as amended]; the Freedom of Information Act, and the country\u2019s international obligations including under the UN Convention against Corruption and the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights to which Nigeria is a state party.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur requests are also entirely in line with the judgment by Justice Mohammed Idris ordering your government to widely publish up-to-date information on recovered stolen funds since the return of civilian rule in 1999. Your government has refused to obey the judgment, despite publicly promising to do so.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe would be grateful if the recommended measures are taken within 14 days of the receipt and/or publication of this letter. If we have not heard from you by then, SERAP shall take all appropriate legal actions to compel your government to comply with our request in the public interest.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a signatory to the UN Convention against Corruption and the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights, Nigeria has committed to ensure transparent and accountable management of public resources, and unhindered access to public information. These commitments ought to be fully upheld and respected.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to our information, Mr Malami recently reportedly disclosed that your government has recovered over $700 million looted funds from the United States, the United Kingdom, Bailiwick of Jersey, Switzerland, and Ireland in the past four years.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Malami also disclosed the return of \u00a34.2 million linked to James Ibori, former Delta state governor, and his associates. Your government is also reportedly working towards securing the repatriation of more than \u00a380 million linked to Ibori.\u201d",

          "text": "Twenty-one people were killed after hail, freezing rain and high winds hit runners taking part in a 100-kilometer (62-mile) cross-country mountain race in China, state media said Sunday.\n\nThe extreme weather struck a high-altitude section of the race held in the scenic Yellow River Stone Forest near Baiyin city in northwestern Gansu province Saturday afternoon.\n\nAmong the dead were elite Chinese long-distance runners, local media reported.\n\nOfficial news agency Xinhua confirmed the death toll had risen to 21, citing the local rescue command headquarters. State broadcaster CCTV also reported the final missing competitor had been found dead.\n\nBaiyin city mayor Zhang Xuchen said that at around midday Saturday a section of the rugged ultramarathon course \u2014 between kilometres 20 and 31 \u2014 was \u201csuddenly affected by disastrous weather\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn a short period of time, hailstones and ice rain suddenly fell in the local area, and there were strong winds. The temperature sharply dropped,\u201d Zhang said.\n\nShortly after receiving messages seeking help from some participants, marathon organisers dispatched a rescue team that managed to save 18 of the 172 participants.\n\nAt around 2pm, weather conditions worsened and the race was immediately called off as local authorities sent more rescuers to help, Zhang said.\n\nThe victims included top domestic marathon runners Liang Jing and Huang Guanjun, local media reported, citing a friend of Huang\u2019s and Wei Pulong, Liang\u2019s coach. Liang had won multiple Chinese ultramarathons in recent years.\n\nHuang, who was deaf-mute, won the men\u2019s hearing-impaired marathon at the 2019 National Paralympic Games held in Tianjin. Marathon organisers confirmed his death to a friend, who was cited in local media.\n\n\u201cAs the event\u2019s organiser, we feel a deep sense of guilt and self-blame, express our deep mourning for the victims and deep condolences to their families and the injured runners,\u201d Zhang said, as he and other local officials bowed.\n\nThe race, backed by the Baiyin city government and the Chinese Athletic Association, has been held for four successive years.\n\n\u2018Come and save us!\u2019\n\nXinhua reported that some of the runners suffered from hypothermia, and Zhang said earlier that eight people were being treated for minor injuries in hospital and were in a stable condition.\n\nVideo footage broadcast on state media showed emergency rescue personnel in combat fatigues carrying flashlights as they climbed through the rocky terrain at night.\n\nSome marathon participants, wrapped in heavy-duty blankets, were filmed being put on to a stretcher by rescuers.\n\nPhotos published by Chinese media also showed a group of runners huddled together on the mountainside, some wrapped in insulation blankets.\n\nREAD ALSO: Iran Explosives Factory Blast Injures Nine\n\n\u201cMy whole body was soaked through, including my shoes and socks. I couldn\u2019t stand up straight because of the wind, I was very worried I\u2019d be blown over. The cold became more and more unbearable,\u201d one survivor was quoted as saying in local media.\n\n\u201cWhile descending the mountain, I was already experiencing hypothermia symptoms.\u201d\n\nScreenshots of messages sent in the race participants\u2019 chat group were published in local media.\n\n\u201cA few people have already lost consciousness and are foaming at the mouth,\u201d wrote one unidentified participant. \u201cCome and save us, quick!\u201d\n\nChinese social media erupted in mourning and outrage Sunday, as users blamed organisers for perceived failings in contingency planning.\n\n\u201cThe local organisers have an inescapable responsibility for the bad weather in the marathon! Current weather forecast accuracy rates are very high \u2026 what kind of emergency plans did they have?\u201d wrote one user.\n\nMeteorological authorities in Gansu\u2019s Jingtai county told local media they had sent a weather report to race organisers but it \u201ccontained no details of a cold air front\u201d.\n\nGansu Meteorological Bureau warned of \u201csudden heavy showers, hail, lightning, sudden gale-force winds\u201d and other adverse weather conditions across the province in a report dated Friday.\n\nProvincial authorities have set up an investigation team to look into the cause of the incident, Zhang said.\n\nRepeated calls to Baiyin city propaganda department were not answered.\n\nGansu, one of China\u2019s poorest regions, borders Mongolia to the north and Xinjiang to the west.\n\nDeadly floods and landslides have hit the province in the past, with mudslides reportedly killing more than 1,000 people in one town in 2010.\n\nMarathons have seen a surge in popularity among China\u2019s middle class in recent years.\n\nHowever, the sport has often been plagued by cheating scandals in China.\n\nAFP",

          "text": "Hundreds of masked Hamas fighters brandishing assault rifles paraded in Gaza City and the group\u2019s top leader made his first public appearance on Saturday, in a defiant show of strength after the militants\u2019 11-day war with Israel.\n\nSaturday marked the first full day of a cease-fire, and Egyptian mediators held talks to firm up the truce which ended the fourth Israel-Hamas war in just over a decade.\n\nIn the fighting, Israel unleashed hundreds of airstrikes against militant targets in Gaza, while Hamas and other militants fired more than 4,000 rockets toward Israel. More than 250 people were killed, the vast majority of them Palestinians.\n\nIn Gaza City, residents began assessing damage.\n\nOne of Gaza City\u2019s busiest commercial areas, Omar al-Mukhtar Street, was covered in debris, smashed cars and twisted metal after a 13-floor building in its centre was flattened in an Israeli airstrike.\n\nMerchandise was covered in soot and strewn inside smashed stores and on the pavement. Municipal workers swept broken glass and twisted metal from streets and sidewalks.\n\n\u201cWe really didn\u2019t expect this amount of damage,\u201d said Ashour Subeih, who sells baby clothes. \u201cWe thought the strike was a bit further from us. But as you can see not an area of the shop is intact.\u201d\n\nHaving been in business for one year, Subeih estimated his losses were double what he has made so far.\n\nDrone video and photos showed some city blocks reduced to rubble, in between homes and businesses left standing.\n\nBoth Israel and Hamas have claimed victory.\n\nOn Saturday, hundreds of Hamas fighters wearing military camouflage paraded past the mourning tent for Bassem Issa, a senior commander killed in the fighting. The top Hamas leader in Gaza, Yehiyeh Sinwar, paid his respects in his first public appearance since the war began.\n\nIsrael bombed the house of Sinwar, along with that of other senior Hamas figures, as part of its attack on what it said was the group\u2019s military infrastructure. Israel\u2019s defense minister, Benny Gantz, has said Israel delivered a punishing blow to Hamas, and that top Hamas figures remained targets.\n\nStill, there was a widespread expectation that the cease-fire would stick for now, even if another round of fighting at some point seems inevitable.\n\nUnderlying issues remain unresolved, including an Israeli-Egyptian border blockade, now in its 14th year, that is choking Gaza\u2019s more than 2 million residents and a refusal by the Islamic militant Hamas to disarm.\n\nThe UN Security Council released a statement Saturday, welcoming the cease-fire and stressing \u201cthe immediate need for humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian civilian population, particularly in Gaza.\u201d\n\nThousands rallied in the Israeli city of Tel Aviv, calling for coexistence between Jews and Arabs.\n\nThe fighting began on May 10, when Hamas militants in Gaza fired long-range rockets toward Jerusalem. The barrage came after days of clashes between Palestinian protesters and Israeli police at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound.\n\nHeavy-handed police tactics at the compound and the threatened eviction of dozens of Palestinian families by Jewish settlers had inflamed tensions.\n\nThe war has further sidelined Hamas\u2019 main political rival, the internationally backed Palestinian Authority, which oversees autonomous enclaves in the Israeli-occupied West\n\nBank. Hamas\u2019 popularity seemed to be growing as it positioned itself as a defender of Palestinian claims to Jerusalem.\n\nOn Friday, hours after the cease-fire took effect, thousands of Palestinians in the Al-Aqsa compound chanted against Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and his self-rule government. \u201cDogs of the Palestinian Authority, out, out,\u201d they shouted, and \u201cThe people want the president to leave.\u201d\n\nIt was an unprecedented display of anger against Abbas. The conflict also brought to the surface deep frustration among Palestinians, whether in the occupied West Bank, Gaza or within Israel, over the status quo, with the Israeli-Palestinian peace process all but abandoned for years.\n\nDespite his weakened status, Abbas will be the point of contact for any renewed U.S. diplomacy, since Israel and the West, including the United States, consider Hamas a terrorist organization.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken is to meet with Abbas and Israeli leaders when he visits in the coming week. Abbas is expected to raise demands that any Gaza reconstruction plans go through the Palestinian Authority to avoid strengthening Hamas.\n\nAbbas met Saturday with Egyptian mediators, discussing the rebuilding of Gaza and internal Palestinian relations, according to the official Palestinian news agency Wafa.\n\nAn Egyptian diplomat said that two teams of mediators were in Israel and the Palestinian territories to continue talks on firming up a cease-fire deal and securing long-term calm.\n\nThe diplomat said discussions include implementing agreed-on measures in Gaza and Jerusalem, including ways to prevent practices that led to the latest fighting. He did not elaborate. He was apparently referring to violence at the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the planned eviction of Palestinian families from the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood in east Jerusalem.\n\nThe diplomat spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss behind-the-scenes deliberations.\n\nSeparately, a 130-truck convoy with humanitarian aid and medical supplies reached the Gaza border from Egypt on Saturday, according to a senior Egyptian official at the border crossing. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to reporters.\n\nAcross Gaza, an assessment of the damage to the territory\u2019s already decrepit infrastructure began.\n\nThe ministry of public works and housing said that 769 housing and commercial units were rendered uninhabitable, at least 1,042 units in 258 buildings were destroyed and just over 14,500 units suffered minor damage.\n\nThe United Nations said about 800,000 people in Gaza do not have regular access to clean piped water, as nearly 50% of the water network was damaged in the fighting.\n\nIsrael has said it was targeting Hamas\u2019 military infrastructure, including a vast tunnel system running under roads and homes, as well as command centers, rocket launchers and the homes of commanders. The Israeli military has said it was trying to minimize harm to civilians and accused Hamas of using civilians as human shields.\n\nThe Gaza Health Ministry says at least 248 Palestinians were killed, including 66 children and 39 women, with 1,910 people wounded. It does not differentiate between fighters and civilians. Twelve people were killed in Israel, all but one of them civilians, including a 5-year-old boy and 16-year-old girl.\n\nIsrael has accused Hamas and the smaller militant group of Islamic Jihad of hiding the actual number of fighters killed in the war. Prime Minister Netanyahu said Friday that more than 200 militants were killed, including 25 senior commanders.\n\nIslamic Jihad on Saturday gave a first account of deaths within its ranks, saying that 19 of its commanders and fighters were killed, including the head of the rocket unit in northern Gaza.",

          "text": "The European Union has announced plans to remove Ghana from the list of countries that are deficient anti-money laundering and terrorism financing.\n\nThe decision to remove Ghana from the list followed a two-day working visit by the President of Ghana, Nana Addo Dankw Akufo-Addo to Brussels, Belgium from the 19th to 20th May, 2021.\n\nA statement by the Acting Director of Communications, Office of the President of Ghana, Eugene Arhin said Akufo-Addo met with the President of the European Council Charles Michel where he intimated the EU with efforts of his government in implementing the action plan of the International Country Risk Guide.\n\nThe statement said the EU acknowledged the efforts made by Ghana in this regard and has decided to remove the country from the list of the countries that are deficient anti-money laundering and terrorism financing.\n\n\u201cIt is expected that the Financial Action Task Force, the global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog, will, in June 2021, announce that Ghana has been taken off its list of high risk, third world countries with strategic deficiencies in Anti-money Laundering and Countering of Terrorism Financing,\u201d the statement added.\n\nThe statement also said that the Vice President of the European Commission, Vadis Dombrovskis, the commission indicated the selection of Ghana as a possible manufacturing hub for Covid-19 vaccines in Africa.\n\nThis, according to the commission follows the initiatives already taken by the Government of Ghana towards the domestic manufacturing of vaccines.\n\nThe statement said taskforce teams from the EU and Ghana will meet shortly to discuss modalities towards the realization of this initiative.\n\nThe Ghanian president had already secured one hundred and seventy million euros (\u20ac170 million) from EIB for the establishment of the Development Bank, Ghana.\n\nLast month, United Kingdom exempted Nigeria from its list of high-risk countries for money laundering. The list, comprising 21 countries, was released as part of post-Brexit developments.\n\nUntil the end of the Brexit transition period, the list of high-risk countries was determined by the European Union under the 4th Anti Money Laundering Directive.\n\nHowever, from January 1, 2021, the UK has had its own standalone list. Since then, any amendments made by the European Union to its list do not have effect in the UK. The EU had in March 2019 added Nigeria to countries on its \u201cdirty money blacklist\u201d.\n\nThe EU said the nations in this category pose a threat because of lax controls on terrorism financing and money laundering.\n\nThe Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit, however, announced that Nigeria was officially withdrawn from the list by the Council of Europe on March 5, 2019.\n\nGhana, Senegal, Iran and Morocco are among the countries listed in the UK\u2019s Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (Amendment) (High-Risk Countries) Regulations 2021 which took effect on March 26.\n\nOthers include Syria, Uganda, Zimbabwe and Pakistan.\n\n\u201cThese Regulations amend the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017 (S.I. 2017/692) (\u201cthe MLRs\u201d) to insert as Schedule 3ZA a new UK list of high-risk third countries for the purposes of enhanced customer due diligence requirements,\u201d an explanatory note attached to the regulation read.\n\nRegulation 2 substitutes for the definition of \u201chigh-risk third country\u201d in regulation 33(3)(a) of the MLRs a definition which refers to the list of countries in this Schedule, rather than to the list in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1675 of 14th July 2016 supplementing Directive (EU) 2015/849 of the European Parliament and of the Council by identifying high-risk third countries with strategic deficiencies (\u201cthe CDR\u201d). It also makes a consequential amendment to a further reference to the CDR. Regulation 3 revokes the CDR.\u201d",

          "text": "New facts have shown that economic factors far more outweighed the political reasons that necessitated the recent defection of the Cross River State governor, Ben Ayade, from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nEven more, the governor\u2019s alleged complacent attitude also contributed to why members of the National Assembly outplayed him in the wards, local and state congresses elections in the state.\n\nA top source within the National Working Committee (NWC) of the PDP said the economic issue played out more than the governor losing the PDP structures in the state.\n\nTHISDAY gathered a bait of returning some, at least 20 oil wells out of the 76 that were ceded to Akwa Ibom by federal government, largely informed why Ayade left the PDP.\n\nAccording to the source, \u201cSince the APC lost the bids to have a foothold in Bayelsa and later Edo States, out of the desperation to have the APC in the South-south, the ruling shifted attention to Cross River State, using the bait of returning some of the 76 oil ceded to Akwa Ibom State to Cross River.\u201d\n\nThe source explained that Governor Ayade had since 2019 sought return of some of the 76 oil wells ceded to Akwa Ibom following the ruling of the Supreme Court in 2012, saying the ceding of the oil-rich peninsula was illegal and therefore maintained that the loss of the oil wells was an \u201cact of gross injustice and the APC jump to it as a working tool.\u201d\n\nAyade had alleged unconscionable injustices meted out to the state by the federal government, regretting the takeover of Bakassi Peninsula by Cameroun as well as the non-reimbursement of funds spent on federal roads, which forced him to call for a political solution.\n\n\u201cThis was one of the reasons that Senator Ita Giwa has thrown her support for the defection\u201d, the source said, explaining that Mama Bakassi as she was called, believed that the offer could help the economic development of the state.\n\n\u201cSo, the defection was imminent as the APC-led federal government want to ensure a control of a state in the South-south,\u201d the source stressed\n\nIta-Giwa had told newsmen shortly after Ayade defected to the APC that the governor was the political leader in the state and she would always go where he leads.\n\n\u201cWe have a leader in the state and wherever he moves to my loyalty is with him\u201d.\n\nIta-Giwa, who was a founding member of All Nigeria People\u2019 Party, ANPP has moved between PDP and APC four times since 1999.\n\nGiving reasons for his defection, Ayade said injustice and meddling in the affairs of his state led him to move to APC.\n\n\u201cIt is my responsibility to bring back Cross River to the centre to enhance our fortune. We need to work ahead with our President for the future of our country\u201d, he said, noting that the territorial integrity of the state has been interfered with and that it was his responsibility to \u201cresocket\u2019 the state back to its proper disposition.\n\nHowever, the national leadership of the PDP, a source claimed, believed that Ayade lost the control of the party structures in the state due to his complacent attitude to party issues.\n\nThe source said it has always been the party policy that governors control political party structures in their state, but \u201cthe governor was very complacent and members of the National Assembly in the state moved and took the party structures from him.\n\n\u201cIt was after this slumber that he woke up and demanded that the NWC should intervene and restore the party structures to him. He was the architect of himself missing out in the power structures to members of the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cAs a governor, he ought to have moved to take full charge of affairs in the state. He was like emperor wining and dinning when members of National Assembly moved against him and took over the party from him,\u201d the source stated.",
