          "text": "In the continuation of its resettlement drive of all Internally Displaced Persons, the Borno State committee for the resettlement of Baga displaced persons have confirmed that the villagers who have resettled to the once deserted town have been fully settled and life has picked up in earnest for them despite the presence of some elements of the Boko Haram terrorists lurking around the Lake Chad Basin.\n\nThis was made known to PUNCH in Maiduguri by the Chairman of the committee and Attorney-General of the State, Barrister Kaka Shehu Lawan on Thursday while reacting to the challenges confronting the state government\u2019s resolve to close down all IDP camps in the state by December 2021.\n\n\u201cWe have constructed over two hundred permanent houses in Baga and distributed it to the owners. We have also constructed schools and other basic social amenities across Doronbaga and Cross Kauwa as well returned dwellers to their homes. We will construct hospitals in all these communities and equip them with modern-day facilities to meet up the health needs of the returnees.\n\n\u201cThe initial setback of insecurity has been addressed even though we know there are still elements of the terrorists lurking around the fringes.\n\nOur visit to the Local Government Areas is to ensure that the returnees villagers are good,\u201d the Commissioner of Justice said.\n\nKaka Shehu Lawan stated further that although the villagers are yet to fully commence activities like fishing and farming due to some insecurity challenges, the government through the resettlement committee have begun the process of making their farmlands and rivers safer for them to fully take off with their businesses.\n\n\u201cThe community we have resettled are mostly agrarian, pastoral, farming and fishing communities. They have started fishing activities on a small scale. We have met those concerned about security to map out the waterways so that our people will embark on large scale fishing and farming activities. By this, we hope in no distant future businesses will be boosted as it used to be in that area,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said about 8,640 households that were returned to their ancestral homelands three months ago have received food items and cash relief in Baga, Doro and Cross Kauwa from the Borno State government.\n\nAlso, of the 8,640 beneficiaries, 5,000 of them are men while 3,640 are women.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

And I encourage all French companies to present today to follow in their footsteps and get inspired by their example,\u201d he said.\n\nMacron assured that both French authorities and companies were committed to supporting the ambition of turning Nigeria into a strong industrial country, less dependent on oil and gas and imports.\n\nHe said the committee informed why the French Agency for Development had invested, over the last 10 years, in multiple sectors such as infrastructure, transports, energy, creative industries and sports.\n\n\u201cAnd this is also why the French Treasury has decided to allocate to your government a loan of more than 50 million Euro which will be the first for the Treasury since 1990 and the first-ever French loan in the healthcare sector in Nigeria,\u201d he said\n\nThe president assured that the France-Nigeria Business Council would be a catalyst to cementing cooperation and investments.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "The Federal Government has said it is working to accelerate and scale its current efforts to mobilize the needed domestic and international resources to implement the National TB Strategic Plan 2021-2025.\n\nThe Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire disclosed this at the 2021 National TB Conference held in Abuja, where he also tasked the private sector to intensify work on the newly developed data-driven, community TB case-finding strategies.\n\nIn 2020, the Nigerian government had introduced the engagement of the private sector, data-driven community TB case findings, integration of TB search in COVID-19 outreaches and active TB and COVID-19 search in health facilities as part of strategies designed alongside partners in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nThe Minister who blamed the 2019 emergence of COVID-19 for the reduction in TB case finding, said Nigeria had a 30% reduction in GeneXpert testing in the first week of the lockdown while the notification on TB cases dropped by 17% from 33,119 TB cases in Q1, 2020 to 27,353 in Q2, 2020.\n\nHe, however, said the strategies introduced brought some level of improvement in TB intervention resulting in a 15% increase in the number of cases notified from 120, 266 in 2019 and 138, 59 cases in 2020 across the country.\n\nThe milestone, Ehanire says now places Nigeria among countries with an increase in TB notification in 2020, despite the pandemic, a success he believes must be sustained using the theme of the conference; \u2018\u2018Sustaining a Resilient TB Response in Nigeria; Addressing the Impact of COVID-19 and Other Diseases.\n\n\u201cWe know that we still have a way to go to reach the targets for ending the TB epidemic and that most of our TB cases are yet undetected.\n\n\u201cWe must therefore work with our partners to accelerate and scale up our current efforts significantly, mobilize needed domestic and international resources for implementing the National TB Strategic Plan 2021-2025, to end the TB epidemic in Nigeria.\n\nDespite claims of success in TB case identification, health experts say it appears that TB has been normalized in Nigeria, stressing that the trend must change.\n\nDr. Isa Gidado, a TB expert and the Executive Director of KNCV Tuberculosis Foundation, asked the federal government to infuse a sense of urgency into its intervention to accelerate responses.\n\n\u2018\u2018If Tuberculosis must end in Nigeria, the government must turn its attention to it and invest in it. Show a political commitment to ending it, infuse domestic funds of at least 10% to support all interventions,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a keynote address, Prof of Medicine, Abba Abdullahi warned that TB remains among the top 10 causes of death in the country and is largely driven by poverty, economic distress, marginalization and stigma.\n\nHe, however, advised that if Nigeria adopts the \u2018find and treat model\u2019 used globally, it could prevent about 85% of detected cases.\n\nThe Stop TB Partnership had recently informed 21, 000 new cases of Drug-Resistant TB and 8,441 cases of TB in children in Nigeria, warning that 18 Nigerians still die from the disease every hour.\n\nThis new index is despite assertions by health experts that TB is curable using the 6 to 12 months treatment plan and is also vaccine-preventable.\n\nThe Director, Stop TB Partnership Nigeria, Ayodele Awe, believes the National Conference, which has brought together experts from across the globe is an opportunity to brainstorm on faster ways of ending the disease.",

We got a letter from Mr. President through the Honourable, the Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, approving the establishment of this Law School.

I can see the level of infrastructure that is being provided, which of course I have said before is going to be world-class infrastructure that is supposed to be in a Law School. We are not only providing this infrastructure, but we are also providing accommodation where the lecturers will live with all other things attached to it. And this Law School will have its own investment to take care of the Law School whether the government is here or not.\n\n\u201cFrom what I heard, the Deputy Senate President through some other lawmakers are sponsoring a bill to establish two schools per zone, and then saying that one will be in Yenagoa and one in Delta state, in the village of the Deputy Senate President.

          "text": "By Sunday Ani, Chukwudi Nweje and Noah Ebije, Kaduna\n\nAgain, controversial Islamic cleric, Sheikh Ahmad Abubakar Gumi, is in the eye of the storm following his advice to the Federal Government to give land and money to bandits so that they could stop killing Nigerians.\n\nIn a live stream on his Facebook page on Tuesday, he said past attempts to broker peace with bandits failed because they were not compensated \u201cwith lands or cattle or money big enough to help halt hostilities.\u201d\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates). Click Here to Apply .\n\nHowever, the Ohaneze Ndigbo, the Middle Belt Forum, Yoruba self-determination group, Ilano Omo Oodua (IOO), and other eminent Nigerians said his comment is akin to ceding part of Nigerian lands to foreigners.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chief Alex Ogbonna described Gumi\u2019s advice as condemnable and urged the government to, as a matter of urgency, investigate him.\n\nSetup your own platform that allows you to earn a minimum of \u20a6100,000 daily, payments are in US dollars, 100% legitimate .Click here to start now .\n\n\u201cHe is a security threat to Nigeria because from all indications, he knows and relates with the bandits. Gumi\u2019s position in Nigeria is very clear; he is a security threat. He lives a double life. The one he sees as religious life, that is his public life is completely at variance with his life as an associate of bandits. The government should investigate him and deal with him seriously,\u201d he stated.\n\nFor the president of the Middle Belt Forum (MBF), Dr. Pogu Bitrus, it is unfortunate that a cleric, who is supposed to be showing people the way is the one misleading people.\n\nHe wondered how Gumi expects government to reward criminals who derive pleasure in killing innocent people.\n\n\u201cHow can you reward killers? With whose land and whose money?\u201d he queried.\n\n\u201cThe government should deal with the bandits. If Gumi wants to join them, he is free to do that but no piece of Nigeria\u2019s land will be given to the bandits.\u201d\n\nHe noted that many of the bandits were foreigners and listening to Gumi\u2019s advice would only amount to ceding part of Nigeria to foreigners.\n\n\u201cIt will not happen and I don\u2019t believe this government will tow that line. No wise, sane government will tow that line,\u201d he stated.\n\nProf. Banji Akintoye\u2019s Yoruba self-determination group, Ilano Omo Oodua (IOO) also lashed out at Gumi for his suggestion.\n\nThe group said Gumi is representing an interest and the suggestion has vindicated its position that what is happening in Nigeria is a state-sponsored terrorism.\n\nIOO Media and Publicity Officer, Maxwell Adeleye, wondered why the Federal Government is persecuting Sunday Adeyemo, popularly known Sunday Igboho and other self-determination groups, who neither bear arms nor kill but has refused to arrest and prosecute Gumi who openly associates with terrorists.\n\n\u201cThis is an actual vindication of those of us in Ilano Omo Oodua and Nigerian Indigenous Nationalities Alliance for Self Determination (NINAS) that what is going on in Nigeria is state-sponsored terrorism. We know what Gumi represents; it is clear that he is representing an interest. He has been openly associating with terrorists and posing for pictures with them, yet he is walking the streets free while Sunday Igboho and other self determination groups are languishing in jail. The Niger Delta militants were protesting the degradation of their environment by crude oil spillage that has prevented them from fishing and farming, but what are the so-called bandits protesting for; what are their grievances? These people masquerading as bandits are terrorists, their mission is to make their region ungovernable so that they will be paid part of the crude oil money from the Niger Delta. Their mission is also to hijack the land belonging to the Nigerian people.\u201d\n\nArewa Consultative Forum (ACF) has expressed disappointment over Sheik Ahmad Gumi\u2019s appeal to the federal government that bandits should be set free and be compensated.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of ACF, Emmanuel Yawe told Daily Sun that Islam does not encourage such statement, adding that it is too strange to hear such statement from a Muslim leader.\n\n\u201cWe have never heard such statement from a Muslim, it is un Islamic to call for compensation for those who kill and kidnap innocent citizens.\n\n\u201cHow then do you reward innocent citizens that were killed and kidnapped\u201d. Yawe said.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection. Click here .",

The committee found as a fact that out of a sum of over $22.8billion approved by the National Assembly under the 2016-2018 external borrowing rolling plan, only $2.8 billion, that is 10 per cent has been disbursed to Nigeria.

          "text": "\u2022Confidence in Nigeria\u2019s business environment growing, Says Emefiele\n\n\u2022CBN Governor predicts external reserves to surpass $42bn by mid-2022\n\n\u2022Rabiu seeks measures to fast-track growth, development in Africa\n\nDeji Elumoye in Paris, France\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has painted a rosy picture of Nigeria\u2019s economy saying its outlook\n\nremains bright with sustained investments in infrastructure, particularly in ICT.\n\nHe stressed that Nigeria\u2019s business environment favours global businesses and has a friendly regulatory environment that supports Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs).\n\nBuhari said this while delivering a keynote address yesterday in Paris, France, during the one-day Nigeria International Partnership Forum, with focus on, \u201cBeyond the Pandemic.\u2019.\n\nThis is just as the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, who also spoke at same forum yesterday, disclosed that confidence in the Nigerian business environment was growing due to sustained policy interventions in the economy. Overall, Emefiele said the business confidence index was projected at 37.7 index points in November 2021 and 57.6 index points by mid-2022.\n\nContinuing, President Buhari said the nation\u2019s economy was being re-engineered and re-positioned to be globally more competitive, favouring business and entrepreneurship to drive growth and development.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cFor us in Nigeria, lessons drawn from the pandemic prompted us to redouble efforts to mitigate its socio-economic effects. Despite prevailing uncertainties, our equitable and sustainable reform initiatives resulted in substantial economic gains and steady recovery.\n\n\u201cI can assure you that our administration is on the right path to achieving multi-sectoral progress. We have revitalised the economy by increasing investments in capacity building, health, infrastructure, women\u2019s empowerment, climate change, and food security.\n\n\u201cToday, these actions are yielding self-employment, expanding our human resource pool and strengthening our national productivity for sustainable development.\u201d\n\nThe President assured investors of the country\u2019s willingness to create a win-win at every point.\n\n\u201cI am proud to reiterate our resolve to reduce and ultimately eliminate obstacles to access and retention of FDI. Our investment-friendly policies are backed by the rule of law, practical security policies and a resilient population.\n\n\u201cLet me finally stress that Nigeria is open for partnership and cooperation. I invite the French business community to take advantage of the vast investment opportunities in Africa\u2019s largest economy.\n\n\u201cAs our development partners, rest assured that we will stand together with you throughout our partnership journey to guarantee our mutual interest.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari told a gathering of French and Nigerian businessmen that the government recognised the nation\u2019s risk profile and decided to re-assess and update the National Security Strategy in 2019.\n\n\u201cThe implementation of this multi-sectoral strategy has contributed to the progress we have made in fighting insurgents and terrorists in the north-east of the country. Working closely with international partners, we are firmly addressing the root causes of crimes, and taking measures to prevent and counter violent extremism,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\n\u201cAs I said at the fifth edition of the Future Investment Initiative Summit in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, investing in humanity is investing in our collective survival.\n\n\u201cWith this in mind, we have incorporated the Public-Private Partnership model into our economic recovery plan, to attract private sector participation in the financing and operations of critical economic and social infrastructure. This measure is already helping to mitigate COVID-19 triggered capital flight and decline in grant and development financing.\n\n\u201cAlso, at the just concluded COP26 in Glasgow, I stressed the link between modern infrastructure and the overall economic development of a nation. Hence, the massive infrastructure expansion programme, we have been executing in various sectors since the beginning of this administration. 1.5 trillion Dollars is the cumulative amount estimated to be spent within a period of ten years from 2015,\u201d the president added.\n\nAccording to him, his administration has made significant investments in railways, seaports, roads, renewable energy, housing and many others attractive to prospective investors. He said institutions such as the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority and the recently created Infrastructure Corporation of Nigeria are run as independent world class institutions to support and facilitate investments in the country.\n\nPresident Buhari stressed that opportunities in the mining sector had been expanded, with simplified licensing process, extensive investments in transportation of raw materials, equipment and other mining elements by road and by rail.\n\nAccording to him, to keep the progress in the digital economy, the fastest growing sector in Nigeria in both 2020 and 2021 on track, government recently approved the national policy on Fifth Generation (5G) network.\n\nHe said: \u201cOur ultimate goal is to leverage ICT platforms to spur further investments and create jobs, while diversifying support to other emerging sectors. Already, several foreign investors are taking advantage of our recent ranking as the leading start-up ecosystem in Africa.\n\n\u201cOver a week ago, I launched the eNaira, the electronic version of our national currency. When fully operationalised, this innovation will increase participation in fin-tech within Nigeria, increase efficiency in the banking sector, and boost our capacity to combat illicit flow of funds,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe president said the oil sector was also getting more attention to expand opportunities with the signing of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA).\n\n\u201cOur plan is to increase Liquefied Natural Gas exports and expand our domestic market. Partnerships in textile and leather processing, tourism, and health sectors are also areas we can explore,\u2019\u2019 he further explained.\n\nThe president noted that the agricultural sector, through Anchor Borrowers Programme, provided loans and technical support to small holder farmers, leading to the expansion in the number of rice mills in Nigeria from 10 in 2014 to 40 today.\n\n\u201cThe country has also increased the number of active fertilizer blending plants to more than forty-six, from fewer than five in 2014.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, we have set aside several million hectares of available arable land for agriculture, and have embarked on the creation of Special Agriculture Processing Zones across the country,\u201d he added.\n\nSpeaking further, Emefiele pointed out that headline inflation in the country was also expected to moderate to 15.35 per cent by December 2021 and 14.91 per cent by February 2022, respectively.\n\nSimilarly, he anticipated that core inflation would fall to 13.39 percent in December 2021 from 13.74 per cent in October 2021. \u201cThis is due to the favourable impact of the various CBN and government interventions in the agriculture and the real sector, the moderation of supply side constraints and the gradual increase in domestic economic activity, which is expected to keep prices low in the near-term,\u201d Emefiele told his audience.\n\nHe estimated that Nigeria\u2019s external reserves would surpass $42 billion by mid-2022. This, according to the CBN Governor was due to sustained increase in crude oil price, the impact of Eurobond Issuance, and the stable exchange rate condition.\n\nAccording to Emefiele, the recent launch of the eNaira would improve the conduct of monetary policy in Nigeria, reduce transaction costs and increase financial inclusion in the medium to long term.\n\n\u201cWe expect an increase in the availability of credit through the CBN intervention programmes to increase aggregate demand and stimulate growth in key sectors that face credit constraints.\n\n\u201cWe expect higher revenue due to stronger revenue administration efforts by the fiscal authorities,\u201d he added.\n\nThe CBN Governor reiterated that the take-off of the Dangote refinery and the implementation of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) which were expected to expand the fiscal space of government in the medium to long term, would also boost growth.\n\nIn addition, Emefiele told the gathering of foreign investors and global political leaders and diplomats that improvement in crude oil prices were expected to provide stability to Nigeria\u2019s external reserves and exchange rate.\n\nAs part of efforts to drive the diversification of the Nigerian economy, the CBN said policies had been developed to reduce import of goods that could be produced in the country in order to create employment opportunities for Nigerians, reawaken Nigeria\u2019s manufacturing industry and reposition them for the AFCFTA.\n\nHe pointed out that prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Nigerian economy had been on a positive growth trajectory and had witnessed 12 consecutive quarters of positive growth following the 2016 to 2017 recession, along with significant foreign capital inflows due to improved fundamentals of the economy.\n\nInflation rate rose to 18.17 per cent in March 2021 from 12.12 per cent in January 2020, and external reserves declined to about $34.3 billion in May 2021, from nearly $36.7 billion in January 2020.\n\nAlso then, market turnover on the Investors and Exporters\u2019 window declined significantly too, from an average of $262.3 million daily in 2019, to about $44 million at the height of COVID-19 in the second quarter of 2020.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian economy rebounded after two quarters of contraction. The economy witnessed growth of 0.11 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020 from -3.62 percent in the third quarter of 2020.\n\n\u201cThe non-oil and services sectors were the major contributors to growth in the fourth quarter. Headline inflation rate decreased to 16.63 percent in September 2021 from 18.17 percent in March 2020 and external reserves grew to nearly $41.5 billion.\n\n\u201cThe quick recovery from the recession was due to targeted interventions in the critical sectors of the economy, monetary and exchange rate policies to stabilise exchange rate, the implementation of the Economic Sustainability Plan, and the nationwide improvement in vaccine administration and coverage,\u201d he added.\n\nWhile noting that the immediate effects of COVID-19 in Nigeria was felt through the loss of means of livelihood for many households during the lockdown, Emefiele highlighted various measures the CBN adopted to support households and firms in the wake of the pandemic.\n\nSome of these included creating a N100 billion target credit facility for affected households and small and medium enterprises through the NIRSAL Microfinance Bank; creating a N100 billion intervention fund in loans to support pharmaceutical companies and healthcare practitioners and to expand and strengthen the capacity of our healthcare institutions; creating a N1 trillion facility in loans to boost local manufacturing and production across critical sectors; and creating a research fund, which was designed to support the development of vaccines in Nigeria.\n\nHighlighting the CBN\u2019s medium term policies to tackle COVID-19, he listed some of these to include the granting approval of three payment bank licenses which would accelerate the provision of digital financial services by bank and non-bank institutions and reduce the need for paper money; implementation of the Tertiary Institutions Entrepreneurship Scheme (TIES) to promote entrepreneurial activities and foster job creation among Nigerian youths, and supporting the Auto-Gas Conversion Programme of the federal government.\n\nOn the other hand, he listed the CBN\u2019s long term policies to tackle COVID-19 to include the establishment of the InfraCo to address the funding challenges in financing the development of critical infrastructure which would act as a catalyst for growth in the medium and the long run while providing reasonable returns to investors.\n\nOthers are the planned establishment of the CBN CPP intervention to develop the human capital needed to build capacity in the financial sector.\n\n\u201cThrough this program, the CBN will produce a critical mass of well-educated postgraduate degree holders in the fields of Accounting, Banking and Finance, Business Administration and Economics for the financial services industry, and the Nigerian economy as a whole.\n\n\u201cThe creation of a Central Bank Digital Currency, or the eNaira, to support post COVID economic growth. The eNaira will increase financial inclusion, improve the conduct of monetary policy, and facilitate low-cost and efficient payments.\n\n\u201cThe impact of our policy measures helped to prevent larger GDP contractions in 2020, as projected by analysts. Unfolding developments continue to indicate that the Nigerian economy will achieve strong growth while current inflation trends remain on track towards their desired levels,\u201d he added.\n\nIn his presentation, the Founder/Executive Chairman of the BUA Group, Abdul Samad Rabiu, also called for a three-way partnership between the African private sector, government and finance institutions to fast-track growth and development in Nigeria, and in Africa.\n\nAccording to Rabiu, who is the President of the France Nigeria Business Council, the partnership will identify sustainable solutions to the issues of infrastructure, climate and industrialisation.\n\nSpeaking at the Forum in Paris, France, Abdul Samad Rabiu noted that despite the challenges occasioned by the global pandemic, African governments must work with the private sector across board to develop sustainable policies that will aid investments and innovation while financial institutions must move with the times and come up with more innovative approaches to support growth in the continent.\n\nAccording to Abdul Samad Rabiu, the Nigeria Partnership Forum was timely and a welcome development \u2013 especially for Nigeria and the rest of Africa, in the face of increasing global economic uncertainty and challenges brought about by the latest global pandemic.\n\n\u201cNumerous opportunities for global partnerships exist across Nigeria and Africa. Key amongst this is in the infrastructure space. By increasing our investments in infrastructure, creating access between borders, encouraging the free movement of goods and services under the AfCFTA, and opening up the continent, it is expected that supply chains will become more efficient, trade would be bolstered, new industries and industrial bases will emerge while intra-African integration would be enhanced. All of these will ensure that Nigerians and Africans will be better off.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe also need to see more three-way partnerships between the African private sector, governments and Development Finance institutions to fast-track growth. I believe conversations in this important forum will touch on this topic while also challenging our approach towards the future of Nigeria and the African continent. We can all agree that there are challenges but while they may appear numerous, we cannot give up or choose to remain docile in our bid to accelerate development and innovation,\u201d he added.\n\nThe National Security Adviser to the President, Major General Babagana Monguno (rtd); Nigeria\u2019s Special Envoy on Chad and Lake Chad Basin, Ambassador Babagana Kingibe; Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Ali Pantami; Minister of State, Petroleum, Timipre Sylva; Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama also gave an overview on key sectors of the Nigerian economy.\n\nSome other business leaders from Nigeria at the event included Founder and Chairman of Oriental Energy Resources, Mohammed Indimi; Chairman/Editor-In-Chief of THISDAY Group and Arise News Channel, Nduka Obiagbena; and Founder/Chairman of Zenith Bank, Jim Ovia, Chairman of Heirs Holdings and UBA, Tony Elumelu.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Promises quality leadership\n\n\u2022Defectors have started begging to come back, says Oye\n\n\u2022Buhari to gov-elect: I look forward to working with you\n\n\u2022Fayemi, Saraki, Gbajabiamila, Ozigbo, Ubah, others congratulate winner\n\n\u2022TMG demands improved INEC equipment, end to vote-buying\n\nDeji Elumoye in Paris, Chuks Okocha, Onyebuchi Ezigbo, Udora Orizu in Abuja, Emma Okonji, Nosa Alekhuogie in Lagos, David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka, Hammed Shittu in Ilorin, Emmanuel Ugwu-Nwogo in Umuahia and Victor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti\n\nAnambra State governor-elect and candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Professor Chukwuma Soludo, yesterday unveiled his agenda for the state on the ARISE News Channel, in his first post-victory television interview. Soludo promised to run an all-inclusive government that would focus on problem-solving and value addition to the state.\n\nIn the interview with the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers, shortly after he was declared winner of the governorship election by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) yesterday, Soludo pledged to hit the ground running and demonstrate quality leadership at a fast pace.\n\nHe said he would pursue peace and unite the people in order to bring the much-needed value to the state.\n\nSoludo was declared winner of the November 6 governorship election after polling a total of 112,229 votes to defeat his closest rival, Valentine Ozigbo of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), who scored 53, 807 votes to emerge second. Andy Uba of the All Progressives Congress (APC) got a total of 43,285 votes to emerge third, while Ifeanyi Ubah of the Young Progressives Party (YPP) came fourth with 21,261 votes.\n\nUbah won in one local government, just as Ozigbo, while Soludo won in the remaining 19 local government areas.\n\nThe Returning Officer for the 2021 Anambra State governorship election, Florence Obi, announced the final results in the early hours of Wednesday at the INEC headquarters in Awka.\n\nNot unexpectedly, National Chairman of APGA, Chief Victor Oye, who also spoke on Arise News Channel, said he had started receiving calls from some of those, who had defected to other political parties at the heat of the election, but were now willing to return. Oye said the party would welcome them back if they showed sufficient remorse and true repentance.\n\nMeanwhile, congratulatory messages have begun to pour in for Soludo, with President Muhammadu Buhari, not only congratulating the governor-elect, but also saying he looks forward to working with him in the collective interest of the country.\n\nEkiti State Governor and Chairman of Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), Dr. Kayode Fayemi; former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki; Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila; Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate in the Saturday election, Valentine Ozigbo; and former PDP National Chairman, Uche Secondus, congratulated Soludo for a victory well deserved.\n\nEqually identifying with the former Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), were a former national publicity secretary of the PDP, Chief Olisa Metuh; former presidential hopeful and chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr. Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim; and governorship candidate of Young Progressives Party (YPP), Ifeanyi Ubah, among others.\n\nSimilarly, foremost civil society election observation organisation in Nigeria, the Transition Monitoring Group (TMG), called for improvement of election equipment by INEC, especially, its newly introduced Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS).\n\nInterestingly, Soludo\u2019s victory at the just concluded governorship election reverberated in neighbouring Abia State, with a resurgence of hope among the APGA faithful for electoral ahead of 2023.\n\nSpeaking to his plans for Anambra, Soludo said, \u201cWe have fought a political fight and we have gone to court and now is the time for us to come together to build the state. The incumbent governor wanted me to succeed him among all other contestants, and he worked hard to ensure that APGA won the election.\n\n\u201cNow that APGA has won, and the governor-elect has emerged, it is time for us to work as a political party and also extend our friendship to other party members in the state, in order to build the state.\u201d\n\nHe said anyone willing to support the state would be welcomed, saying, \u201cIt is about bringing value to the people and I will work with those who will bring value to the people, and turn Anambra State into an industrial hub that we all envisage. I will reach out to them in the \u2018Anambra Spirit\u2019 in order to develop the state together.\u201d\n\nAsked about his plan for women and youth representation in his government, Soludo said, \u201cThere will not be a dramatic change in women and youth representation in my government, because I will be focusing on problem solving. If the women and youth show the capacity to deliver, so be it, and I will engage them to deliver on value.\n\n\u201cWhen I was Central Bank Governor, I gave responsibilities that had to do with trust and integrity to the women, and they never disappointed me. Anambra has a youthful population and I will not discriminate between gender in my administration, and, above all, my manifesto is a youthful manifesto.\u201d\n\nSoludo assured the people of Anambra State that anybody with useful values to offer would be engaged to do so.\n\nOn the transition process and how he would run the state after the swearing-in ceremony in March next year, Soludo said he had some experience in governance in the past, having managed huge bureaucracies with six parastatals, long before becoming Governor of CBN.\n\nHe stated, \u201cI have understanding of a few things on how government and institutions work, and the bureaucracy in governance. Again, my governorship will be a continuation of APGA government, so, I expect a very seamless transition process and good governance.\u201d\n\nSoludo said he would not have begrudged anybody if he had lost the election, but would simply have thanked God.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIn 2010, I was conscripted to run for election in Anambra State, and when I lost the election to the former governor, I congratulated him two hours after INEC declared him winner of the election, and I walked away after the thanksgiving service. Also in 2013, I was disqualified from contesting the election under APGA and I did not leave the party because of my disqualification. But I remained in the party and still supported the party.\n\n\u201cI have persevered after loosing election twice in the state, and I believe this is the right time that God Almighty has planned for me to emerge as winner. Now is the time for me to serve the people of the state and I see it as a divine journey for me, and I am grateful to God and to all the people of Anambra State, including the judiciary, and President Muhammadu Buhari.\u201d\n\nThe former CBN governor believed his victory was divine, stressing that he would not be overwhelmed by his triumph at the poll. He said his focus would be the enormity of the work ahead of him as governor.\n\nAsked the possibility of APGA winning elections outside Anambra State and becoming a regional and national political party, he said the name of the party, which was registered since 2002, would continue to speak volumes for the party\u2019s mission of becoming both a regional and national political party.\n\n\u201cThe first election that APGA won was in the South-east, and we will continue to work hard as progressives to stretch our winning strategies to other states across regions,\u201d Soludo said.\n\nOn his part, the APGA national chairman, while speaking on moves by defectors to return to the party, explained, \u201cFor me, people disagree to agree. You mentioned the deputy governor, nobody did anything to him. He just chose to embark on an adventure.\n\n\u201cHe was not denied anything. He had everything he should have. He had everything, but suddenly he jumped out of the team. So, how are you going to blame somebody who jumped out of a 21- storey building?\n\n\u201cWhat do you expect will happen to him? He will crash and end up blaming the building or the builder. All those people that left without justification, they went on sheer adventure, and some of them have been calling to return to the party. For me, they can come back if they show sufficient remorse, because APGA is a party for all of us.\u201d\n\nBuhari to Soludo: Rally stakeholders for transformational leadership\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, while rejoicing with Soludo, enjoined him, as a member of the Presidential Economic Advisory Committee, to rally other stakeholders to tackle the challenges confronting the state and the South-east, in general.\n\nBuhari, in a release by his media adviser, Femi Adesina, added that he looked forward to working with the incoming governor for the peace, security, and development of not only Anambra State, but the entire country.\n\nThe president also praised the security agencies for their determination to ensure that the election went on as smoothly as possible. He commended INEC for the successful conclusion of the exercise, despite the initial challenges encountered.\n\nDemocracy is the real winner \u2013 Fayemi\n\nFayemi said the Anambra election attested to Buhari\u2019s sincerity and commitment to delivery of a free, fair, and credible electoral system. The Ekiti State governor said democracy was the real winner at the Anambra election, with the successful and peaceful conduct of the poll.\n\nIn a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Yinka Oyebode, the governor said the will of the people of Anambra State, expressed through the ballot box, had prevailed. He hailed all stakeholders, including the electorate, INEC, security agencies, election observers, political parties, and their agents for working together to deliver an election devoid of violence.\n\nFayemi praised the people of Anambra State for their perseverance and tenacity in participating in the poll, despite some technical hitches that were recorded, and ensuring that their votes counted.\n\nSaraki: Anambra poll outcome has crucial lessons\n\nSaraki congratulated Nigerians, particularly, the people of Anambra State, for the success of the governorship election. He advised the people not to allow the crucial lessons, which the results of the election signified, to go unnoticed or be ignored.\n\nIn a statement by the head of his media office, Yusuph Olaniyonu, the former senate president commended the stakeholders and others, who initiated and participated in the dialogue that created the peaceful atmosphere for the election.\n\nHe praised the security agencies for the diligence and professionalism displayed by the officers and men on duty. He also lauded INEC for the successful deployment of technology to improve the election process, particularly, the adoption of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) and electronic transmission of results.\n\nSaraki said, in the statement, \u201cThe Anambra State electorate has taught the rest of Nigeria a lesson about the need for people to vote according to their conscience, to conduct polls devoid of violence, and stand firm in defence of our votes.\n\n\u201cAll stakeholders also have to work on the issue of vote-buying. It is a problem, which we must find a solution to, otherwise, it will continue to undermine our democracy. These are some of the lessons from Anambra State, which must not be ignored.\u201d\n\nGbajabiamila: Soludo coming with experience and skill\n\nIn a congratulatory letter to Soludo, Gbajabiamila said with the former CBN governor\u2019s antecedents as an accomplished professional, he believed the Anambra governor-elect would bring his experience and expertise to bear.\n\nGbajabiamila told Soludo in the letter, \u201cYou are taking office at a time of profound challenges and tremendous opportunity in our country. All of us, who hold public office, have an obligation at this moment in history to take active measures, guided by considerations of the best interests of our people, to overcome these challenges and provide conditions for our citizens to thrive.\n\n\u201cYou have in your professional life shown a tremendous capacity for effectiveness; you have demonstrated personal integrity and have already accomplished much more than most can ever hope for. I am confident that you will thrive in this new role, and your service will glorify God and elevate the people of Anambra State and all of Nigeria. I wish you success, and I assure you of my support.\u201d\n\nPDP candidate congratulates Soludo\n\nThe PDP candidate, Ozigbo, in a press statement he personally signed, said he had called and congratulated Soludo on his victory at the poll.\n\nOzigbo stated, \u201cI have just called Professor Chukwuma Soludo and congratulated him on being declared the winner of the Anambra State governorship election, 2021. I wished him well and prayed for his success.\n\n\u201cLet me also use this opportunity to congratulate all the men and women, who contested our dear state\u2019s governorship this year. You all have shown a determination to see that Anambra is better. It was an honour to run this race with you.\u201d\n\nNdi Anambra have spoken, says Metuh\n\nMetuh said, in a statement, \u201cFinally, Ndi Anambra have spoken and their voices were heard loud and clear. They have, through their votes, democratically made their choice of who governs them for the next four years.\n\n\u201cThough the outcome of the election might not have swung the way some individuals, especially, those within the political circles, desired, but Ndi Anambra have spoken and their choice must be respected and accepted.\n\n\u201cIt is on this note that I call on all Ndi Anambra, irrespective of political affiliations, to put politics and issues of the election behind and come together as one people that we are, and join hands with Prof. Soludo to chart a new course for our dear state. I implore contenders, who are hurting over the outcome of the election to sheathe their swords and put aside all personal interests for the sake of Ndi Anambra.\u201d\n\nOlawepo-Hashim: Nigeria is greatest winner\n\nOlawepo-Hashim commended Buhari for creating an atmosphere of non-interference in INEC\u2019s conduct of the election in Anambra State. In a statement by his media assistant, Mr. Segun Abifarin, Olawepo-Hashim said the victory belonged to Anambra and Nigeria, in general.\n\nHe congratulated the \u201ca wonderful person of Anambra State, who against all odds, filed out peacefully and performed their civic responsibilities,\u201d stressing, \u201cOur dear country Nigeria is the biggest winner. Glory to God as the country has again proven prophets of doom wrong.\n\n\u201cAll Nigerians should celebrate this victory. Though my party, APC, did not come top in the final result, we can boast that our government created the atmosphere under which the votes of the electorate are beginning to count.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s democracy in action, says Secondus\n\nSecondus said by Soludo\u2019s victory, the people had spoken and democracy was in action. He said though he had desired his party, PDP, to come out victorious, \u201cas a true democrat, we will always respect the will of the people, where and when it\u2019s allowed to prevail.\u201d\n\nSecondus mocked the All Progressives Congress (APC) for trying to reap where it did not sow in the hope that untoward acts could give them victory.\n\nNLC calls for democratic reforms\n\nIn its congratulatory message, the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) called for deeper reforms to democratise the appointment of the leadership of INEC, establish an Electoral Offences Commission, and the institutionalise proportional representation in Nigeria\u2019s constitution and electoral law.\n\nNLC President, Ayuba Wabba, said Soludo\u2019s victory was a testament to the confidence he enjoyed from majority of Anambrarians, but added that the advocated reforms represented a more sustainable recipe for deepened political process and value-laden democratic outcomes in Nigeria.\n\nAyuba stated, \u201cThis is the hallmark and beauty of democracy. There is no doubt that the consummation of the November 6 governorship election in Anambra State was fraught with anxious moments, as many Nigerians followed the process with bated breath. The thuds of armoured tanks and the echoes of gunshots that trailed the campaign train turned the once peaceful state into a theatre of battles.\n\n\u201cThe dicey security situation was not helped with the agitations of the IPOB, especially, the sit-at-home order which hung a huge blanket of uncertainty over the November 6, 2021 election.\n\n\u201cWe commend the resolve of Anambra people to put the enemies of democracy to shame. Many voters in the state dared the pre-election day violence and showed up on election day to cast their ballot.\u201d\n\nIfeanyi Ubah: I won\u2019t challenge result in court\n\nThe YPP candidate, in a press statement, said, \u201cI have just called the newly elected governor of our dear state, Prof. Chukwuma Charles Soludo, to congratulate him on his victory at the just concluded November 6, 2021 Anambra governorship poll.\n\n\u201cAs a democrat and law-abiding citizen, I wholeheartedly accept the outcome of the election and would like to use this medium to congratulate Prof. Charles Soludo on his victory. It is imperative to state that I do not intend to challenge the electoral results as announced by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) through any court or judicial process.\u201d\n\nTMG tells INEC to improve use of technology\n\nTMG called for the improvement of election equipment, especially, the BVAS. It urged the security agencies to investigate and charge to court all security operatives, who engaged in violation of human rights, and gross misconduct during the election.\n\nChairman of the group, Comrade Auwal Musa Rafsanjani, noted that the pre-election season, which witnessed a lot of violence that marred campaign rallies of the various parties in parts of the state, eventually led to low voter turn out, an omen, he said, was bad for democracy.\n\nRafsanjani said, \u201cThe stand of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and the strong presence of security operatives had an effect on how voters came out to exercise their franchise.\u201d He called on government to stand up to the challenges of insecurity in the country, so that the 2023 election would not witness voter apathy, as was the case in Anambra.\n\nVice Chairman of the group, Mrs. Miriam Menkiti, also lamented the poor performance of the BVAS, which she said frustrated voters across the 21 local government areas of Anambra State.\n\nMenkiti stated, \u201cIt is shocking that despite the consistent statement by INEC that the card readers were all set for the elections, we still witnessed a high rate of poor connection of the BVAS in various part of the state.\n\n\u201cTMG appeals to INEC to live up to the task of providing smooth elections for Nigerians in the 2023 general election, which will be cumbersome and overstretch the electoral umpire.\u201d\n\nSoludo gingers up APGA in Abia\n\nIn nearby Abia State, APGA members saw Soludo\u2019s victory as the sign of a political possibility in the state in 2023. Leader of Abia State chapter of APGA, Hon. Obinna Ichita, told journalists that the party received the outcome of the Anambra poll with great joy and high hope for better things ahead, as the 2023 general election drew near.\n\nIchita stated, \u201cWe (Abians) now know that it is normal to ply on good roads; it is normal to have potable water; it is normal to have quality healthcare services that APGA has provided in Anambra over the years.\u201d\n\nHe said come 2023, Ndi Abia could not afford to continue to entrust their collective destiny to PDP, which had over the past 20 years \u201cproved to be incompetent\u201d.\n\nIchita declared that APGA was a proven credible alternative.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

This investment size is to be contributed by the public sector at N49.7 trillion representing 14.3 per cent and the private sector at N298.3, representing 85.7 per cent.\n\n\u201cAlso the public sector expenditure component of N49.7 trillion will be contributed by the federal government as well as the states.\n\n\u201cThe federal government expenditure component is N29.6 trillion, representing 8.5 per cent of the total expenditure size while the state governments will contribute N20.1 trillion representing 5.8 per cent.\u201d\n\nAccording to her, the funding strategy for the plan had also been identified, which she listed to include broadening the tax base and expanding the capacity of the private sector through creating investment opportunities and delivering quality engagements and incentives.\n\n\u201cAlso exploring domestic and concession financing sources and strengthening and setting up financial investments vehicles and public private partnership as well as the Nigerian investment.\n\n\u201cThe plan requires the establishment of a strong implementation mechanism and framework that promotes performance and accountability which is necessary for the implementation of the plan.\n\n\u201cThere will also be a development plan implementation unit that will report to the National steering committee which will be headed by Vice President with the Ministers of Finance, Budget and National Planning as Vice Chair.\n\n\u201cThe establishment of the plan development implementation will be in the planning arm of the ministry to ensure that the ministries, departments and agencies, state governments and private sector organisations are all working in a coordinated fashion.\n\n\u201cThe plan also has a specific concentration to deliver within the five year period and immediately we get this plan launched, we\u2019ll be continuing to work on Nigeria Agenda 2050. And this is to make sure we don\u2019t have a crisis going forward.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking on the NDP, Minister of State for National Planning, Clement Agba, said in coming up with the NDP, government took into consideration the criticisms that trailed the EPRG including the fact that it was not inclusive enough.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cOne of the downsides that we learnt from the ERGP or complaints that came from people was that: it wasn\u2019t inclusive enough, it wasn\u2019t participatory enough, and that people saw it as a federal government plan.\n\n\u201cSo, deliberately, for this National Development Plan 2021-2025, the issue of no one being left behind was key. We have to make sure it\u2019s national enough. That is to say that it should be prepared by federal government, state governments, local governments, and more importantly, the organised private sector.\n\n\u201cThat is why in terms of governance structure that was approved by Mr. President, we have two co-chairs. One is from the private sector, Mr Atedo Peterside, and one from the public sector, my sister, Dr Zainab Ahmed.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire disclosed that FEC approved contracts worth about N1.264 billion for projects in Federal Medical Centre, Katsina and Uthman Dan Fodio University, Sokoto.\n\nAccording to him, the council approved the procurement of an oncology and radiotherapy centre for the medical centre to be able to handle cancer cases.\n\nHe said council approved that the linear accelerator and the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) machine at the University of Sokoto be replaced.\n\n\u201cThe FEC today considered three memos from the Ministry of Health, and all of them were in respect of procurements. First was the memo from the Federal Medical Centre, Katsina for an oncology and radioterapy center, to be able to handle cancer cases.\n\n\u201cThe projected award was to a company for N1,023,500,668:86\n\nfor the completion period of 42 weeks and is going to be executed by a Nigerian company.\n\n\u201cThe second memo was for reequipping Usman Danfodio University which is one of our centres of excellence for managing cancer also.\n\n\u201cThe equipment are old and broken down. The most important one which is linear accelerator which is going to be replaced and the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) machine which will also be replaced.\n\n\u201cThe MRI at the cost of N440,484,984.32 to replace the old dis-functional one and a linear accelerator at N887,690,000 from special intervention fund. For the MIR is from budget appropriation.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

See Also Breaking News EXCLUSIVE: Yoruba Freedom Fighter, Sunday Igboho Arrested in Cotonou\n\nHe was, however, nabbed by security operatives in the neighbouring country.\n\nMeanwhile, the Nigerian government assembled at least six lawyers at the Cour De\u2019Appel De Cotonou, Benin Republic, in a bid to secure the extradition of the Yoruba Nation agitator.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that the lawyers, both French and English speaking, however, failed to convince the court after a 13-hour trial as to why Igboho should be extradited.\n\n\u201cThe court session took no less than 13 hours because of frequent breaks in-between. Also, the Beninese court system is different from the system of law in Nigeria. See Also Breaking News BREAKING: Benin Republic Court Declines Extradition Of Sunday Igboho To Nigeria, Orders Him To Remain In Cell\n\n\u201cNigerian courts have an adversarial system of justice but Benin Republic has an inquisitorial system; a justice system in which the judge takes the matter on himself to inquire like an investigator, asking questions and probing the two parties,\u201d a legal source said.\n\n\u201cSo, the court was actually investigating the three main allegations brought against Igboho by the Federal Government of Nigeria which claimed that Igboho was a gun runner, a terrorist and a criminal who wanted to divide Nigeria. All these could not be proven by the lawyers,\u201d the source said\n\nThe Yoruba Nation agitator is still facing trial in the Republic of Benin as his lawyers continue to battle the West African nation\u2019s government for his release.

          "title": "Exclusive: Meta\u2019s VP MEA and Turkey on Facebook\u2019s transition into the metaverse",
          "text": "At the end of October, social media giant, Facebook, changed its company to Meta. The announcement was made in an hour-long video that explained the company\u2019s decision to shift gears away from being known as just a social media company and focus on building the metaverse.\n\nLeading that work in Africa is Derya Matras, Vice President (VP), Middle East, Africa (MEA) and Turkey, Meta.\n\nPrior to her appointment as VP in August, Matras was the Managing Director for the MEA and Turkey region. Before that, she was Country Director for Facebook in Turkey for four years. Derya holds a BSc in electronics engineering from Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i University, Istanbul, Turkey, and an MBA from Columbia Business School.\n\nOver email, Matras talked to TechCabal about Facebook\u2019s rebrand to Meta and how it plans to make money from the metaverse and deal with the challenges that come with building it.\n\nHow is the Metaverse better than Facebook in its current form?\n\nWhen Facebook launched in 2004, it changed the way people connect. Apps like Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp further empowered billions around the world\u2014and we are not turning away from these existing products. Those experiences are going to form a crucial part of the future metaverse ecosystem. The Facebook app is still going to be called Facebook.\n\nThe name Meta is a clear link to our vision for the metaverse. However, the metaverse will exist, whether Meta is there or not. So, Meta means us moving beyond 2D screens towards immersive experiences like augmented and virtual reality, to help build the next evolution in social technology. This is a natural evolution for our company as social media and technology evolves.\n\nWhat demographic is the metaverse targeting in Africa?\n\nGiven all that the metaverse has to offer, there\u2019s a lot at stake in making sure its possibilities are open to everyone and not just people from traditionally underrepresented groups. An inclusive metaverse benefits everyone.\n\nIs Facebook building the metaverse because it\u2019s best positioned to build something that\u2019s inevitable?\n\nIn recent decades, technology has given people the power to connect and express themselves more naturally. We started with websites, then we got phones with cameras, and then the internet became more visual and mobile. As connections got faster, video became a richer way to share experiences. If you look back over time, we\u2019ve gone from desktop to web to mobile; from text to photos to video. Now we are looking at what comes next. The metaverse will feel like a hybrid of today\u2019s online social experiences, sometimes expanded into three dimensions or projected into the physical world. It\u2019s the next evolution in a long line of social technologies, and it\u2019s ushering in a new chapter for our company.\n\nIn Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s letter, he mentioned that the \u201cmetaverse will not be created by one company\u201d. Does this mean there\u2019ll be other metaverses outside of Facebook\u2019s metaverse and that they can all exist side by side without Facebook trying to be the only metaverse out there?\n\nThe metaverse isn\u2019t a single product that one company can build. Its success depends on building robust interoperability across services, so different companies\u2019 experiences can work together. And it won\u2019t be built overnight. Many of these products will only be fully realised in the next 10-15 years. While that\u2019s frustrating for those of us eager to dive right in, it gives us time to ask difficult questions about how they should be built. We\u2019ll work with experts in government, industry and academia to think through issues and opportunities in the metaverse.\n\nWe also need to involve human and civil rights communities from the start to ensure these technologies are built in a way that\u2019s inclusive and empowering.\n\nAcross Africa, we\u2019re supporting Africa No Filter, Electric South and Imisi 3D to support creators who have been pushing the boundaries of digital storytelling using immersive technology to amplify African voices.\n\nIs there the potential for other applications and programmes to be built in the metaverse\u2014similar to the blockchain.\n\nWe are at the very start of this. A lot of the technology and infrastructure still needs to be built. It will take at least 5 to 10 years for this vision of the metaverse to come to life. This pace is going to be dictated less by business interests and more by technological realities. Infrastructure needs to be transformed with new technologies, hardware and cooling specifications to be able to support a robust service. And new hardware still needs to be built, including things like hologram displays, projectors, batteries, radios, custom silicon chips, cameras, speakers, and sensors to map the world around you and more.\n\nWhy should Facebook build this? Why not another company?\n\nThis was an important step for us to take on our journey, and as we evolve to Meta, we hope this will better reflect where we are going as a company. Like all businesses, we continue to innovate so that we can bring value to people\u2019s lives.\n\nWe are a social company with investments in technology, like VR; and the metaverse is the next frontier of virtual digital connection\u2014so it\u2019s a natural evolution for our business. But it\u2019s important to reiterate that Meta is neither going to build, own, or run the metaverse on its own. This isn\u2019t going to be a Meta product.\n\nBuilding this will be more like how the internet came about rather than how one app was launched. That\u2019s why we will be collaborating at every stage with other companies, developers, experts, and policymakers. Principles of privacy, safety, and security need to be built in from the start. If we have the principles right, then as a society, we will be better at tackling new challenges with these technologies as they arise.\n\nThe transition to communication via the metaverse will face some challenges considering that it\u2019s not just another app on the mobile phone. What challenges does Facebook expect to encounter in rolling out the metaverse in Africa?\n\nNew innovations bring new challenges, and there\u2019s lots we need to figure out. But that\u2019s why we\u2019re starting this conversation early. We have to be responsible in our approach, and we intend to do that in a number of ways:\n\nNo surprises: In the past, the speed with which new technologies have emerged has sometimes left policymakers and regulators playing catch-up. We don\u2019t want this to happen this time around. A core principle is going to be \u201cdon\u2019t surprise people\u201d. That\u2019s why we are having this conversation out in the open, way in advance of all these technologies being launched.\n\nCollaboration: Partnering with independent experts and organisations will be a crucial part of how we navigate future challenges. We have already launched a two-year $50 million investment in programmes and external research, collaborating with industry partners, civil rights groups, governments, non-profits, and academic institutions to get input as we build these technologies responsibly. This is alongside being a founding member of the XR Association (XRA), which is committed to helping build responsible XR, which includes virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality, and future immersive technology.\n\nBuilt-in: While we will need to continue to get better at anticipating risks, we won\u2019t be able to see around every corner. That\u2019s why the principles of privacy, safety, and security need to be built in from the start.\n\nFacebook plans to spend ~$10 billion this year on the metaverse project\u2014and even more in the coming years. How will the company make money from this?\n\nIt\u2019s very early, and our focus today is more around building the foundational pieces for the metaverse, like VR, and bringing more people into those experiences. We outlined a few areas during Connect where we think there is an opportunity around commerce. We want to help provide tools for creators and developers so they can build a meaningful business in the metaverse because we think digital commerce will become increasingly important.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that investing in the metaverse also means additional resources invested in issues like safety and security. For example, the $10 billion investment in Reality Labs that we have already announced will include spending on research to better understand how we can responsibly tackle safety and integrity challenges in the metaverse.\n\nAnd, just like the rest of the internet, we expect that free things in the metaverse would likely be powered by ads while there would also be paid experiences that are ad-free.\n\nThis is a very long-term vision. It\u2019s going to take investment over many years before the metaverse reaches scale.\n\nLately, fingers have been pointed at Facebook for inciting civil unrest in Africa and being ill-equipped to staff its Africa offices to properly regulate posts. How does Facebook plan to build the metaverse responsibly?\n\nEvery day, our teams have to balance protecting the ability of billions of people to express themselves openly with the need to keep our platform a safe and positive place. We continue to make significant improvements to tackle the spread of misinformation and harmful content. To suggest we encourage bad content and do nothing is just not true.\n\nWe are on track to spend over $5 billion on safety and security in 2021 alone and have 40,000 people working on these issues, including 15,000 people who review content in more than 70 languages.\n\nHow we build is as important as what we build. And we will be collaborating at every stage\u2014with other companies, developers, experts and policymakers\u2014to make sure that what we build is good for the world.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to secure funding for your early-stage startup in Africa",
          "text": "This article was contributed to TechCabal by Ayobami Olajide and Ayobamigbe Teriba. Ayobami and Ayobamigbe work with Ingressive Capital, a venture capital firm that writes up to $400K cheques to early-stage startups.\n\nYou\u2019re a startup founder. You have overcome every self-doubt standing in the way of you launching out; you have invested painstaking hours in defining your idea and building out your solution. You are convinced your solution is what the market needs.\n\nDefinitely, without your solution in the market, the total user experience will be a notch lower. Now there\u2019s only so much you can do with your resources; you need some capital injection to supercharge your operations and expand into new markets. You are thinking of raising capital, but you\u2019re unsure of which is easier: meeting and convincing investors or getting a donkey to pass through a needle\u2019s eye?\n\nThe truth is, there has been an influx of investors and investment activity on the continent. Disrupt Africa reported a 68.4% jump in the number of investors in 2020 (370 investors) from 2019\u2019s reported number of 261 investors. This figure still doesn\u2019t capture in totality the number of angels involved in these deals. Three hundred and ninety-seven companies secured $701.5 million in investment in 2020. By the first half of 2021, African startups had raised $1.19 billion based on an index from Maxime Bayen. Nigeria, Egypt, South Africa and Kenya trapped most of the capital flowing into the continent. Long story short, the uptrend continues, meaning there\u2019s capital for you.\n\nHow can you partake of this money rain?\n\nWhat are you building?\n\nCapital activities always follow momentum, simply put, FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). Sometimes it may be geographical (Egypt, Latin America, etc). Other times, it\u2019s sector-based: Fintech has been of serious obsession with venture capitals (VCs) and even institutions. Investors typically depend on signals like increased liquidity events in a particular geography or sector to plug into the next big thing.\n\nFor startups operating in the middle of the current market obsession, like BNPL and other startups in the fintech spectrum, it may be relatively easier to raise money than others. Well, there are thematic funds that cater to startups in specific sectors.\n\nWho should you be talking to?\n\nAt the initial stage of your company, you should connect more with other founders building infrastructure for what you are building. Also, you need to prioritise taking feedback from customers you are serving in a bid to achieve product-market fit (PMF). Once PMF is achieved, your startup should begin to see some traction.\n\nAccelerators\n\nYou can then consider applying to startup accelerators. Startup accelerators like Y Combinator and TechStars have become incredible partners to the growth of the African startup ecosystem. Y Combinator, for example, boasts of backing up to 15 African startups per batch. Edtech startups can consider applying to Injini; fintechs can apply to the African Fintech Foundry. Of general interest can be Google for Startups, Antler, xx.team, and the like.\n\nEven if you can\u2019t get into an accelerator, you can simulate an accelerator experience for yourself by talking to founders building global solutions in your space. We see this with Shola Akinlade of Paystack\u2019s engagement with Stripe leading to its eventual acquisition for $200 million. Engaging global founders is important in the sense that it would help you develop a local playbook based on global perspectives. Also, it puts you on their radar for investment opportunities from their corporate vehicle or angel checks from the founder.\n\nVenture Capital Firms\n\nWhile a lot of founders defer to this as a first option, it is important to note that VC engagement must be precluded by traction recorded in your startup, e.g., Trade Depot and its founders scaled the venture to a good traction point. VCs are unlikely to invest in idea-stage startups. For example, Ingressive Capital\u2019s investment criteria only caters for post-launch and post-revenue startups. The same goes for a number of VC firms in the ecosystem.\n\nAs a founder, it is important to familiarise yourself with the theses of venture capital firms you want to approach. Here are those of Future Africa and Ingressive Capital. You may get pointers for fit between the VC firm and your startup through a thesis alignment check or examine previous round announcements to see the kind of firms and the stage that VC firm typically invests in.\n\nYou can also evaluate your startup-VC fit based on the value-add they bring to your company beyond money. You must ask if they offer portfolio company support, follow-on investments or referrals, strategic market access, etc.\n\nYou can get the attention of VCs through their online events majorly co-hosted by the general partners of the fund\u2014Is My Idea Fundable? with FirstCheck Africa, Let\u2019s Talk with Microtraction), Invest in the Future with Future Africa), and How I Got Funded (Ingressive Capital).\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nHow should you, and other founders, navigate the capital sourcing process?\n\nInteracting with investors need not inspire fear, provided that you are ready. First, it is necessary to engage and interact with investors to create a human connection. Investors invest in persons they are familiar with.\n\nIt is important to get your pitch ready. Vary your pitch to include a one-liner, an elevator pitch and an extensive one, with the aid of a deck. Your investment pitch deck should address the pivotal questions of the problem, why the problem matters, your solution, and the market opportunity (total addressable market).\n\nFurthermore, your pitch should emphasise how your solution measures against current market players. To achieve this, dedicate a section to competitive analysis in terms of product offerings and pricing.\n\nInvestors are often regarded as catalysts not creators. They use capital to supercharge your operations and help you achieve scale. It is important to show traction you have recorded in terms of user growth and financials tracked month-on-month (MoM) or quarterly growth for startups less than a year or year-on-year for older startups.\n\nHave a data room where investors can easily access your financial records, financial forecasts, incorporation documents, product demos, team bio and pitch deck. Fundraising is often a nerve-racking period in a founder\u2019s journey but it can prove to be very definitive. Founders must be willing to go all out and give it all it takes. As the legendary Yoda said, \u201cDo or do not. There is no try.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "With the adoption of blockchain and the tech it creates, crypto has given rise to exciting innovations like non-fungible tokens (NFT), decentralised finance (DeFi) and decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs).\n\nEmerging economies have experienced an explosion in the adoption of crypto and blockchain technology, but a new startup wants to bring more people into the fold by lowering the barrier for entry.\n\nThe brainchild of Taiwo Orilogbon and Yele Bademosi, Nestcoin is a parent company that wants to create crypto-native products beyond trading and investments, with a focus on driving the adoption of crypto in Africa.\n\nImage source: Nestcoin\n\nNestcoin wants to help Nigerians first, then other Africans, \u201cexit the status quo\u201d by offering them access to wealth using crypto technology or elements of web 3.0 like NFT, DAOs and DeFi.\n\nIt wants to do this through its media publication, Breach, and other products that use crypto technology\u2014spanning across DeFi, media, digital art and gaming.\n\n\u201cThe products we build are tools of individual freedom and creative expression,\u201d said Bademosi in a call with TechCabal.\n\nTapping into Africa\u2019s deepening crypto culture\n\nBademosi and Taiwo\u2019s ambition is rooted in their rich history in Africa\u2019s crypto space. While Taiwo is a former Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of Bundle Africa, a Nigerian crypto exchange, Bademosi has been investing in crypto companies since 2017. He was among the earliest investors in Nigerian crypto exchange, Buycoins, which is now under a new parent company, called Helicarrier.\n\nBefore Nestcoin, Bademosi was a former director at Binance\u2019s venture capital programme. In 2019, he got seed funding from the same programme to launch a payment app in Nigeria, Bundle.\n\nAt Bundle, Bademosi said he realised the entry point is the same as the ceiling when interacting with crypto in Nigeria: trading it. So, he set out to create innovative products beyond this ceiling.\n\nBut before Binance Labs, he\u2019d begun his career in venture capital as the founding partner at Microtraction, one of the most active investors in African early-stage startups now.\n\nUsing education to drive up crypto adoption\n\nAfrica is the fastest adopter of cryptocurrency among the regions, according to a survey by Chainalysis, a US-based research institute. Chainalysis estimates that African countries collectively received around $105.6 worth of cryptocurrency between July 2020 and June 2021. This represents a 1,200% growth. Despite this, however, Africa is still the smallest crypto economy of all the regions, the institute studied. Africa received just 3% of the total value of crypto in the world.\n\nCiting data from crypto exchange, Luno, that 55% of Nigerians do not use crypto because they don\u2019t understand it, Bademosi admitted that crypto is still confusing to a lot of people.\n\n\u201cSo, we\u2019re trying to close that information gap in terms of trying to make crypto more relatable and familiar,\u201d Bademosi said.\n\nImage source: Nestcoin\n\nAs part of efforts to drive crypto adoption using education, Nestcoin is setting up Breach to create content that explains complex crypto topics like DeFi, Blockchain, DAOs, DApps, NFTs and more to novices.\n\nBreach, officially launched today, is a platform that uses newsletters and blog posts to make easily digestible content that will help everyone make sense of the crypto world. Spearheaded by media analyst and former head of communications at Eko Atlantic City, David Adeleke, who will now be managing editor for Breach and communication lead for Nestcoin, Breach intends to make crypto mainstream and help people jumpstart their crypto careers.\n\nIncentivising the crypto community\n\nNestcoin wants to create a community of users that understands crypto, as a way to make their lives easier. Nestcoin will then harness the power of this community to create new products and embark on projects that can generate revenue. \u201cIt\u2019s a community that we want to incentivise and reward for their participation,\u201d Bademosi said.\n\nNestcoin is also creating avenues for users to make money by getting them to play games on the blockchain and invest in digital art.\n\n\u201cThe community will be able to play crypto games that have the potential of helping them earn more than in their day jobs,\u201d Bademosi said.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It\u2019s called Kifta Technologies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKifta Technologies creates cutting-edge defence technology used by private entities and countries globally.\n\nIt makes smart glasses that can identify who you\u2019re looking at and even tell you if they\u2019re a wanted criminal.\n\nInterestingly, the company is the brainchild of a Nigerian textile merchant, Monsuru Anifowoshe.\n\nAfter several cases of stolen, intercepted and even vanished textile containers travelling from Lagos to Kano, Anifowoshe decided to build drones that\u2019ll make sure his containers arrived at their destinations safely.\n\nHardware is hard. However, Anifowoshe is making it work somehow. Kifta\u2019s first Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) prototype cost $450,000 to build, easily a pre-seed raise for a software company in Nigeria.\n\nEmmanuel Paul visited Kifta Technologies HQ and dished all about the gadgets here: Nigeria\u2019s Kifta Technologies produces smart glasses, other cutting edge defence tech for companies and countries worldwide.\n\nOr you can jump straight to the video here.\n\nEquity-free financing by Lendable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to funding, there are two ways to do it. You either give up some shares in your company or get a loan and pay it back later. The former \u2014 a popular option in the startup space \u2014 is equity financing, while the latter is debt financing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLendable, a UK-based debt financing company, typically gives startups between $5 million and $10 million in debt financing. However, it doesn\u2019t finance startups in the idea stage, only those with a proven product that needs to kick things up a notch.\n\nLendable shared how they invest, some of their biggest funding stories, and missed opportunities with Techpoint Africa\u2019s Chimgozirim Nwokoma.\n\nYou can read all about it here: How UK-based debt financing company, Lendable, is providing equity-free financing for African startups.\n\nRabbit\u2019s $11m pre-seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRabbit team. Sourece: TechCrunch\n\nThe grocery delivery business in Egypt seems to be getting a lot of attention lately. Last week, Breadfast and Appetito bagged $26 million and $2 million, respectively.\n\nThis week, it\u2019s RabbitMart, aka Rabbit\u2019s turn. The startup raised a massive pre-seed round of $11 million.\n\nWho invested? Per TechCrunch, the record-breaking pre-seed saw investments from Global Founders Capital and Goodwater Capital, among others.\n\nInterestingly, Rabbit was founded in June 2021 but just came out of stealth in October.\n\nUnlike players like Breadfast and Appetito, Rabbit says it will set itself apart by letting the market call the shots. According to its CEO, Ahmad Yousry, Rabbit, \u201cwe\u2019re going to let the market dictate what we sell. We\u2019re not limiting ourselves as a grocery player.\u201d\n\nThe company employs an Amazonesque system to fulfil orders in 20 minutes. It has a large warehouse in addition to fulfilment centres to speed up delivery.\n\nThe startup plans to add more fulfilment centres in major cities across Egypt over the next year.\n\nFlutterwave acquires Disha\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, November 10, 2021, African payments startup, Flutterwave, announced its acquisition of Disha, a platform for creators to curate their content and receive payment.\n\nDisha, which has about 20,000 users globally, was on the brink of shutting down in February 2021 but told users in a tweet that it was \u201cconsidering new options for our company and will share an update as soon as we have made a resolution.\u201d\n\nFounded by former Cregital CEO, Evans Akanno, Rufus Oyemade and Blessing Abeng in 2019, most of the platform\u2019s users were based in the UK, US and Europe. However, it only generated a little over $1000 monthly, according to TechCrunch.\n\nWhat does this acquisition mean for Disha? Flutterwave will provide the platform with a new payout and collection solution to help users receive payments from audiences globally.\n\nWhile Flutterwave makes it easier for creators to receive payments, the acquisition is also a way to invest in a global creator market estimated at $104.2 billion.\n\nMFS Africa raises $100m Series C\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDare Okoudjou (Founder and CEO, MFS Africa).

          "text": "One of the greatest investors of all time, Peter Lynch, once said, \u201cInsiders might sell their shares for a number of reasons, but they buy them for only one: they think the price will rise.\u201d\n\nThat is the case for some Nigerian companies where insiders from parent companies to directors are buying their stocks that have been undervalued for over two years now due to broader concerns about the economy and foreign exchange accessibility.\n\nNestle SA, Stanbic Africa Holdings and a non-executive director at Access Bank are some of the insiders who have bought substantial shares in their companies this year.\n\n\u201cThe insiders buying the shares of these companies are doing so because they feel the stocks are undervalued,\u201d says Johnson Chukwu, CEO of Lagos-based asset management firm, Cowry Assets.\n\nSuch actions are sometimes a pointer for investors that there is value in a company since the insiders have more information than an outsider, according to Wale Okunrinboye, head of investment research at pension fund manager, Sigma Pensions.\n\nThe Switzerland-based Nestl\u00e9 S.A, majority shareholder in fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) company, Nestl\u00e9 Nigeria plc, has bought nearly N20 billion worth of the Nigerian unit\u2019s shares this year alone.\n\nThe latest deal was on November 4, when it acquired 63,077 units of Nestle Nigeria shares at N1,400 for N88 million.\n\nNestle has managed to stay profitable amid a challenging operating environment where purchasing power is low and operational costs are rising.\n\nThe FMCG company made sales worth N90.15 billion in the third quarter of 2021, a 25.7 percent increase compared to last year.\n\nCost of sales may have risen 30 percent to N55.29 billion but profit after tax was up 17 percent to N11 billion. For the nine-month period, Nestle\u2019s revenue was up 23 percent to N261 billion from N212 billion in 2020, while profit after tax rose 5 percent to N33 billion.\n\nRead Also: Nigerian stocks lag peers as investors worry over economy\n\nNestle\u2019s shares have not however reflected the company\u2019s resilient financial performance this year, with its share price down by 6 percent since the start of the year.\n\nStanbic Africa Holdings, a majority shareholder in Stanbic IBTC Bank, has also been busy mopping up undervalued shares of the lender. The financial holding company has bought N1.48 billion worth of Stanbic IBTC shares in the last two months alone. The buying activity started on September 14, as reported by the lender.\n\nStanbic\u2019s profit after tax in the first nine months of 2021 fell 40 percent compared with last year, due to a mixture of lower trading income and higher operating costs, even though its net interest income beats expectations.\n\nThe lender\u2019s return on average equity of 14 percent still however remains well above the industry average of 8 percent in the period.\n\nAnother bank that has attracted the interest of an insider in recent times is Access Bank. Okey Nwuke, one of the bank\u2019s non-executive directors, bought N13.9 million worth of Access Bank shares on November 3, according to data obtained from the Nigerian Exchange Group. This adds to the 1.3 million shares that Nwuke bought in May.\n\nAccess Bank\u2019s profit after tax in the first nine months of 2021 (N122bn) was higher than its entire profit in 2020 (N106bn). Interest income grew by 24 percent to N395 billion in the nine-month period from N318 billion last year while its earnings per share climbed by 19 percent, a sign that it delivered greater value to investors.",

          "text": "For Charles Chukwuma Soludo of the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA), it is time for victory dance as victory songs rent the air. He had, for several weeks, traversed the length and breadth of Anambra State, soliciting the people\u2019s votes and enunciating value propositions for the state.\n\nSoludo, by his victory, has become the second CBN governor to be elected governor of a state.\n\nThe first was Clement Nyong Isong, banker and politician, who was governor of the CBN in 1967 during the military regime of General Yakubu Gowon.\n\nIsong was later elected governor of Cross River State (1979\u20131983) in the Nigerian Second Republic.\n\nThe level of confidence reposed in Soludo can be seen in the comment by Okey Ikechukwu, executive director, Development Specs Academy, who said he was going to bring to Anambra a new paradigm, capacity, and international exposure.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t imagine Soludo would get into anything and wants to do badly. No,\u201d Ikechukwu said.\n\nDuring the run-up to the election, Peter Obi, a former governor of the state, had advised the people on the imperative of electing the best person for the job.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe see how a state that was truly the \u2018Light of the Nation,\u2019 once referenced as the best in terms of virtually all developmental index, has gone back to its previous notoriety as \u2018Home for All\u2019 and is once again referenced for all the bad reasons. If we continue on this trajectory, it will sound the final death knell for our dear state.\u201d\n\nRead Also: My election victory for Anambra people \u2013 Soludo\n\nThere is no doubt that the Anambra people have heeded the advice by giving their mandate to Professor Soludo, even though Obi may have been campaigning for the candidate of his own party.\n\nSoludo\u2019s manifestos were neither muddled up as have been the case with many politicians\u2019 propositions, which usually fail to see the light of day after the victory song must have been sung.\n\nHe presents a cost for his plan and a realistic argument on how he intends to achieve his plan. He estimates the government\u2019s direct investment in his plan to be between N200 and N250 billion per annum.\n\nIf this is compared with Anambra\u2019s proposed N141.9 billion budget for 2022, it becomes clear that the incoming Soludo administration needs innovative means to shore up revenue.\n\nApart from making revenue collection more efficient and ICT-driven, Soludo proposes other sources of funds for projects \u2013 i.e. from Private Public Partnership (PPP) initiatives and from Development Finance Institutions (DFIs).\n\nIn Nigeria, there is a wide gulf between campaign promises and performance in office. Experience has shown that many politicians and political parties discard their manifestos as soon as they get into office.\n\nSome even begin to deny ever making some promises. Nigerians have also heard some politicians say that they never made any personal promise but their party, and so they were not under any compulsion to fulfill such promises.\n\nIt is expected that Soludo will not join that pack and that he will deliver on his 72-page manifesto, which was his mantra as he cruised across the state soliciting for the people\u2019s votes.\n\nHe promised to change, develop, boost and transform Anambra State from a dominantly informal commercial state to a formal, productive, and competitive economy.\n\nHe said that such a feat would be achieved on the back of rapid industrialization, agriculture, commerce, entertainment/leisure and the creative industry, technology and innovation, solid minerals, and oil and gas.\n\nThe governor-elect also plans to work with the Federal Government on state security and provision of adequate logistics and material support to security agencies in the state, support law enforcement agencies in the state with infrastructure, surveillance, and communications tools to enhance their capacity to safeguard lives and property.\n\nThe Professor said he would reinforce the capability of the existing security system through employment and equipment of more personnel, training, and retraining of vigilante officers to improve their effectiveness, partner with security agencies towards the eradication of violence, crimes, drug usage, fraud, and all deviant behaviors.\n\nHe also promised to ensure more active participation of women at all levels of decision-making and governance at the community, local government, and state government levels.\n\nPart of his manifesto is to strengthen MSME funding programs through the Anambra State Small Business Agency (ASBA) aimed at providing funding and capacity-building assistance for vulnerable groups and women.\n\nThe creation of specific programs to empower women-owned businesses and enterprises and also seek partnerships and funding from direct investments to support these businesses were all contained in his document.",

          "text": "The need to feed the country\u2019s large and growing population as well as provide jobs for the over 23 million unemployed Nigerians are the top reasons investors find the agribusiness and power sectors most suitable for impact investments.\n\nAccording to Wale Adeosun, CEO of Kuramo Capital, there is over $270 trillion worth of global commercial capital out there, and if Nigeria can go where the money is and get 1 percent of the capital, it will be able to address most of the funding needs.\n\n\u201cI think wherever there is a hard problem there is opportunity to make an impact, and so power and agribusiness are a priority,\u201d Mezuo Nwuneli, managing partner at Sahel Agribusiness Managers Limited said at the fourth IIF Annual Convening on Impact Investing.\n\nNwuneli said his company was largely focused on agribusiness because that is where they make their mark and for many different reasons \u2013 food security.\n\n\u201cHow do you match the problem with the opportunity \u2013 we have a very large population that is going to add close to 70 million people in the next 10 years. How are we going to feed these people?\u201d he asked.\n\nRead Also: Nigeria stock market sheds N12bn as investors sell for profit\n\nNigeria\u2019s post-harvest food loss, estimated to be worth over $1 billion per year, is one of the factors responsible for the country\u2019s food insecurity. In sub-Saharan Africa, the post-harvest losses should be enough to feed at least 48 million individuals, according to a 2019 Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) report.\n\nAccording to the Nigerian government, Nigeria needs at least $1.5 trillion over 10 years to achieve an appreciable level of the national infrastructure stock.\n\n\u201cPower and agribusiness are the top sectors we\u2019ll want to invest in. Food security is key and they both create jobs,\u201d Adeosun said, adding that all the value chains of agribusiness have huge prospects for impact investment potential and \u201cpower, which is obviously, where we are big on.\u201d\n\nExplaining that his company invests in Nigeria\u2019s power industry as it creates jobs, Adeosun said during a panel session with the title \u2018Identifying and Unlocking Impact Potentials in Nigerian Enterprises\u2019 that his company \u201cprovides electricity that powers pretty most of the water consumed in Lagos.\u201d\n\nFor Nigeria to lift millions of its population out of extreme poverty, the most populous nation in Africa would need to first fix its power sector that has left about 120 million people with less than an hour\u2019s supply of electricity, according to industry analysts.\n\nAn electricity tariff that is cost-reflective and free of any form of subsidy is one of the first steps to achieving a steady power supply, the Nigeria Economic Summit Group said.\n\nAccording to AIION, an independent company funded by Royal Dutch Shell, about 120 million Nigerians do not have access to electricity or have less than four hours.\n\nThis translates to 14.2 million households and 4 million SMEs who do not have access to electricity (currently off-grid) in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe way I think about it is that there are some basic needs required to be alive and that includes food, water and housing, and the others,\u201d Nneka Eze, managing director of VestedWorld, said while explaining what impact investment meant.\n\nAcknowledging the fact that many areas need impact investment in Nigeria, Eze said \u201cagribusiness is top on the list,\u201d not just \u201cbecause of my experience but because it is critical for food security.\u201d\n\nAccording to industry players, the absence of high-quality investment opportunities with a good track record in the country is one of the reasons Nigeria lacks the much-needed impact investments.\n\nImpact investors have diverse criteria for selecting projects. So, failure to meet these criteria might deny a firm of impact investing alliance.\n\nLargely driven by two major criteria, impact investors consider the goals of generating a financial return on investment within a given period, and, realize the stated impact objectives in its field of operations\n\nThis suggests that for Nigerian companies and projects to attract the desired level of impact investments, their promoters must be sure those two objectives must be present and sustainable, analysts said.\n\nAnother hurdle firms in Nigeria must overcome to get the needed impact investment is to be able to state clearly the problems they are addressing. What exactly is the focus of your investment? Which problem are you trying to solve?\n\nAccording to the industry players, the ability to pitch the project in clear terms will go a long way to attract impact investors in the appropriate areas.\n\nImpact investors in Nigeria have also been faced with the challenges of finding easy ways to exit their investments across a broad spectrum of sectors. Many factors are responsible for this, which include shallow financial markets for listed firms while several firms are not even listed on the Nigerian Exchange Group.",

Rev. Patrick Ebosele Ekpu on his 50th Episcopal anniversary and 90th birthday celebration, saluting his contributions to the development of Edo State and Nigeria.\n\nSpeaking at the celebration, held at St. Paul Catholic Church, Airport Road, Benin City, the governor said the clergy\u2019s service in God\u2019s vineyard has drawn more Christians to God.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cOur father has lived a very illustrious life and a life of service. His service in the vineyard of God has provided the opportunity for many Christian faithful to sustain personal connection and relationship with God.\u201d\n\nObaseki said Ekpu and other Nigerian patriots, in the midst of the civil war, were called into the service of God and accelerated to become Bishops in the Catholic Church, adding, \u201c50 years on, they have changed the face of the church in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cThe role of the Catholic Church became significant and very prominent particularly after the civil war, because of the diligent work our father commenced as a Bishop of this Diocese. As a priest, he has risen to the pinnacle of his Episcopal calling and has seen it all. We will continue to cherish his wisdom and experience.\n\n\u201cIn his service to the work of God, he brought the Church closer to the people and created an awareness where the people, regarded as fetish, got to understand Christianity better and became closer to God.\u201d\n\nNoting that the clergy has made huge contributions to the development of society, the governor noted, \u201cAt the age of 90 years, he continues to provide leadership even in retirement. We will continue to tap from his rich pool of wisdom to guide us as we chart our path through these very difficult times.\u201d\n\nWelcoming guests, the Archbishop of Benin and President, Catholic Bishops\u2019 Conference of Nigeria (CBCN), Most Rev.

          "title": "Southwest: Fanning the embers of religious bigotry",
          "text": "By Bola Bolawole\n\nReligion is the opium of the people \u2013 Karl Marx (1843).\n\nIn the aftermath of the collapse of the 21-storey Ikoyi skyscraper, conscious and deliberate efforts have been made in some quarters outside and within the Southwest to foul the air, pollute the age-old cordial relations amongst Yoruba Christians and Muslims, and trigger a religious crisis that will consume the Yoruba people and their civilization and cause them to remain slaves to the hegemonic, feudalistic and conservative forces fighting tooth and nail to maintain and reinforce their stranglehold upon the Nigerian polity. The \u201cforeign\u201d wing of this army of vile, despicable, vacuous and vicious elements is made up of latter-day immigrants to the space called Nigeria but who, ironically (although puerilely, arrogantly and mischievously), regard the same Nigeria as the fiefdom of their fore-fathers and the people who are autochthonous to the area as second-class citizens that must be dispossessed of their land and other ancestral rights and be extinguished or pushed into a hole like the colonists did to the red Indians in America and other parts of the so-called New World. The \u201clocal\u201d wing are the enemies within, those that the Yoruba call the \u201cOmo ale\u201d as opposed to \u201cOmo oko\u201d, the biblical Esau selling their birthright for a mess of pottage, and who, for the pecuniary gains of fleeting posts and perishing filthy lucre, compromise the interests of their own people while teaming up with the invaders to impoverish, imperil and even annihilate their own people and its civilization. Whitelegs (let\u2019s not call them Blacklegs) are to be found in all climes and through all ages. Their god is money and they will do anything for money, position and influence. Ungodly people, they are those William Shakespeare referred to in the Merchant of Venice as an evil soul producing holy witness; a villain with a smiling cheek; a goodly apple rotten at the heart: and like Marx posited in the opening quote, religion is a convenient excuse and deliberate weapon they employ to achieve their wicked goals.\n\nThe Southwest is the most peaceful region of Nigeria as of today and this does not augur well for those the Yoruba will call the \u201carije ni modaru\u201d. Those who fish and prosper in trouble waters, having tried but failed to spread their evil dragnet over Yoruba land through direct invasion, have now beaten a retreat and devised a detour to achieve the same nefarious end of unnerving, unhinging, suppressing, oppressing and subjugating the Yoruba and taking over their ancestral land and destroying their civilization and culture in the same way and manner they are doing elsewhere. Religion is their new-found strategy. By imagining, concocting, feigning and creating a non-existent enmity between Yoruba Muslims and Christians, by pretending to love the Yoruba Muslims more than the Yoruba Muslims are loved by their own Christian brothers and sisters, and by posing as the mujahideen who will fight Yoruba Muslims\u2019 battles against imaginary and orchestrated Christian \u201cenemies\u201d, they intend to be gifted the foothold into Yoruba land that their failed direct invasion could not provide. Let the Yoruba Muslims beware of those shedding crocodile tears and bearing Greek gifts! It is deceit, not love, and this has been their stock in trade from time immemorial. Their history, past and present, gives them away unmistakably as blood-thirsty hounds. As the Yoruba will say, the love that the poultry farmer has for his chicken does not transcend that of fattening it for the soup pot! Such is the emergency \u201clove\u201d of some Northern Muslims for Yoruba Muslims!\n\nHistory teaches that Islam got to Yoruba land around the 14th Century during the reign of the famous Emperor Mansa Kankan Musa of Mali; that was long before the jihad of Uthman dan Fodio in 1804. So, the Yoruba Muslims were neither evangelised/conquered by nor had they anything to learn on Islam from the so-called Sokoto Jihad. Pure and simple, the jihad was a territorial conquest camouflaged and disguised as a holy war. If Northern Muslims (many of them Muslim only in name, who cannot even read or understand the Quran) \u2013 if they truly love Yoruba Muslims as they now mischievously profess, ask them what love they have shown to their own Northern Muslim brothers and sisters! Shouldn\u2019t their charity begin at home? That Nigeria is the poverty capital of the world is because of the grinding poverty in much of the North. As the Yoruba will say, when a man says I will buy you a lace material, first of all check the quality of the clothes he himself is putting on. He who does not love his own brother cannot love you whom he derisively and derogatorily calls \u201ckeferi\u201d (kafirs)! If he feigns love, be careful; he has a hidden agenda!\n\nHow can Northern Muslims claim to love Yoruba Muslims when even the illiterates and cretins among them detest Yoruba Muslims leading them in prayers? Even the vilest of Northern Muslims believe (erroneously, myopically, and provocatively, though) that they are better Muslims than the more illustrious and better accomplished Yoruba Muslims! Those Northern Muslims now posing as defenders of Yoruba Muslims\u2019 rights should explain to the Yoruba why they annulled MKO Abiola\u2019s presidential mandate in 1993 and prevented him from becoming president, despite the fact that he won the election free and square! Was Abiola not a Muslim? His running mate who later ditched him was a Muslim. The military president who annulled his mandate was a Muslim. The man who arrested and detained Abiola was a Muslim. The man under whose watch Abiola was allegedly murdered in detention was a Muslim! All of them Northern Muslims! Yet, Northern Muslims love Yoruba Muslims and will now defend them against their Christian brothers and sisters! If they are deceiving you, please don\u2019t deceive yourself!\n\nCan we ever have another Yoruba Muslim closer to the Northern Muslim Establishment \u2013 in fact, ingrained into it \u2013 like MKO? Yet, they deceived him! They lied to him! They frustrated him! They let him down when it mattered most! They broke his heart, so much so that he warned us about them that \u201cWith friends like these, no one needs an enemy\u201d! In a flash they forgot all his good deeds towards them! They humiliated him; perhaps, even worse than they had done to other Yoruba leaders like Awolowo, Benjamin Adekunle, Tai Solarin, Ayodele Awojobi, Fela Anikulapo-Kuti, Gani Fawehimi, Adekunle Ajasin, Abraham Adesanya. The list is endless! If Northern Muslims truly love Yoruba Muslims why, then, is the disgusting treatment being meted out to Bola Tinubu? Is Tinubu not a Muslim? Thrice Muhammadu Buhari contested the presidency and lost, until Tinubu gave him his back in 2015, but see how they have rubbished their benefactor! If this is not the hallmark of ingratitude and deceit, then, I don\u2019t know what is!\n\nTell the Southwest to beware! The Northern Muslims and their southern hirelings beating the drums of war for Yoruba Muslims do not mean well. They are the latter-day Alimis intent on continuing the conquest of Yoruba land from Ilorin where their fore-fathers were forced to stop. Their collaborators in Yoruba land are the modern-day Afonjas who, for selfish reasons, are teaming up with enemies to endanger the peace, tranquillity and prosperity of the Yoruba homeland. See how the flotsam and jetsam of the North daily pour into Yoruba land, fleeing from the misery that their leaders, these self-same Northern Muslims, have enveloped their land in? But for Sunday Igboho and the others who rose up to the challenge when the Yoruba were practically (and deliberately?) abandoned in their hour of need! But for the octogenarian Banji Akintoye who picked up the gauntlet! But for the governor of governors, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu (aka Aketi), who provided leadership not only for the Southwest but also the entire southern Nigeria, treading where even angels might have feared to tread!\n\nYoruba land is one place where religious crisis must never be allowed to rear its ugly head. It is not in our blood or character. It is not in our culture and traditions. It is not in our style of resolving disputes. We are too urbane, too civilized and too cultured for that. Religious crisis is not a recurring decimal in our long but chequered history as it has been the case in some other places. Yoruba land is one place where both Muslims and Christians are to be found in practically every family and home. Yoruba land is one place where \u201ccarpet-crossing\u201d or \u201cdefection\u201d from one religion to another is commonplace, easy and seamless to execute and where eyebrows are seldom raised. No honour killing! No blasphemy issues! No political Sharia of amputation of limbs and stoning to death hypocritically visited only on the poor and downtrodden \u201ctalakawa\u201d! In Yoruba land adherents of the religions mesh. But to every rule there are exemptions; thus, it is not impossible to find religious zealots here and there but they are the exemption rather than the rule. Such lone and far-in-between incidents do not define the Yoruba worldview on religion and the aberrant must have picked up their discordant tunes from somewhere else! Guess where?\n\nYoruba land is one place where religion hardly determines friendship or influences relationships. Religion has NEVER been an issue here. That is the beauty of Yoruba land which the enemies of progress will have destroyed. May they fail!",

          "text": "The Lagos State Police Command says it has uncovered a camp used by an illegal Military outfit known as Nigerian Merchant Navy, as training camp in the the Ogudu Stanfield area of the state.\n\nThe command arrested Commanding Officer of the unit, Sunday Dakare, 47, alongside 107 youths, comprising of males and females between ages 19 and 47, who were undergoing training.\n\nParading the suspects who were clad in what looked like the Nigerian Navy camouflage, at the headquarters of the Lagos State Police Command, Ikeja, on Tuesday, the command boss, Hakeem Odumosu, noted it embarked on intensive surveillance of the camp and its activities, following what he described as credible actionable intelligence on the illegal activities of the outfit, before it carried out a well-coordinated overt operation at the training camp, at the early hours of yesterday.\n\n\u201cDuring the raid which was coordinated by the Operations Department of the Command, the following items were recovered: several military accoutrements including, camouflage, badges of ranks, flag, signboard, ID cards,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, recruitment letters, promotion letters, a portrait of the Commanding Officer, two motorcycles, one plasma TV, three cutlasses, criminal charms and other items, were also recovered.\n\n\u201cIn the course of interrogation, it was discovered that the Nigerian Merchant Navy also called the COASTAL DEFENCE FORCE has been operating illegally since 2005\u201d.\n\nHe recalled that the Nigerian Merchant Navy has since been outlawed by the Federal Government and therefore, said it was illegal for anyone to operate such a military outfit and give military training to unsuspecting young Nigerians.\n\nHe said, \u201c this trend portends danger for our Nation and a threat to peace and security. It, therefore, behoves us as a law enforcement agency to enforce such law banning activities of the illegal military outfit.\n\nI want to use this medium to warn other individuals or groups still operating such illegal outfits in any part of the State to close it forthwith. Anyone nursing the plan to operate such an outlawed security outfit is advised in his own interest to rescind the decision or face the full wrath of the law. The police will not hesitate to clamp down on them and their operators and bring them to book\u201d.\n\nHe, therefore, urged members of the public with useful information on anyone operating a clandestine military outfit or training camp to inform the police for urgent necessary action, adding that the suspects would be charged to court.\n\nThe Commanding Officer of the Camp, Dakare, however, denied any wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why they will arrest us. Efforts are on to legalise the Nigeria Merchant Navy as obtained elsewhere in the world. Besides, the uniform we are wearing is not Military camouflage, it is not Navy best, it is Marine Navy and we are not operating yet. Other countries have Coast guards and that is our role,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe are not being paid, we are only undergoing training while we await Federal Government\u2019s consent.\u201d",

I have been told not to tell anybody. That day, we were working on the first floor, Engineer Kola and Engineer Ola told us there was one pillar on the first floor, the pillar was cracked. The engineers told us to break the pillar so that they could fix another pillar there because the pillar was really big; they had confidence that nothing would happen to the pillar if they set another one.\n\n\u201cSuddenly we heard a noise, the thing (pillar) started to shake, I and Monday (another labourer) ran when we saw that the pillar was starting to shake. When I was running, I fell down; I was struggling to come out.\n\n\u201cWhen I ran outside, the gateman saw me, he now called a bike man (commercial motorcyclist). I ran out before the rescue operatives came in. The owner of the house (Femi Osibona) knows (knew) about the pillar, that it was cracked. He told the two engineers to ask us to break it. He was aware, he saw us, he even gave us money for food (breakfast). He saw us there when we were working on it.\u201d\n\nThe survivor explained that two members of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), whom he identified as Sam and Shola were also trapped under the rubble.",

Where else in the world is it free? The Presidential Committee on Health should come with a proposal for bonding doctors, nurses, medical laboratory scientists and other health workers, so that they don\u2019t just carry their bags and walk out of their country at will when they were trained at no cost.\n\n\u201cIn London, it is 45,000 pounds a session for medical education in cheap in universities. If you go to Edinburgh or Oxford, you pay $80,000. If you go to USA you pay $45,000 but if you go to the Ivy leagues, you pay $90,000 for only tuition, excluding lodging. You do it for six years. So, people in America take loans.\n\n\u201cWe can make provisions for loans and you pay back. If government will train you for free, we should bond you. You serve the country for nine years before you go anywhere,\u201d the Minister said in a statement issued by Deputy Director, Press and Public Relations of the Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment, Charles Akpan.\n\nMeanwhile, the Federal Executive Council (FEC) has given a waiver for employment in health, defence and paramilitary to ensure that those who leave for greener pastures were replaced.\n\nNgige explained that the waiver was granted by the government despite an embargo on recruitment into public service.\n\nThe Minister said to address the incessant labour crises in the county, the government would introduce mandatory training for newly elected labour leaders at the National Institute of Labour Studies (NILS).\n\nHe said the proposed training will equip the labour leaders with the knowledge of Labour laws and the International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions to curb the incessant industrial disputes in the country.\n\nNgige also revealed that his Ministry has made provision for the establishment of Rapid Response Labour Desk Offices across the 36 States of the Federation to help nip some of these industrial crises in the bud.",

          "text": "The Senate Wednesday approved President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s loan requests for the sum of $16,230,077,718 (USD) billion and \u20ac1,020,000,000 billion (Euros) under the 2018-2020 External Borrowing plan.\n\nAlso approved was a grant component of $125 million (USD) and the request to the Bank of Industries for the issuance of \u20ac500 million (Euros) but not more than \u20ac750 million Eurobond in the International Capital Market.\n\nOf the total loan components, lender agencies from China would give $11, 874,402,442.\n\nThe chamber\u2019s approval of the loan requests was, however, accompanied by a resolution that the terms and conditions of the loans from the funding agencies be forwarded to the National Assembly prior to its execution for approval and proper documentation.\n\nThe approval followed the consideration of a report by the Committee on Local and Foreign Debts on the proposed 2018-2020 External Borrowing (Rolling) Plan.\n\nIn his presentation, Chairman of the committee, Senator Clifford Ordia (PDP, Edo Central), said President Buhari\u2019s request was in compliance with the provisions of the Debt Management Office (Establishment) Act 2003 and the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2007.\n\nAccording to the lawmaker, the provisions of the statutes enjoined the president to seek and obtain the approval of the National Assembly in respect of the External Borrowing Programme of the Federation and States.\n\nGiving the breakdown, Ordia said the sum of $3,529,300,000 billion would be sourced from the World Bank; $5,078,441,252 billion from China EximBank; $3,902,267,260 billion from Industrial & Commercial Bank of China; $2,893,693,930 billion from China Development Bank; and $698,500,000 million from the Africa Development Bank (AfDB).\n\nIn addition, he stated that \u20ac345,000,000 million is expected to be sourced from the French Development Agency (AFD); \u20ac175,000,000 million euros from the European Investment Bank; $190,255,276 million USD from European ECA/KfW/IPEX/AFC; \u20ac500,000,000 from the International Capital Market; and $62,120,000 USD from Standard Chartered Bank/SINOCURE.\n\nIn reaching the decision, Senator Ordia said the committee noted the serious concerns of Nigerians about the level and sustainability of the country\u2019s borrowing in the last decade.\n\nOrdia said Nigeria\u2019s debt figures which continued to increase, reached an all-time high of around 95 percent of retained revenue and 35 percent of its annual expenditure.\n\nHe expressed concern that the development constitutes a drain on the nation\u2019s economy and limits resources available for national development.\n\nUnderscoring the need for a more proactive approach to revenue enhancement, the lawmaker observed that \u201cthere are noticeable improvements in our revenues but the growth is not sufficient or rapid enough to catch up with the pace of development required for our nation.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that out of the sum of over $22.8 billion approved by the National Assembly under the 2016-2018 External Borrowing Plan, only $2.8 billion \u2013 an amount representing ten percent \u2013 has been disbursed to Nigeria.\n\nThe lawmaker stressed that the projects, which required additional financing, would have great multiplier effect on stimulating economic growth through infrastructure development, job creation, poverty alleviation, healthcare and improve the nation\u2019s security architecture.\n\nHe emphasised that tax revenues accruable to the government would increase as a result of the impact of commercial and engineering activities.\n\nBuhari assures on FDI\n\nMeanwhile, President Buhari has said the outlook of the Nigerian economy remains bright with sustained investments in infrastructure, particularly ICT, that favours global businesses and a friendly regulatory environment that supports Foreign Direct Investments (FDI).\n\nHe spoke Wednesday in Paris, France at the Nigeria International Partnership Forum, with focus on \u201cBeyond the Pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe president said the Nigerian economy was being re-engineered and re-positioned to be globally more competitive, favouring business and entrepreneurship to drive growth and development.\n\n\u201cFor us in Nigeria, lessons drawn from the pandemic prompted us to redouble efforts to mitigate its socio-economic effects. Despite prevailing uncertainties, our equitable and sustainable reform initiatives resulted in substantial economic gains and steady recovery.\n\n\u201cI can assure you that our administration is on the right path to achieving multi-sectoral progress. We have revitalised the economy by increasing investments in capacity building, health, infrastructure, women\u2019s empowerment, climate change, and food security.\n\n\u201cToday, these actions are yielding self-employment, expanding our human resource pool and strengthening our national productivity for sustainable development,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president told a gathering of French and Nigerian businessmen that the government recognised the nation\u2019s risk profile and decided to re-assess and update the National Security Strategy in 2019.\n\n\u201cThe implementation of this multi-sectoral strategy has contributed to the progress we have made in fighting insurgents and terrorists in the North East of the country. Working closely with international partners, we are firmly addressing the root causes of crimes, and taking measures to prevent and counter violent extremism.\n\n\u201cAs I said at the 5th edition of the Future Investment Initiative Summit in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, investing in humanity is investing in our collective survival. With this in mind, we have incorporated the Public-Private Partnership model into our economic recovery plan, to attract private sector participation in the financing and operations of critical economic and social infrastructure. This measure is already helping to mitigate COVID-19 triggered capital flight and decline in grant and development financing.\n\n\u201cAlso, at the just concluded COP26 in Glasgow, I stressed the link between modern infrastructure and the overall economic development of a nation. Hence, the massive infrastructure expansion programme, we have been executing in various sectors since the beginning of this administration. 1.5 trillion Dollars is the cumulative amount estimated to be spent within a period of ten years from 2015.\n\n\u201cSo far, we have made significant investments in railways, seaports, roads, renewable energy, housing, and many others attractive to prospective investors. Institutions such as the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority and the recently created Infrastructure Corporation of Nigeria run as independent world class institutions to support and facilitate investments in the country,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe president said opportunities in the mining sector had been expanded, with simplified licensing process, extensive investments in transportation of raw materials, equipment and other mining elements by road and by rail.\n\n\u201cTo keep the progress in the digital economy, the fastest growing sector in Nigeria in both 2020 and 2021 on track, we recently approved the national policy on Fifth Generation (5G) network.\n\n\u201cOur ultimate goal is to leverage ICT platforms to spur further investments and create jobs, while diversifying support to other emerging sectors. Already, several foreign investors are taking advantage of our recent ranking as the leading start-up ecosystem in Africa.\n\n\u201cOver a week ago, I launched the eNaira, the electronic version of our national currency. When fully operationalised, this innovation will increase participation in fin-tech within Nigeria, increase efficiency in the banking sector, and boost our capacity to combat illicit flow of funds,\u201d he said.\n\nOil and gas sector\n\nOn the oil and gas sector, President Buhari said Nigeria was also getting more attention to expand opportunities with the signing of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA).\n\nHe said: \u201cIn the oil and gas sector, I recently signed the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA). The legislation, which is expected to serve as a liberalising force in the industry, introduced incentives such as tax holidays, zero-interest loans, and easy repatriation of profits.\n\n\u201cOur plan is to increase Liquefied Natural Gas exports and expand our domestic market. Partnerships in textile and leather processing, tourism, and health sectors are also areas we can explore,\u201d he said.\n\nOn agriculture, the president said through Anchor Borrowers programme, the federal government provided loans and technical support to small holder farmers, leading to the expansion in the number of rice mills in Nigeria from ten in 2014 to forty today.\n\n\u201cThe country has also increased the number of active fertilizer blending plants to more than forty-six, from fewer than five in 2014,\u2019\u2019 the president said, \u201csimilarly, we have set aside several million hectares of available arable land for agriculture, and have embarked on the creation of Special Agriculture Processing Zones across the country, Buhari said.\n\nAssuring investors of the country\u2019s willingness to create a win-win at every point, he said: \u201cI am proud to reiterate our resolve to reduce and ultimately eliminate obstacles to access and retention of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Our investment-friendly policies are backed by the rule of law, practical security policies and a resilient population.\n\n\u201cLet me finally stress that Nigeria is open for partnership and cooperation. I invite the French business community to take advantage of the vast investment opportunities in Africa\u2019s largest economy. As our development partners, rest assured that we will stand together with you throughout our partnership journey to guarantee our mutual interest.\u201d\n\nAlso at the event, National Security Adviser to the President Major-General Babagana Monguno (rtd); Nigeria\u2019s Special Envoy on Chad and Lake Chad Basin Ambassador Babagana Kingibe; Minister of Communications and Digital Economy Professor Isa Ali Pantami; Minister of State for Petroleum Resources Timipre Sylva; Minister of Information and Culture Lai Mohammed; and Minister of Foreign Affairs Geoffrey Onyeama also gave an overview on key sectors of the Nigerian economy in separate remarks.\n\nSome business leaders from Nigeria at the event were Founder/Chairman Oriental Energy Resources Mohammed Indimi; Founder/Chairman BUA Group Abdul Samad Rabiu, who also heads France-Nigeria Business Council; Founder/Chairman Zenith Bank Jim Ovia; Chairman of Heirs Holdings and UBA Tony Elumelu; and Chairman/Editor-in-Chief ThisDay Group and Arise News Channel Nduka Obiagbena.",

          "text": "Migrants stranded inside Belarus threw rocks and branches at Polish border guards and used logs to try to break down a razor wire fence overnight in new attempts to force their way into the European Union, the authorities in Warsaw said on Thursday.\n\nThe EU on Wednesday accused Belarus of mounting a \u201chybrid attack\u201d on the bloc by encouraging thousands of migrants fleeing poverty and war-torn areas to try to cross into Poland, and is gearing up to impose new sanctions on Minsk.\n\nThe crisis has sparked a new confrontation between the West and Russia, which dispatched two nuclear capable strategic bombers to patrol Belarusian airspace on Wednesday in a show of support for its ally. Belarus said the planes carried out drills for a second day on Thursday.\n\nThe Kremlin said Russia had nothing to do with tensions on the border and suggested the presence of heavily armed people on both sides \u2013 an apparent reference to Belarusian and Polish border guards \u2013 was a source of concern. The prospect of sanctions on Belarus a \u201ccrazy idea\u201d, it said.\n\nTrapped between two borders, the migrants have endured freezing weather in makeshift camps. Poland has reported at least seven migrant deaths in the months-long crisis and other migrants have expressed fear they would die.\n\nNone of around 150 migrants gathered near the town of Bialowieza managed to breach the border, the spokeswoman for the border guards service Ewelina Szczepanska told Reuters, saying there had been 468 attempts at illegal crossings on Wednesday.\n\nNeighbouring EU state Lithuania, which like Poland has imposed a state of emergency on the border, also reported new attempts to breach the frontier.\n\nIn a joint statement on Thursday, the defence ministers of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia said they saw the crisis as \u201cvery alarming, and unequivocally condemn the deliberate escalation of the ongoing hybrid attack by the Belarusian regime, which is posing serious threats to European security.\u201d\n\n\u201cLarge groups of people are being gathered and transported to the border area, where they are then forced to illegally cross the border. This increases the possibility of provocations and serious incidents that could also spill over into military domain,\u201d they said.\n\nThe bloc accuses Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko of manufacturing the migrant crisis in revenge for earlier sanctions after the veteran leader unleashed a violent crackdown on mass street protests against his rule in 2020.\n\nRussian flag carrier Aeroflot AFLT.MM on Thursday denied any involvement in organising mass transportation of migrants to Belarus, after its shares fell on a news report that it could face EU sanctions over the crisis on the Belarus-Poland border. read more\n\nThe Belarusian authorities said more than 2,000 migrants were at the border. Lukashenko and Russia have blamed the EU for the migrant crisis and said the EU was not living up to its own humanitarian values by preventing the migrants from crossing.\n\nLarge groups of people fleeing conflicts and poverty in the Middle East and elsewhere started flying to Minsk this spring. They then travel to the border with EU members Poland, Lithuania or Latvia by taxi, bus or cars provided by human smugglers and try to cross.\n\nPolish authorities say the number of flights to Belarus from the Middle East has increased dramatically in recent months, with the Polish prime minister calling on the EU to take action to stem the flow of airlines ferrying migrants to Minsk.\n\nMost migrants use travel agencies across the Middle East which partner with Belarusian companies to book tourism packages that usually include visa, flight and accommodation.\n\nThe price of the whole journey varies and can reach up to about $14,000. In October, Minsk restricted the number of travel agencies in Belarus allowed to deliver tourism invitations, and smugglers as well as agencies have reported a rise in prices.",

          "text": "FW de Klerk, the last president of apartheid South Africa and a key actor in the country\u2019s transition to democracy, has died.\n\nThe FW de Klerk Foundation\u2019s spokesperson Dave Steward confirmed his death to News24 on Thursday. \u201cThe former president died earlier this morning at his home in Fresnaye after his struggle against cancer. He was 85-years-old. He is survived by his wife Elita, two children Susan and Jan, and his grandchildren.\u201d\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to announce details of De Klerk\u2019s state funeral in due course.\n\nIn a statement on 8 June 2021, the foundation said he was diagnosed with mesothelioma \u2013 \u201ca cancer that affects the lining of the lungs\u201d \u2013 in March 2021. He was receiving immunotherapy for the illness.\n\nDe Klerk was the head of state from September 1989 until May 1994 and became one of the country\u2019s two deputy presidents after the first multi-racial, democratic election in April 1994.\n\nThe son of a National Party senator and minister, De Klerk entered Parliament in 1972 after training as a lawyer and winning his seat in Vereeniging, in what was then known as Southern Transvaal. He was appointed to the Cabinet of prime minister John Vorster in 1978 and served in various portfolios, including Minister of National Education. De Klerk was also a member of the Broederbond, the secretive Afrikaner organisation then active in politics and society.\n\nHe succeeded PW Botha as the leader of the National Party in February 1989 after Botha suffered a stroke and resigned from the party leadership. He became president seven months later after Botha quit the post in anger and the National Party won a whites-only election with a reduced margin.\n\nOn 2 February 1990, exactly one year after taking the reins as National Party leader, De Klerk announced to Parliament that he was unbanning the ANC, SACP, PAC and other liberation movements, and that he was releasing Nelson Mandela unconditionally. This led to a multi-party negotiation process between 1990 and 1994, paving the way for the democratic election.\n\nThe 1993 Nobel Peace Prize was jointly awarded to De Klerk and Mandela, who became the country\u2019s first democratically elected president the following year.\n\nDe Klerk became the first leader of the opposition after the election and led his party from the Government of National Unity in June 1996. He retired from active politics in August 1997.\n\nHe testified at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission on behalf of the National Party in August 1996 and May 1997, where his apology for apartheid was criticised as insufficient.\n\nAfter his political career, he launched a foundation in his name, which sought to play a role in civil society as a watchdog and think-tank. He also became involved in a global leadership initiative called The Elders, consisting of former heads of state who advocated for the rule of law and human rights.\n\nRecently, De Klerk became mired in controversy. In 2012, he defended aspects of apartheid during an interview with CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour and in 2020 he refused to concede that the system was a crime against humanity.\n\nHe is survived by his wife Elita (68), whom he married in November 1998, son Jan (57) and daughter Susan (52). His son Willem died of cancer in October 2020 at the age of 53. His former wife, Marike, whom he divorced in 1998, was murdered at the age of 64 in 2001.",

          "title": "Nigeria Not Ruling Out Political Solution on Separatists Kanu and Igboho, Says AGF Malami \u2013 Arise News",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government is open to all kinds of considerations, including a political solution, as parts of efforts to resolve the crisis surrounding separatist agitations in the Southeast and the Southwest parts of the country.\n\nAttorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Mr Abubakar Malami, on Wednesday, hinted at this possibility in a chat with select journalists in Abuja.\n\nThe AGF, who insisted that criminal conducts would never go unpunished, however, remarked that the government had been using the amnesty policy to tackle some security challenges in the country and as such, the possibility of a political solution could not be ruled out.\n\nMalami spoke on many other issues, including the current controversy between the federal government and the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), the international arbitration involving Nigeria and Process and Industrial Development (P& ID) company on the one hand and Sunflower firm over the Mambila power projects on the other.\n\nAsked whether the federal government was not disposed to a political solution to the cases of the leader of Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu and leader of the Yoruba Nation, Sunday Adeyemo otherwise called Sunday Igboho, as being canvassed by some leaders and other stakeholders in the country, Malami noted that although such consideration was not yet on the table, would however not mind taking a shot at it once there was an approach on how to go about it.\n\n\u201cAs far as security situation is concerned and as far as governance and this administration is concerned, you cannot rule out all possibilities\u201d, he said, adding: \u201cBut then, there has to be an approach for government to consider.\u201d\n\nHe explained that he could not be preemptive at this stage by stating clearly and outright that reconciliation was being considered without an approach been made.\n\nAccording to him, it was the approach if at all any was made, that the government \u201cwill look into for the purpose of looking at its weight, the authenticity of it, the good faith associated with it and then bring about the considerable factors relating to the negotiations or otherwise.\n\n\u201cSo, it is not a conclusion that one can outrightly make without juxtaposing associated facts relating to the reconciliation, there has to be an approach and then a counter consideration\u201d.\n\nMalami was however quick to add that no approach in that respect was on the table for consideration yet, it was something the government might take a shot at when it gets to that stage.\n\n\u201cSo, no approach in that respect is on table for consideration yet. So, we\u2019ll cross the bridge when eventually we get to that \u2013 when perhaps a type of request is made, we\u2019ll consider,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the federal government had been involved in legal battle with Nnamdi Kanu in Nigeria, it\u2019s been battling to extradite Igboho from Benin Republic to face criminal charges.\n\nBoth Kanu and Igboho have been in the forefront of agitations for breakaway from Nigeria.\n\nThe government, in fresh charges filed against Kanu last month, at the Abuja Division of the Federal High Court, had linked him with the wanton destruction of lives and properties as well as attacks on security operatives and government infrastructure in the South east of Nigeria.\n\nBut some leaders from the two geopolitical zones have been seeking a political solution to the situation.\n\nMeanwhile, on the payment of consultancy fees to contractors, who allegedly helped the 36 states government to recover excess deductions from the account during the payment of the Paris Club loans, Malami berated the governors for \u201caprobating and reprobating at the same time\u201d.\n\nHe explained that the governors could not come to deny a liability in 2021 having consented to it and made several payments.\n\nArguing that the federal government was obligated to obey orders of courts and carry out executions of court judgment, he claimed that the governors\u2019 current litigation over the payment of consultancy services fees was belated.\n\n\u201cI have told you earlier that the judgment in contention was a 2013 judgment and it was a consent judgment in which ALGON and governors\u2019 forum consented to a judgment.\n\n\u201cSo, what judgment are you talking about in 2021 against the background of the fact that they consented to the judgment in 2013, against the background of the fact they have been effecting payment as far back as 2013, against the background of the fact that they have written in their right, under their respective hands, committing to the payment of this consultancy fee we are talking about.\n\n\u201cSo, I think it is logical for all to see that they were indeed, submissive and they were indeed in agreement, and they have indeed conceded and consented to a judgment that created the liability they are now complaining about.\n\n\u201cThey have probated at a point in 2013 by way of submitting to judgment and then effecting payment over time. And, in fact, among the claims relating to Paris Club that has been presented before the federal government over time is a component relating to consultancy fees.\n\n\u201cSo what they are doing is as good as aprobating and reprobating at the same time \u2013conceding in 2013, and objecting 2021\u201d.\n\nHe denied any relationship with the contractors or having any personal interest, except for his duty to protect the federal government from unnecessary liabilities.\n\nAccording to him, since the federal government was made a party to the suit, there was the possibility that the assets of the federal government could be seized to pay the debt.\n\n\u201cSo, as far as the payment is concerned, the office of the attorney general is not in any way involved. But the fact remains, judgments are meant to be enforced and then you are not expected to be speculative as far as the enforcement are concerned.\n\n\u201cWhen in the case of P&ID, an award was made against Nigeria, what we did was to approach the court of law for the purpose of setting aside the enforcement proceedings. It was only when the proceedings were set aside that we now have respite in terms of ensuring that no asset of the federal government is attached.\n\n\u201cSo, the fact that they are in court, belatedly, again against the background that they have three months within which to appeal against the 2013 judgment, which they kept sleeping from 2013 until 2021 makes it illogical that they expect the federal government or perhaps any institution of government faced with a judgment and order of the court to await their belated approach to court, which is indeed a forum shopping\u201d.\n\nHe further clarified that following complaint from the governors at a time, the administration had involved the EFCC and DSS to authenticate the project; as well as what was done and how much.\n\nHe said the total Judgment debt was put at about $3.2 billion out of which the governors did not only agree to pay but actually have been making payments until recently.\n\nAlex Enumah in Abuja",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday, expressed the readiness of Nigeria to collaborate with France to degrade international criminal networks.\n\nHe also appreciated efforts of the French President, Emmanuel Macron, in expanding opportunities for business between Nigerians and their French counterparts.\n\nThe President, who spoke over lunch during a state visit to President Macron at Palais Elysee in Paris, emphasised that irregular migration and human trafficking were issues of concern to both Nigeria and France.\n\nAccording to him, the transnational criminal networks operating in Africa and Europe were exploiting the vulnerable in the most dehumanising ways.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to working with the relevant French authorities to dismantle these networks. Nigeria and France have a wide scope to expand and deepen their relations. This effort would be aided by closer engagement at the ministerial level,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Buhari also commended France for its concern towards achieving appreciable peace in both the Sahel and the Lake Chad region.\n\nHis words :\u201cOn security, we commend France for its strong commitment to peace and security in the Sahel and the Lake Chad region. This has contributed significantly to the fight against terrorism and extremism in the region.\u201d\n\nHe, however, noted that the visit of President Macron to Nigeria in 2018 had yielded fruits in renewed interest for entrepreneurship beyond local borders, with more businesses expanding their reach and scope in France, particularly, with establishment of French Nigeria Investment Club.\n\n\u201cOn the business front, we welcome the personal efforts of President Macron to strengthen ties between Nigerian and French corporations. It was during your visit to Lagos in 2018 that the French Nigeria Investment Club was established.\n\n\u201cYou were also instrumental to the establishment of the France-Nigeria Business Council more recently in June 2021. These efforts have brought together some of the largest corporations in Nigeria and France and the stage is set for expanded engagement by entrepreneurs in both countries,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President affirmed that the French government has continued to share the vision of promoting stronger ties in health and education, even as he appreciated the French President for support in improving bilateral relations with Nigeria.\n\nHe said, \u201cMr. President, we are determined to take steps to further strengthen our bilateral relations and we look forward to working closely with the French government on this.\n\n\u201cFrance is a major development partner for Nigeria and we truly appreciate this. The contributions of the Agence France de Developpment (AFD) to development projects across Nigeria have been well documented. These projects are making a significant difference in communities across Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe welcome the collaboration of Campus France with Nigerian tertiary institutions. This is expanding the scope of Nigeria-France relations into the education sector and improving people \u2013 people contact especially, among young Nigerian and French citizens\u201d.\n\nThe President further said the French government had also played a key role in ameliorating the challenge posed by COVID-19 since 2020, donating 10 million doses of vaccines to Africa, with more than 500,000 sent to Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cFrance has played a vital role in the fight against COVID-19 in Africa. We appreciate the donation of 10 million doses of Astrazeneca and Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines to the African Union by the French government.\n\n\u201cWe acknowledge, with profound gratitude, the donation of over 500,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines we have received from France. This has gone a long way to support our national vaccination drive, a critical aspect of our fight against COVID-19\u2033.\n\nPresident Buhari noted that Nigeria and France had wide scope to expand and deepen their relations, adding that, \u201cthis effort would be aided by closer engagement at the ministerial level. We should therefore work towards more high-level official visits.\u201d\n\nHe also told his host that his state visit was coming at a time \u201cwe have decided to hold the very first Nigeria International Partnership Forum, which is taking place here in Paris.\n\n\u201cWe see the Forum as a strategic step towards strengthening ties between Nigeria and France. I thank President Macron for the support of the French government for the Forum. I am pleased with the cordial bilateral relations between Nigeria and France, which have grown deeper over the years with closer cooperation in political, economic, security and socio-cultural matters.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, the French President said there was a growing need for stronger partnership on security in the West Coast, taking into consideration threats in the Sahel.\n\nMacron also urged more enabling environment for businesses to thrive, including smaller companies in France that wanted to stretch their markets into Nigeria.\n\nBuhari and Macron, during the bilateral talks, discussed the need for successful elections in Libya to restore stability, regional intelligence sharing on security, maritime security, single monetary policy in West Africa and the situation in Chad and Mali.\n\nDeji Elumoye in Paris",
