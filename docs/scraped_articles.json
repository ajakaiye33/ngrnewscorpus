          "text": "A conference of Yoruba has called for decentralisation of government to allow the six geopolitical zones in the country to have autonomy to function.\n\nThe conference, which had in attendance Yoruba scholars and traditional rulers, was led by Professor of History, University of Texas, Austin, Toyin Falola, who submitted that decentralisation of power would solve most of the problems, including the insecurity facing the country.\n\nThe Yoruba leaders and scholars met at Babcock University, Ilishan-Remo, Ogun State, on Monday, for the sixth Atanda lectures and conference on Yoruba culture and society.\n\nThe three-day conference on Yoruba culture and society had many national and international scholars on Yoruba and culture as speakers, including a foremost private art collector in Africa, Prince Yemisi Shyllon; Director of African Studies Institute, University of Georgia, USA, Akinloye Ojo, and Professor Arinpe Adejumo of the University of Ibadan.\n\nSpeaking on the essence of the conference, held in remembrance of a late professor of history, Joseph Atanda, Falola said the late scholar contributed immensely to the teaching of Yoruba history and culture while alive.\n\nSpeaking on the state of the nation, Falola said, \u201cThe Yoruba are angry, the Igbo are angry, so, how to minimise and reduce the anger is what we should find a solution to.\n\n\u201cAt this time, the best advice one can give is decentralisation and autonomy in various regions.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think separation is the best way to go, but seeking better autonomy in these regions is a better option.\u201d\n\nAnother professor of history, Olutayo Adeshina, in his submission advised the agitators for Yoruba nation to think things through.\n\nHe said \u201cThose who are pushing for it, I will say let us take it easy and see it from broader perspectives because here, the structure of Nigeria is skewed; it is imbalanced and it is also not right. Yes, we have rights to agitate; I will say let us take it easy.\n\n\u201cIf we agitate and try to secede, move away, what is the benefit of it? What is the cost of taking Yoruba out of Nigeria? Is it going to be done peacefully?\n\n\u201cYou have to do this thing very clinically; you must get your parameters right; is it going to be peaceful? If it is going to be peaceful, Okay, if it is not going to be peaceful, what is the cost to us as a people and as a society? What is the cost on our infrastructure? A lot of things must be done carefully and well calibrated.\u201d\n\nThe Orangun of Oke-Ila, Osun State, Oba Abolarin Adedokun, also called for patience and tolerance among the tribes and ethnic groups in the country.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

took the boy into his Church, treated him in hospital, counselled him, sent him to school, took care of all his needs and raised him as his own son.\n\nThere was a man I knew who gave shelter to the

          "text": ".\n\nBy Anayo Okoli & Dennis Agbo, ENUGU\n\nSENATE Minority leader, Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe has vowed that no amount of threat will stop Ndigbo from demanding equitable treatment in Nigeria, insisting that the marginalization has become unbearable.\n\nAccording to Abaribe, despite the fact that Igbo are the glue that holds Nigeria, some people are trying to push them out but he said they are not going anywhere.\n\nSpeaking yesterday in Enugu at the inauguration of the Igbonine socio-cultural organisation, Abaribe lamented that Igbo have been pushed to the fringes irrespective of the fact that they are the glue that holds Nigeria together and as the highest domestic investors.\n\nHe said the present government is manifesting sectional leadership and unequal treatment, which he said has been the problem of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe are being highly marginalized. This Union called Nigeria is stiflingly everybody in Nigeria not just Igbo but other regions and I am glad that we are making noise to see how to change the situation.\n\nWhat does Igbo want? Igbo want emancipation. Our people have gone through a lot. We have gone through, lost over 3 million people. When the war ended, were given 20 Pounds but we rose through the ashes and survived.\n\n\u201cWe are the glue that holds Nigeria together. We are the highest domestic investors; We are the most travelled in Nigeria. In any part of Nigeria, after the indigenous people, the next is Igbo.\n\nThat is why anywhere you go you must see an Igboman. We are really the federal Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWhen they say want to leave, we say no, some people want to push us out. We are not going to leave Nigeria for anybody.\n\n\u201cWe have a government today that is manifesting sectional leadership. Boko Haram has been killing people but nothing was done to them. When our boys were carrying flags running around, it was easy for them to get them proscribed as a terrorist organization but the same government refused to designate Boko Haram which everybody knows their activities, killing and destroying and bombing churches and institutions.\n\n\u201cWhen we challenge them, the Minister of Information said that Boko Haram was faceless but our boys were known.\n\nAlso Read: Lai: Buhari\u2019s Agric revolution yielding results\n\n\u201cThis unequal treatment of people has been the problem of Nigeria. We are feeling of being alienated. The alineation is spreading across the country no longer on Igbo.\n\n\u201cWhat we now have is that even though there is insecurity everywhere but they want to paint Igbo as the people causing the problems.\n\n\u201cOur country Nigeria today is supposed to be the inclusion of everybody because we are equal partners. We, the Igbo are the glue that keeps Nigeria. Therefore, there must be a deliberate effort to bring everybody together.\n\n\u201cIgbo have been pushed to the fringes. When it is time for their rights, they will like to push them around. I will not like when it is time to give President somebody will say there is a problem in Igbo land. Was there no trouble in the North West when Buhari was elected president?\n\nIn fact, Buhari was allegedly nominated by Boko-Haram during President Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s Presidency to negotiate for them.\n\n\u201cNo amount of threat will deter up from demanding for equitable treatment in Nigeria. Nobody will stop us from doing that even to the position of the President.\n\n\u201cIf the dominant position in Nigeria today is restructuring then the minimal demand of Ndigbo in Nigeria cannot be anything less than that of restructuring.\n\n\u201cWe cannot be in a country where my own child will be required to score 140 per cent to enter the federal school while another child will be required to score just two to enter the same school\u201d, Abaribe said.\n\nVanguard News Nivgeria",

          "text": "Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta ZState\n\nBy Emma Amaize\n\nFORMER Minister of State for Education and Governorship Aspirant in Delta State, Olorogun Kenneth Gbagi and Chairman, Senate Committee on Niger-Delta, Senator Peter Nwaoboshi, both ranking members of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, fell out, yesterday, over the performance of Delta Governor, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa, who has done six years in office.\n\n\n\nSenator Nwaoboshi in a forwarded message reportedly told some persons:\u201dI am a PDP Senator but I have to tell you the truth. Urhobo and Itsekiri governors performed credibly well than our own Anioma governor.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat has the Anioma governor done for Asaba people to show that he loves Asaba more than the Delta Central people? Don\u2019t allow selfish people to bring division between us and Delta Central people.\n\n\n\n\u201cI challenge anyone to a debate that (Emmanuel) Uduaghan loves Asaba more than our Anioma governor anytime and anywhere. His legacy in Asaba speaks volumes. It is the turn of Delta Central to produce the next Governor of Delta State,\u201d Nwaoboshi stated.\n\n\n\nReacting to the statement, Gbagi asserted: \u201cDistinguished Senator Nwaoboshi, I have just read a small piece credited to your name comparing the works of Senator Ifeanyi Okowa to that of the two past governments. We are all citizens of the state, you and I, James Manager, formed this party. We know where we are coming from and we are all members of the party. If you drive today from the foot bridge of Anambra into Delta, to Sapele, Oghara, Warri, Isoko, Isiokolo and taking the entire state into perspective, what this governor has done, nobody has done.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe know what resources had accrued to first governor, second governor and this third governor by way of revenue and in sharp contrast, we must give honour to whom honour is due, Okowa is a legend. Given the money he has received, given what he has been able to do, there is no local government that has less 10 roads constructed for it and its people without being cronies of this governor and that makes a huge difference.\n\n\n\n\u201cI do not like us to heat up the polity, we are working, we own this party together and we are one people.

Today, go back there, that road is being turned to an expressway with drainage and what have you, who is doing it?\n\n\n\n\u201cLook at Asaba, I went to Asaba the other day, Asaba is today a massive city that looks like the capital of a state. Before now, it was not.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf we really want to look at it, let us look at the money that accrued to the first governor, what happened, the second governor, what happened, the third governor, what happened? I mean we can take all the streets in Delta, we can publish it, I plead with you Peter, to call your father a wrong name is not good for whatever it is worth.\n\nWe are friends and will continue to be friends. We own the party together. Please, I ask of you, Delta State must go forward. We must develop the state, the state must wear its look as one of the greatest states in Nigeria financially. All of these bickerings will not help us,\u201d he said.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

The fact that you regulate certain untoward activities does not mean you are gagging the media.\n\n\u201cWe have one of the most liberalised media industry in Nigeria: private radio stations, private television stations and news online.

          "text": "By Toba Adedeji, Osogbo\n\nAs the political activities for the Osun State governorship scheduled to hold July next year get underway, the lawmaker representing Ede North/Ede/South/Egbedore/Ejigbo Federal Constituency at the National Assembly, Bamidele Salam has dampened the quest of Dr Akin Ogunbiyi to contest the election on the platform of the Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nHe said Ogunbiyi who is one of the high contenders with Senator Ademola Adeleke for the party\u2019s ticket would not be a good governor if given the chance.\n\nOgunbiyi had contested for the PDP ticket in the last governorship election in the state but narrowly lost to Adeleke. He polled 1,562 votes, against Adeleke\u2019s 1,569 votes. Ogunbiyi has declared interest in securing the ticket of the opposition party for next year\u2019s election.\n\nSalam who was elected on the platform of the PDP made the remark while featuring on a private radio station in Osogbo, Rave FM monitored by our correspondent. He said Ogunbiyi can be useful in other political offices, except that of the governor.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHis words: \u201cThe party is not divided along (those backing) Dr Akin Ogunbiyi and Senator Ademola Adeleke; it is just a mere aspiration which is normal in politics. Politics is not about noise-making, it is about acceptability, networking and capacity. So, if anybody talks about the Adelekes\u2019 today, it is like a brand, they have earned it, not like anybody dashed them. The senior Adeleke was the governor of Osun State. The family has a name that anyone desirous of political success can leverage on.\n\n\u201cI know Dr Akin Ogunbiyi very well; he is a brother that I respect so much, but you know that when we talk about politics, we talk about the name, influence, networking, Ogunbiyi is nowhere near the Adelekes. I give him due honour, he is a very good and capable man but he can also be very useful in other areas but certainly not as the governor in this time around.\u201d",

          "title": "Quest for better representation for Ndokwa/Ukwuani Federal Constituency",
          "text": "Former Speaker, Delta State House Assembly, Olise Enebeli Imegwu, who writes from Aboh, Ndokwa East Local Government, is concerned about the quality of representation Ndokwa/Ukwuani Federal Constituency is currently receiving. Imegwu who is writing on behalf of Concerned Leaders of Aboh is calling for equity and fairness in the share of democracy dividends within his constituency\n\nThough Ossai N. Ossai represents Ndokwa/Ukwuani Federal Constituency in the Green Chambers of the National Assembly, which comprises Ndokwa East, Ndokwa West and Ukwuani Local Government Areas, he goes about his mandate as if he is representing only Ndokwa West, his immediate constituency. He thereby neglects the other two local governments in the constituency.\n\nAs a result, his representation has brought in its wake a tale of woes that dates back to 1976 when the defunct Aboh Division was renamed Ndokwa Local Government, later divided into the current three councils in Ndokwa/Ukwuani Federal Constituency.\n\nChief Enuenwosu of Ukwuani descent began the change in the 1970s. Since then, it has been a tale of hope, patience, perseverance and disappointments for the rest of the tripod. As a result, the popularity of Aboh Kingdom has waned. At the height of its fame, the Obi of Aboh, Oba of Benin and the Olu of Warri were the only kings from the defunct Midwest Region that attended meetings at the Western House of Chiefs in Ibadan. A series of other acts, in rapid succession, multiplied to ensure the descent of the kingdom into oblivion. The larger Ndoshimili people of Ndokwa East Local Government suffered the same fate.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nUkwuani as a dialect became foisted on us without our consent. Still reeling from the wounds of the decades past, a neo-20th Century ethnic cleansing scheme under Ossai is rearing its ugly head in Aboh, by extension, Ndokwa East.\n\nIt comes in the form of domination in our socio-economic-political-policy/programmatic sphere of government benefits. This oppressive and imperialistic attitude has been ongoing since 2019 and it reached its crescendo when Ossai, a PDP legislator, decided to take the obnoxious step of scuttling the establishment of the University of Agriculture and Technology, Aboh. His reason is that it was not cited in Ndokwa West, his local government. Ironically, a PDP lawmaker elected into office by our joint votes would turn around to oppose a programme or policy supported by an APC-led government of President Muhammadu Buhari and the APC leadership in the National Assembly, led by Senator Ahmad Lawan, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege and our distinguished senator from Oshimili North and the sponsor of the bill, Senator Peter Nwaoboshi. It is noteworthy that Ossai\u2019s opposition arises from the fact that the said University of Agriculture and Technology was not cited in his local council of Ndokwa West.\n\nHow many tertiary institutions do Ndokwa West want to have? The School of Maritime Technology is situated there. It also has other institutions of higher learning, including the University of Novena (a private institution), and two polytechnics. The idea of establishing the University of Maritime Technology in Aboh at Okerenkoko was first initiated by a group led by Prof. B.I.C. Ijomah during the tenure of former Governor Emmanuel Uduaghan. Unfortunately, the Federal Government built the same for Burutu, the Abohs applauded and supported it because Burutu, like Aboh, is a long-neglected and marginalised Niger Delta and oil-producing local government.\n\nOssai\u2019s ignoble act has now opened the door for an Anioma co-legislator in the House of Reps, Ndudi Elumelu, to canvass for the same University for Asaba, a non-non-oil producing area. This is not justifiable. For, only this year, March 2021, the Delta State University of Science and Technology was established and the same have since been inspected and accredited by the National University Commission (NUC).\n\nWhat portion have we in the union called Ndokwa or Anioma?\n\nThus, the attitude being put up by Ossai patterned after the obnoxious acts of the decades of the \u201970s and \u201990s and it is becoming unbearable by the day. First, this year, Ndokwa Neku Union (NNU) which Ndokwa East belongs, carried out what many considered a disguised form of a neo-20th Century ethnic cleansing when it amended its 2006 constitution and wiped out the delegate representation of Ndokwa East by 100 per cent and increased those for Ndokwa West and Ukwuani by 100 per cent each. The 2006 NNU Constitution, approved by the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) in 2013, distributed the delegate representation on basis of the number of clans in each local government.\n\nThe baseline figure was two, multiplied by the number of clans per local government. Ndokwa East with its 22 clans had 44 delegates. Ndokwa West with its six clans had 12 delegates, while Ukwuani with its nine clans had 18 delegates. Alas, the so-called 2020 NNU amended constitution, which of course is illegal and unconstitutional, increased the clan delegate representation for Ndokwa West and Ukwuani to 44 delegates each, while Ndokwa East with 22 clans remained 44. We are bitter and angry about this impunity as it was done against our protestation.\n\nSecondly, the attempt by NNU to present a position paper on behalf of Ndokwa Federal Constituency at the recently concluded Senate Constitution Amendment Review Committee at Grand Hotel was stopped by Dr Olisa Enebeli Imegwu, when it was discovered that Ndokwa East was again to be short-changed. The position paper to be presented that morning was different from the advanced copy in his possession. In the smuggled position paper, NNU proposed that Ndokwa West and Ukwuani with six and nine clans, respectively, be divided into two local governments each, that is, four. Ndokwa East with 22 clans, much larger in size and population, on the other hand, was proposed to be divided into two local governments, Inyi town excluded. It is to be noted that, apart from the large size and population, the other important fact is that our terrain, a typical Niger Delta terrain is not contiguous and difficult to access. With these acts, what has now set in irretrievably is a deficit trust in the union, a sick Ndokwa Neku amalgam.\n\nIn 1991, Ndokwa East had two state constituencies and Ndokwa West had also two. Today, while the state constituencies for Ndokwa East are reduced to one Ndokwa West remains two. Meanwhile, Ukwuani, which was created from it remains. Fourth, we want the oil wells in Ndokwa East: namely Beniku, particularly those of Kwale, Kwale East, Umuseti/Igbuku (named after towns in Ndokwa West), to be renamed with the names of towns in Ndokwa East where they are located and the production quantum and revenue to be credited to us. All of the listed grievances amount to a case of one injustice nullifying the other. Is this a true union of equals; one of a brother\u2019s keeper?\n\nOur appeal\n\nThe National Assembly should ignore Ossai and approve the University of Agriculture and Technology, Aboh, the headquarters of the only oil and gas producing local government in Delta North, as it did for Burutu Local Government and Amasoma, and Otuoeke, in Bayelsa State. From the inception of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) to date, Aboh and Ndokwa East have not had any major NDDC project awarded and completed, and it is a typical Niger Delta, oil and gas producing area.\n\nIn conclusion, the elders of Ndokwa/Ukwuani Federal Constituency should encourage and the election of candidates that would be consensus builders. They should do away with \u201celectoral banditry\u201d, \u201coccultic politics\u201d and too much emphasis on money. They should also do away with any form of imposition of candidates and those who get appointments, whether or not they ate fit and proper persons. The failure of Ndokwa statesmen to hearken to this admonition will invoke the biblical lesson in 1 Kings 12:16, \u201cfor you cannot build a nation on the back of a people and then refuse to give them a place in it\u201d. This is a call for active citizenship and Ossai should join us to build a virile and united Ndokwa nation and not push us over the cliff.",

          "title": "Buhari, Afenifere, Ohanaeze, MBF clash over appointments",
          "text": "By Sunday Ani, Chukwudi Nweje and Romanus Okoye\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has defended his appointments and policies, saying they are fair and inclusive.\n\nHe was apparently reacting to the gale of criticisms against his alleged lopsided appointment which critics say favour one part of the country.\n\nBuhari said there was no part of the country that has not been impacted positively in the areas of infrastructure, agriculture and economic support initiative based on peculiarities of the regions.\n\nHe spoke at the All Progressives Congress (APC) Youth Conference with the theme: \u201cThe future is a decision.\u201d\n\nThe conference, first of its kind in the history of the APC was attended by youths representatives from across the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nHe maintained that the party would keep implementing and executing policies that were not only beneficial but fair to all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cSo far, all the policies initiatives, projects and even appointments by this administration has been guided by equity and inclusiveness. There is actually no part of the country that has not been impacted positively in the areas of infrastructure, agriculture and economic support initiative based on peculiarities of the regions.\u201d\n\nHe explained that what an area lacked in one aspect was compensated for in another.\n\nHowever, the pan-Yoruba socio-cultural organisation, Afenifere, Ohaneze Ndigbo, the Middle Belt Forum, former governor of Anambra State, Chukwuemeka Ezeife and Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Chijioke Okoli faulted the President Buhari\u2019s claim.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of Afenifere, Jare Ajayi, said the administration has been most unfair in terms of appointments and policies.\n\n\u201cThere has never been an administration in this country that is as unfair and alienates certain parts of the country as that of President Buhari. For Buhari to claim he is fair shows he is unaware of the feelings of the Nigerian public. It seems certain English words connote a different meaning to president Buhari,\u201d he said.\n\nOhanaeze\u2019s scribe, Alex Chidozie Ogbonna, agued that the lopsidedness is not just in favour of the north but the Fulani extraction, which he said gives great concern to even the northerners.\n\nHe said after his election in 2015, he did not hide his disdain for the South East when he said those who gave him 97 percent would not be treated the same way as those who gave him five per cent.\n\n\u201cAnd true to his pronouncement, his administration has been skewed against the South East that didn\u2019t give him much electoral support in 2015. But even when the zone supported him in 2019, the trend did not change. So, he can\u2019t say his appointments and policies have been fair and inclusive. I disagree with him on that.\u201d\n\nPresident of the Middle Belt Forum, Dr. Pogu Bitrus, said if the president was right in his claims, people would not complain about his administration.He noted that the president has been so nepotistic in all his political appointments so much that every important organisation in Nigeria is headed by a northern Muslim.\n\n\u201cThe president is not just nepotistic in his appointments and policies, he also has an agenda which favours what he wants to protect. I don\u2019t want to say he lied, but the data is there for everybody to see. Nearly all appointments, even in some states where the Fulani population is insignificant like in Nasawara and Taraba, are taken by the Fulani. There is nepotism in Buhari\u2019s government, which has never been experienced in Nigeria before now. So, let him change. Nigerians don\u2019t hate him; it is his policies that Nigerians don\u2019t like. It is his policies that are creating all the problems we are having today. It is his policies that are making people say they are no longer interested in this country.\u201d\n\nOkoli (SAN) equally disagreed with the president, saying if the president said his appointments and policies are fair and inclusive, then he is not just habituating in an alternate universe but has also taken his audience to the theatre of the absurd.\n\n\u201cAnd in such theatre, you are torn between laughing and crying. The disingenuousness is beyond belief. He had earlier acknowledged the lopsided nature of his appointments but justified them on the basis of merit. It is a village idiot that would believe him in his embarrassing appointment of some of the least qualified from a section of the country, which are, in the first place, disadvantaged educationally, in the presence of qualified manpower.\u201d\n\nFor Dr Ezeife, President Buhari\u2019s appointments are motivated by blood relationship while his policies are driven by love and hatred.\n\n\u201cHe hates the South East and to a lesser extent the South-South. He loves Niger Republic even though it is not part of Nigeria. He loves Muslims and hates Christians. It is not possible for him to say his appointments and policies are fair and equitable. I can\u2019t believe he can say such a thing but if indeed he said so, then something is wrong, too wrong for correction,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022Criminal elements\u2019ll be brought to book\n\n\u2013President\n\nNotwithstanding the criticisms, Buhari has reassured that no effort would be spared in tackling insecurity in the country and bringing its perpetrators to justice.\n\n\u201cAs you are all aware, we are currently dealing with some internal security challenges and I will like to reassure you that as the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, no effort will be spared in tackling them.\n\n\u201cAs I have repeatedly said in recent weeks, every criminal element that has taken up arms against the peace of the country and its citizens will be brought to book accordingly.\n\n\u201cI am happy to see that we are beginning to see the results and we keep improving until the country is rid of such divisive elements,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nBuhari implored Nigerians not to be discouraged or relent in the joint task of nation building.\n\nHe stressed that we have no other country but Nigeria, adding that it was the responsibility of everyone to work toward the development and advancement of the country.\n\nHe advised that unpleasant experiences and controversies of the past should be put behind, as we forge a better future for the country.\n\nThis, he added, could be achieved through patience, perseverance, love and empathy for one another irrespective of tribe, language and religion.\n\nBuhari also gave assurance that the APC would remain bound by the tenets of its manifesto and constitution.\n\nHe noted that while the party`s constitution and manifesto might not be perfect, they were put together to ensure that elected and appointed members of the party conducted themselves in the most responsible manner possible.\n\nMeanwhile, the First Lady, Mrs Aisha Buhari, has said her faith in younger generation of Nigerian women and youths remained unshakable.\n\nRepresented by her Senior Special Assistant on Women Affairs and Administration, Dr Rukayyatu Gurin, the first lady expressed her unalloyed support and commitment to the party.",

          "text": "From Adetutu Folasade-Koyi and Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has said it is targeting a minimum of 20 million additional registrants in the forthcoming nationwide Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) exercise to increase the total number of voters to 100 million ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\nINEC also pleaded with media organisations to ensure the success of the CVR through massive publicity, emphasising that the exercise scheduled to last a period of at least one year, will depend on citizens\u2019 awareness through voter education.\n\nCommission\u2019s Chairman, Prof Mahmood Yakubu, made the appeal in his remarks during the second quarterly meeting with media organisations in Abuja, yesterday.\n\nHe argued that with the launch of online Voter Registration portal and deployment of over 2,000 mobile physical registration equipment, the target of the commission to enrol about 100 million voters ahead of the 2023 general election is a mission possible.\n\n\u201cThe expansion of voters\u2019 access to polling units prepares the ground for the discharge of another important responsibility of the Commission. The registration of eligible Nigerians as voters is one of the immediate tasks before the Commission.\n\n\u201cConsequently, in the next one week i.e. Monday June 28, 2021, the Commission will resume the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) nationwide. In doing so, the Commission is introducing a portal to enable eligible Nigerians to commence registration as voters online before completing the exercise physically at designated centres nationwide. This is first time a major exercise of this nature is handled partially online consistent with the Commission\u2019s commitment to continue to deepen the use of technology in the electoral process in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cJust like the expansion of voter access to Polling Units, the Commission appeals to the media for support so that this novel idea will also be successful. The CVR will be a major issue for discussion at this meeting.\n\n\u201cThe Commission will demonstrate the procedure for the proposed online registration and also present the new INEC Voter Enrollment Device (IVED) to you shortly.\n\n\u201cThe Commission will also brief you about the preparations for the forthcoming Anambra State governorship election scheduled for November 6 and the Area Council elections in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) holding on February 12, 2022.\n\n\u201cAs you are already aware, the Commission has released the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the two major off-season governorship elections in Ekiti and Osun States holding on June 18, 2022 and July 16 2022 respectively.\n\n\u201cWe have since uploaded the details on our website and social media platforms. However, hard copies of the same documents are contained in your folders for this meeting.\n\n\u201cWe intend to undertake the CVR exercise over a period of at least one year. The success of the exercise depends to a considerable extent on citizens\u2019 awareness through voter education.\n\n\u201cThere will be new registrants, requests for intra-state and inter-state transfers as well as the replacement of voters\u2019 cards as provided by law.Furthermore, with the relocation of voting points to underserved areas as autonomous polling units, there is need for massive publicity so that citizens are familiar with their voting locations well ahead of all forthcoming elections. We appeal for your partnership to achieve this,\u201d he requested.\n\nPresident of Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Chris Isiguzo, had appealed to the Commission to use the various off season elections to cement the electoral progresses it has recorded.",

          "text": "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs allegedly mismanaged $68 million (about N28 billion) released by the President Muhammadu Buhari administration in 2018 for disbursement to some of the country\u2019s foreign missions, SaharaReporters learnt.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt from a government\u2019s audit report that the Ministry\u2019s Permanent Secretary has now been asked to explain how the funds, allegedly misused, were disbursed to the missions.\n\nNigeria Foreign Affairs Minister Geoffrey Onyeama\n\nThese are contained in the Annual Report of the Auditor-General of the Accounts of the Federation of Nigeria for the year ended, December 31, 2018.\n\nThe Auditor-General\u2019s report stated that when queries were sent to the ministry to explain the issues around how $68 million was disbursed, no responses were received.\n\nThe report reads, \u201cIssue 1 \u2013 Lack of accountability in the Disbursement of intervention fund for distressed missions - $68,875,902. Financial Regulations No. 415 states that \u201cThe Federal Government requires all officers responsible for expenditure to exercise due economy. Money must not be spent merely because it has been voted.\n\n\u201cAudit examination of the Ministry\u2019s accounting records showed that a total of US $68,875,902 was approved by the President as intervention fund for distressed Nigerian missions abroad. The sum which was in three tranches \u2013 USD32,873,896.68, USD28,810,217.80 and USD7,191,787.52 was meant to address challenges such as: missions\u2019 indebtedness, renovation and refurbishment of missions\u2019 chanceries and residencies, and replacement of broken-down representational vehicles.\n\n\u201cDetailed examination of the Ministry\u2019s accounting records however, revealed the following anomalies; one, the sum of N268,814,121.20 was diverted from the first tranche of the intervention fund and was expended on 'exigencies and sundry items', part of which N101,230,676.95 which, according to the documents presented by the Ministry, was for bank charges on remittance of funds by the Central Bank of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cNo explanation was given, nor documents released justifying how the balance of N167,583,444.25 was utilised.

Financial Regulations No. 415 states that \u201cThe Federal Government requires all officers responsible for expenditure to exercise due economy. Money must not be spent merely because it has been voted.\n\n\u201cAudit examination of the Ministry\u2019s accounting records showed that a total of US $68,875,902 was approved by the President as intervention fund for distressed Nigerian missions abroad. The sum which was in three tranches \u2013 USD32,873,896.68, USD28,810,217.80 and USD7,191,787.52 was meant to address challenges such as: missions\u2019 indebtedness, renovation and refurbishment of missions\u2019 chanceries and residencies, and replacement of broken-down representational vehicles.\n\n\u201cDetailed examination of the Ministry\u2019s accounting records however, revealed the following anomalies; one, the sum of N268,814,121.20 was diverted from the first tranche of the intervention fund and was expended on 'exigencies and sundry items', part of which N101,230,676.95 which, according to the documents presented by the Ministry, was for bank charges on remittance of funds by the Central Bank of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cNo explanation was given, nor documents released justifying how the balance of N167,583,444.25 was utilised. Two, documents evidencing the disbursement of the second tranche of USD28,810,217.80 such as distribution breakdown of the funds to the beneficiary missions, expenditure returns for money received, and request for settlements of indebtedness from missions were not presented.\u201d\n\nThe report added that sanctions should apply to the ministry since it failed to produce the documents to prove that it disbursed the funds appropriately.\n\n\u201cThree, while a request for the third tranche of USD6,691,787.52 was made, the Ministry got approval for the sum of USD7,191,787.52 which was later released, giving an excess of USD500,000.00.\n\nThe Ministry however approved the release of the excess to the Consulate-General of Nigeria in Dubai, which was originally not among the missions in need of intervention funds.\n\n\u201cThe issue had been communicated to the Permanent Secretary vide Management Letter Ref No. OAuGF/MAD/AI/2017/Vol.1/1 on 8th May, 2019 followed by two reminders vide Reference No. OAuGF/MAD/AI/2017/Vol.1/1b and OAuGF/MAD/AI/2017/Vol.1/1c dated 3rd July, 2019 and22nd August, 2019, respectively.

I am a strong black successful woman and I love my skin but will not allow this bully to run around the street emotionally abusing women!\n\n\u201cIn 2021 and on a beautiful day like this, when we celebrate fathers I didn\u2019t expect a message like this from another black man but this has to stop here!!! @oluwaseun Adeoye a Wells Fargo employee has to be called to order, we need to protect other women from people like him!!!\u201d\n\nIn its reaction, Wells Fargo commended Agbanobi for bringing the matter to its attention while asking her to forward details of the conversation to the company\u2019s email for proper review.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThank you for bringing this to our attention, Joyce, and we\u2019re so sorry to learn of this experience. Could you please send us an email at [email protected] with more details and the screenshot attached? We\u2019ll forward this to our HR department for review. Thanks,\u201d it replied.\n\nIt remains unclear if Adeoye is indeed a staff of the company as another user claimed \u2014 in the comment section of the post \u2014 that he works with the Bank of America (BoA).",

          "text": "In Hero Mode, all Troy wants is to work at Playfield, his mom\u2019s 12-year-old gaming company. But she insists he focus on a dull computer science course at school. The real reason, however, is that she wants him to have a \u201cnormal\u201d childhood away from video games.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem: Playfield is sinking. Their only potential angel investor bailed because their latest game sucked. A cheap buy offer from a rival is on the table.\n\nBut Troy convinces his mom to let him rebuild the game. He adds a rainbow that talks and a Barack Obama feature. And the rest is\u2026 actually, go watch the rest.\n\nReal life Troy stories are rare in Nigeria but an active gaming community is growing. Platforms like Twitch and Discord are spurring a global gaming economy and a means for financial independence for young Nigerians \u2013 like Olaide and Ying-Yi Akanji.\n\nThey met in 2012 at a GCE exam hall. When they started dating, Olaide introduced Ying-Yi (who is half-Nigerian, half-Taiwanese) to online gaming. Now married, they are an ardent gaming couple.\n\nWhile speaking with them on Tech Republic \u2013 a weekly radio show produced by 88.5 UFM Lagos in collaboration with TechCabal \u2013 I felt nudged to pick a controller and earn some recharge card money, at least. But how does a rusty Millennial get started?\n\nBelow is an excerpt of the chat with the Akanji\u2019s, edited for clarity. Most questions are from Tech Republic hosts Jay and Didi.\n\nJay: What\u2019s the situation with gaming in Nigeria?\n\nOlaide: I have been playing video games since I was a kid. My first Playstation 2 was from my dad. I became very good at gaming but I felt it couldn\u2019t take me anywhere because our 300kbps internet was so bad. Playing online was just impossible.\n\nThen I moved to the UK to study software engineering and everything was better. I dived into e-sports and built a following on Twitch. But I was not comfortable with a foreign audience. Gaming was more fun when I moved back. I could chat and banter on my streams in Pidgin and Yoruba.\n\nBut then came the issues \u2013 internet and electricity. It was demotivating to the point where I almost quit. The main problem was ping \u2013 a measure of how fast you get responses when you click to pass or shoot or any other action.\n\nOur problem here is that when you click on a button for any of those actions, it needs to travel to a server in Europe before it returns to Nigeria. And if you are playing against someone in Europe, their ping is much faster. I may shoot him first but it may not get to him when I do; then he shoots a second later and wins. That\u2019s why you have not seen Nigerians breakthrough internationally.\n\nDidi: Okay, how do I get into gaming? Can I start now even if I didn\u2019t play as a kid?\n\nOlaide: Yes you can! That\u2019s what I love about gaming. When people tell me they don\u2019t like video games, I say you haven\u2019t tried it out. There are so many games out there, it\u2019s impossible for you to hate them all.\n\nA 16-year-old kid won $3million playing Fortnite in 2019 and I actually played in that tournament. I made it into the top 1,000 from the initial 80 million people. The top 100 played in the finals in the US.\n\nBut that prize money shows how this sport has grown. I think the biggest prize money ever won in Nigeria was around \u20a65million.\n\nJay: This is really an untapped market in Nigeria\n\nOlaide: Oh my God, there\u2019s so much potential. I\u2019ve had many conversations with companies that want to get into online gaming but they fear the risks. And it\u2019s understandable because you need 24/7 electricity.\n\nI\u2019ve heard stories about NEPA taking power in the middle of a tournament. It\u2019s painful. When we compete against South Africans, they win because their internet is better.\n\nStill, the Nigerian gaming community is growing.\n\nDidi: How many female gamers are in Nigeria?\n\nYing-Yi: We have quite a few, but the gaming scene is saturated with guys. Girls in Nigeria have less time to play video games because they are more likely to do house chores, while guys can keep playing. Women gamers have to put in more effort. That means we are not a lot but we are getting there.\n\nParents also need to understand that gaming helps to improve cognitive reasoning of both boys and girls. Yes it can be sedentary but parents can set the balance between gaming and other activities.\n\nAlexander: So how do you pitch online gaming to people in government, as something good for the digital economy?\n\nOlaide: People are investing in electronic sports (esports) because every competition provides a level playing field for amateur and expert gamers. No connections needed.\n\nAnybody can buy a console, start playing and competing. Gamers like TimTheTatman are terrible at gaming but make millions because they make entertaining gaming videos. That opportunity should be open to all Nigerian youth looking for jobs and alternative income streams.\n\n\u2014\n\nListen to Tech Republic every Thursday at 2pm WAT on 88.5 UFM Lagos.

          "title": "How to avoid investment scams in Nigeria",
          "text": "\u201cDo you want to double your money in 10 days?\u201d\n\nInvestment scams tend to start off the same way.\n\nWhether it\u2019s a social media advert or a video of a celebrity telling you that an \u2018investment platform\u2019 made them millionaires overnight.\n\nThey all echo an alarming promise: \u201cgive us your money and we will give you more returns than you\u2019ve ever seen in the market \u2013 oh and did we mention your money is sure to come back to you?\u201d\n\nThese offers always seem too good to be true. And they usually are.\n\nOver the past few weeks, two different scams have been uncovered in Nigeria. Insha-Allahu Investment is the latest of them.\n\nWith a business name that roughly translates to \u2018If God Wills\u2019, the company\u2019s CEO is currently on the run after promising investors up to 20% Return on Investment (ROI) in two months. Many of the investors put in their life savings and in one case, their inheritance in a bid to multiply their money.\n\nInvestment is not a get-rich-quick scheme. It requires work. The work on your part as the investor is to perform due diligence and ensure your money is going to the right place.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that many more investment scams will continue to spring up. Days after Brisk Capital\u2019s CEO was arrested for fraud, a tweet featuring a popular celebrity made the rounds.\n\nThe power to become a millionaire is in your hands. Start your journey to become a millionaire today by Joining the great @mcivip known as Millionaire Club where you can invest and earn big.\n\n\n\nOfficial website: https://t.co/HMfsRY9aCspic.twitter.com/i0gqGXYzjJ \u2014 Instablog9ja (@instablog9ja) May 28, 2021\n\nIn it, the actor claimed that the company, Millionaires Club Investment, would give you 50% ROI (Return on Investment) in 3 days.\n\n\u201cOkay, but how?\u201d\n\nThis is a question that should follow every claim of returns. If a company tells you they plan to give you 30% of your money back in say, a month as Brisk Capital did, it\u2019s important to ask for details of how exactly they plan on making those returns.\n\nI spoke to Adedayo Bakare, COO of Money Africa and Oluwatomi Solanke, CEO of Trove Finance to get an idea of how to gauge if a deal is too good to be true.\n\nThey both agree that there is a relative benchmark to employ when discussing investments in the country \u2013 it\u2019s called the MPR (Monetary Policy Rate) \u2013 it\u2019s usually around the price of most of the government\u2019s debt instruments \u2013 like bonds and treasury bills.\n\nAs of March 2021, the MPR for Nigeria was 11.5% per year. To find out how much that is monthly, we just need to divide by 12 and we have roughly 0.96% per month.\n\nSo as a rule of thumb, if you have any \u2018investment platform\u2019 offering you significantly more than 0.96% ROI per month then you should proceed with caution. If they\u2019re offering less, then you shouldn\u2019t bother with them at all because you could get more by buying debt instruments directly from the government.\n\nInvestment is, by nature, risky. Legitimate investment platforms are usually keen to inform you of the risks involved when you\u2019re putting your money with them. If a person is promising you 30% monthly and telling you it is low-risk then they are already lying to you and you should not bother doing business with them.\n\nThis is the first step in finding out if an \u2018investment opportunity\u2019 is a scam \u2013 investigate their ROI claims and how they intend to turn them into a reality.\n\nIf a company tells you they are investing in the stock market \u2013 which admittedly can give you high returns \u2013 you must be aware of the risks. The market is volatile and can move up or down very quickly.\n\nIf they say they are investing in real estate then, as an investor, the onus is on you to ask questions about the real estate offerings. Are they selling land? Renting out buildings? How exactly are they able to make that much money from renting or selling land within a short time frame.\n\nIf you find that a company\u2019s explanation for the \u2018how?\u2019 is satisfactory, then you should go on to the next item on our checklist: Regulation.\n\n\u201cAnd you are licensed by\u2026?\u201d\n\nThis is probably one of the most essential checks you must perform before you hand over funds to an investment company.\n\nIt is not enough that a company is \u2018registered\u2019 as a business. Any street-smart hustler can register a business.\n\nAn investment platform you are considering must be either: registered with the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), licensed by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), or be affiliated with a company that is licensed by the SEC or the CBN.\n\nA company claiming to be a financial services company of any kind that has no connection to the SEC or CBN is one to approach with extreme caution.\n\nTo be extra sure, when a company tells you they are licensed with the SEC or gives you their affiliate company (or trustee), you can click here to confirm their eligibility.\n\n\u201cWho did you say you were again?\u201d\n\nContinue your due diligence by looking into the company\u2019s track record.\n\nIt is important to find out what credentials the owners or managers of these companies have. In the case of Dominic Joshua, a quick search would have raised some doubt about the veracity of a 21-year-old investment wunderkind with no real track record.\n\nThis step is especially important when you speak with referees or the company\u2019s brand ambassadors. You shouldn\u2019t put your money into a company just because a friend or family member told you it was great.\n\nYou should also check the company\u2019s track record and find out if fraud allegations have been levelled against its founders, senior leaders, or board members.\n\nPlatforms like ours, Nairaland and even Facebook have been around long enough to have picked up news on all kinds of scams and their perpetrators. It would be good to search for the names of those people and companies and see what comes up.\n\nFinally, making wise and well-informed investment decisions is a great idea but the journey to financial freedom is no walk in the park and requires careful research.\n\nSo the next time you or a loved one are faced with a new \u2018investment opportunity,\u2019 we recommend you share this article with them.\n\n*This is not investment advice\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Two unhealthy decades later\n\nOnly Rwanda, Botswana and Zambia have budgeted over 15% to health in the last two decades. In Nigeria, budget allocation for healthcare was 4.15% and 3.91% in 2017 and 2018 respectively, as data by TechCabal Insights shows.\n\n\n\nWith governments\u2019 poor performance, the burden of funding African healthcare has largely fallen on the shoulders of the private sector, which accounts for nearly 60% of financing. The continent relies on private providers for nearly 50% of its healthcare needs.\n\nEast and Southern Africa remain the regions most affected by HIV in the world. But as other diseases like Ebola and COVID-19 have shown, Africa\u2019s healthcare concerns are systemic, broad and in need of huge capital injection.\n\nAfrica has an estimated $66 billion-a-year health financing gap and in the absence of serious government efforts, donors and the private sector have come through.\n\nFrom 2019 to 2020, the value of PE and VC investments in African healthcare increased from 3% to 16% of total investments in the continent, according to the African Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (AVCA).\n\nBetween 2015 and 2020, 97 private equity and venture capital fund investments worth $1.3bn were made in health care in Africa. Most healthcare deals in that period happened in Nigeria (15%), Morocco (11%), Egypt (10%), South Africa (8%) and Ghana (8%). Boluwatife Sanwo/TC Insights\n\nHealth care, as an investment sector, can be narrowed down to a number of segments, according to the GICS classification system: Equipment & Supplies, Providers & Services, Technology, Biotechnology, Pharmaceuticals, and Life Sciences Tools & Services.\n\nAnd health technology (healthtech) has received the most attention recently in Africa.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2020, AVCA estimates that healthtech accounted for 35% of health care investments in Africa. In 2020 alone, healthtech was the bright star too \u2013 gulping 45% of health care investments.\n\nOne of the more eye-catching healthcare companies is mPharma. The Ghana-based startup is now present in 7 other countries and has raised over $40 million. It became a crucial partner in the Ghanaian government\u2019s vaccine distribution strategy this year and is tipped as one of Africa\u2019s next big companies..\n\nOther breakout healthcare startups in Africa include LifeBank, Helium Health and 54Gene in Nigeria, Ilara Health in Kenya, and Healthlane in Cameroon. These startups are filling critical gaps in blood products logistics, genetics data and hospital management technology to improve service delivery. More are coming on board.\n\nBoluwatife Sanwo/TC Insights\n\nAs with mPharma, new innovative health startups are relying on VC funding to rise to popular consciousness. To close the $66bn-a-year gap, the PE and VC community will be expected to invest larger checks at a faster rate in more startups. COVID-19, while an unfortunate pandemic, has spurred a welcome boost in visibility for healthcare startups.\n\nBut tough questions will have to be asked of governments as well. Are they doing their bit, at least keeping to what they agreed to 20 years ago? The first quarter of the 21st Century has only four years before it ends.

          "text": "The Buhari administration has stepped up efforts to regulate the online media in Nigeria in what is seen by many as attempts to further stifle the civic space in the country.\n\nTwo weeks after blocking Twitter\u2019s operations, the federal government has asked the House of Representatives to enact a law that will empower the Nigerian Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to control all forms of internet broadcasting and social media.\n\nThe request was made on Wednesday by the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, during a public hearing organised by the house committee on information, national orientation, ethics, and values on a bill to amend the NBC Act.\n\nThe commission already controls television and radio broadcasting in Nigeria, based on provisions in Section 2(b) of the NBC Act. It states that \u201cthe Commission shall have [the] responsibility of receiving, processing and considering applications for the establishment, ownership or operation of radio and television stations including cable television services, direct satellite broadcast and any other medium of broadcasting.\u201d\n\nLai Mohammed now wants the commission to also regulate the online media, in addition to other channels of broadcasting. \u201cI want to add here specifically that internet broadcasting and all online media should be included in this because we have a responsibility to monitor contents, including Twitter,\u201d the minister told lawmakers.\n\nBefore Lai Mohammed\u2019s proposal, the broadcasting regulator had asked all social media platforms and service providers in the online broadcasting space in Nigeria to apply for a broadcast licence.\n\nPossible clampdown on freedom of expression\n\nWidespread criticism has trailed the proposal by the Nigerian government, which has only further stoked concerns over a possible clampdown on free speech and internet freedom by the Buhari administration.\n\nMedia stakeholders at the public hearing kicked against the inclusion of online media under NBC\u2019s mandate, asking the panel to instead make the commission more independent of the Minister of Information.\n\nOver time, the NBC has acted as an extension of the Ministry of Information and Culture, which rarely acts independently, and thus, the commission\u2019s operations have often been subject to political interference. This was condemned by the International Press Centre (IPC) and the Centre for Media Law and Advocacy in a joint statement that called for the neutrality of the commission.\n\nAccording to Akin Akingbulu, executive director of the Institute for Media and Society, the commission should not receive directives from the information minister. \u201cThe power to give directives to the commission, vested in the minister of information in section 6 should be removed and replaced with powers which include policy formulation for the broadcasting sector.\u201d\n\n\u201cSocial media bill through the backdoor\u201d\n\nDespite the ban on Twitter, Nigerians continue to use the platform thanks to virtual private networks (VPNs) that help bypass the suspension. Many have taken to Twitter to express criticism over the proposed regulation of online media.\n\nBREAKING: NBC Amendment Bill Is Social Media Bill Through The Backdoor \u2014 SERAP (@SERAPNigeria) June 17, 2021\n\nAmendment of the NBC act;grafting the shoot of autocracy. \u2014 Senator Shehu Sani (@ShehuSani) June 17, 2021\n\nNigeria Govt is asking House of Reps to amend the NBC Act and include \u201cinternet broadcasting\u201d.\n\n\n\nThat means all online radio/TV stations must register with NBC and Lai Mohammed.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Google has announced opening up three new programmes targeted at supporting African entrepreneurs \u2014 the 6th cohort of Google for Startups Accelerator (GFSA) Africa, $3 million Black Founders Fund (BFF) Africa, and Google.org-backed $3 million grants for female entrepreneurs.\n\nFollowing a rigorous selection process earlier in the year, 15 tech startups have been chosen across the continent to participate in the GFSA; and the three-month online mentorship programme will begin today, June 21, 2021. Notably, the first virtual class of Google for Startups Accelerator Africa was launched last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nGFSA Cohort 6. Source: Supplied\n\nGFSA has graduated 67 startups from the past five cohorts \u2014 represented across 17 African countries \u2014 since it launched in 2018.\n\nCharles Murito, Google\u2019s Africa Policy and Government Relations Director, told Techpoint Africa that these startups are in turn accelerating the continent\u2019s economy, having collectively raised over $72 million in capital and provided 2,800 jobs after participating in the programme.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Founders Fund (BFF) Africa\n\nSimultaneously, applications will be opened for the $3 million Black Founders Fund for African startups in their early stage. The programme will have 50 African startups, led by Black founders, receive cheques between $50k and $100k.\n\nHowever, it is non-dilutive equity-free funding, which means the startups do not have to give up part of their shares to Google following the financing. In addition, the startups will get $220k in Google ads grants and cloud credits alongside training sessions and access to Google\u2019s network of mentors.\n\nEligibility\n\nTo be eligible for this, interested businesses must be a tech startup headquartered in either Botswana, Cameroon, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Ghana, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, or Zimbabwe; have a founding team of at least one black founding member, and possess technical skills to use Google\u2019s resources.\n\nHead of Google for Startups Accelerator Africa, Onajite Emerhor, adds that, for inclusiveness, the fund is open to companies that are focused on supporting the black community, not only those led by black C-level founders.\n\nQualified startups can apply here as applications close on July 7, 2021.\n\nSME grants and support for 500 female entrepreneurs\n\nMeanwhile, another $3 million has been earmarked as SME grants. This fulfils the company\u2019s promise to open funding initiatives to small businesses that are not online. The $3 million funds will be used to provide mentorship, coaching, and access to key markets for 5,000 female entrepreneurs with low digital skills come from rural areas and currently operate in an informal sector.\n\nThis will also include seed capital in the form of cash grants and Google product support for 500 aspiring female entrepreneurs. Beneficiaries will be chosen from Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, and select Francophone countries.\n\nFor two of the programmes, Google will be working with two African partners, with a thriving community of entrepreneurs, to disburse the funds \u2014 Co-Creation Hub (CcHUB) for BFF, while Tony Elumelu Foundation will be in charge of grants for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Google\u2019s 14 years of presence in Africa, it has at different times launched investments initiatives that are far-reaching into the continent, not only South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda, and Ghana, where it has physical offices. It has reached more locations through partnerships with tech hubs and startup communities in other locations.\n\nApart from funding, Google has also been actively involved in empowering African talents with digital skills. During his visit to Nigeria in 2017, Google CEO, Sundar Pichai, disclosed plans to train 10 million Africans in digital skills by 2022.\n\nIn January 2020, Google launched the Google Developers Space in Lagos, the first of its kind in sub-Saharan Africa \u2014 to serve as an incubation ground for innovators.

          "text": "Today, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nA possible policy on intellectual property in Nigeria\n\nSexual violence and tech\n\nThe latest news on 5G deployment in Nigeria\n\nNigeria\u2019s intellectual property policy\n\nNigeria may get an intellectual property (IP) policy soon. This was revealed by Nosakhare Uwadiae, Managing Partner, Gee Law Firm, at a webinar organised by the Advertising Practitioners Council of Nigeria (APCON) in collaboration with the Nigerian Copyright Commission (NCC).\n\nWhy should we care? Currently, Nigeria loses over $287 million to IP theft annually. This also affects foreign direct investment (FDI), research and development (R&D), innovation, and technology transfer.\n\nEssentially, as a result of Nigeria\u2019s weak lP policy regime, amongst several other factors, the country loses inflows from FDI. Of course, this is apart from the lack of domestic R&D, innovation, and technology transfer because of copyright and patent protection challenges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvery year that Nigeria has failed to address its failing IP policy regime, the country loses much-needed economy-boosting FDI. Citing the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), a PwC study says that the strength of a country\u2019s patent protection is positively correlated to FDI inflows.\n\nAnd for a developing country like Nigeria, a 1% increase in the strength of patent protection leads to nearly a 1% increase in domestic R&D. A similar increase in trademark and copyright protection corresponds with a 1.4% and 3.3% increase in domestic R&D, respectively.\n\nNo date yet: While we do not have a date yet, Uwadiae \u2014 one of the draftsmen working on the policy document \u2014 says the ongoing efforts will pay off this time around and will crystallise into a workable policy in the not too distant future.\n\nStill wondering why you should care? Check this out: Why the Nigerian tech ecosystem needs to take intellectual property rights more seriously.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, sexual violence, and tech\n\nIn recent times, sexual violence cases seem to be on the rise. According to the United Nations, COVID-19-induced lockdowns exposed vulnerable people to more risk of sexual violence in 2020.\n\nAn increased spate of reported official and unofficial cases led the Nigerian government to create a national database of sex offenders in 2019. Unfortunately, this was not enough, and an even worse increase during the pandemic led governors in all 36 states to declare a state of emergency on rape.\n\nThey also agreed to set up a sex offender register and sign laws to punish the crime.\n\nFast forward to May 2021, and Lagos State \u2014 one of the few with an active online sex offender register \u2014 disclosed that it had added 206 names to its list of sexual offenders between 2020 and 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOluwanifemi did a deep dive into the issue, highlighting the various ways tech and social media have helped combat sexual violence in Nigeria.\n\nRead: How tech tools create a safe space for sexual violence survivors in Nigeria\n\nMore on 5G deployment in Nigeria\n\nPhoto Credit: <a href=\u201dhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/[email protected]/49713123696/\u201d>Ivan Radic</a> Flickr via <a href=\u201dhttp://compfight.com\u201d>Compfight</a> <a href=\u201dhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\u201d>cc</a>\n\nIt appears 5G deployment in Nigeria is gaining even more traction. Umar Danbatta, Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC) CEO, has inaugurated a committee on Spectrum auction for 5G deployment.\n\nThis comes after the Commission signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Nigerian Communications Satellite (NIGCOMSAT) Limited on the use of C-Band Spectrum for 5G services in Nigeria.\n\nThe C-Band Spectrum is a mid-range frequency set at 3.6 GHz-4.2 GHz touted as the most suitable and appropriate frequency for deploying the 5G network services.\n\nRecall that the Nigerian Senate approved deployment plans after an investigation conducted by the Senate Joint Committee on Communications, Science and Technology, ICT, and Cyber Crimes and Primary Healthcare, and Communicable Diseases.\n\nThe Committee\u2019s mandate is to develop the Information Memorandum for the auction of the 3.5 GHz spectrum band, which will be used for the early deployment of 5G services in Nigeria. It will also develop an award process for the grant of these licences.\n\nThe Information Memorandum defines the process that the Commission has decided to adopt for the auctioning of the C-Band Spectrum. It will provide information on the Nigerian telecommunications market, details of the Spectrum, the pre-qualification process, the auction process, and an indicative timetable.\n\nWhile it has taken a while to get to this stage \u2014 2019-2021 \u2014 this is certainly great news for Nigerians despite the controversies which have shrouded 5G deployment in the country.\n\nLast week on Techpoint Africa\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading\n\nMicrosoft issues copyright takedown request over leaked Windows 11 build.

          "text": "Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s busiest city with a massive consumer market has overtaken Nairobi, Kenya\u2019s capital as home and a top destination for the greatest number of start-ups in Africa. Over 500 active start-ups operate out of Lagos.\n\nRead Also: Kenya overtakes Nigeria as top destination for start-ups investment deals in 2020\n\nThe most populous city in Nigeria gained five spots in 2021 to attain a global ranking of 122nd (127th in 2020) after switching places with Nairobi, which now ranks 136th, according to the Global Startup Ecosystem Index 2021 by StartupBlink that ranked 1,000 cities and 100 countries.\n\nThe large population of Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s commercial hub is one of the reasons for the rise in start-ups in the city.\n\n\u201cIt is not surprising that Lagos is the top start-up hub in Africa,\u201d Andrew S Nevin, Partner/Chief Economist, PwC, Nigeria said.This is because, according to Nevin, \u201cThere are big challenges to solve on a massive scale,\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s only solvable with innovation.\u201d\n\nThe country\u2019s top economic performer has one of Nigeria\u2019s highest urbanisation rates as more people arrive in search of opportunity, creating demand for accommodation, financial service products, roads, health care and electricity, amongst other things.\n\nAlthough Lagos is Nigeria\u2019s smallest by land area, the centre of excellence is Africa\u2019s largest, a densely-packed megalopolis that is home to an estimated 21 million people. Nigeria\u2019s most populous.\n\nOn its own, Nigeria\u2019s economic capital would rank as Africa\u2019s seventh-largest economy. Known for its traffic gridlock and entrepreneurial dynamism, Lagos alone is responsible for about 30 percent of Nigeria\u2019s gross domestic product. If Lagos was a country, its economy which is worth over $136-billion would not only be the seventh-largest in Africa, it would be ahead of Cote D\u2019Ivoire and Kenya.\n\nA breakdown of the report by StartupBlink, one of the world\u2019s most comprehensive startup ecosystem map and research centres revealed that Lagos was also ranked in the global top 50 cities for E-commerce & Retail Technology and in the global top 100 for both Transportation Technology and Education Technology, a natural by-product of the pandemic\u2019s digital acceleration.\n\nIbadan was another city that saw a massive increase in ranking, jumping 601 spots to 353rd globally and 2nd in Nigeria, surpassing the Nigerian capital of Abuja. The latter ranked 3rd nationally, fell 12 spots to 466th on the global ranking, while Port Harcourt decreased by 6 spots to 906th.\n\nThe newest Nigerian city in the rankings, Enugu, came out at the 978th spot globally and 5th nationally. Benin City increased 9 spots to 979th, while Kano jumped 14 spots to 981st. In total, Nigeria now has seven cities in the global top 1000 and continues to have the highest number of ranked cities of any African nation.\n\nAs a result, Nigeria reported one of the notable increases in Africa, it leapt 5 spots to now rank 63rd globally. It is the highest-ranking country in Western Africa and the 3rd highest-ranking country in Africa.\n\n\u201cNigeria has increased significantly, gaining 5 spots to rank 63rd globally. It is the highest-ranking country in Western Africa and the 3rd highest-ranking country in Africa,\u201d research analysts at StartupBlink, said.\n\nWithin Africa, the Global Startup Ecosystem Index 2021 showed that there were differences among sub-regions. Central Africa had no representation in the rankings; Eastern Africa grew from 4 to 6 countries in the global top 100. Northern Africa kept its three representatives in the global top 100, yet two of the three nations (Tunisia and Morocco) declined in rank.\n\nSouthern Africa had a good year; not only did South Africa join the global top 50 this year, but a second Southern African country (Namibia) joined the rankings.\n\nIt was a good year for Western Africa as all ranked countries (Nigeria, Ghana, and Cape Verde) improved their rankings.\n\nDespite nurturing unicorns like Jumia, an online shop for electronics, phones, and fashion, Nigeria, according to StartupBlink, faces some major challenges, such as a lack of financing options and even a lack of broadband internet infrastructure.\n\n\u201cGovernment entrepreneurship programs are present but need to be developed, as does legislation and public sector support,\u201d the report said.\n\nNigerian and Kenyan start-ups accounted for over 77 percent of the total investment attracted in 2020. Nigeria alone was estimated to have been backed by more than $600 million in venture capital funding in 2019.\n\nAccess to funding for many of the smaller start-ups in Africa\u2019s largest economy remains a key challenge that is crippling growth.",

          "title": "Why Buhari, APC failed in first four years \u2014 Senate President Lawan",
          "text": "The President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, has provided insight into why President Muhammadu Buhari and his party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), were unable to deliver on their electoral promises during their first four-year tenure.\n\nMr Lawan lamented that the plan of the APC to deliver on most of its promises to Nigerians was stalled in the first tenure of the President Buhari administration as a result of the feud between the National Assembly and the Executive arm of government.\n\nMr Lawan spoke on Monday night in a speech delivered to close the First Progressives Youth Conference 2021 which held at the International Conference Centre, Abuja.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhen we were voted in 2019 as leaders of the National Assembly, we were conscious of one thing, that our mandate that was given to us by Nigerians in 2015 had suffered disruption and dislocation.\n\n\u201cFor four years (2015 to 2019), our government could not perform optimally because of the then crisis between the parliament \u2013 the National Assembly \u2013 and the Executive arm of government.\n\n\u201cSo, APC had already lost four very important years. And, that was supposed to be the years that we should have convinced Nigerians that they took the right decision by voting out a PDP administration in 2015.\n\n\u201cWhat are our options? We are one party in different arms of government. Our policies are supposed to be the same. Our programmes and projects are supposed to be the same, whether you\u2019re in the legislature or the executive.\n\n\u201cSo long as you are APC, that is your programme and project, that is your government and you are bound to make it succeed.\n\n\u201cSo, we took the conscious decision of working in harmony that our relationship must be characterized by consultation, coordination, partnership and mutual respect, that we must succeed in the second tenure (2019 \u2013 2023).\n\n\u201cOtherwise, in 2023, many would like to see our backs if you can\u2019t provide the services expected of you in your first four years.\n\n\u201c[And] you to change and do better, why would anybody give you eight years?\n\n\u201cSo, we felt we have an obligation to Nigerians who voted for us, to our people in APC and to our country, that we must work in such a fashion and manner that government is able to deliver services to Nigerians.\u201d\n\nThe Senate President also said the APC may face challenges after the exit of President Buhari from office in 2023, except timely interventions are taken to avert same.\n\nAccording to him, the party must begin to plan ahead to sustain the goodwill and legacies of the present administration by ensuring that its leaders hand over power to competent youths in the All Progressives Congress.\n\nHe noted that by doing so, the party would be able to retain its appeal and nationalistic outlook beyond the 2023 general elections.\n\nMr Lawan said, \u201cWhether we like it or not, the truth is, President Muhammadu Buhari remains the person with the bulk of the support we get across this country in APC.\n\n\u201c[And] when he leaves, he would still have some roles, but I daresay that it is after he leaves office that APC will face its challenge.\n\n\u201cYes, we have to know our value then, and the value of APC presently is APC minus President Muhammadu Buhari. Whatever it is, that is the value of APC.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cSo, we need to do a lot to build this party, and we need our youths more than ever before for them to continue with this legacy that this administration has established all over the country.\n\n\u201cThat means we have to see our selves as brothers and sisters regardless of where we come from.\u201d\n\nThe Senate President added that, \u201cour tribe or even ethnic group, our religious persuasion should not matter when it comes to uniting this country.\n\n\u201c[And] as APC, the onus is on us to provide security and an economy that will bring growth and development to give people the kind of life that is meaningful.\n\n\u201cWe can ask others to join us, but we are the ones to do it, so we need all hands on deck.\u201d\n\nThe Senate President further disclosed that the ongoing amendment to the 1999 constitution will accord priority to inclusion of youths in governance.\n\nHe explained that the aim was to ensure that power is divested to younger generation in a way that allows them to participate in the process.\n\n\u201cPower is not given by opposition. When were out of power or when we came in, another party was in control of the country \u2013 the PDP.\n\n\u201cThere was no way the PDP could have given us power a la carte, but the people of Nigeria mobilized and, of course, that government was voted out.\n\n\u201cBut when it is a family affair, and this is my position, power is given not taken. Imagine yourself and your children, you want them to be better than you.\n\n\u201cBut when you say power will not be given, that family is dysfunctional. So, power is given and can be given. How I wish it would be given.\n\n\u201cI am with you and I am on your side. I am still on the side that we can give power to our youths.\n\n\u201cWe should enable them, prepare them and tell them this is the way to go. You have seen us do it, and you can do better because of the energy and capacity that you have.\n\n\u201cThese days, our youths have more capacities, what they may lack is that clout.\n\n\u201cSo, we also have to mentor our youths, but we have to give them the opportunity to participate in governance.\n\n\u201cI really feel we can do better to have more youths and more women in our government and party positions.\u201d\n\nSOURCE: PRESS UNIT OF THE SENATE PRESIDENT`S OFFICE",

          "title": "Government Plays Critical Role In Supporting Food Industry \u2013 Jaiyeola",
          "text": "How did the pandemic affect the business and operations of the company?\n\nAdvertisements\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pandemic had a significant impact on our business. Both our local and foreign supply chains were impacted by various lockdown measures implemented to minimise the spread of the virus. To mitigate this impact, we secured our supply chains by increasing our stock holding quantity of critical items and replacing imported manufacturing inputs with locally available substitutes where possible. This was particularly rewarding as it did not only ensure that we continued to operate as smoothly as the conditions permitted, but we were also able to collaborate with local suppliers to develop their capacity to supply based on our quality requirements.\n\nAdditionally, the combined effect of Naira devaluation due to lower oil prices and higher input costs led to significant increases in the cost of raw materials. The prevailing economic conditions due to lower spending power of consumers necessitated that increases in input costs could not be passed on fully to the customer. This compelled us to accelerate implementation of initiatives that improved our operational efficiency and optimized cost.\n\nThe lockdown period restricted movement and the delivery of products. While food manufacturing companies were exempt from movement restriction, we had to work closely with representative organisations such as NECA and MAN \u2013 who liaised with the Nigeria Police and state governors to ensure that the supply of critical food products were maintained. This ensured that our food products continued to be available to our customers nationwide. Turnaround time also improved following relatively freer road situations across the States.\n\nYou just generated over N100billion revenue in the financial year ending March 31, 2021, during a pandemic. How was this possible?\n\nAdvertisements\n\nIt was indeed a tough year for everyone, with significant effects on people\u2019s health and the national economy. Our thoughts go out to all those who have been impacted by the pandemic. As a major food manufacturer in a critical industry, we were convinced that once our people are safe and motivated, the business will be able to overcome any challenges that the pandemic brought.\n\nWe implemented a wide range of protocols across all our manufacturing locations to prevent the occurrence and spread of the virus and thankfully, we did not have to shut down any of our locations due to the outbreak. The peculiarity of the period enabled us to deepen our customer relationships which enhanced our ability to sell and offer competitive trade terms. We pioneered new ways of selling and developed relationships with new customers all over the country across the traditional and modern trades.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis and many other strategic initiatives implemented led to a high single digit volume growth overall year-on-year. Our consumer brands delivered a strong performance on the back of 40 per cent plus growth in pasta and double-digit growth in the Ball Foods category. The pasta performance was driven by increased capacity at the Sagamu Pasta factory.\n\nSome of your raw materials are sourced from overseas, how is the company coping with sourcing foreign exchange?\n\nWe explored partnership opportunities with as many financial institutions capable of establishing LCs (Letters of Credit) for the company and took advantage of non-deliverable forwards. We also leveraged our long-term relationships with our key foreign suppliers to relax their existing trade terms. This period also created a need to rethink and review the local wheat value chain development.\n\nOur major raw material, wheat is currently imported, however, as an industry, the Flour Mills Association of Nigeria (FMAN) has worked closely with the CBN and Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development to support further development of the wheat value chain in Nigeria \u2013 improving the ability of wheat growers to develop their capacity to deliver improved wheat varieties, cultivation techniques and provision of harvesting materials. More than ever, Government\u2019s support is needed in developing the local wheat industry.\n\nWhat challenges do you face that the government needs to address for companies like yours to remain in business?\n\nThe food and milling industry in Nigeria is a promising sector with opportunities to expand into other markets beyond Nigeria. However, the high cost of Nigerian processed food products occasioned by high input costs and other conversion costs such as power continue to negatively impact profitability, and limit investments in the sector. A general improvement in infrastructure, such as power and transportation, will go a long way in driving growth within the sector.\n\nToday, affordability and availability of basic foodstuffs is an uppermost consideration in the minds of many Nigerians. Our government has a critical role to support the food industry so we can honour our responsibilities to supply food to all parts of the nation. This can be done by ensuring sustainable infrastructure for logistics and reliable security across the country.\n\nThere is also a need to harmonise multiple regulators (SON, NAFDAC, Federal and State Agencies for Environment, Health and Safety, Consumer Protection Council, Ministries of Trade, etc.) that are currently operating across the manufacturing sector. This will enhance the ease of doing business with a far-reaching impact on the economy.\n\nFurthermore, it is becoming increasingly difficult to find properly skilled workers in the manufacturing sector as our education system is not creating work-ready graduates, leading to a need for employers to make significant investments for entry level roles. Also, there is a need to focus attention on technical education and the development of technical workforce as there is a dearth of the required skills to support maintenance efforts within the manufacturing sector.\n\nLastly, the food industry in Nigeria is a critical industry as it provides one of the most essential services in maintaining social cohesion, particularly as the trend for urbanisation takes large numbers of people into cities and away from basic agriculture. The food industry has built considerable expertise and capability to serve the nation with consistent supplies and reliable quality foods.\n\nGovernment needs to act as an enabler for this huge enterprise \u2013 encouraging further investment in both capacity, process technology and efficiency projects so that the industry\u2019s growth will match that of the growing population.\n\nWhat new project is the company involved in, in terms of expansion and R&D; and how is the capital for these projects being raised?\n\nThe next phase of our development is to be at the forefront of the carbohydrate industry, providing affordable, nutritious foods to our fast-growing population.\n\nHuge strategic opportunity exists for us in the development and commercialization of modern formats of indigenous carbohydrates, and we have commenced the development of an exciting opportunity in the indigenous tubers category that will significantly broaden our business base and serve as a source to generate foreign exchange through export.\n\nIn addition, we have identified agricultural commodities that can be aggregated locally for export.\n\nWe are currently ramping up our capabilities to efficiently source and aggregate such commodities. Capital for the execution of these projects will be a mix of debt and equity.\n\nplans to access short to medium term notes for the execution of some of our identified projects.\n\nHow is the company boosting investor confidence at this time? What should they expect in the next final year?\n\nOur overarching objective is to grow shareholder value in the medium to long term through consistent return to shareholders, consistent business growth, and consistently improving efficiency. This will underwrite future investment requirements. Our performance in the last financial year demonstrated our capacity for growth at both top and bottom lines, despite the challenging environment. We will continue to implement these successful strategies aimed at driving operational and financial performance in order to create significant shareholder value.\n\nWhat are company\u2019s medium and long term goals?\n\nIn the medium term, we are pursuing category expansion plans based on commercialization of locally available raw materials for food production.\n\nWe have identified five scalable food categories that will be developed over the next 10 years. These categories have both consumer and industrial food processing applications and provide us with potential for export. Our long-term goal is to be a highly valued foods business with a diverse portfolio of brands and products. We are determined to be at the forefront of the carbohydrate food industry providing affordable foods to a fast-growing population in Nigeria, and the African continent at large.",

          "text": "The Federal High Court, Abuja, has ordered Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) to pay the oil communities in Ibeno Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom cumulative damages of 81.9 billion over oil spillage.\n\nAdvertisements\n\n\n\n\n\nJustice Taiwo Taiwo, in a judgment debt, ordered that the payment must be paid within 14 days, and failure of which 8 per cent interest would be accruable on the principal sum annually.\n\nDelivering judgment yesterday in a joint suit instituted against the two defendants by the aggrieved oil producing communities, Justice Taiwo held that the American oil company and NNPC were negligent in the way and manner they handled oil spills that caused environmental degradation in the communities.\n\nTaiwo particularly took swipe at the NNPC for being interested in the revenue generations from the oil exploration at the expense of the lives of the people in the communities.\n\nHe said that he believed the oral and documentary evidence adduced by the plaintiffs to support their claims that lives were made miserable for them when their water and land were polluted through crude oil leakages from old oil pipelines.\n\nHe noted the claims of Mobil that it did clean up exercise and held that the oil giant failed to address the compensation that would have mitigated the economic losses of the people said to be mainly fishermen and farmers.\n\nAdvertisements\n\nBesides, the judge described as unreliable witnesses called by Mobil adding that for no reason they became evasive during cross examination by counsel to the plaintiffs.\n\nHe held that the oral and documentary evidence produced by Mobil Company were not in any way helpful to the court as they were targeted at serving predetermined interest.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe judge further said that some of the witnesses ought not to have come to the court at all going by the discrepancies in the documents brought to the court, adding that they only embarked on guess research that was not reliable.\n\nHe further held that both Mobil and NNPC were negligent by their failure to visit places of the leakages of the crude oil that led to the contermination of Rivers and creeks.\n\nJustice Taiwo rejected the claims of the Mobile joint venture partner, NNPC, that the suit was statute barred in 2012 when it was filed by the aggrieved plaintiffs.\n\nThe NNPC had claimed that the suit was not filed within 12 months by the plaintiffs as required by the provision of Section 12, Sub Section 1 of the NNPC Act, 2004.\n\nHowever, the judge held that the instant suit had to do with fundamental rights that cannot be rendered impotent by the statute of limitations.\n\nHe stated further that Section 11, Subsection 5 of the Oil Pipeline Act made it mandatory for oil companies to monitor and repair their pipelines to avoid spillages and environmental degradation.\n\nJustice Taiwo consequently awarded the sum of N42.8 billion as damages for intangible losses, N21.9 billion for special damages as annotated and N10 billion as general damages.\n\nThe Ibeno communities led by Obong Effiong Archianga and 9 others had through their lawyers, Chief Lucius Nwosu, SAN, brought the action against NNPC, Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited and ExxonMobil Corporation.\n\nThey had sought about N100 billion compensation for economic losses suffered from oil spillages caused by the defendants during exploration.\n\nThe 3rd defendant was however deleted from the court action when the court established that there was no cause of action against it.",

          "text": "Your Excellency, Having successfully celebrated yet another \u201cDemocracy Day\u201d in office, let me join millions of your well wishers and supporters worldwide in congratulating you on this auspicious occasion in our national lives. It is with greatest respect and deepest sense of responsibility that I write this open letter to you on the current inconsistencies and illogical presentations on the chieftaincy tussle in Mbula land.\n\nAdvertisements\n\n\n\n\n\nJust like Doctors without borders, so are the Journalists. Some might ask; what is Ibrahim\u2019s interest in the chieftaincy affairs of Mbula land and why should he write an open letter on an issue that has little or affinity to his pedigree? In this era of technology and globalization, the world is now a global village where public relations dazzles public good and contest of ideas overcomes conflict of personalities. As an indigene of Adamawa I am a concerned citizen and an interested party.\n\nYour Excellency, under the purview of your Government an abominable act that may likely desecrate our viable norms and values is about to happen in Mbula land. Our interest in this endeavour is to safeguard our traditional institutions from hijack by money bags that are desperate in undertaking a gradual but systematic dismantling and disintegration of our collective will and values.\n\nWith the demise of His Royal Highness, Jerome .J. Fwa, Murum\n\nMbula, just a couple of months ago or so, there are attempts by some people with godfathers\u2019 to truncate the traditional lineage of succession of the highly revered stool of Murum Mbula. This issue, your Excellency is as profoundly injurious to the tenets of our highly respected traditional institutions as it is to our democratic values. Towards this endeavour, it is my submission that the whole process lacks honest, transparent and selfless approach to good conscience and natural justices in every material, particular.The deceased, Murum Mbula, J.J. Fwa as he was fondly called, left a \u201cbig shoe\u201d to be occupied by his successors. I remember with palpable nostalgia his brilliance that dazzled mediocrity, his legendary kindness, wise counsel, virtues of humility, infectious charm and strength of character were attributes of a powerful ruler that cannot be easily forgotten. He was a source of inspiration that upheld the core values of tradition and culture. In Mbula land or better still Mbula federation, the line of succession falls within the brackets of two Royal clans of a bigger family of royalty. Duragi and the Ndantul clans. Going down\n\nmemory lane, it could be recalled that from 1885 when HRH Mboiman ascended the throne whose rein lasted to 1894, was of the Ndantul clan where kingmakers actively participated in his natural choice as a king. From then on, sapan1896 \u2013 1906 of the Duragi clan. This tradition of succession based on clannish identities continued to rotate between the two clans with Usman Mboiman 1928 \u2013 1943, Ndantul, constant Banabe 1943 \u2013 43 \u2013 Duragi, Biyapo Usman 1943 \u2013 63 \u2013 Ndantul, Joel Nzabusa Fwa \u2013 1963 \u2013 1993 \u2013 Duragi, whisky M, Usman 1994 \u2013 95 Ndantul and JJ Fwa 1995 \u2013 2021 \u2013 Duragi By natural succession plan based or rotational values as enshrined in their \u201ctraditional constitution\u201d it is now the turn of Ndantul clan to provide the next king.\n\nAdvertisements\n\nBut recent events are grossly disturbing as according to Stephen Hasso, a retired deputy Commissioner of Police is of the view that there is a willful and deliberate attempt to truncate the succession network of his people in Mbula land. He opened that about four contestants from the Fwa family representing the Duragi clan are at it again. He also raised fundamental objection as to why an Election Committee would be set up by the government as against the traditional \u201cKingmakers\u201d to elect the new MurumMbula.\n\nHe said \u201cI have never seen or heard anywhere in the history of chieftaincy where an Election Committee is forwarded by the government to elect a first class chief. Has Traditional Institution become INEC? The tradition is all over the place as same is applicable in Lunguda, shelleng and Bachama chiefdoms where Kingmakers elect the new king.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nYour Excellency, I think we should not lose sight of the bigger picture of the collateral damage this action may likely cause the traditional institution in Mbula land.\n\nUsing any parameter of our cultural practices, the imposition of an \u201cElectoral Committee\u201d to elect a king is an aberration and an anathema that is repugnant to equity, natural justice and good conscience.\n\nIn view of the foregoing and in the interest of fair play and justice to which Governor Ahmadu Fintiri is noted for, we believe that no responsible and responsive government would fold its arms in the face of glaring injustice and monumental underhand dealings in the process of electing a first class king. As a passionate and compassionate democrat of conscience who operates by the dictates of the \u201cBooks\u201d Governor Fintiri has history by his side for standing against injustice in this endeavor. As an exceptionally great strategic thinker whose love for humanity found its deepest and most profound expression in his commitment to social justice, we appeal to Governor Fintiri to stand his grounds against rapacious and destructive cleavages, spiraling indiscipline and deceptive impurity in Mbula chieftaincy tussle.\n\nIt is against this background that we appeal to the Governor that chieftaincy stool is not a \u201cbazaar\u201d where any hawk can hijack the process. Tradition must play a fundamental role as the people of Mbula Federation who have great respect for the Governor are expecting nothing less than a transparent process where the kingmakers would be accorded the traditional respect of choosing the right successor to the departed J.J Fwa.\n\n\u2013 Modibbo, Strategic Communicator And Analyst on National Issues is an Abuja based Journalist.",

          "text": "IDRIS AHMED, LOKOJA\n\nNational Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the National Drugs law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Brigadier-General Muhammed Buba Marwa (Rtd), has disclosed that no fewer than 14.3 million young and adult Nigerians from the ages of 16 to 64 years abuse hard substances.\n\nHe disclosed this at the weekend while delivering a speech at this year\u2019s Ogidi Day festival in Ijumu Local Government Area of Kogi State.\n\nThe NDLEA boss explained that at least 10.6 million people are addicted to cannabis being the commonly abused substance, and most worrisome is the indulgence of the young people who have been initiated at early age of 19\n\nAccording to Marwa, there is also increasing use of other psychotropic drugs, especially heroin by a growing number of young people who are mostly initiated at the age of 22 years.\n\n\u201cIn the past four months, we have arrested more than 2,180 drug traffickers, intercepted and seized over two million kilograms of assorted illicit substances such as cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, tramadol and cannabis. Broadly speaking, the agency has been able to seize drugs and cash worth over N90 billion within the first four months of this year\u201d. He stated.\n\nHe also disclosed that the agency has filed over 2,000 drug cases in court and over 500 have been sentenced and are currently serving different jail terms, while over 1,500 of the cases are still pending in court.\n\nMarwa noted with serious concern the negative effects of drugs on the users and the peace, security and meaningful development of the country, which has turned other citizens to victims of the consequences of drug abuse and trafficking, as no community in Nigeria is exempted from the drug scourge.\n\nHe therefore appealed to parents, elders and community leaders to awaken to the urgent and solemn task of saving the children and loved ones from the calamity of drug abuse by joining the war against drug abuse and drug trafficking.\n\nHe assured the Ogidi people of NDLEA anti-drug programmes in their communities, \u201cOur children need to be properly brought up and well-disciplined from home. To this end, the NDLEA has requested the establishment of drug control committees across all communities.\n\n\u201cThis way, we hope to convince Nigerians to see themselves as stakeholders in the effort to rid our country of this scourge of drug abuse.\u201d The Chairman said.\n\nHe equally counseled the Ogidi youths be of good behaviour to achieve a better tomorrow, by emulating good examples, \u201cIndeed, Ogidi is not lacking in illustrious sons and daughters who have brought fame to their hometown in various fields of endeavours.\n\n\u201cWe have a good example here today in Chief (Mrs) Nike Okundaye, the Yeye Oba of Ogidi, a world-renowned artist who rose from this village to become a global cultural icon.\n\n\u201cThe illustrious list of Ogidi indigenes includes the late Sunday Bada, the Olympic athlete who is Nigeria\u2019s household name in sports, the president of Ogidi Development Union, Mr Kayode Eniolorunda, who retired recently as a top Immigration officer, the present National Commissioner for Insurance, Mr O.S. Thomas and several other eminent people including professors and military Generals. These are role models that should inspire the young people of Ogidi.\u201d\n\n\u201cTherefore, I urge the young people of Ogidi to be patient, to remain hardworking and to shun all forms of drug abuse and trafficking.

The initiative to help African countries produce vaccines is especially urgent at a time when cases and deaths on the continent have increased by almost 40% over the past week.\n\n\u201cToday I am delighted to announce that WHO is in discussions with a consortium of companies and institutions to establish a technology transfer hub in South Africa,\u201d WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a news conference.\n\nIn a statement, the WHO described the hub as a training facility, \u201cwhere the technology is established at industrial scale and clinical development performed. Interested manufacturers from low- and middle-income countries can receive training and any necessary licenses to the technology.\u201d\n\nThe two South African companies participating so far were Afrigen Biologics, described as a development company, and Biovac, described as a manufacturer.\n\nWHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said the WHO was in negotiations with Pfizer and Moderna , which have both produced vaccines widely used in rich countries using new mRNA technology, which sends instructions into the body to make proteins that trigger an immune response.\n\n\u201cWe could even expect to see within 9 to 12 months vaccines being produced in Africa, in South Africa,\u201d Swaminathan said.\n\nSouth Africa was also still pushing separately for a waiver to intellectual property rules governing COVID-19 vaccines.",

          "text": "During the 2015 presidential election campaign, one of the primary manifestos of the All Progressives Congress, APC, was to restructure the country for total transformation, according to NewsDirect.\n\nExpectations were high following President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s election victory, as Nigerians patiently awaited the new political system promised on the campaign trail, only to find gestures indicating otherwise.\n\nDr. Chris Ngige, Minister of Labour and Employment, informed Nigerians on September 6, 2016, that the president was still working to fulfill his campaign pledges, particularly the restructuring of the country.\n\nThe Minister told journalists in Awka, Anambra State, said the Buhari administration has already begun the restructuring process, beginning with the economy.\n\nHe said, \u201cNigerians have changed their way of doing things for the better and have become more prudent and judicious in their spending pattern.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one after the other. After economic restructuring to reposition the economy of this country, the Buhari administration will embark on the political restructuring and will set the modalities for the exercise.\u201d\n\nHowever, the president, who has been silent on the reorganization for years, has recently spoken out against calls for a new political structure.\n\nOn June 19, the president declared that his administration will not restructure the country, claiming that those advocating for split and restructuring are foolish and uninformed about war.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe other issue is that those who are currently calling for restructuring and conference on what they call ethnic nationality, If you go to Southern Kaduna, Taraba, who is to represent them? We have a different combination of ethnicity in many parts of the country. Even Kano and Kaduna Igbo have properties. The same goes for Yorubas.\n\n\u201cThere are Fulani in Port Harcourt, Rivers State. So those calling for whether separation or restructuring, some of them I will say they are very naive or even mischievously dangerous. Those agitating for restructuring are ignorant of war and its consequences. Because Nigeria is a dominant force in west Africa\u201d.\n\nThe president\u2019s declaration has continued to trigger reactions from concerned Nigerians as many took to their social media handle to lambast the president.\n\nA former presidential aide, Reno Omokri described Buhari\u2019s promise as an election scam stating that it was the promise that gave him the victory in 2015.\n\n\u201cIf a Nigerian youth makes a false promise of marriage to a woman and obtains money from her, the EFCC will arrest him for \u2018romance scam\u2019.\n\n\u201cYet, Buhari made false promises to restructure Nigeria and obtained votes from Nigerians based on that. Is that not an\u2018 election scam\u2019? The biggest issue General Buhari campaigned on in 2015 was restructuring. Now, he says he will NEVER restructure Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIs that not a scam? That is deceit. That is obtaining votes by false pretences. That is why the Southwest and Southeast are agitating for secession.\n\n\u201cMay Buhari not drive Nigeria to war! Twitter deleted his tweet and he banned them. What about all the promises he made that he has now deleted? Should we ban Buhari too\u201d.\n\nA respondent, Promise Emeka who spoke to DAILY POST in Abuja, said the president used restructuring to market himself during the election.\n\n\u201cThey knew very well that the Southeast and South-South belong to the People\u2019s Democratic Party, PDP so they used restructuring to deceive our leaders to win the election.\n\n\u201cSeven years after the election, we are yet to get the promise. The Southern Leaders need to wise up. Northerners have a different agenda for this country than what we can see. They are afraid of standing alone and that is why the country would remain the way it is.\n\n\u201cThe only thing they know is dragging us back and that is why we are agitating for our own sovereign nation, Biafra. No mallam will come to Biafra after our freedom to tell us how to run our government\u201d, he stated.\n\nSimilarly, an On-Air Personality, Mr Alfred Ademola expressed shock that Buhari \u2018Mr Integrity\u2019 would lie to millions of Nigerian.\n\n\u201cHonestly we thought this man was a Messiah, someone who has all qualities of a good leader not knowing that we were heading for doom.\n\n\u201cFirst it was the promise of paying youths five thousand Naira for being jobless, which even the one who used to be a pastor denied openly. \u2018Kai! This country na joke\u2019.\n\nI don\u2019t even think about this administration anymore, I have learnt to live with the reality since I cannot change the situation. May God give us life so we can try again in 2023 but are we going to have a candidate from a foreign country? Is it not these deceivers that will present candidates to us? It is well with Nigeria.",

          "title": "Sani-Bello\u2019s order to special squad: Comb the forest and free 136 kid-abductees",
          "text": "Niger state Governor Abubakar Sani Bello has ordered a combined security squad to comb the forest and battle the bandits to rescue the 136 children abducted over two weeks ago.\n\nHis action is coming on the heel of a similar feat in Kebbi where the governor, Atiku Bagudu vowed to crush abductors of some unspecified number of students and staff members of Federal Government College, Birnin Yauri Thursday.\n\nThe move by Bagudu, who insisted on no ransom for the hoodlums, is yielding the desired result as 11 of the captives had been rescued as at the time of this report.\n\nBello\u2019s past outcry\n\nGovernor Sani Bello had at various times cried out to the federal government to come to his people\u2019s aid who had remained under bandits\u2019 siege.\n\nAnd when none seemed to be coming, the governor accused Abuja of abandoning his people to their fate, warning that Abuja was not also safe as the criminal elements were just two hours away from the nation\u2019s capital city.\n\nFurther to that, the governor was also quoted to have recently said there were informants within his government.\n\nTime to act\n\nBut talking tough and set for action, the governor said he was ready to take the battle to the bandits\u2019 hideouts.\n\nAddressing a security squad comprising the Military, Police, Civil Defence, and Vigilante Corps at Kagara, Rafi local government area of the state Monday, the governor said the government had resolved to take decisive measures in ensuring the safe return of the children.\n\n\u201cEven though we have ruled out payment of ransom, it is time for government to take decisive measures towards ending the bandits\u2019 activity that is forcefully changing the lives of the people especially in the rural areas.\n\n\u201cThe abductors are not honest, they are not honourable. After agreeing with parents, they started shifting goal post and now we are here to take action,\u201d the governor said.\n\nRecalling how banditry started in the state, the governor said the criminals \u201cdisplaced farmers from their farmlands before moving to burning farms, kidnappings and forcing us to close our schools. Now they have started attacking Islamic schools, only God knows what is next.\u201d\n\nGovernor Sani Bello further said \u201cmost of the bandits are foreigners hired to cause problems for us. The true Fulani herdsmen don\u2019t indulge in this kind of acts.\u201d\n\nHe called on the federal government to \u201ccollaborate with neighbouring countries to flush them out since it is clear that these bandits are foreigners.\n\n\u201cThese bandits are well organised and coordinated. We cannot fold our arms anymore but to take decisive and necessary steps to apprehend those involved both the informants and the bandits.\u201d\n\nSani Bello commended the security personnel for their efforts at tackling the bandits in the last few weeks, adding, logistics had been provided to enhance the assessment.\n\nThe governor mourned the recent killing of 20 Vigilante Corps Members by the bandits in Magama local government.\n\nWhile at the palace of the Emir of Kagara, Governor Sani Bello commiserated with parents of the abducted children, urging them to exercise patience as government was exploring all avenues to ensure their safe rescue.\n\nHeadmaster speaks\n\nAddressing journalists, headmaster of the Islamiyyah School, Mallam Abubakar Alhassan commended government\u2019s resolve to combat the bandits, saying \u201cthis is a welcome development provided that the children will be brought back safely.\u201d\n\nHe said 15 of his teachers escaped from their abductors in Zamfara state with 4 already in Kagara and 11 in military facility in Birnin Gwari, Kaduna state where they would be handed over to the Niger state government soon.\n\nOyo on insecurity\n\nIn a related development, Oyo state Governor Seyi Makinde has declared that his government would continue to take the issue of security of lives and property seriously to ensure people go about their lawful endeavours.\n\nThe governor stated this in Ibadan Monday while speaking at the inauguration of the Board of the Oyo State Security Network Agency, codenamed Amotekun, held at the Executive Chamber of the Governor\u2019s Office, Secretariat, Agodi, Ibadan,\n\nGovernor Makinde stressed that his administration was committed to tackling the security challenges in the state; assuring people of the state would see more visible actions from government to secure the state.\n\nThe governor maintained that contrary to the negative pictures being painted by those hell-bent on politicising the security situation, a lot more people and businesses have been coming to the state as a result of the policies of the administration.\n\n\u201cWell, some of these people are saying insecurity is the major challenge in Oyo state. Yes, the country is going through quite a bit but I challenge them to a debate. I am ready. Let them come and tell us what they will be doing differently. They have nothing to offer the people of Oyo state apart from wanting to ride on the perception of insecurity to gain prominence.\n\n\u201cI have been listening and watching people trying to politicise the issue of security. Well, I want to appeal to such individuals within the state; it is our state and it is only God that puts people in position. If you want to destroy your state before everybody to gain political power, I wonder what kind of state such an individual or group of people will want to preside over.\n\n\u201cWe have seen cases where they doctored videos to discredit Amotekun. We have seen cases where people go out and lie outright. Now, everybody has been on the street as an advisor on security. They have all sorts of advice they gave to me and I asked them where they practiced their own security. They have not gone beyond their streets, maybe they organised neighbourhood watch and they think that it is the qualification on how to advise us on the issue of security.\u201d\n\nHe further said: \u201cWe know that because of the policies of this administration, a lot of people are coming into Oyo State, and when you have more and more people coming in, it will come with its own set of challenges and with opportunities as well.\n\n\u201cIn the days ahead, we will also let the people of Oyo State know the things we are doing as far as security is concerned. And when they see security operatives all around, they must give them total support.\u201d\n\nThe governor stated that the 12-member Board has as its chairman Brigadier-General Ajibola Kunle Togun (rtd) and Mrs. Akinbode Iyabode Enitan as Secretary with some of its members to include the Amotekun Commandant, Colonel Bisiriyu Olayinka Olayanju (rtd), the Commissioner of Police; State Commandant of the Nigeria Security and Defence Corps; representative of the Armed Forces of Nigeria in the state; and the Executive Secretary, Oyo State Security Trust Fund and Special Adviser on Security, COMPOL Fatai Owoseni (rtd) among others.",

          "text": "The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) on Monday announced that it has reduced the life ban imposed on former Head Coach of Nigeria\u2019s Super Eagles, Samson Siasia to five years.\n\nWorld football governing body, FIFA, had slammed Siasia with life ban over alleged match fixing scandal.\n\nHowever, the Court ruled that Siasia was a first offender and it would be injustice to ban him for life even when he has not received any financial benefit from the deal that brought the punishment on him.\n\nThe judgement was delivered after CAS heard Siasia\u2019s appeal earlier.\n\nThe CAS said in a media release Monday afternoon that \u201cCAS has issued its decision in the appeal filed by the Nigerian football coach Samson Siasia against the decision rendered by the Adjudicatory Chamber of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) on 11 April 2019 (the Challenged Decision).\n\n\u201cIn such decision, Samson Siasia was found guilty of infringement of article 1 (bribery) of the 2009 FIFA Code of Ethics and sanctioned with a life ban from taking part in any kind of football-related activity at national and international level (administrative, sports or any other) and a fine of CHF 50,000 was imposed on him.\n\n\u201cIn 2010, a match fixer tried to involve Mr Siasia as a coach of a club under his strict instructions. With the promise of employment benefits, Mr Siasia would have had to always field several players under the control of the match fixer.\n\n\u201cThe negotiations between the match fixer and Mr Siasia in relation to the conditions of employment were conducted by email over a period of two months. \u201cEventually, the club did not accept or could not afford Mr Siasia\u2019s requests and the negotiations ended.\n\n\u201cThe CAS Panel confirmed the Challenged Decision, with the exception of the following elements:\n\n\u201cMr Siasia is banned for 5 (five) years from taking part in any kind of football-related activity at national and international level (administrative, sports or any other) as of 16 August 2019.\n\n\u201cThe imposed fine of CHF 50,000 (fifty thousand Swiss Francs) on Mr Siasia is set aside.\n\n\u201cThe Panel determined the imposition of a life ban to be disproportionate for a first offence which was committed passively and which had not had an adverse or immediate effect on football stakeholders, and that a five-year ban would still achieve the envisaged aim of punishing the infringement committed by Mr Siasia.\n\n\u201cThe Panel acknowledged the need for sanctions to be sufficiently high enough to eradicate bribery and especially match-fixing in football.\n\n\u201cHowever, the Panel considered in the particular circumstances of this matter that it would be inappropriate and excessive to impose a financial sanction in addition to the five-year ban, since the ban sanction already incorporated a financial punishment in eliminating football as a source of revenue for Mr Siasia, and considering that Mr Siasia had not obtained any gain or pecuniary benefit from his unethical behavior.\u201d",

Sonny Echono, the Minister revealed that plans are underway to establish a National Institute of Technology,NIT, in Abuja.\n\nHe said the Institute shall be patterned after similar institutions in Singapore and Malaysia to serve essentially as a postgraduate centre devoted to research and innovation, drawing the best graduates from the six Universities of Technology, as well as other exceptional graduates from reputable universities within and outside Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI am pleased to inform you that President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the phased development programme, compelled by our lean resources.

These shall lay a solid foundation for building national preparedness and resilience in anticipation of future challenges in the health sector while reducing medical tourism to countries like India, UAE, Egypt, Europe and the USA,\u201d he said.\n\nAdamu said president Buhari has approved a take-off grant of N4 Billion each for the Universities of Technology and N5Billion each for the Universities of Health Science from the funding Resources of Tetfund for early take-off.\n\nHe however disclosed that the Federal Ministry of Education will collaborate with the Federal Ministries of Health, Science and Technology, Communications and Digital Economy, the FCT Administration as well as other relevant agencies and Institutions to facilitate speedy actualization of these Legacy Projects of the Buhari Administration.",

          "text": "Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, has stated that the success of the Continous Voter Registration, CVR exercise, slated to kick-start on Monday 28th June, lies largely with citizen\u2019s awareness.\n\nChairman of the Commission, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, made this known today, during the second quarterly meeting with media organisations at the INEC\u2019s headquarters in Abuja.\n\nHe maintained that with the creation of more 56,876 polling units across the country and bringing the total to 176,846 polling units, in its bid to expand voters\u2019 access to polling units prepares the ground for the discharge of another important responsibility of the Commission, which is the registration of eligible Nigerians as voters and which is one of the immediate tasks before the Commission.\n\n\u201cWe intend to undertake the CVR exercise over a period of at least one year. The success of the exercise depends to a considerable extent on citizens\u2019 awareness through voter education. There will be new registrants, requests for intra-State and inter-State transfers as well as the replacement of voters\u2019 cards as provided by law. Furthermore, with the relocation of voting points to underserved areas as autonomous polling units, there is need for massive publicity so that citizens are familiar with their voting locations well ahead of all forthcoming elections. We appeal for your partnership to achieve this goal,\u201d Yakubu said.\n\nThe CVR exercise which is scheduled to commence on 28 June 2021 with an online pre-registration for a period of three weeks, will subsequently take place in 2,673 designated centres nationwide and subsequently devolve to the INEC LGA/Area Council Offices based on assessment of security report.\n\nOn the attacks on INEC\u2019s offices and damages done to its facilities in recent times and the readiness for subsequent elections, the INEC boss maintained that the Commission is not sitting aloof, as it is putting heads together to do the needful at ensuring that the electorates are not disenfranchised.\n\nIn his own remarks, Chris Isiguzo, President Nigerian Union of Journalists, he expressed delight that the previous engagements of the Union with the Commission has come to fruition and that the process of digitizing the electoral process has just started and that it will pave way for credible electoral process devoid of rancour, hitches and other challenges that face the electoral process.\n\n\u201cWith the leadership in INEC now, things are getting better.\n\n\u201cI hope with the off-season elections in Ekiti and Osun States, things will keep on getting better.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any other country, therefore, we will all try to put in our best in deepening our democracy,\u201d Isiguzo added.",

No. KPE60AA, two (2) expanded cartridges and One Super Cub Motorcycle.\n\nThe suspect confessed that the Two (2) vehicles were robbed by two of his gang members, Ferdinand and one other in Imo and Anambra State respectively. The said gang members were alleged to have fled the scene on sighting Police on the day he was arrested. Chijioke Oke denied taking part in the Car snatching and armed robbery but confessed to being a member of Ayes Confraternity and had taken part in many cult clashes that have claimed many lives in the State.\n\nI, therefore, call on the general public particularly those whose vehicles match the description of the stolen vehicles to come along with proof of ownership for possible claim of their vehicle(s).\n\nMeanwhile, frantic effort is ongoing to apprehend the fleeing suspects.\n\nAt this juncture, I wish to commend the gallant efforts of the officers and men of the Command who took the fight to the hoodlums while putting their lives on the line with these mega achievements to restore peace and tranquillity in Ebonyi State, I also appreciate the collaborative support of other Sister Security Agencies, the Military, DSS, personnel of Ebube-Agu Security Outfit, local Vigilantes and other law-abiding Citizens in the State.\n\nI must extend my profound gratitude to our amiable Inspector General of Police, IGP Usman Alkali Baba, psc+, NPM, fdc for his huge support to the command since his assumption of office.\n\nI wish to thank immensely His Excellency, the Executive Governor of Ebonyi State, Chief Engr.

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nHalima Gayam, Lafia\n\nIn February, youths in Mada station community in Nasarawa state began to loosen and cut railway tracks that connect the area to the rest of the country.\n\nAlthough the Mada station tracks, about 130km away from Abuja, had not been in use for about five years, the infrastructure was still good enough for the vandals.\n\nBy June, most of the route\u2019s six tracks laid bare, except for its ballast.\n\nThe portions left untouched were only those protected by the wheels of an abandoned coach.\n\nEven the culvert under the tracks were dug and the water pipes vandalised.\n\n\u2018Night operation\u2019\n\n\u201cWe were not happy about it,\u201d a resident of the community Mikailu Abdullahi, told Channels Television. \u201cWe did our best to stop them, but we couldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nSome community members reported the vandalisation to the police and the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), but they were told there weren\u2019t enough arms to enforce arrests, according to a staff of the Nigeria Railway Corporation in Mada station who pleaded anonymity.\n\n\u201cThe youths came in numbers at night to vandalise the tracks,\u201d the staff said. \u201cIn one of the incidents, six armed men came here to arrest a trailer loaded with railway materials. But they couldn\u2019t make the arrest because the youths refused.\u201d\n\nAnother railway staff suggested that the youths were motivated by a sense of entitlement.\n\n\u201cThe youths are claiming that the tracks are their father\u2019s and they have to chop (eat),\u201d he said. \u201cThey are also claiming they are indigenes of the area, so nobody can stop them to do whatever they want to do.\n\n\u201cWe did our best (to stop them). When we reported to the nearest police station and civil defence, they said there are no arms and mobility. So this is how the vandalism continued.\u201d\n\nIn May, the police stepped in and have now arrested 35 of the vandals, including two Chinese nationals, local politicians, police and NSCDC officials, and a railway official.\n\nChinese connection\n\nThe youths, according to the police, were in cahoots with several top politicians, corrupt police officers and NSCDC staff, and Chinese nationals.\n\nAfter welders perform the loosening and cutting, the tracks and sleepers are piled and arranged in lorries, before they are ferried to a steel company run by a Chinese suspect, Marra Thai.\n\nMr Thai is said to be the main collector of the vandalised tracks.\n\nAccording to the Nasarawa Commissioner of Police, Bola Longe, the tracks are compressed and dissolved \u201cand then later on they will mass produce new ones and use it for us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know whether it is legal or not,\u201d Mr Thai, whose steel company is based in Abuja, said when asked why he received vandalised tracks. \u201cAnd we asked somebody to confirm it, and they said there was no problem. That\u2019s why we collected it.\u201d\n\nBut the police said Mr Thai\u2019s lawyer offered a N600,000 bribe when the police caught up with his client.\n\nAniette Eyoh, the officer who heads the anti-vandalism template created by the police, rejected the bribe. One lorry driver implicated in the vandalism operation also offered Officer Eyoh N150,000.\n\nThe monies were displayed when the suspects were paraded this month.\n\n\u201cWe have resolved, with unbending determination, that whosoever comes into our radar, no matter who, will be seen, and the person will be arrested and treated in accordance with the provision of the law,\u201d Mr Longe, the police chief, said.\n\n\u2018An act of terrorism\u2019\n\nThe vandalisation of rail tracks is a recurring headache in Nigeria. While the Federal Government has prioritised the revitalisation of the country\u2019s railway network, vandals appear to have upped their activities.\n\nThis month, the police announced that it had cracked down on a criminal syndicate engaged in vandalising rail tracks across the North-West and North-Central.\n\nThe operation was uncovered after the police raided a warehouse in Gboko, Benue state.\n\nInside the warehouse, the police discovered different vandalised rail equipment, stolen rail installation racks, weld-shear, rail puller, other rail accessories and consumables.\n\nBut many of the syndicate members are still at large.\n\nThe Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed, has described such vandalisation as acts of terrorism.\n\n\u201cRemoval of rail tracks can cause train derailment, with deadly consequences,\u201d he said at a town hall meeting recently.\n\nWhile promising to prosecute anyone suspected of vandalising public property, the Minister has also pleaded with Nigerians to take ownership of the assets, as they \u201cmust be protected for the benefit of all.\u201d",

We all want to win,\u201d Levy told the club\u2019s official website.\n\n\u201cOne of the items that Fabio will have to deal with when he comes in is which players are going to be retained, which will be asked to look for other clubs.\n\n\u201cThere is a market out there. What we want and what other clubs want is not always possible to achieve. We will do whatever is right for the club.\u201d\n\nLevy confirmed Spurs will be active in the transfer market this summer, but was keen to restrict expectations about how much money they could spend.\n\nMan City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak, meanwhile, said after last month\u2019s Champions League final that the club will be \u201ccompetitive and aggressive\u201d this summer, and are aiming to strengthen by bringing \u201cquality to the squad in a couple of key positions\u201d.\n\nThe Premier League champions\u2019 priority is to replace Sergio Aguero, with Kane being considered along with Erling Haaland, Romelu Lukaku and Lautaro Martinez.\n\nMan City begin their Premier League title defence by travelling to Tottenham on August 15.",

This is the order of this court,\u201d the judge declared.\n\nNAN reports that the Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa and Rivers governments sued the AGF at the Supreme Court, demanding an upward adjustment of the shares of revenues accruing to the Nigerian government whenever the price of crude oil exceeds $20 per barrel.\n\nIn the apex court verdict delivered in October 2018, John Okoro, ordered the Nigerian government to embark on an upward adjustment of the shares of revenues accruing to the government whenever the price of crude oil exceeds $20 per barrel.\n\nThe three oil states in the Niger Delta; Rivers, Bayelsa and Akwa-Ibom, had approached the Supreme Court for interpretation of Section 16(1) of the Deep Offshore and Inland Basin Production Sharing Contract Act in suit number SC964/2016 filed on their behalf by their lead Counsel, Lucius Nwosu, SAN.\n\nThe particular section requires the Federal Government to adjust the shares of the revenue accruable to the federation, whenever the price of crude oil exceeds $20 per barrel.\n\nAccording to the Bayelsa government, the money had accrued from 2003 to 2017.",
