          "text": "There was a mild drama at the South-West All Progressives Congress\u2019 presidential aspirants and leaders meeting on Friday.\n\nImpeccable sources at the meeting told Saturday PUNCH that the Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, pointedly refused to shake the party\u2019s National Secretary, Iyiola Omisore\u2019s hand or sit next to him and Osun State Governor, Gboyega Oyetola.\n\nThe meeting was convened by the former interim National Chairman of the APC, Chief Bisi Akande, and a former governor of Ogun State, Chief Segun Osoba.\n\nThe crisis between Aregbesola and Oyetola became public knowledge after the minister opposed the governor\u2019s second term bid.\n\nWhen Aregbesola was about to have his seat at the meeting, he asked the Governor of Lagos, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, \u201cGovernor of Lagos, where is my seat?\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu replied, \u201cSir, (it is) beside Baba \u2013 Omisore.\u201d\n\nAfter Aregbesola\u2019s objection, others at the meeting subsequently intervened by declaring free sitting in a short video that surfaced online.\n\nHowever, Aregbesola greeted Bola Tinubu and was embraced by both Akande and Osoba, including others, when he arrived at the meeting.\n\n\u201cAregbesola was expected to sit down next to Omisore and Oyetola, but he refused to associate with them, deciding instead to sit far off. Attempts by the elders to make Aregbesola change his mind proved abortive as he said he didn\u2019t want to be associated with Omisore,\u201d one of the sources told Saturday PUNCH.\n\nWhen contacted on Saturday, Sola Fasure, the Media Adviser to Aregbesola, said he could not comment on the matter because he was not at the meeting.\n\nThe meeting was convened by the former interim National Chairman of the APC, Chief Bisi Akande, and a former governor of Ogun State, Chief Segun Osoba.\n\nAlso at the meeting were the Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola; Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila; Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Chief Niyi Adebayo; governors Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo, and Dapo Abiodun of Ogun.\n\nOthers include a former governor of Ogun State, Otunba Gbenga Daniel; a former Deputy Governor of Oyo State, Moses Adeyemo; and a former National Vice Chairman of the APC, South-West Zone, Chief Pius Akinyelure.\n\nAt the meeting, Akande called on all aspirants and governors to ensure that they carry on with their campaigns with decorum.\n\nThe APC chieftain was said to have called on them to put the interest of the South-West first and ensure that they would not lose the ticket at the primary, which comes up at the end of the month.\n\nA source said, \u201cBaba Akande said it is better for one of us to have the Presidency than for none of us to have it. He said we should carry on our campaigns with decorum. The ultimate goal is to have a small number of aspirants through consensus. However, this will be discussed in subsequent meetings.\n\n\u201cEverything was done to ensure that the impression was not given that Baba Akande was supporting anyone. They also will encourage consensus among all aspirants in order to strengthen the unity of the Yoruba,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen asked why Bakare, Bankole and Boroffice were not invited, he said, \u201cA list was given to Niyi Adebayo to invite people. I think all these people you mentioned had not yet declared as of the time this meeting was put together.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": ".\n\nBy Ibrahim Hassan-Wuyo\n\nFour days after Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State picked Senator Uba Sani as his preferred gubernatorial aspirant, another aspirant under the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kaduna, Alhaji Sani Sha\u2019aban has rejected El-Rufa\u2019i\u2019s choice of Uba Sani as the party\u2019s consensus candidate for the 2023 General Election.\n\nSha\u2019aban, an inlaw to President Muhammadu Buhari, spoke to some journalists in Kaduna where he described El-Rufa\u2019i\u2019s endorsement of the Senator as \u201cshocking.\u201d\n\nSha\u2019aban, a former member of the House of Representatives whose children had since bought the form for him to vie for the ticket, described as undemocratic the action of the stakeholders that gave the governor the powers to do what he did.\n\n\u201cAs a founding member of the party and to the best of my knowledge,I was not consulted or contacted before that decision was taken.\u201d\n\n\u201dI happened to be a founding member of the original APP that culminated into ANPP and went into a merger with three political parties to give birth to what we have today, APC.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were shocked in Kaduna State with more than 3 million willing and able registered voters, a special arrangement will be made without even the knowledge of some of us who are the first to obtain the nomination form.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf democracy is about decisions, about numbers, about exercising one\u2019s independent mind of choice and freedom to make the choice, we believe there\u2019s a snag here. There is a buffing here made by the sitting governor of Kaduna State.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnless and otherwise after they enjoyed their eight years in APC, they are no longer interested in the success of APC again in Kaduna State.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf they care about what will happen about the future of APC, if they care about the interest of the members in Kaduna State, if they care about the message of President Muhammadu Buhari and the leaders of the APC what they said after they were elected immediately after the just concluded convention, in the spirit of togetherness, the spirit of the successes, the spirit of making APC a very strong and dynamic party in Nigeria should be respected.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will fill my forms and return them in accordance with the party\u2019s directives, and wait for further directives from the party.\u201d\n\n\u201d We totally reject the endorsement of Senator Uba Sani as the party\u2019s APC gubernatorial candidate for the 2023 election in Kaduna State.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you cannot treat me as a nobody. I know my rights. I earned it. I deserve to be informed of any decision. Even if it is a phone call. This is what we intend to do. When you rubbish me, I rubbish you.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a democrat and in line with our party\u2019s guideline, I subscribed to the position of the party which says in case there\u2019s an objection, which there is in Kaduna, a primary election will hold,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe call on the party at the national level to monitor the activities of the State, and let there be fairness, justice and rule of law because the party is in danger of being seen in a bad light if this consensus arrangement is allowed to scale through,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo, all I\u2019m saying is that we reject in totality any consensus arrangements, it is an attempt to render all delegates useless which is against the democratic process,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMy aspiration is among other reasons to give people a sense of belonging and to render selfless service and better the lots of the good people of Kaduna State.\u201d\n\n\u201cNigeria is not under a military dictatorship but democracy, but I\u2019m sorry to say that that is not the case in Kaduna State because consensus is being used to deceive people in Kaduna State.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Luminous Jannamike, Abuja\n\nThe Northern Elders Forum, NEF, has faulted the clamour for the major political parties in the country to zone their 2023 presidential tickets to the South, saying that it would result to damage the North will not accept.\n\nNEF\u2019s Director, Publicity and Advocacy, Dr Hakeem Baba-Ahmed said this in a press release entitled, \u2018Statement of Northern Elders Forum on Threats from Southern Socio-Cultural Groups\u2019 which was issued to journalists on Friday.\n\nRecall that the Southern and Middle Belt Leaders Forum, SMBLF, had cautioned political parties and stakeholders, not to tinker with the issue of zoning and rotation of political offices, especially the presidency, on the grounds that doing so would further threaten the fragile threads of the nation\u2019s unity.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nZoning on the North\u2019s slaughter slab\n\nHowever, NEF described the warning as a failed attempt to heighten the tensions in the land: stressing that the zoning of political offices is retrogressive, unworkable and anti-democratic.\n\nBaba-Ahmed said, \u201cNorthern Elders Forum (NEF) has observed attempts to heighten tension by some Southern socio-cultural groups determined to stampede Nigerians into subverting the foundational principles of the democratic process. These include the rights and freedoms of political parties to choose their candidates, and for voters to choose their leaders in free and fair elections.\n\n\u201cWhile the real politicians are busy campaigning all over the country out of the knowledge that all Nigerians must participate equally in the selection of candidates and voting for leaders in 2023, leaders of groups from the South are busy rehashing old threats and intimidating tactics in a bid to deny the northerner his right to vie for his party\u2019s ticket and vote for the next President without limitations to his right to choose.\n\n\u201cThese tired tactics will not scare the North, and will not win the Southern politician the type of support he needs to compete to become Nigeria\u2019s next President.\n\n\u201cNEF does not believe that these elders speak for serious aspirants and prospective southern candidates when they threaten even the survival of the country they aspire to lead unless they have their way.\n\n\u201cThe very vigorous campaigns by aspirants from every part of the South against each other ought to remind these elderly Nigerians that zoning is retrogressive, unworkable and anti-democratic.\n\n\u201cNEF\u2019s position has remained consistent. Our democracy will only grow if it respects its own basic rules, and excluding a part of the country from enjoying full participation in all aspects of the electoral process amounts to damage which the North will not accept.\n\n\u201cOur Forum encourages all aspirants and candidates to fully participate in all their parties\u2019 activities. It advises elders of groups from the South to behave in a manner befitting their status and avoid pitching parts of the country against each other.\n\n\u201cWe appeal to Southern politicians seeking the support of Northern voters to assure them that they do not share the doomsday scenario being peddled by some leaders of Southern socio-cultural groups.\n\n\u201cPolitical parties that find Northerners deserving to fly their flags should not be intimidated by scare tactics that they will lose Southern votes.\n\n\u201cThe Forum has faith that Nigeria can produce good leaders who will lead it out of its current challenges if the entire nation opens up to the emergence of the best candidates who do not bear ethnic or regional labels.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Jacob Ajom\n\nThere are several heavyweight battles coming up in Matchday 35 of the 2021/22 LaLiga Santander season, including the second Madrid Derby of the campaign. In just one weekend, football fans can savour Real Betis hosting Barcelona just as Villarreal CF entertain Sevilla.\n\nThe much anticipated Madrid derby will see Atl\u00e9tico Madrid will be at home to champions Real Madrid, with all six of those teams currently inside the top seven in the standings.\n\nThat means they\u2019re all currently on course for European qualification, so will be fighting to stay there and book the most prestigious UEFA ticket possible.\n\nThe first game of Saturday is another huge one in its own right, as RCD Mallorca host Granada CF for a relegation six-pointer.\n\nBoth teams have changed their coach in the past few weeks, with Javier Aguirre coming in on the island and Aitor Karanka taking over the Granada CF hotseat. Each has already made a positive impact and will be battling for the three points at the Visit Mallorca Estadi.\n\nSeveral other intriguing fixtures follow on Saturday afternoon. Athletic Club coach Marcelino takes on his former side Valencia CF at San Mam\u00e9s as those two historic clubs aim to finish as high as possible.\n\nIn Vigo, RC Celta will host Deportivo Alav\u00e9s as the Basque side look to keep their slim survival hopes alive. There\u2019s also C\u00e1diz CF vs Elche CF, an extra special fixture for striker Lucas P\u00e9rez given that he switched from the Franjiverdes to the Amarillos in January.\n\nOn Saturday night comes the first of the weekend\u2019s top-of-the-table clashes as Real Betis take on FC Barcelona at what promises to be an electric Estadio Benito Villamar\u00edn, as this will be the Verdiblancos\u2019 first home match since winning the Copa del Rey.\n\nCoach Manuel Pellegrini has urged his players to keep battling for a potential Champions League qualification spot, making this duel with a direct rival for a top four berth so important.\n\nSunday is Madrid Derby day, yet it\u2019s not only Atleti and Real Madrid who\u2019ll face off.

          "title": "Nigeria at increasing risk of intellectually deficient children \u2013 Experts warn",
          "text": "In future, Nigeria may be filled with a crop of intellectually unfit adults who are not capable of social and economic contributions to the society if it does not check the learning crisis currently rocking the education sector, experts have warned.\n\nRecent research has placed Nigeria in first place among countries with the lowest learning outcomes, especially among children in basic school.\n\nA World Bank report indicates that in sub-Saharan Africa, 87% of children are in learning poverty and are unable to perform basic literacy and numeracy tasks.\n\nThis deficiency in learning is estimated to be most severe in Nigeria, as data from a 2017 National Learning Assessment by the Universal Basic Education Commission, UBEC, shows about 70% of 10-year-olds have difficulty attaining basic foundational skills.\n\nAlready Nigeria is grappling with the challenge of poor enrolment, where over 10.5 million children are said to be out of school and are not learning.\n\nWhat this portends for Nigeria is that in future, the country will lack professionals in various fields, cerebral adults, and technocrats, leaving its social and economic development on the shoulders of intellectually poor leaders, says Economist, Dr. Chinedu Zephaniah.\n\nIn his analysis, any form of a learning crisis in the country at the moment will boomerang in the nearest future, when children who did not receive the kind of education they need to financially contribute to the economy, will become adults and further burden the country\u2019s Gross Domestic Product.\n\nHe explains that the worth of every country is dependent on its human capital, the reason why the United Nations mostly focuses on the human development index of nations.\n\nAlso emphasising the nexus between social and economic deprivation, and social unrest, Dr Zephaniah insisted that quality education remains the best way to shape the minds of young people for constructive development.\n\n\u2018\u2018If you check the societies with a lot of social problems, you will notice that they are usually where people don\u2019t have skills so they can\u2019t get jobs. And because they don\u2019t have skills and can\u2019t get jobs, they turn out to be the poorest in society. Now what happens is that when we don\u2019t raise children who have proper education, those children will in turn not get the kinds of jobs that will pay them.\n\n\u2018\u2018And then we are preparing children who would snowball into things like Boko Haram, ISWAP and the rest of it. In clear terms, when Northeast Nigeria fell under the pressure of Boko Haram, it was something that we all knew was going to happen. At that time, the financial exclusion rates in that region were the worst in Nigeria. So it was like a time bomb that we all saw clicking towards zero until it exploded\u2019.\n\n\u2018\u2018What we can glean from this is that if we don\u2019t make conscious efforts to give people not just literacy, but education that is relevant for the 21st century, they will not be able to compete in the environment and the global space,\u201d he said.\n\nRecently, Manar Ahmed, an Education Specialist at UNICEF had warned that the poor literacy milestones in basic schools are mostly, the result of poor funding of the sector, an unqualified workforce, a lack of resources like infrastructure and poor teaching and learning materials.\n\nDescribing the situation as dire, Manar had worried that despite efforts to tackle the challenge using a 2018- 2021 ministerial strategic plan; learning outcomes continue to deteriorate, pegging Nigeria as one of the worst globally.\n\nMeanwhile, data shows that Nigeria only allocates 1.7% of its GDP to education, falling behind UN recommended 50% to 20% of public finance to the sector.\n\nAlso, figures from a 2018 personnel audit by UBEC show that at least 27% of teachers are unqualified, while a 37% classroom shortage accounts for the insufficient physical resources needed for quality education in schools.\n\nBut the education specialist says it is not only about the budget but how available resources are deployed effectively and the right teaching workforce engaged.\n\n\u2018\u2018We know qualified teachers are in short supply at all educational levels but it is more at the stage where you expect your child should learn how to read and write.\n\nOn the suggestion that poorly educated children will eventually become adults and aspire to political positions thereby leaving the country in the hands of unfit leaders, Dr Zephaniah disagrees insisting they will rather become nuisances to society.\n\nHe argues that there is no way someone without proper education and cerebral competence can aspire to such heights of human fulfilment.\n\nHe said, \u201dIn today\u2019s world, everything is online, the person needs to get the kind of education to enable him to understand the simplest of complex situations. So it is a boundary line. It is the divider, it is a rubicon of human development. You either get an education or you will not be able to live the barest of human life and you will not be able to attain the most basic of the desires of an average human being in contemporary society.\n\n\u201dSo, the problem is, you know, a huge gap in future where Nigeria will not be a nation to reckon with because the bulk of the population will be people without requisite skills.\u201d\n\n\u201dBut the fact is that we are not even thinking enough at that time when this huge number is not able to contribute economically or socially, the nation automatically, will not also be a country to reckon with.\n\n\u201cSo, asking about the future the gap, the gap starts now, the skills are required now, what will happen in future is when this comes to full maturity, where the nation will implode and not be reckoned with, among the committee of nations,\u201d he maintained.",

          "text": "The second term aspiration of the Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, received a boost on Friday, as the Governor\u2019s Elders Advisory Council, officially endorsed his second term bid.\n\nGiving the position of the Council, its chairman, Chief Oluleye Okuboyejo, in a proclamation he read at the Obas Complex, Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta, particularly commended the Governor for the increase in the ease of doing business index, which according to him, has significantly increased investment in the State.\n\nOkuboyejo added that Abiodun in the last three years had proved himself to be a great marketer of the State, noting that \u201chis marketing acumen is responsible for the rise of the state\u2019s internally generated revenue\u201d.\n\nHe further noted that since the inception of the current administration in the State, Governor Abiodun has been methodical in fashioning the policy agenda around \u2018ISEYA\u2019, saying that, \u201cthe smooth delivery of the social contract elements which could be seen across the state have even been applauded by the Governor\u2019s ardent critics.\n\n\u201cWe publicly endorse the second term ambition of our indefatigable Governor.\n\n\u201cHaving been sworn in on Wednesday, 29th May, 2019 as the Governor and the current tenure will lapse on Sunday, 28th May, 2023, the government under your watch is methodical in fashioning the policy agenda around \u2018ISEYA\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe delivery of this social contract element has been applauded even by your ardent critics.\n\n\u201cWe cannot but commend the increase in ease of doing business index that has significantly boosted foreign and indigenous investment in our state. Your Excellency has shown yourself as a great marketer of our state and the result is evidently clear in the rise of our internally generated revenue\u201d, Okuboyejo stated.\n\nWhile commending the administration of Governor Abiodun for completing projects inherited from previous administration in the State, the Council chairman noted that \u201cthe real selling point for this administration are confirmation that projects inherited from previous administrations have been completed and upgraded where necessary. From the Elite Road in Abeokuta South, Ajilete in Yewa South, Ajebandele in Ijebu-East, Oke-Agbede in Imeko, Awowo in Ewekoro, Alapoti in Ado-Odo-Ota, Ifoyintedo in Ipokia, Ibiade in Ogun Waterside, Ilugun in Odeda and Isiwo in Ijebu-Ode, the story of good performance continued to rend the air\u201d.\n\nOkuboyejo, while noting that other areas such as Oke-Sopen in Ijebu- North, Ilishan in Ikenne, Onidundu in Obafemi Owode, Ipara in Remo-North, Ososun in Ifo, Ishote in Sagamu and Ita-Oshin in Abeokuta-North, among other towns across the State were not neglected, applauded the way and manner which the state government had been able to address issues of social order, protection and security in the state.\n\n\u201cThe issue of social order and protection is also germane to the elders and we applaud the way and manner which the state government has been addressing the matter.\n\n\u201cIt is no gainsaying to state the fact that security is everybody\u2019s business and the workable framework that has been provided by the government assures us that things will be getting better in our dear state,\u201d he submitted.\n\nIn their respective remarks, Chiefs Fohunola Abiola, Ibunkunolu Ojosipe and former deputy governor of the state, Alhaja Salimot Badru, representing the Ogun Central, East and West Senatorial districts of the State, commended the State Governor for not developing any part of the State at the expense of the other.\n\nThey said that aside from governing with the fear of God, the governor was also able to approach governance of the state with the spirit of equal distribution.\n\nResponding, Governor Abiodun, who noted that the endorsement by the Governor\u2019s Elders Advisory Council was a position of trust, said that he would not deviate from his mission to rebuild and also continue in the part of honor and integrity.\n\nAbiodun, while pledging that he would continue to do what he was elected into office to do, promised to continue to be inclusive, accountable, responsive, just and fair.\n\nAbiodun informed the Council that his administration\u2019s efforts this year would be concentrated more on electricity generation and water to further boost the socio-economic development of the State.\n\n\u201cOur focus this year will be on electricity generation and water supply. This is because we feel that those are the areas we need to focus on. We have continued to implement the ISEYA Programmes without leaving any part of the State behind. I promised that we will complete any project that has a direct impact on the lives of our people and that we are also doing\u201d, the governor stated.\n\nHe maintained that his administration had touched all sectors of the State economy and ensured that all parts of the State were treated equally in the distribution of projects.\n\n\u201cThis mandate was the goodwill of the people of this state and I will not take it for granted knowing fully well that it is not a birthright nor an inheritance. When I was sworn in, I promised to be fair, accountable, consensus oriented, transparent, just and equitable to all sections of the state and we are doing just that\u201d, he added.\n\nThe Governor, however, noted that one of the signature projects of his administration, the cargo airport was progressing steadily.\n\n\u201cThe airport, for many preceding years, was just an idea, but to the glory of God the runway is being asphalted as we speak. That airport will be truly an international cargo airport and passengers airport. By the grace of God on or before December 2022, an aircraft will land at the airport signalling the commencement of air traffic operations at the airport\u201d, Abiodun pointed out.\n\nWhile thanking the Elders for believing in his ability and for endorsing him for the second term in office, he noted that their action would propel him to work harder.\n\n\u201cWhat happened this afternoon can only further motivate myself and my team to which I owe all the successes you showered on us.\n\n\u201cYou have helped in managing issues at the local government levels. You have helped us through your advice and counsel. Please continue on that path of honesty. Help us superintend on issues that will bring peace in the State, especially during this political era\u201d, the Governor stated.",

APC should be a uniting government and not a divisive government stampeding on the weak. Today, religion has divided us as a people in Kaduna State\u201d.\n\nHe stressed his aspiration is to give people a sense of belonging and render selfless service and better the lots of the good people of Kaduna State.\n\nHe added: \u201cSo, all am saying is that, we reject in totality any consensus arrangements, it is an attempt to render all delegates useless which is against democratic process.\n\n\u201d I also wish to make it clear that I cannot be rubbished, because if you rubbish me I will rubbish you, democratic process must be followed and respected, all those who purchased form must be allowed to go for primaries.\u201d\n\nCorroborating his position, his campaign Director General, Chief (Barrister) Joshua Danladi Ephraim, said democracy should be about freedom, adding that they will not allow the Governor to have his way on any consensus arrangements, \u201cwe will not allow a lawless situation in APC.\n\n\u201cWe call on the party at the national level to monitor the activities of the State, let there be fairness, justice and rule of law because the party is in danger of being seen in bad light if this consensus arrangements is allowed to scale through,\u201d he said.",

He was posted to serve in the mandatory NYSC Scheme at The Polytechnic Ibadan.\n\nWhile undergoing the compulsory NYSC scheme in 1984 as a Youth Corp member serving at the Polytechnic Ibadan, he composed the National Youth Service Corp anthem and that is what is still being used till date.\n\nHe lectured at the Department of Music Technology, The Polytechnic, Ibadan, for about 30yrs. He rose from an Assistant Lecturer to Chief Lecturer (Professor Cadre in the University settings) in 1999.\n\nHe established the first department of Music Technology at the Polytechnic Ibadan, which he headed for eleven years. He also became the first Lecturer in the Music Technology Department to become a Senior Principal Lecturer in the Music Department of the Polytechnic, Ibadan.\n\nHe is also the first Lecturer in the Department to become a Dean of Faculty of Eight Departments at the Polytechnic of Ibadan.\n\nAdetiran later joined the Celestial Church of Christ at Army Barracks Road Parish, Mokola, Ibadan, under the Shepherdship of Late MSE Moses Obasa Adekanmbi, in the early 1970s.\n\nUntil his demise, he was the Music Director of Celestial Church of Christ, worldwide and the Founding Rector of CCC Academy of Music Technology, Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nThe Celestial Church of Christ Academy of Music and Music Technology, being the first Monotechnic in Nigeria, was established in 2010, through Adetiran.\n\nAdetiran is a recipient of National Award from the Federal Government of Nigeria. He\u2019s a Member of the Pastor-in-Council of the Celestial Church of Christ WW and a J.P.\n\nThrough Adetiran, several music stars in Nigeria and overseas have been discovered, nurtured, trained and promoted. Amongst these are; Baba Rotimi Olaosebikan (current HOD, Music Tech. Dept., The Polytechnic Ibadan), Olusola Allynson Obaniyi, Samson Adekanmbi (Sammy P), Seyi Solagbade, Chidi Egwuatu, Reuben Adekanmbi and several others.\n\nHe was also part of the Celestial Church of Christ Hymns Technical Review Council from May 26th 2009 to November 2019. This Council\u2019s efforts under the Supervision and Coordination of Most. Superior Evangelist S. O. Banjo resulted into the New Revised Standard Edition of the CCC Hymn Book launched on 25th December 2019 at Imeko, Ogun State.\n\nHe battled serious health challenges which also took away his hair strand and replaced them with wounds. He treated it with a purple ointment usually called \u201cJelu\u201d in Yoruba language to treat wounds of all kinds.\n\nDuring his lifetime, Adetiran coordinated the largest single choir that features at the annual Luli Concert (a Christian worship concert that has taken worship to another level in the world. His music at the Luli Concert created an inter-faith and non-denominational praise gathering for all).",

          "text": "By Emmanuel Oladesu, Jide Orintunsin and Nicholas Kalu, Abuja\n\nAll Progressives Congress (APC) leaders and presidential aspirants from the South West emerged from a meeting in Lagos last night with a resolution to ensure that the geo-political zone produces Nigeria\u2019s next president in 2023.\n\nThey also affirmed the right of every one of the contenders to pursue his ambition, but advised the gladiators to eschew acrimony and abuse in the build-up to this month\u2019s primaries.\n\nBy the close of work at the party\u2019s national secretariat in Abuja yesterday, the number of APC\u2019s presidential aspirants had risen to 22 after Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) governor Godwin Emefiele, former House of Representatives Speaker Dimeji Lawal, immediate past Ogun State Governor Ibikunle Amosun, Science, Technology and Innovation Minister Ogbonnaya Onu, former Zamfara State Governor Sani Yerima and Senator Ajayi Boroffice bought their own expression of interest and nomination forms.\n\nEach set of forms goes for N100 million.\n\nMany of the aspirants purchased the forms through proxies.\n\nIt was gathered yesterday that more aspirants might join the queue in due course.\n\nYesterday\u2019s meeting of APC South West leaders was convened by former Osun State Governor Bisi Akande and his Ogun counterpart Aremo Olusegun Osoba to douse the anxiety generated by the growing number of aspirants from the same political family and background.\n\nIn attendance were APC National Leader Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Senator Ibikunle Amosu, and Ekiti State Governor Kayode Fayemi, all of who have purchased their expression of interest and nomination forms for the presidential primaries.\n\nThe meeting, which took place at the Lagos State House, Marina, also attracted House of Representatives Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila, APC National Secretary Senator Iyiola Omisore, Southwest APC leader Isaacs Kekemeke, Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu and his Ondo, Ogun and Osun counterparts Rotimi Akeredolu, Dapo Abiodun, and Gboyega Oyetola.\n\nOthers were Interior Minister Rauf Aregbesola, his Trade and Investment counterpart Otunba Niyi Adebayo, Works and Housing Minister Babatunde Fashola, former Ogun State Governor Gbenga Daniel and former Oyo State deputy governors Iyiola Oladokun and Alake Adeyemo.\n\nA source close to the conveners said the meeting was successful.\n\nHe said: \u201cThey (aspirants) freely expressed themselves. They spoke their minds. It was agreed that they were free to pursue their ambitions. But the leaders emphasised the commitment to the emergence of the next APC presidential candidate from the Southwest.\u201d\n\nThe source added: \u201cThe aspirants were admonished to pursue their legitimate interests without abusing one another. They called for decorum.\n\n\u201cIt was also agreed that the aspirants should meet regularly to review events and situations. Contrary to feelings in some places, the meeting was not convened to make aspirants withdraw from the race.\u201d\n\n22 aspirants buy forms\n\nThe APC National Organising Secretary, Sulaiman Mohammed Argungu, confirmed yesterday that 22 presidential aspirants had bought the presidential forms so far.\n\nHe put the figures for governorship nomination form purchases at 105,262 for senatorial nomination forms and 936 for House of Representatives aspirants.\n\nAlthough party sources said yesterday that the growing interest among chieftains of the party to buy the presidential nomination forms might be in response to the financial need of the ruling party ahead of the 2023 general elections, Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) Chairman Abdulrasheed Bawa revealed that the agency was investigating sources of monies used by politicians to buy their nomination forms.\n\nOnu, speaking in Abuja yesterday on his aspiration, said he has the key to unlock the prosperity of the country through a knowledge economy driven by science, technology and innovation.\n\nNo nation, he said, has ever become truly great without the efficient and effective deployment of science, technology and innovation to nation building\n\n\u201cI am convinced that I have the knowledge, the experience, the credibility, the education having been trained in one of the best universities in the world, the vision, the integrity, maturity and a man who can be trusted,\u201d he added.\n\nYerima visited President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday to brief him on his ambition and told reporters afterward that security, poverty alleviation and education would receive his utmost attention if elected as president.\n\nAsked if his introduction of Sharia during his tenure as Zamfara State governor would not count against him in the presidential race, he answered in the negative.\n\nHis words: \u201cOn the issue of Shari\u2019a, I\u2019m a Muslim and I say everywhere I go, that I am a Muslim and I want to die as a Muslim.\n\n\u201cLike I said, I\u2019m going to fight the problem of ignorance, and this is one of it. People don\u2019t know, a lot of people don\u2019t know that the Constitution of Nigeria, Section 38, provides for freedom of religion, including freedom to change your religion, if you want to, to practise alone or in community with others, in private or in public.\n\n\u201cAs governor of the state, I followed the constitutional provision, prepared a law, sent it to state assembly and they passed it into law and I implemented what the Constitution of Nigeria has given me the powers to do.\n\n\u201cEven in Zamfara State, I never, never required, asked or forced any Christian to follow the Islamic faith because I would have done an unconstitutional act.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m elected, by the grace of God, I\u2019m going to take an oath to protect and defend the Constitution of Nigeria. So, I will never do anything unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nFormer Zamfara State Governor Mahmuda Aliyu Shinkafi led the delegation that bought Bankole\u2019s form.\n\nFormer deputy governors\u2019 forum endorses Tinubu\n\nThe Forum of Former Deputy Governors of Nigeria (FFDGN) yesterday expressed support for the presidential aspiration of Asiwaju Bola Tinubu.\n\nNational Chairman of the Forum and former deputy governor of Edo State, Lucky Imasuen, said former deputy governors elected on the platform of the party were enthusiastic to work with and for the success of the former Lagos State governor at the presidential primaries and the general elections.\n\nHe spoke at a meeting with the presidential hopeful in Abuja on Thursday night.\n\nCalling for the support of the forum, Asiwaju Tinubu promised to address the economic and security challenges facing the country when elected as the president.\n\nHe acknowledged inadequacies in the reward system of the APC and promised a drastic improvement if elected.\n\nHe said: \u201cMany of you I know, and you have participated in governance and political activities. You have given value to your various states. When we merged as one and took the broom as the symbol of the party, the broom has a lot of meaning.\n\n\u201cLet me first of all address our element of the constitution. I promise to look into that if elected. Our reward system as APC is very poor, and it was late before I could recognise that. Let me assure you, I won\u2019t repeat that mistake if I\u2019m elected.\u201d\n\nHe enjoined the former deputy governors to ensure unity within the APC in their various states, and to ensure success for the party in the forthcoming elections, starting with the Osun and Ekiti state governorship elections.\n\nWhy contest is attracting unprecedented number of aspirants \u2013 Party sources\n\nFollowing continued criticism of the increasing number of presidential aspirants seeking the APC ticket and the huge costs of its expression of interest and nomination forms, party sources said yesterday that the development might be in response to the financial need of the ruling party ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\nSources said it might also be that some of the aspirants are making strategic plans for the post- election period.\n\nInformed party source told The Nation that many of the presidential aspirants who have obtained the forms are simply trying to support the party financially by coming forward with their N100 million.\n\nIt was gathered that besides about four of the aspirants who have actually been going round the states of the federation to canvass for delegates\u2019 support, the others may merely be helping to prepare the party for the financial demands ahead.\n\nMentioned as the serious aspirants who will go all the way in the race when the chips are finally down are the National Leader of the party Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Transportation Minister Chibuike Amaechi and Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State.\n\n\u201cUnlike the former ruling party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the APC will not use state resources to fund elections,\u201d a former national officer of the party said.\n\nHe added: \u201cWhat you are seeing is an unspoken fund drive by party chieftains in preparation for the 2023 general elections. As loyal and dedicated party leaders, they understand the immediate need of the party and that\u2019s what they are making available.\n\n\u201cDuring the 2019 general elections, it was a difficult task as the party had to struggle to raise funds. I can say this because I was in office then as a Zonal Chairman.\n\n\u201cTo avoid the difficulties experienced then in 2023, party leaders have found a way of assisting the ruling party to meet the financial demands of the primaries.\u201d\n\nThe Nation also gathered that Buhari had on several occasions tasked the leadership of the APC to define methods of raising funds needed to prosecute elections.\n\nIt was also gathered that the new National Chairman, Senator Abdulahi Adamu, on taking office, had sought the support of leading chieftains of the party, particularly current and former governors, ranking National Assembly members, ministers and other prominent chieftains of the party, for his fund raising plans ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\nAnother top member of the party described the high number of presidential aspirants as a \u201csmart way of raising the huge amount of money needed to prosecute the primaries without running foul of the laws of the land as individuals and as a political party.\n\n\u201cIt is obvious that what is going on in the APC is fund raising,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother source said: \u201cThere is no way someone who dropped such an amount of money will not be a stakeholder to consult when the victory song is to be sung. And when it is time to share the spoils of war, they will be considered. Don\u2019t be surprised when they start stepping down before the primary elections.\u201d\n\nBawa: EFCC investigating funds used to buy nomination forms\n\nEconomic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) Chairman Abdulrasheed Bawa said yesterday that the agency was probing the sources of the funds used to buy nomination forms by aspirants ahead of the primaries.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to the issue of monitoring election funds as well as candidates\u2019 funds, that has to do with the work of INEC in this regard. But, of course, we are working hand in gloves with INEC and other related agencies in that field to ensure that we follow the money, we know the source, whether it is legitimate or illegitimate, because that is what concerns us,\u201d Bawa said on Channels Television.\n\nContinuing, he said: \u201cYou know that we are concerned about good governance. We are concerned about transparency, accountability. We are also concerned about ensuring that corrupt elements are not given leadership positions in this country.\n\n\u201cThat is one of the things we are working behind the scene to ensure that at least we make our positions known on some certain actors within the political space in this country.\u201d\n\nVoluntary withdrawal forms violate constitution, Electoral Act, expert tells APC\n\nA former chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and International Constitutional Law expert, Livingstone Wechie, has told the APC leadership to reverse its issuance of voluntary withdrawal forms to its presidential aspirants.\n\nWechie described the action of the APC leadership as a contravention of the provisions of the 1999 Nigerian Constitution as amended, the APC Constitution and the Electoral Act.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is not acceptable that the All Progressives Congress (APC) should be allowed to continue to blazingly engage in constitutional somersaults with impunity.\n\n\u201cThe recent so-called voluntary withdrawal forms attached to the expression of interest and nomination form is an absolute stranger and illegal to Nigeria\u2019s political system.\n\n\u201cThat form has no constitutionality with respect to Nigeria\u2019s 1999 Constitution, the APC Constitution and the Electoral Act. That form is in absolute violation of all the legal frameworks that govern Nigeria\u2019s electro-political system and it must be stopped at this point.\n\n\u201cIt is more worrisome because that purported form is a tool aimed at imposition, coercive and arbitrary hand-picking of candidates against the will of other aspirants who are left without a choice all in the name of party supremacy.\n\n\u201cIf the Party has sold form at outrageously questionable figures, why will a person be forced to sign to forfeit his or her rights without following a fair constitutional process?\n\nFG bars civil servants from primaries\n\nThe Federal Government has warned civil servants to steer clear of the forthcoming primary elections of the parties.\n\nHead of the Civil Service of the Federation, Dr. Folashade Esan, in a May 5, 2022 circular entitled \u2018Clarification on the provision of public service vis-avis the Supreme Court judgment as it relates to participation of civil servant in partisan politics\u2019, warned civil servants to be \u201cguided by the provisions of PSR (Public Service Rules) and the legal opinion of the Honourable Attorney-General of the Federation/Minister of Justice on the subject.\u201d\n\nThe Attorney General had, in a November 26, 2018 letter with Ref. No. SGF/PS/HCSF/210/11 said: \u201cNeither the 1999 Constitution nor the Supreme Court has authorised civil servants to engage in partisan politics.\n\n\u201cThe provisions of Rules 030422 and 030423 of the Public Service Rules (2008 Edition) were not nullified by the Supreme Court, hence, they remain in force and binding on all civil servants seeking to participate in nomination exercises or party primaries.\u201d",
          "summary": "In attendance were APC National Leader Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Senator Ibikunle Amosu, and Ekiti State Governor Kayode Fayemi, all of who have purchased their expression of interest and nomination forms for the presidential primaries.\nHe put the figures for governorship nomination form purchases at 105,262 for senatorial nomination forms and 936 for House of Representatives aspirants.\nSo, I will never do anything unconstitutional.\u201dFormer Zamfara State Governor Mahmuda Aliyu Shinkafi led the delegation that bought Bankole\u2019s form.\nWechie described the action of the APC leadership as a contravention of the provisions of the 1999 Nigerian Constitution as amended, the APC Constitution and the Electoral Act.\n\u201cThat form has no constitutionality with respect to Nigeria\u2019s 1999 Constitution, the APC Constitution and the Electoral Act.",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja and Chijioke Agwu, Abakaliki\n\nFive months after he gave reasons he would not honour the request by South-East traditional and religious leaders to grant amnesty to the leader of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, to deescalate tension in the zone, President Muhammadu Buhari, has again said Kanu\u2019s fate will be decided by the courts. Kanu is facing charges bordering on treasonable felony instituted against him in response to years of the campaign for the Republic of Biafra through IPOB.\n\nAccording to a statement by Femi Adesina, Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Buhari, Friday in Abakiliki at a meeting with South-East leaders, said in response to appeals by traditional, religious and political leaders in the region for the release of Kanu: \u201cI have listened carefully to the various appeals from the elders to the traditional leaders regarding a wide range of options, and as I have said previously, this matter remains in the full purview of the courts where it will be properly adjudicated.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\n\u201cMy worry is for our hardworking and innocent civilians, for whom life is already tough and would like to earn a decent and honest living.\n\n\u2018\u2018There are many that fit this profile and the government owes them that obligation to protect lives and property. I will once again repeat, no one has the right to carry an AK-47, and anyone seen in any part of the country doing so and is not a law enforcement officer is a threat to our peaceful coexistence and should be treated as such,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nPresident Buhari vowed that the Federal Government would deploy its strength to protect innocent and hardworking Nigerians from terrorists and those causing breakdown of law and order in the South-East region. He expressed concern over the deteriorating security situation in the region, reiterating his directive to security agencies to \u201cflush out\u201d those perpetrating violence in the land.\n\n\u201cIn the last 48 hours, I have been informed of the latest in the round of brutal actions carried out by gun-wielding terrorists, who prey on innocent and hardworking citizens, unfortunately, these barbaric acts were visited upon those who have committed their lives to protect their fellow citizens,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president paid tribute to members of the Nigerian armed forces who recently lost their lives in the region. On infrastructure, the president highlighted some of his government\u2019s achievements in the region, dismissing those peddling false narratives of lack of care and consideration for the people of the South-East by this administration\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days...

In his remarks, Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi said President Buhari would be remembered as a man who did not use the plight of the people of the South-East to play politics, but came to their rescue severally. He urged Southern leaders to work towards finding a political solution in resolving some challenging issues, warning that the region is at a crossroads.\n\n\u201cOn this issue of a political solution, I have never believed in IPOB\u2019s method of operation, I disagree with them but we have gotten ourselves to a very terrible and pitiable solution.\n\n\u201cSome of us warned that we will get to this situation and some were playing politics with it. Mr President, we are at a crossroads. I have been to you and I have begged you for a political solution. Surprisingly and graciously you granted that. You said our people should initiate that and at the forefront is Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s lawyer.\u201d\n\nThe governor, therefore, urged the President of Ohaneze Ndigbo to meet with elder statesman, Mbazulike Amaechi, the Chairman of Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Southeast, the Chairman of Southeast Traditional Rulers Council, Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s lawyer and few others to initiate the political solution. On the 2023 elections, the governor said he believed strongly in the demand for the presidency to be zoned to the South-East region on the basis of fairness, equity, justice and morality. Umahi, who is also a presidential aspirant, commended some leaders from outside the region for expressing their support for the next president of Nigeria to emerge from the South-East. The Chairman of Southeast Traditional Rulers, Eze Charles Mkpuma and CAN Chairman, South-East, Very Rev. Fr. Abraham Nwali, also spoke in favour of a president of Nigeria of South-Eeast extraction come 2023.\n\nThe leaders while expressing support for a united Nigeria, appealed to the president to grant pardon and release the IPOB leader, urging other agitators to cease all forms of hostilities.",

          "text": "From Godwin Tsa, Abuja And Tony John, Port Harcourt\n\nThe Supreme Court on Friday resolved the legal dispute between Rivers and Imo over the ownership of 17 oil wells in favour of Rivers State. In a unanimous judgment, the apex court specifically declared that the oil wells located in Ndoni and Egbema communities belong to Rivers State. Before the judgment, there was a political arrangement put in place by the Federal Government for the revenue from the disputed wells to be shared equally between the two states. However, when Emeka Ihedioha became governor in 2019, a presidential memo directed that all the revenue should go to Imo.\n\nIn the judgment which was prepared by Justice Helen Ogunwunmiju, but delivered by Justice Emmanuel Agim, the apex court dismissed the counterclaim ownership put forward by the Imo State government.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above?

The state sought a declaration that all the oil wells within Akri and Mbede communities are wrongly attributed to Imo State and that they are all oil wells within the territory of Rivers state. It maintained that only Rivers State is entitled to receive the full allocation of the distributable revenue from the oil wells on the basis of the 1390 derivation as contained under section 162 of the 1999 constitution.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nMeanwhile, Governor Nyesom Wike said Rivers State was in court with its neighbouring Imo State, not to claim victory, but to defend its ownership rights of oil wells in Akri and Mbede communities. The Rivers State governor made the clarification in Port Harcourt on Friday, in response to the ruling of the Supreme Court of Nigeria which delivered judgement on the subsisted boundary dispute between the two states over the affected oil wells.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt bears repeating that the quest to defend our ownership rights through the courts over the Akiri and Mbede oil wells was not intended to claim victory over Imo or any other state.\n\n\u201cWe also deplore the collusive actions of the National Boundary Commission (NBC), which unfortunately, has become notorious as one of the most corrupt national agencies, which has functioned more in causing confusion than resolving boundary disputes,\u201d he said.\n\nGovernor Wike pointed out that while the dispute lingered, the NBC did nothing in demarcating the boundaries to establish the proper location and title to the disputed oil wells. But instead of ensuring that NBC did its work, Governor Wike said the former Imo State governor, Emeka Ihedioha repudiated the subsisting 50:50 per cent sharing formula and also made provocative claims as exclusive owners of the oil wells.\n\n\u201cIn order to actualise this spurious claims, he (Ihedioha) stealthily wrote a letter dated August 9, 2019, to President Muhammadu Buhari and requested for the refund of the sum of N15 billion from Rivers State to Imo State as backlog of accrued proceeds from the 13 per cent derivation revenue of the said oil wells.\n\n\u201cActing on Governor Ihedioha\u2019s letter, Mr President warranted a letter to be written to the Revenue Mobilization, Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMFAC) through his late Chief of State, Mr Abba Kyari, to alter the status quo in favour of Imo State without reference to the subsisting dispute and agreement between the two states.\u201d\n\nGovernor Wike said Rivers State government was surprised by that action because since 1999, Peter Odili and Achike Udenwa, both former governors of the respective states had agreed to a 50:50 per cent sharing of derivative proceeds from those wells.",

from 17 oil wells in Akri and Mbede communities in favour of Rivers State.\n\n\n\nBoth Rivers and Imo states have been engaged in legal battles over the ownership of the 17 oil wells located in boundary communities between the two states.\n\n\n\nThe National Boundary Commission had in the Nigeria Administrative Map, 10th, 11th, 12th, and other maps delineated the two communities in which the 17 oil wells are located in Imo State.\n\n\n\nBut, Rivers State, citing decree No. 14 of 1967, Decree No. 12 of 1976, the White papers/conclusion of the Federal Military Government on the Irikefe and the Nasir Boundary Commission/Boundary Adjustment Commission, amongst others, claimed ownership of the disputed communities and urged the court to declare same.\n\n\n\nDelivering judgment in the suit that had the Attorney General of the Federation and Imo State as 1st and 2nd defendants respectively, the apex court held that from the evidence before it, the affected oil wells fell in the area belonging to Rivers.\n\n\n\nIn the summary judgment delivered by Justice Emmanuel Agim, which was prepared by Justice Helen Ogunwunmiju, the Supreme Court held that \u201cthe plaintiff\u2019s case

of the 13% derivation principle as provided for under Section 162 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999, as amended, among others.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe court based its decision on the fact that the boundary between Rivers and Imo states, as delineated in Nigeria Administrative Map 10th, 11th, 12th, editions and other maps bearing similar delineation was inaccurate, incorrect, and did not represent the legitimate and lawful boundaries between Rivers and Imo states.\n\n\n\nThe apex court had earlier declared that the correct instruments, map and documents to be relied upon in determining the boundary between Rivers and Imo states were those used by Rivers State in delineating the boundary line between the two states, including Decree No. 14 of 1967, Decree No. 12 of 1976, the White papers/conclusion of the Federal Military Government on the Irikefe and the Nasir Boundary Commission/Boundary Adjustment Commission, the Eastern Nigeria Map, the Provincial Map of Owerri Province, Warri Province, Onitsha Province, Rivers Province, the Ahoada District Map and Aboh Division Map.\n\n\n\nThe apex Court also declared that based on the correct instruments, maps and documents for determining the boundary between Rivers and Imo states, the following Rivers State communities wrongly attributed to Imo State, among other communities, are communities within the territorial boundaries of Rivers State and therefore communities in respect of which Rivers State was entitled to exercise governmental and administrative powers, including entitlement to benefits derivable from mineral or other resources within the communities.\n\n\n\nOther reliefs sought by Rivers State, which were granted by the unanimous judgment include: \u201cA declaration that all the

They refuse to accept that the North has over 55% of the population of Nigeria. They won\u2019t concede that the voting population in the Northwest region of the North alone is bigger than those of the Southeast & South-south combined\u201d\n\nJohn Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nNot comfortable with stereotypes and alleged blackmail anymore, a foremost umbrella body for the north, Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), yesterday, reacted to the ongoing controversy and constant bashing of the region over zoning within the two leading political parties \u2013 the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) \u2013 and declared that the North would not allow itself to be blackmailed any more, neither was it afraid of the country\u2019s break-up.\n\n\n\nThe forum, in a statement in Kaduna, warned that gone were the days, when Northerners felt blackmailed and intimidated by threats of re-structuring, secession, break up or break down of Nigeria.\n\n\n\nAccording to the statement signed by the Secretary General of the forum, Murtala Aliyu, the North is not and had never been opposed to the election of any Nigerian from any part of the country as President, maintaining however, that anything that would be done to achieve that must be in accord with the law and democratic principles.\n\nACF said some Southern politicians were already \u201cgiving their Northern counterparts an ultimatum not to elect anyone from the North as president or we will break up the country!\u201c\n\n\n\nIn the statement title, \u201cEnough of the blackmail\u201d, the ACF warned that gone were the days when Northerners felt blackmailed by certain narrative from the South, but that the times had changed.\n\n\n\nThe statement read: \u201cA long running political riddle that has continued to frustrate all efforts at achieving \u2018justice, equity and fair-play\u2019 is this: anything and everything in which the North has superiority or advantage or strength is, in the opinion of many Southerners, fake or contrived or speculative and therefore unacceptable.\n\n\n\n\u201cThese Southerners contest the facts that the North has 78% of the landmass of Nigeria. They refuse to accept that the North has over 55% of the population of Nigeria. They won\u2019t concede that the voting population in the Northwest region of the North alone is bigger than those of the Southeast & South-south combined.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey will never acknowledge the fact that all the beef, all the tomatoes, the onions, the beans, etc. consumed in the South, is produced in the North. They concede nothing. On the contrary, they say the North brings nothing to the table and is entitled to nothing. Not to an equitable share of national revenues, not to a fair share of employment in the public services or to admissions into public schools.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf the law says, for example, that election outcomes must be based on one man one vote, they quickly dismiss it as an \u2018imposition\u2019 by Northerners. They contest every fact, every principle including those that formed the basis of our union such as our federation, our system of administration, our\u2077 democracy, etc.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd as we inch up towards the 2023 elections, it comes as no surprise that some Southern politicians are giving their Northern counterparts an ultimatum which roughly translates thus: elect no one from the North as President or we will break up the country!\n\n\n\nBut what are the facts?\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s Fourth Democratic Republic is about 22 years old. Of this, Northerners ruled for only ten years. But in-spite of this, some southern politicians are furious, issuing dare warnings against the election of any Northerner as president. It has to be stated clearly and for the avoidance of any doubt that the North is not and has never been opposed to the election of any Nigerian from any part of the country as President.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnything that will be done to achieve that, however, must accord with the law and democratic principles. Gone are the days when Northerners felt blackmailed and intimidated by threats of re-structuring, secession, break up or break down of Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe North does not seek to dominate any part of the country but will not submit itself to be relegated to serfdom. Those issuing ultimatums are to be pitied, knowing that they know not what they are doing. They own no patent nor monopoly of the art or science of ultimatums. Enough of the blackmail.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Reports surfaced during the week that Uba Sani, senator representing Kaduna central, had been endorsed as the preferred governorship aspirant for the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state.\n\nIn a statement addressed to his supporters, Muhammad Sani Abdullahi, better known as Dattijo, had said Nasir el-Rufai, governor of Kaduna, asked APC governorship hopefuls to support Sani\u2019s ambition.\n\nDattijo also said the decision to support Sani was discussed at a meeting held on Wednesday.\n\nThe senator\u2019s \u201cvast experience\u201d as a presidential aide, political adviser, as well as his track record at the upper legislative chamber, contributed to making him the preferred choice, TheCable understands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpinion polls were conducted on governorship hopefuls within \u201cthe political family of el-Rufai\u201d, and Sani is said to have always come first among the three APC aspirants.\n\nAside from Dattijo and Sani, Hadiza Balarabe, deputy governor of Kaduna, is listed as the third governorship aspirant within the \u201cpolitical family\u201d.\n\nA source said the decision had to be taken as the \u201cactivities of supporters of Dattijo and Sani were heating up the polity\u201d, adding that Kaduna APC stakeholders \u201cwanted the best of the three to be endorsed, so that the party can approach the primary as a united house\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDr. Hadiza Balarabe, the first elected female deputy governor in the state, had acted as governor on several occasions and is seen as capable. She is a consultant in public health, and she led the state\u2019s strong response to COVID-19 and enjoys unique status as a powerful number two to el-Rufai,\u201d a source said.\n\n\u201cMuhammad Sani Abdullahi, who is fondly known as Dattijo, is an international development expert who served twice as planning and budget commissioner and was el-Rufai\u2019s chief of staff. He is young, bright and hardworking.\n\n\u201cOn his part, Uba Sani is an outstanding first-term lawmaker, who is among the top 10 senators with the highest number of bills. He has sponsored 21 bills in his three-year stay in the senate, placing him as the fourth legislator in terms of high sponsorship of bills.\n\n\u201cUba Sani used his influence to secure funding for the construction of the faculty of engineering at the permanent site of the Kaduna State University (KASU).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSimilarly, he sponsored the bill for the establishment of the Federal College of Education in Giwa, Federal Medical Centre in Rigasa, the Federal College of Forestry Technology and Research, Birnin Gwari, among others.\n\n\u201cHe also initiated two bills that have been signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari and they are the Banking and Other Financial Institutions Act (BOFIA) and the new AMCON Act.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the development, a chieftain of the APC in Kaduna commended el-Rufai for \u201cresolving the issue of anointed candidate amicably within his team\u201d.\n\nAccording to the party stakeholder, there were concerns over the governorship ambitions of the three aspirants \u2014 while Sani and Dattijo declared their interest in March, the deputy governor was said to have begun consultations on her interest in running for governor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis development created some kind of confusion within the rank and file of the party because three members of the governor\u2019s team were interested in succeeding him in 2023,\u201d the party chieftain said.\n\n\u201cThis had the potential of dividing the party. Coupled with that, supporters of each aspirant, especially the senator and Dattijo\u2019s campaign teams, claimed that they had the governor\u2019s full backing and they sometimes used strong language against each other.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA member of the Kaduna governor\u2019s cabinet also gave details on how Sani was chosen, as well as other decisions taken to improve the APC\u2019s chances at the polls.\n\n\u201cYou know that el-Rufai is a digital politician who is tech-savvy and he exercises leadership in whatever he does. Opinion polls, regular meetings and assessments all played a role in the final endorsement of Uba Sani,\u201d the cabinet member said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFirst, senator Uba Sani is the core team\u2019s consensus candidate. Second, Dattijo will vie for the senate to continue his political career at the national level and gain experience in law making, while senator Suleiman Abdu Kwari has been pencilled down to retain his seat as the senator representing Kaduna north senatorial district.\u201d",

          "title": "The biggest African tech moves from April",
          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "CAF is tackling Africa's $4bn cybersecurity threat",
          "text": "As African businesses grow in number and reach, the importance of cybersecurity in Africa must be reiterated. More Africans are coming online, increasing the continent\u2019s contribution to the global economy, and everyone from businesses to governments and individuals must learn to protect their data and digital sovereignty.\n\nGlobally, businesses lose about $1 trillion per annum to cybercrime. From ransomware attacks and phishing scams, to cryptojacking and malware, cybersecurity threats are on the rise as the world moves to become a \u201cglobal village\u201d.\n\nAfrican countries are often erroneously tagged as the countries where most cybercrimes originate from, but this has consistently been proven false. China, Russia, Brazil, India, and the United States have repeatedly topped the charts, and only 1 African country\u2014Nigeria\u2014has frequently made some of these lists.\n\nAlthough many African countries might not have the largest cybersecurity threats, they are still at risk of cyberattacks. Interpol\u2019s Africa Cyberthreat Assessment Report states that over 90% of businesses on the continent are operating without the necessary cyber security protocols in place. In 2021, cybercrime reduced GDPs across Africa by 10%, resulting in a $4 billion loss. The top 5 cyber threats are online scams, digital extortion, business email compromise or BECs, ransomware, and botnets, and most were distributed through emails. Over 679 million cybercrime-related emails were detected last year alone\u2014with 219 million of this emanating from South Africa.\n\nAs these threats grow, so do the development of cybersecurity organisations like Ciberobs, an Ivorian cybersecurity firm providing analysis, information, and tools for governments and businesses. Ciberobs also hosts an annual cybersecurity conference\u2014Cyber Africa Forum (CAF)\u2014where decision-makers across sectors gather to highlight the cyber threats facing Africa, and how to address them.\n\nIn preparation for the second edition of CAF scheduled to hold in Abidjan on May 9 and 10, TechCabal held a conversation with founder and Managing Partner Franck Ki\u00e9 to underline the importance of events like CAF.\n\nFranck Kie, Managing Partner of Ciberobs\n\nTimi Odueso: How did Ciberobs start?\n\nFranck Ki\u00e9: Well, I had my Masters\u2019 in cybersecurity. I remember I was doing a research paper and project on cybercrime in Cote d\u2019Ivoire and I couldn\u2019t find the data I needed. So I put up keyword alerts on the internet and found an old article with all the data. That journey\u2014searching for and finding the data\u2014is what really brought about Ciberobs. On a more personal level, I\u2019ve always really been interested in bringing my contribution to make Africa safer. As a kid, I grew up seeing political unrest all around C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, and I always wanted to make Africa safer, one way or the other. When I had the chance to switch careers from business to cybersecurity, I took that chance, and I haven\u2019t looked back since.\n\nTO: Since Ciberobs founding in 2019, have you found any trends across regions? Are there some countries taking cyber security more seriously?\n\nFK: I wouldn\u2019t say that some regions are doing better than others, but we could say that for countries, some of which are doing better than others. Kenya, and East Africa in general, is making a lot of advancement, partly due to the growth of the mobile money industry. There are also other countries that are more advanced because they need the economic advantage; there\u2019s danger and risk at stake, and they need to tackle it. Countries like Morocco, Mauritius, Kenya, Togo, South Africa, and even C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire are definitely putting cybersecurity at the top of their lists. And C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, for example, is taking it quite seriously because we\u2019ve been on the receiving end of global financial restrictions brought on by growing cybercrime in the country. Up until a few years ago, it was forbidden to send money, through Western Union, to Canada from C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\n\nTO: Hmm. Interesting. What advancements have been made since then to help curb these restrictions?\n\nFK: Awareness is the biggest advancement we\u2019re making now. People need to know about these cybersecurity risks. At Ciberobs, a lot of our work focuses on awareness and sensitisation. We write news, articles, and host webinars on cybersecurity. We\u2019re also planning to go to schools and universities to carry out these awareness programmes. Our biggest activity, however, is the Cyber Africa Forum event which we launched last year. In that first edition, we had over 700 attendees representing 60 countries, and we held roughly 150 meetings during the whole run.\n\nFirst edition of Cyber Africa Forum (CAF)\n\nTO: Wow, was there a resolution made in the first edition?\n\nFK: No, there wasn\u2019t. Last year was really about promotion and awareness. We wanted governments to know the importance of taking more measures in order to improve cybersecurity. Last year was more like a sub-regional event. This year, we\u2019re going bigger. We\u2019re having delegations from ministries from Kinshasa, and Brazzaville; and top cybersecurity leaders from companies like Huawei, Ecobank, Deloitte, Orange Bank, Kaspersky, and PwC. What we\u2019re really looking forward to doing this year is facilitating discussions that will highlight information and solutions to cybersecurity issues for decision-makers across sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to be a part of the conversation at CAF register for free here. The programme will take place in Abidjan, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, on May 9 and 10, 2022.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Anambra State Governor, Charles Chukwuma Soludo, has announced the appointment of Chukwuemeka Fred Agbata as the MD/CEO of the Anambra State ICT Agency for a four-year tenure.\n\nThroughout his tenure, Agbata will be expected to use his experience to help the government achieve its plans of building a mega-city. This will include expanding broadband access, digitising government services, and supporting technology startups in the state.\n\nAgbata brings over a decade of experience working in the technology sector in different roles in the media and startup space, experience that he believes will serve him as he begins a new chapter.\n\nSpeaking to Techpoint Africa on how his past will help him in his new role, Agbata said, \u201cWith my industry experience, I will be able to quickly launch new programs, attract the right partners, strengthen the tech and developer communities, organise programmes and meetups, and tons of other initiatives and activities that will benefit both Anambra State and Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAgbata\u2019s mandate will tie neatly into the state government\u2019s mission to make Anambra the digital and creative capital of Nigeria. Through the Soludo Solution, the state plans to train and support up to 10,000 youth annually while setting up a five billion venture capital fund to incubate and provide growth capital for startups.\n\nMuch of the growth in Nigeria\u2019s tech sector has been seen in Lagos State. However, growth in the industry needs to be spread across more cities if the country\u2019s unemployment rate is to be reduced.\n\nWith ICT\u2019s growing contribution to the country\u2019s GDP, some states have taken steps to take advantage of this trend.\n\nIn 2020, the Edo State Government launched the Edo Innovation Hub. The hub provides a place for state residents to convene and potentially build technological products.\n\nLast year, it inaugurated a board with Victor Asemota, SwiftaCorp Co-founder as its chairman; and Oswald Guobadia, Senior Special Assistant to the Nigerian President on Digital Transformation, as a member.\n\nAlready, the state has partnered with tech talent accelerator, Decagon in a project that plans to train 15,000 residents of the state in software development and is an attempt to follow and potentially leapfrog Lagos State as a top destination for technological innovation.\n\nOne factor that has aided the rise of Lagos as a tech hub is the existing infrastructure absent in most states in the country.\n\nAccording to data from the National Bureau of Statistics, the South Eastern region of Nigeria, where Anambra State is, has the lowest Internet penetration rates, with 13.7 million users.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIncreasing the number of residents connected to the Internet will be vital in achieving the government\u2019s goals. Already, the previous government has set the ball rolling by waiving the right-of-way charges for telcos in the state, paving the way for the new government to build on it.\n\nIn Agbata\u2019s experience and Soludo\u2019s previous experience as a Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the state could become a digital powerhouse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

Interestingly, TikTok appears to be upping its game, leaving Meta with no breathing room. Maybe some sleepless nights for Meta in the coming days?\n\nWhy? TikTok has introduced Pulse, a new advertising program that will allow brands to place advertisements alongside the platform\u2019s most popular videos.\n\nIsn\u2019t this fantastic news for TikTok Pulse creators? To put things into perspective, ad revenue will be split 50/50 between creators and publishers. This is similar to what YouTube offers creators, who reportedly receive a 55% cut.\n\nNow, you\u2019re interested, aren\u2019t you? But there\u2019s a catch: TikTok says p,m Pulse will be available only to creators and publishers with at least 100,000 followers, and even then, ads will only appear alongside \u201cthe top 4% of all TikTok videos.\u201d\n\nMoreover, TikTok\u2019s Pulse will also ensure that creator content is \u201csuitable\u201d for advertisements.\n\nThis means that Pulse will allow brands to target their ads to specific areas of TikTok. Brands can use Pulse to place ads alongside videos in 12 different categories, including beauty, fashion, pets, gaming, TV & movies, auto, Spanish language, sports and recreation, and more.\n\nFor the time being, this feature will be available to a select group of users in the United States beginning in June 2022. And sometime in September 2022, more countries.\n\nTigerrise to improve mental health access\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Emily Underworld on Unsplash\n\nIn Africa, mental health care is scarce. Per the World Health Organization (WHO), 75-95% of people with mental illnesses do not have any access to appropriate care in low and middle-income countries.\n\nTo back up this claim, Kenya\u2019s health ministry reports that 75% of people in need of mental health services cannot obtain them. Knowing the stereotypes surrounding mental illnesses in Africa, I don\u2019t think this is breaking news.\n\nWhy? Studies have shown that Kenyans suffering from mental illnesses are frequently stigmatised on several levels.\n\nConsequently, Tigerrise \u2014 a company which uses data-driven insights to disrupt the delivery of health and wellness services positively \u2014 has partnered with the Elton John AIDS Foundation.\n\nMoreso, it has received a $1 million grant to empower Kenyan youth to take charge of their mental and physical health to increase access to mental health care in Kenya.\n\nWhat\u2019s in for Kenyans? Over the next three years, the Elton John AIDS Foundation\u2019s $1 million grant will ensure that all Triggerise-affiliated clinics in Mombasa, Kenya, provide mental health screening and services ranging from individual and group counselling to trauma-based care.\n\nMoreover, these services will be fully integrated with Triggerise\u2019s existing sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services for young people aged 15 to 24.\n\nSince seamless access to SRH is critical for this age group, the collaboration will ensure that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and antiretroviral therapy (ART) services are part of Triggerise\u2019s established offerings in Mombasa.\n\nRichard Matikanya, Triggerise\u2019s Chief Operating Officer said, \u201cThe timing of this investment is particularly exciting, as the growing mental health burden among young people in their diversity \u2014 particularly those living with HIV \u2014 has largely been overlooked. Our partnership will allow us to contribute to the evidence base on how to ensure that young people have access to mental health services that respond to their needs on their terms.\u201d\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nWHAT DOES THE FUTURE OF ABORTION LOOK LIKE?\n\nChange: an Opportunity rather than a Fear\n\n\u201cEverything happens for a reason\u201d \u2014 and other lies I\u2019ve loved\n\nOpportunities\n\nTechpoint Africa will host entrepreneurs and startup enthusiasts at Techpoint Pitch Friday on Friday, May 13, 2022, by 5 p.m at 43b Emina Crescent, Opebi, Allen, Ikeja.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s probably safe to state that technology and exposure have changed how startups operate in Nigeria. After its first entry with Senegal\u2019s Wave, Y Combinator, one of the most prestigious accelerators in the world today, has gained increasing prominence in Africa.\n\nResearch from the good folks at Intelligence by Techpoint, our data and research team, has shown that African startups, on average, enter YC within a year or two of launch.\n\nIn March 2005, four illustrious professionals decided to start a company that would change how venture capitalists (VCs) invest in startups. With a seed fund of $150,000, the company took in the likes of Reddit in its first batch and has gone on to fund an enviable list of startups, including Stripe, Airbnb, and OpenSea.\n\nSince Paystack\u2019s entry in 2016, Y Combinator has seemingly increased its focus on Africa annually. This has significantly changed how African startups operate and, per some founders, helped refine their business processes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince Paystack\u2019s entry in 2016, Nigerian startups have dominated the scenes, gravitating towards the accelerator. Little wonder that 53% (51) of YC-backed African startups (95) are from Nigeria. Egypt comes in at a distant second with 12 startups, while Kenya rounds up the top three countries with 9 startups.\n\nDifferent interested parties have reasons for Nigeria\u2019s seeming dominance in YC, but it\u2019s not so surprising for the accelerator.\n\nKat Manalac, Head of Outreach at Y Combinator, points out that when one company from a region goes through YC, gets featured in the press, and raises money after demo day, more founders from that region start applying the following year.\n\n\u201cWe saw this in 2014 with Algolia \u2014 the Algolia founders were some of YC\u2019s first French founders. They went through YC in Winter 2014, and in the following batch, we saw 17 French founders go through the program. This is what started happening with African companies after Paystack went through the batch,\u201d she says.\n\nCombined, Africa\u2019s YC-backed startups had raised $1.3 billion as of March 2021, with two of them \u2014 Wave and Flutterwave \u2014 reaching a billion-dollar valuation. Paystack, another huge success story, was acquired by Stripe, a US-based payments startup, for $200 million in 2020.\n\nThese headline-grabbing stories appear to show investor attraction for YC-backed companies. For most investors, getting into YC means that a startup now has a higher valuation. But the big question remains: What problems are Y Combinator-backed startups solving?\n\nWhat problems are Africa\u2019s YC-backed startups solving?\n\nWhile this might be the most obvious question, I guess we should have framed it thus: What problems are Africa\u2019s YC-backed startups \u2018trying\u2019 to solve? Why? To use the Nigerian parlance, \u201cProblem nor dey finish\u201d, which simply means problems are never ending.\n\nOur data shows that these startups are playing in various industries, including Financial Services, eCommerce, Agriculture, Healthcare, and Mobility & Logistics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019ll work our way up from the industries with the least focus to the ones with the most focus for this article. We found some startups working in some unexpected industries, but you\u2019ll have to download the report to find out.\n\nEducation, Media, and Telecoms\n\nEducation, Media, and Telecoms are together because each sector has only one YC-backed startup trying to solve its problems. This is hardly surprising, considering that only 5% ($245m) of the $4.9 billion African startups raised in 2021 went to the Education sector.\n\nWhile Africa\u2019s education startups didn\u2019t get up to 3% of startup funding in 2020 ($1.07 billion), Media and Telecoms did not make any notable imprint on the funding numbers for 2021 and 2020.\n\nThese startups have raised a combined $7.2 million and are seemingly making decent strides in their respective industries.\n\nIn 2021, the African Union reported that there were 42 million out-of-school children in Africa, with 40% of this number coming from West Africa. Six out of ten Africans are still without access to the Internet, and affordability remains a big issue for those who have access.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that these are huge capital-intensive sectors and might not be appealing to the fast-paced, high-growth nature of modern startups. But we might just be an innovative execution away from the problem. Easier said than done, we know. As for media? That\u2019s a different ball game entirely.\n\nOther sectors like Real Estate and Marketing also feature in this group.\n\nEnergy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far, two Energy startups have gone through the prestigious accelerator programme and closed a combined $22 million to date. Slightly better than the three industries above, renewable energy solutions have attracted decent funding in Africa.\n\nWhile it only accounted for 5% ($245 million) of funding in 2021, it took 22% of funding in the previous year. A cursory glance at the numbers, which show that 43% of Africans didn\u2019t have access to electricity as of 2019, evidently points to a vast untapped market.\n\nLike Telecoms, this is also capital intensive, and from what we\u2019ve observed, several renewable energy solutions are barely affordable for the average (or even upper-middle-class) African.\n\nAgriculture\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith all its classes and tasty nutrients, food is an integral part of society. So far, YC has funded three startups looking to provide tech-enabled solutions for food security in Africa, and they have secured a combined $64 million.\n\nLike the previous industries, it appears there\u2019s a low investor appetite for startups building agriculture solutions across the continent. Agriculture startups accounted for 4% of funding in 2021, lower than 7% in 2020.\n\nAccording to world vision, 282 million people are undernourished in Africa, and that\u2019s just one result of several underlying problems. While food prices keep rising, 37% of food produced gets wasted.\n\nMobility & Logistics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMobility & Logistics is at the heart of commerce and nearly everything we do. To date, six African Mobility & Logistics startups have gone through YC, raising $94.6 million. A trend we observed is that most of these startups are based in North Africa, with roughly 30% from Nigeria.\n\nRecent funding announcements have shown a renewed interest in eCommerce in North Africa. Overall, Mobility & Logistics companies accounted for 10% of the total funding in 2021, a marginal improvement from 7% in 2020.\n\nWhen we split both sectors, we\u2019ll find that most of these companies are logistics companies. Mobility startups, on the other hand, have not raised as much.\n\nHealthcare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Tyck via Iwaria\n\nAfrica\u2019s Health sector is huge not for its number of hospitals and medical infrastructure but for the number of problems waiting to be solved. Everything, from preventive healthcare, telemedicine, health insurance, and precision medicine, represents critical areas in Africa.\n\nY Combinator has invested in eight African Health startups that have bagged a combined $115 million. These startups offer diverse healthcare solutions in preventive healthcare, health insurance, cancer diagnostics, medical logistics, and precision medicine.\n\nNine out of the top ten causes of death in Africa are health-related problems that run pretty deep. While healthcare startups are emerging, their services are mainly meant for a particular class, so it\u2019s hard to see how they can reach the mass market without significant regulatory backing.\n\nHealth startups accounted for 8% of 2021\u2019s funding, not improving on 9% in 2020. While technology is great, there are other serious considerations beyond its scope \u2014 for now at least.\n\nMarketplace\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarketplace startups have grown in popularity in recent years, and platforms that simply offer the technology to connect sellers to buyers are popping up with diverse execution strategies. So far, YC has invested in 17 startups looking to help Africans buy and sell online.\n\nConsidering the well-documented struggles of Jumia and Konga, questions abound on the viability of eCommerce startups in Africa. But these questions have not stopped YC-backed African eCommerce startups from bagging $138 million to date.\n\nOverall, eCommerce startups have accounted for 3% and 5% of funding in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Also noteworthy is that an increasing number of eCommerce startups are now serving businesses rather than consumers directly.\n\nFinancial Services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancial Services startups are the cream of the crop and the most popular sector by almost any metric in use. It has attracted the most funding and, perhaps, the most media attention for the past four years.\n\nSo far, YC has invested in a whopping 47 Financial Services startups in Africa, almost half of its Africa alumni. They\u2019ve collectively raised over $854 million, about 65% of the total funding raised by Africa\u2019s YC alumni.\n\nHowever, this trend is not peculiar to YC. Fintech companies accounted for 62% of funding in 2021, mainly due to megadeals from Flutterwave and Chipper Cash. In the preceding year, fintechs grabbed 33% of funding, still much higher than any other sector.\n\nThere are some obvious reasons for the prominence of fintech companies. Over half of the continent\u2019s population does not have access to formal financial services. As of 2020, the median age of Africans was 19.7 \u2014 this means half of the population was younger, and half of the population was older.\n\nMost fintech companies\u2019 efforts do not seem geared toward improving financial inclusion but rather promising a better experience for people who already have bank accounts. However, the jury is still out on how successful they\u2019ve been.\n\nPayments, for instance, have witnessed the most advancement. With the exploits of Paystack and Flutterwave, API-led fintechs are changing how financial companies communicate, but nearly every other sub-sector is still in the early stages.\n\nWhy is the focus on fintech?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat we fund is typically a reflection of what strong teams are applying with,\u201d says YC\u2019s Manalac, in response to our question on fintech\u2019s evident dominance.\n\nManalac\u2019s assertion suggests that the company does not deliberately look out for fintech companies, but it receives several applications from founders offering financial services solutions.\n\n\u201cThat payments lead the way shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise because it is a primary pain point for all human beings irrespective of where you are, and is one area that technology has proven that it can build solutions for,\u201d says Adesoji Solanke, Director, Frontier/SSA Banks & Fintech Equity Research, Renaissance Capital.\n\nPelumi Aboluwarin, CTO of Nigeria\u2019s Nomba (formerly Kudi), maintains that running a business is hard, so payments shouldn\u2019t be difficult too. Perseus Mlamba, CEO, Zambia\u2019s Union54, also argues that payment is the key to unlocking innovations in health, agriculture, and industry.\n\nWhile both founders run prominent financial services startups, Ikenna Nzewi, CEO of Releaf, a Nigerian Agritech startup, agrees.\n\n\u201cFintech was the first piece of our growing innovation story so it makes sense that most of the investment and attention so far has gone to that sector. However, as innovation from more sectors emerges, I believe we will see a more diverse split.\u201d\n\nAll things considered, we can safely say that YC-backed companies are mainly looking to solve problems in finance, eCommerce, logistics, and Healthcare. As these entrepreneurs gain more experience, we should better understand how these tech solutions could be best applied in an African context. As the founders we spoke to explained, going through YC is just the beginning.\n\nLooking to understand how YC\u2019s activities are changing Africa\u2019s startup landscape? We spoke to some prominent entrepreneurs who have gone through the accelerator to gain insights. Watch this space on Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Writer and Narrator.

To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email business@techpoint.africa\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe International Girls in ICT Day was celebrated globally on April 28th, 2022, and the team at the Microsoft Africa Development Center (ADC), West Africa, celebrated the day at an intimate event with schoolgirls and female tech enthusiasts.\n\nThemed \u201cAccess and Safety,\u201d the day was marked to reinforce the safety for girls and young women to thrive in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), and the need for safe and reliable access to the internet and digital tools. This year and every year, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and partners work together to develop solutions and ideas for lowering barriers to access and improving safety online for girls and young women.\n\nThe event held at the newly launched Microsoft facility in Lagos with young girls from Girls Senior Secondary Grammar School Obalende, Ikoyi Lagos, female tech enthusiasts as well as 30 ladies under 30 with no prior tech knowledge all in attendance. This audience were treated to inspiring conversations, one-on-one sessions with mentors, a tour of the office facility, and an introduction to skilling pathways in technology.\n\nOn their part, the 30 ladies under 30 who attended the observance without an academic degree or career in tech left with renewed energy willing to pursue careers in tech and software engineering.\n\nHosted by Sefunmi Wande-Durojaye, Lead Ecosystem and Program Development at Microsoft ADC-West Africa, the observance sparked conversations in ICT for girls during the day-long event, with a keynote address delivered by Bolanle Olumekor, Knowledge Management Assistant at United Nations Information Centre Nigeria.\n\nParticipants had the opportunity to hear inspiring and insightful speeches from the speakers during the sessions. Paula Wigwe, Business Manager at Microsoft ADC-West Africa, shared a relatable story of how she got into tech even though her first degree was in Estate Management. Her story had a lot to do with her curiosity, resilience and being focused.\n\nBeyond the significance of internet access and safety for young women, the day was leveraged as another channel to inspire young women interested in STEM to dream and believe in a future at Microsoft like many women, they had the opportunity to meet.

In the face of this, airlines have engaged the Federal Government, the National Assembly, NNPC and Oil Marketers with the view to bringing the cost of JetA1 down which has currently made the unit cost per seat for a one hour flight in\n\nNigeria today to an average of N120,000. The latter cannot be fully passed to passengers who are already experiencing a lot of difficulties.\n\n\u201cWhile AON appreciates the efforts of the current government under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari to ensure air transport in Nigeria grows, unfortunately, the cost of aviation fuel has continued to rise unabated thereby creating huge pressure on the sustainability of operations and financial viability of the airlines.

          "title": "Unbundling, sales, seen saving Aero Contractors",
          "text": "There are indications that Aero Contractors, the oldest airline in Nigeria, is on its way to closing shop. This follows the current financial crisis in the company, compounded by foreign exchange scarcity, high cost of aviation fuel and low passenger traffic.\n\nAfter 61 years of flight operations in Nigeria, the airline has N50 billion unserviceable debt and can currently boast of only two old aircraft \u2014 a Bombardier Dash 8-300 and a Boeing 737-500 \u2014 without operating cash to sustain its operations.\n\nHowever, experts in the aviation sector said all hopes may not be lost for the falling airline as there are some urgent interventions that can be deployed to save the airline from going under.\n\nAlexander Nwuba, managing director, Smile Air Ghana and former MD, Associated Airlines and WestAir Benin told BusinessDay the airline may need to first incorporate new structures and split the business.\n\n\u201cAero is in a situation where its liabilities create the impossibility as a going concern. In other climes like the USA, they would file a chapter 11 bankruptcy, meaning that they can longer pay their debts and force their creditors into a settlement so that the business can continue. Here it is not possible,\u201d Nwuba said.\n\n\u201cIf you cannot pay your debts, the government either rescues you, a buyer comes to the table to pay your debts or you quit the business. In the case of Aero with a stupendous debt profile, now under the management of Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON), it\u2019s either AMCON writes off the debt or finds a buyer,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said AMCON has over the years tried to see if it can resuscitate the business but all they have ever seemed to achieve is to pour kerosene into fire and Aero comes out of it, worse, now it\u2019s obvious that AMCON no longer wants to fuel the fire and there is talk of a shutdown.\n\nRead also: Despite $300m trapped funds, airlines increase flights into Nigeria\n\nHe said this invariably means that the business will disappear, which doesn\u2019t have to happen as there are still many lucrative and profitable parts to the business that can be spun off and sold.\n\n\u201cThe methodology I proposed is to establish Aero parts, a part trading and aircraft support company, Aero maintenance, to continue the profitable aircraft maintenance business; Aero support, to provide field support to the industry, Aero Services, which can leverage the 62-year business experience and provide services across many sectors from training to manuals and business process development; catering, cleaning etc. and the core airline business which requires the Air Operating Certificate (AOC), so the helicopter and aircraft business would not be easily split,\u201d Nwuba said.\n\nHe explained that these businesses can be sold into the marketplace or, the current employees can engage investment bankers to help them raise money to buy the businesses that they have demonstrated knowledge and skills in, adding that the proceeds of the sale will go to the main Aero which can then reduce its liabilities and liquidate the rest of the assets such as planes.\n\nFor John Ojikutu, aviation security consultant and Secretary-General of the Aviation Safety Round Table Initiative (ASRTI), when AMCON took over Arik and Aero, the corporation was supposed to find out the total amount owed by the two airlines locally and internationally, find technical and credit buyers both locally and international, dispose the remaining debts in the stock market to the public as shares and establish the two airlines separately as flag carriers or combine the two to form a national carrier.\n\nOjikutu said asking AMCON to be running the two airlines to recover more than N300 billion is a task that can only be achieved in 30 years if the receiver can make an annual net profit of N10bn, which can only be achieved by an aviation corporate organisation not a new asset receiver like AMCON.\n\nSpeaking on how to save the airline, he said there is a need to find out if the aircraft in the airline fleet are older than most contemporary airlines in the country, regional or continental.\n\n\u201cAero never had the problems it was having until the British technical partners left in 2010 when the Ibru family took over its running and became independent and in the hands of Nigerian management. Two years later, precisely in 2012, it joined new airlines like Arik to begin sourcing about N20 billion government intervention funds.\n\n\u201cIs anyone going to conclude that old aircraft and forex brought Arik too to the level it is? Unless we find out how these airlines got involved with over N200bn intervention funds or whoever facilitated the funds for them, we can never find solutions to their problems,\u201d he said.\n\nOlumide Ohunayo, an aviation analyst, told BusinessDay that AMCON have bitten more than they can chew, hinting that when they came into the industry everyone was happy because they promised to resuscitate the airline and save jobs but have failed.\n\n\u201cI expected that by now, Aero would have sold the airline to investors and this would have allowed the airline to survive. There were some aircrafts that were leased out which did not favour the airline. It is sad that things are happening this way. Aero was very successful and the best-managed airline at the time and still holds their safety records. We hope investors can still pick up the ashes of the airline,\u201d Ohunayo said.",

The media chooses which issues to highlight to its viewers and how to frame them, influencing what people perceive to be a priority.\n\n\u201cWhen the public discussion about a particular topic is structured in such a way that it creates a sense of outrage and menace, people will put pressure on their leaders to put that issue at the top of the political agenda.\n\n\u201cThe manner in which the media presents information shapes audience perceptions.

You are sensitive; you come with a lot of sensitivities and you have that displayed always, even when we go through contentious issues in our meetings.\n\n\u201cI can confirm that you are a patriot and as a democrat, I like your spirit which is why democracy is about contestation.

I know the country very well and the people of the country know me. I have been tested as a civil servant, a legislator in Abuja and in Bauchi, using small resources to do more as you are doing a similar thing here in Edo.\u201d\n\nMohammed noted that his reign as the president would foster oneness among Nigerians and further deepen leadership.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

These assessments are based on an analysis of publicly available country information obtained from a wide range of reliable sources including media outlets; UK and other governments; local, national and international organisations; and non government organisations.\n\n\u201cThis CPIN also acknowledges that the Nigerian government has proscribed IPOB as a terrorist organisation, some members of IPOB have reportedly used violence against the state and members of the public, and advises that persons who have committed human rights abuses must not be granted protection.\n\n\u201cThe document is publicly available on our UK Government website, Gov.UK at www.gov.uk/government/publications/nigeria-country-policy-and-information-notes.\u201d\n\nPlease see our statement, which clarifies the UK Government's position in response to some inaccurate reporting in circulation today. pic.twitter.com/pPou7SxQ9S \u2014 UK in Nigeria\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddec (@UKinNigeria) May 6, 2022\n\nMeanwhile, the Nigerian governor, relying on the apparently inaccurate report of the UK prescribing IPOB as a terrorist group, on Friday evening, released a statement welcoming the decision.\n\n\u201cNigeria welcomes the decision by the United Kingdom to proscribe the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) as a terrorist group,\u201d a tweet from the official Nigerian government twitter handle read.\n\n\u201cThe violent secessionist organisation has long been proscribed as such in Nigeria where it carries out the majority of its murderous activities.\u201d",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nThe government of Osun State under the leadership of Governor Adegboyega Oyetola, has ordered immediate enrolment of 30,000 youth into its Health Insurance Scheme.\n\nThe initiative is aimed at ensuring that Osun youths get quality healthcare delivery that is accessible, affordable and beneficial.\n\nThis is even as the government announced that it has also kick started massive recruitment into Osun Youth Employment Scheme popularly called O\u2019YES.\n\nThese disclosures were made on Friday by the Commissioner for Youth and Sports, Mr. Azeez Olayemi Lawal, during a press conference held at the Conference Room, Ministry of Information and Civic Orientation, State Government Secretariat, Abere.\n\nLawal said the initiative was to properly integrate the youth into the Scheme, especially those who are out of school, unemployed, physically challenged or mentally challenged.\n\nHe said the beneficiaries of the Scheme would be drawn from the 30 Local Government Areas, including Ife-East Area Office of the State in line with the Osun State Youth Policy Programme and Implementation Strategies.\n\n\u201cThe present administration\u2019s efforts in making sure that healthcare delivery is accessible and affordable to all citizens and residents of the State led to the establishment of the Osun Health Insurance Scheme (OHIS). The benefits of the Scheme are enormous as the people of Osun are now able to access quality healthcare without tears, with evidence of improvement in their health,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, the youths, who constitute a greater proportion of the population of the State, some of whom are out of school, unemployed, physically challenged or mentally challenged, are yet to be fully integrated into the scheme.\n\n\u201cIn order to address this, Governor Adegboyega Oyetola, who is a lover of the youth, directed that 30,000 vulnerable youth drawn from all the local government areas of the State be enrolled under the Osun Health Insurance Scheme (OHIS).\n\n\u201cThe enrollment of (30,000) thirty thousand vulnerable youth in all the Local Government in the State shall be as follows: Distribution of (OHIS) Osun Health Insurance Scheme forms to the vulnerable youth through Local Government Chairmen; Capturing and Documentation of vulnerable youth beneficiaries in each of Local Government in the State by Osun Health Insurance Scheme Team; Inauguration ceremony of (30,000) thirty thousand vulnerable youths into (OHIS) Osun State Health Insurance Scheme to be presided over by Mr. Governor, at a later date\u201d, Lawal added.\n\nThe Commissioner revealed that the administration of Governor Oyetola has concluded plans to recruit massively into the Osun Youth Empowerment Scheme as part of efforts to maximize the potential embedded in the youth so as to further contribute their quota to the growth and development of the State.\n\nHe said the recruitment of the prospective candidates for the Batch 5 of the O\u2019YES Cadets would kickstart today, and that about 62,000 Cadets had gone through the Scheme that comprised 4 batches so far so good.\n\nAccording to Lawal, the Scheme is a revolving 2-year Volunteers Scheme which strives to empower recruited youths across the 30 Local Governments and Area Office in the State while the volunteers are divided into different specialized cadres such as Public Sanitation, Public Works Brigade, Green Gang, Osun Sheriff Corps, Traffic Marshalls, Osun Paramedics, Sanitation Czars and Teachers Corps and the volunteers are deployed to offer productive services in the identified areas of socio-economic life in accordance with the objectives of the scheme.\n\n\u201cLet me make it clear that O\u2019YES itself is not about offering employment to the youth but empowering the participating youth to become self-reliant and possibly become employers of labour. This is where the exit programme comes in. The Exit Programme empowers the Cadets by helping them become self-reliant through acquisition of relevant entrepreneurial and vocational skills. As at present, the Scheme has about 74 exit programmes for the cadets to choose from.\n\n\u201cWe can boldly say that the Scheme has achieved success in transforming the lives of the ex-cadets through the exit programmes, to the extent that you can now find many of the ex-cadets doing fine in different areas of endeavours, be it the Civil Service, Para-Military Service, Private Sector etc. Similarly, many of our ex-cadets have established their own businesses.\n\n\u201cFor instance, the owners of AJ Gas in Ile-Ife, and Alamar Multi-Purpose Nigeria Limited, passed through the Scheme. Some others have improved on their educational standing such as Dr. Foluke Kehinde, Ms Deronke Egbedun who is now in Canada, etc. On the political front, there are some former O\u2019YES cadets who are now serving as Council chairmen, Secretaries to Local Government councils, Councillors, Senior Special Assistants to the Governor among others.\n\n\u201cIn addition to these, O\u2019YEs under the present administration has recorded more success stories which include Collaboration with the Osun Agency for Community and Social Development Project CSDA on PALM-OIL PROCESSING PROJECT for some ex-cadets of O\u2019yes. The sum of N1,574,625.00 was approved and presented by CSDA to six Local Government Areas. For instance, OREDAPO Vulnerable Group Ifetedo in Ife South LGA among others included some O\u2019YES Cadets who are into palm oil processing\u201d, he added.",

          "text": "It was learnt that the aspirants were asked to work with whomever among them emerges as the party\u2019s candidate for the presidential election.\n\nAccording to a report by The PUNCH, the leaders of the All Progressives Congress in the South-West, on Friday, cautioned presidential aspirants from the zone to guard against their utterances.\n\nIt was gathered that the meeting, which was held behind closed doors at the Lagos House, Marina, also resolved that name calling and other personal attacks should not be encouraged by the aspirants and their supporters.\n\nIt was learnt that the aspirants were asked to work with whomever among them emerges as the party\u2019s candidate for the presidential election.\n\nAccording to sources, the leaders also impressed the aspirants to ensure that the South-West does not lose the opportunity to produce the President in 2023.\n\nA source at the meeting said, \u201cThe issue of betrayal was put to rest as the elders affirmed that everyone who desired to run for any political office whatsoever was not encumbered in any way at all.\u201d\n\nIt was gathered that the meeting did not agree on the issue of consensus.\n\nA source, who was at the meeting, said the issue was also not listed as part of its agenda, but that it was stylishly introduced by one of the leaders.\n\nHe said one of the speakers asked if the aspirants from the zone could still step down for one another if they realised that the zone would be defeated at the party\u2019s presidential primary slated for the end of the month.\n\nBut he said none of the aspirants in attendance responded as they were not ready to step down for the other.\n\nThe source stated, \u201cHow do you ask someone who has paid N100m to step down? Step down for who? All the aspirants believe that they are popular and can win.\n\n\n\n\u201cFunnily enough, the issue of consensus was not listed in the agenda of the meeting. It was also not part of the text messages sent to us for the meeting. The meeting was majorly concerned about the utterances that are already portraying us as being divided and that the zone is behaving as if we have no leaders.\n\n\n\n\u201cYet, there are concerns that the large number of aspirants could put the zone in danger if we go into the primary like that. But nobody was asked to step down for the other.\u201d\n\nThe meeting was convened by the former interim National Chairman of the APC, Chief Bisi Akande, and a former governor of Ogun State, Chief Segun Osoba.\n\nPresent at the meeting were the Vice-President, Prof Yemi Osinbajo; a former Lagos State governor, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu; and the Ekiti State Governor Kayode Fayemi.\n\nAlso at the meeting were the Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola; Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila; Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Chief Niyi Adebayo; governors Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo, Dapo Abiodun of Ogun and Oyetola of Osun states.\n\nOthers include the Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola; the APC National Secretary, Otunba Iyiola Omisore; a former governor of Ogun State, Otunba Gbenga Daniel; a former Deputy Governor of Oyo State, Moses Adeyemo; and a former National Vice Chairman of the APC, South-West Zone, Chief Pius Akinyelure.\n\nHowever, two presidential aspirants from the South-West, Pastor Tunde Bakare, and a former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Dimeji Bankole; and the Deputy Majority Leader of the Senate, Ajayi Boroffice, who have all purchased forms, were absent at the meeting.\n\nWhile commending Osinbajo, who is the highest ranking public officer from the region, for a job well done, sources said the APC elders stated that all the aspirants had the right to aspire to be the President, but enjoined them to exhibit the \u2018Omoluabi\u2019 ethos in their politicking by shunning divisive rhetoric.\n\nWhile stating that consultation with them would be continuous, the meeting advised the aspirants to queue behind whoever among them eventually emerges as the party\u2019s candidate, stating that the cohesion of the South-West must be sacrosanct.\n\nAkande said the presidential aspirants were united that the presidency should come to the South-West region.\n\nHe stated, \u201cWe the APC are united and we will ensure that the presidency comes to our region, the South-West. We had a fruitful discussion at the meeting today (Friday).\n\n\n\n\u201cWe had a fruitful discussion. We also resolved that everybody should maintain absolute decorum because we are united.\u201d\n\nImpeccable sources at the meeting told Saturday PUNCH that Aregbesola pointedly refused to shake Omisore\u2019s hand or sit next to him and Oyetola.\n\n\u201cAregbesola was expected to sit down next to Omisore and Oyetola, but he refused to associate with them, deciding instead to sit far off. Attempts by the elders to make Aregbesola change his mind proved abortive as he said he didn\u2019t want to be associated with Omisore,\u201d one of the sources said.\n\nAt the meeting, Akande called on all aspirants and governors to ensure that they carry on with their campaigns with decorum.\n\nThe APC chieftain was said to have called on them to put the interest of the South-West first and ensure that they would not lose the ticket at the primary, which comes up at the end of the month.\n\nA source said, \u201cBaba Akande said it is better for one of us to have the Presidency than for none of us to have it. He said we should carry on our campaigns with decorum. The ultimate goal is to have a small number of aspirants through consensus. However, this will be discussed in subsequent meetings.\n\n\n\n\u201cEverything was done to ensure that the impression was not given that Baba Akande was supporting anyone. They also will encourage consensus among all aspirants in order to strengthen the unity of the Yoruba,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen asked why Bakare, Bankole and Boroffice were not invited, he said, \u201cA list was given to Niyi Adebayo to invite people. I think all these people you mentioned had not yet declared as of the time this meeting was put together.\u201d",
          "summary": "According to sources, the leaders also impressed the aspirants to ensure that the South-West does not lose the opportunity to produce the President in 2023.\nPresent at the meeting were the Vice-President, Prof Yemi Osinbajo; a former Lagos State governor, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu; and the Ekiti State Governor Kayode Fayemi.\nAkande said the presidential aspirants were united that the presidency should come to the South-West region.\nHe stated, \u201cWe the APC are united and we will ensure that the presidency comes to our region, the South-West.\nThey also will encourage consensus among all aspirants in order to strengthen the unity of the Yoruba,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "CBN gov, Godwin Emefiele under fire over presidential ambition",
          "text": "Emefiele, who is serving a second term as governor of Nigeria\u2019s apex bank, had obtained the N100 million presidential nomination forms of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) on Thursday.\n\nThe development, which suggests that he is now a card-carrying member of a political party, has raised both constitutional and ethical questions, and many have demanded his immediate resignation.\n\nBanners and advert materials of the CBN governor had been in public domain while his support groups have been mobilising for him across the country, holding conferences and rallies.\n\nAnger and disbelief have continued to swell in the country\u2019s social media space since the Delta State-born banker\u2019s power bid became public knowledge, months after he had maintained, amid speculations, that he was focused on his job.\n\n\u201cFollowing reports that the CBN governor Mr Godwin Emefiele has picked the APC N100m presidential nomination form, we urge him to immediately resign his position in line with S. 9 of the CBN Act,\u201d rights group, Socioeconomic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) declared.\n\nAbdul Mahmoud, alias Dr Great Oracle, a popular advocate noted that the CBN boss\u2019 decision literally amounted to poking his fingers at Nigerians and Nigeria\u2019s laws.\n\n\u201cEmefiele is now poking his fingers at us and our law. This is just beyond contemplation, reason and logic that a sitting CBN governor is not only a closet member of a political party, he\u2019s actively taking part in a partisan contest in defiance of Section 1 (3) of of the CBN Act, 2007 which secures the independence of CBN,\u201d noted the human rights lawyer via his Twitter handle @AbdulMahmud01.\n\n\u201cSection 9 of the act talks about the governor having no other vocation than running the CBN. If this isn\u2019t a vocation for politics, nothing is. Terrible.\u201d\n\nThe fury over Emefiele\u2019s attempt at the highest office in the country, apart from its apparent illegality, stems, perhaps more from the fact that his reign at the apex bank has been uninspiring.\n\nThe naira under his watch has been on a free fall, currently nearing N600 to the dollar. The country has had to contend with a biting recession on two occasions under his watch. Inflation has been in double digits and unemployment is 35 per cent.\n\nWorse still, many say he has been running the bank like a dictator. Early last year, he imposed a ban on cryptocurrency trade, which many young Nigerians had begun to welcome as a way out amid high unemployment figures.\n\nRotimi Akeredolu, Ondo State governor and chairman of the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum, lambasted the CBN governor for his brazen act of running for the 2023 Presidency whilst in office.\n\nAkeredolu, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, declared Emefiele\u2019s action as odd, one that constituted illegality and \u2018a joke taken too far\u2019.\n\nThe Ondo governor condemned the action of Emefiele who also reportedly visited Buhari in Aso Villa on Friday to inform the President of his 2023 presidential ambition.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe news of the purchase of Declaration of Intent and Nomination Forms to contest for the office of the President in the forthcoming general elections, on the platform of the All Progressives Congress, purportedly by the supporters of the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Mr Godwin Emefiele, has been received with palpable disbelief and shock by many Nigerians. This act, if unchecked, timeously, portends great danger to the fragile economy of the country.\n\n\u201cRumours had been rife on the subterranean partisan activities linked to him through these shadowy characters in the recent weeks. Pictures of branded vehicles, ostensibly purchased for electioneering campaigns, were also posted on the social media. The audacious moves by those who claimed to be supporting this interest have been unsettling.\n\n\u201cThis latest news confirms that the Governor may indeed be interested in immersing himself in the murky waters of politics like any other Nigerian with partisan interests. It is incontrovertible that Mr Emefiele enjoys a constitutionally protected right to belong to any group or association and participate fully, just as any Nigerian.\n\n\u201cIt is, however, difficult to imagine that a person who occupies the exalted and sensitive office of the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria will be this brazen in actualizing his ambition.\n\n\u201cThere is no gain asserting the obvious. The combined effect of the Public Service Rules, CBN Act and the 1999 Constitution, as amended, exposes not only the oddity inherent in this brash exercise of presumed right to associate.\n\n\u201cIt also confirms the illegality of the act should he proceed to submit the forms while occupying the seat as Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cConsequently, we admonish Mr Emefiele to leave the office, immediately, for him to pursue his interest. He cannot combine partisan politics with the very delicate assignment of his office. Should he refuse to quit, it becomes incumbent on the President and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces to remove him forthwith. \u201cThis is a joke taken too far.\u201d\n\nIn his reaction, Ebun Oluwa Adegboruwa, a senior advocate of Nigeria, said: \u201cI believe that the case of the CBN governor highlights the nature of governance that we have in Nigeria, which is everybody to yourself and no one for all. Things have fallen apart. It is the height of impunity and scandalous of the All Progressives Congress government for allowing him to bastardise his office,\u201d\n\nThe senior lawyer who demanded the governor\u2019s immediate sack, noted that the declaration makes a mockery of the country\u2019s democratic experience.\n\n\u201cIt is a mockery of our democratic experience and an abuse of decency. It is recklessness. I believe lawyers and lovers of peace should call for his removal or sacking,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBy purchasing the form, he lost the moral authority to function as governor of CBN. He should leave to join his colleagues in politics. He should not rubbish the office.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Bar Association and civil society organisations should demand that all the money paid to him by the CBN should be refunded.\u201d\n\nThe lawyer also alleged that Emefiele\u2019s attention had been in politics, saying that may be responsible for the country\u2019s poor economic growth.\n\n\u201cHe never deserved that office. His eyes have been in politics. This explains why the naira and the economy are falling. His mind has always been in politics. He has always been distracted.\u201d He said.\n\nOby Ezekwesili, Nigeria\u2019s former Minister of Education, alleged that the Emefiele, handed over the apex bank\u2019s control to the President Muhammadu Buhari since the latter assumed office.\n\nShe also alleged that the \u201cill-advised monetary policies\u201d of the bank in the last seven years were \u201cpolitical\u201d.\n\nEzekwesili\u2019s allegations followed the reports that Emefiele picked the All Progressives Congress N100m presidential nomination and expression of interest form. He reportedly picked up the form on Friday in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.\n\nThe former minister in a series of tweets on his Twitter handle on Friday said the wrong monetary policies since Buhari assumed office in 2015 were testament that the bank had handed over its independence to the President.\n\nShe alleged that the hidden politics behind the wrong monetary policies and alleged control of the CBN by Buhari led to Emefiele\u2019s open partisan politics.\n\nShe wrote, \u201cIf you did not know all along that Nigeria\u2019s serial wrong and ill-advised Monetary Policies of the last 7 years were political because the @cenbank long handed its independence to the Villa @NGRPresident @MBuhari , at least now you know. They\u2019ve outed themselves. Finally.\u201d\n\nEzekwesili, however, asked the CBN governor to resign from his position and pursue his \u201cill-fated political career\u201d.\n\nShe tweeted, \u201cThe Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria @cenbank must now immediately tender his resignation to stop further destroying whatever little remains of the country\u2019s monetary policy reputation. Mr Emefele should leave immediately- tonight- to pursue his ill-fated political career,\u201d She said.\n\n\u201cThe audacity of Emefiele, a serving CBN governor to obtain the presidential form of the APC shows there\u2019s no one in charge of Nigeria at the moment. Buhari is just existing in Aso Rock with no clues as to what is going on under his nose. This brazen impunity scares me,\u201d fumed social critic Henry Shield Nwazuluahu, @henryshield.\n\nMoris Monye, a popular social media commentator, in a rather sarcastic tweet, summed up all that is wrong with a man who controls the country\u2019s vault taking part in an election.\n\n\u201cIf Emefiele does not win the APC primaries with the vast power at his possession then he doesn\u2019t know the ball,\u201d Monye wrote.\n\n\u201cHe can freeze opponents\u2019 accounts, deny some people bullion vans, credit delegates any amount in their account, and bring raw, cold dollars in cash if they want. Limitless power.\u201d\n\nFor Chidi Odinkalu, another human rights lawyer, the CBN governor\u2019s move has to be some sort of a joke taken too far.\n\n\u201cMr. Emefiele & his #Meffy2023 gang believe that they can get installed as Nigerian president by riding #CartsAndHorses through the Central Bank,\u201d Odinkalu wrote, via @ChidiOdinkalu.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll 1st have to turn over #TheMint to a judge in his back pocket who will rule that party politicking is a \u201ccharitable cause.\u201d\u2018\n\nFor another popular Twitter commentator, NEFERTITI, @firstladyship, the governor\u2019s move has to be some sort of madness.\n\n\u201cCBN governor destroyed the naira & institutionalized arbitrage in the forex market. He restricted fintechs & blocked bank accounts of peaceful EndSARS protesters,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cSo where did Godwin Emefiele get the N100m for his APC presidential form? Any limit to this N100m declaration madness?\u201d\n\nFinancial expert, Kalu Aja, @FinPlanKaluAja1, is obviously lost for words.\n\n\u201cI have to collect my thoughts,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201dWe are going to talk about this on Spaces, and I will write an article on this. This is unbelievable, I honestly am in shock.\n\n\u201cI fear for the naira (it will fall). All those \u201cloans\u201d given to farmers are all gone.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2026Govt should see oil theft as a national economic sabotage \u2013 Olamilekan \u2026Companies must engage natives \u2013 Efih \u2018\u2026Register illegal refiners\u2019 \u2026Finger security personnel in deals\n\nA representative of the oil-producing host communities (HostCom) in the Niger Delta region at the recently concluded stakeholders\u2019 consultative meeting organised by the Nigerian upstream regulatory Commission, Prince Philemon Ebiesuwa, has advised the federal government to bring illegal miners into a cooperative in order to curb oil theft.\n\nPrince Ebiesuwa, of Awoye \u2013 an oil-producing community in Ilaje LGA, Ondo state, gave the advice while speaking exclusively to Blueprint Weekend on the sideline of the meeting against the backdrop of the revelation that Nigeria lost about $3.2 billion to crude oil theft between January 2021 and February this year.\n\nAccording to him, the act is perpetrated with the aid of security personnel and some oil companies\u2019 staff.\n\nHe said some of the people that were involved in this oil theft were \u201cvery powerful community people, adding that \u201cmaybe, they don\u2019t want to challenge them or cross their path.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cSo, if you say oil theft, there is no way they can do it without some inside knowledge of security operatives or some staff of these oil companies.\n\n\u201cBut the one I know of, and I can speak of, in my area in Ondo state, particularly where Chevron operates, is that there is this local community security network.\n\n\u201cThe aim is for community people to go around and protect the facilities from being vandalised; and it has worked because they are the local people and they know the people involved in it. As they patrol, it has reduced to the barest minimum, if not eliminated. I can say with certainty that such doesn\u2019t happen in that area because of the local security network and it has worked.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWhat is feel can stem the tide is what the vice-president suggested. And I can tell you that 30-40% of AGO we use in the Niger Delta are from these illegal refineries. They produce them and people use them. So, if you can legalise them, ask them to register with the government and the government supplies them, they can now produce a better AGO. And those that are registered will not allow any illegal body to come and spoil their business. I think that is one way to fight it.\n\n\u201cYou are not going to proliferate it. If they are known in Ondo state, and you ask them to come together and form a consortium, and give them regulations, the way they will work without endangering the environment. That one is better than allowing them to go and continue to cause more damage.\u201d\n\nProduction figures\n\nSimilarly, a security consultant, Friday Efih, said in an exclusive chat with this reporter that \u201cthose figures they are calling are figures given to them by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Ltd. (NNPCL),\u201d adding that the \u201cNNPCL themselves are not sincere.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cBefore the divestment of the facility at Oben to Seplat by Shell, they said they were producing about 20,000 barrels per day, and when Seplat took over, in the first three months their production increased with the same facility, the same security challenges, to about 35,000 barrels per day; so, where was the 15,000 going into?\n\n\u201cYou know the DPR officials are those that fill the vessels at the terminals. A vessel is supposed to take 2 million, what they do is that they can give you 2.2 million. At a time, they will stop the metre and just fill the vessel, and then they bargain with the owner of the vessel how much they will get, nobody monitors them.\u201d\n\nEfih also said to curb the menace, oil companies needed to engage the natives from their various host communities.\n\n\u201cThis, he said, \u201cis because they know the terrain and so they would be able to adequately monitor the pipelines.\u201d\n\n\u201cOil theft must thrive because the natives are not being engaged. How can you bring somebody from another region to man the stations? Definitely, they must compromise. But when you engage the natives, you will succeed more than an outsider. In every community I know who and who to engage.\n\n\u201cThese people that you are going to engage are the people that will say, okay, they are stealing 50,000 barrels per day, we can reduce it; the only thing is to reduce the rate. You know criminality can never be wiped out, what you do is curb it.\n\n\u201cThe people you will engage will be your eye. These are the people that will give you information on a daily basis about the flow lines. Once there is a leakage, they are the ones that will report the leakage to the company. When they report to the company, that leakage will be stopped.\n\n\u201cThe natives have to give me a report on a daily basis and you must write your report by 8:00am and by 10:00am, I will get our report. Once I don\u2019t get a report from you at about 12am to 2:00am, it means something different because if you wait for a monthly report, you can never work it out. So, the mode of reporting will be twice a day.\n\n\u201cThe first one will be by 12pm and the second one will be by 3:00am. At least, I know how they operate and anyone that does not report within those specific time frames, it means something is wrong. In their case, they wait for a monthly report which is a summary of all your activities for the month. You can get another report every two weeks. When you are closing the monthly report, it is expected to come in latest on the 28 of the month, while the reports from the natives are expected to come on the 26 of the month.\u201d\n\nAlso, speaking exclusively to Blueprint Weekend, a political economist, Adefolarin Olamilekan, said the remote and immediate causes of the development should be considered.\n\nOlamilekan said the government should be blamed for its failure to see oil theft as a national economic sabotage, as according to him, successive governments had only paid lip service to tackling it head-long.\n\nHe said the presidential task force set up to address the issues of oil theft had failed to produce the desired result.\n\n\u201cHowever, the challenge keeps increasing with more complicated issues of official negligence and culpability.\n\n\u201cOil majors operating in the Niger Delta region for reasons best known to them fail to deploy modern security technologies to safeguard oil pipes or even replace outdated and worn out equipment.\n\n\u201cThe shameful involvement of security personnel as an act of sabotage in reducing oil theft rather escalates it in more complex ways,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said further that to tackle oil theft there was the need for a declaration of war on oil thieves.\n\n\u201cIn this regard there needs to be a legislation that would back the government pronouncement of oil thieves as economic terrorists. Oil companies and NNPC must see the need to replace oil wells and pipelines that are already in obsolete conditions. Meanwhile, the use of technology is critical in securing oil platforms across the Niger Delta and beyond.\n\n\u201cThirdly, the oil host community must stand up against oil thieves. We suggest a government incentive to the community that would not allow oil thieves in their domains.\u201d\n\nGovt functionaries not left out\n\nAlso, speaking with this reporter via telephone, a source who asked not to be named in print for obvious reasons, said the oil theft situation \u201cis the way it is because top functionaries in the government and oil companies are involved.\u201d\n\nThe source said, \u201cThere was a time I went to one of our stations and when I saw what was happening close to the JTF houseboat, I met their commander and complained and he told my boss to stop sending me here. Look at the OPEC report concerning Nigeria\u2019s rig count, the situation is gradually shutting down the economy.\u201d\n\nHe said further that the sophistication involved in oil theft had made it possible to sell crude without having to shutdown production.\n\n\u201cThere is a way you can tap crude without having to disrupt production. The wellheads can be working but the oil is coming out. It\u2019s like your Somo; once there is a leak, it will be working, but water won\u2019t come out. That is the situation we find ourselves right now.\u201d\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

The \u2018Indigenous People of Biafra\u2019 (IPOB) is not a proscribed organisation in the UK.\n\n\u201cThe inaccurate reporting relates to the 13 April 2022 publication by the UK Government of a revised Country Policy and Information note (CPIN) on separatist groups in SE Nigeria, including the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).

These assessments are based on an analysis of publicly available country information obtained from a wide range of reliable sources including media outlets; UK and other governments; local, national and international organisations; and non-government organisations.\n\n\u201cThis CPIN also acknowledges that the Nigerian government has proscribed IPOB as a terrorist organisation, some members of IPOB have reportedly used violence against the state and members of the public, and advises that persons who have committed human rights abuses must not be granted protection.\u201d\n\n\u2018Confiscate IPOB assets\u2019\n\nIn his Friday statement, Mr Shehu asked the UK to confiscate IPOB assets, shut down their communication channels and sanction the issuance of visas to IPOB\u2019s funders in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSuch sanctions have played a critical role in combatting other terror groups. And make no mistake: today Africa is a breeding ground for terror, with local and international groups alike gaining strength across the continent, thriving on the economic devastation of the pandemic,\u201d Mr Shehu said.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s intelligence and security forces are the first lines of defence against such groups, including ISIS and Al Quaeda affiliated Boko Haram. We rely on our allies in the West for their support.\n\n\u201cIPOB\u2019s \u2013 and its 50,000 strong paramilitary unit\u2019s \u2013 reign of terror has seen villages butchered, school buses set alight and politicians\u2019 homes bombed. Through their international network of radio and TV stations, they threaten further violence if their demands are not met, while inciting violence and religious and ethnic tension between Nigeria\u2019s Christian and Muslim populations.\n\n\u201cTheir mouthpieces and their wallets are their most effective tools \u2013 it is these assets Nigeria\u2019s allies must target next.

That emergency was allowed to lapse on April 14.\n\nBut protests have escalated since then, fuelling Sri Lanka\u2019s worst crisis since independence in 1948.\n\nThe new emergency declaration came as thousands of demonstrators remained outside Rajapaksa\u2019s sea-front office, where they have been protesting since April 9, and smaller groups also tried to storm homes of other key government politicians.\n\nStorming Parliament\n\nThe students\u2019 attempt to storm the tightly-guarded legislature on Friday was their second in as many days.\n\nThey and other demonstrators blame Rajapaksa and his ruling family for mismanaging the economy. Months of blackouts and acute shortages of food, fuel and pharmaceuticals have caused widespread suffering across the island.\n\nMillions of workers stayed off work on Friday in the strike, organised by the country\u2019s trade union movement. Train and state-owned bus services were disrupted.\n\nIndustrial workers demonstrated outside their factories and black flags were hung across the country in an expression of anger against the government.\n\n\u201cWe can pinpoint the policy blunders of the president that led to this very sorry state of our economy,\u201d said trade union leader Ravi Kumudesh. \u201cHe must go.\u201d\n\nPrivate buses, which account for two-thirds of the country\u2019s fleet, were also off the road, Private Bus Operators Association chairman Gemunu Wijeratne said.\n\n\u201cWe are not providing services today, but if groups of people want to join the anti-government protests within a radius of 20 kilometres, we will give our buses free of charge,\u201d Wijeratne told reporters in Colombo.\n\nRajapaksa has insisted he will not step down despite the escalating demonstrations, including the protest outside his office which has forced him to work from home.\n\nOfficial sources said the president could pressure his elder brother, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, to step down and allow the formation of a unity government to guide the country out of the economic crisis.\n\nThe main opposition SJB party has insisted that it will not take up any role in a national administration unless the president also steps down accepting responsibility for mismanagement and corruption.\n\nSri Lanka\u2019s economic crisis took hold after the coronavirus pandemic hammered income from tourism and remittances.\n\nUnable to pay for fuel imports, utilities have imposed daily blackouts to ration electricity, while long lines of people snake around service stations for petrol and kerosene.\n\nHospitals are short of vital medicines and the government has appealed to citizens abroad for donations.\n\nLast month Sri Lanka announced it was defaulting on its $51 billion foreign debt, and finance minister Ali Sabry warned this week that the country will have to endure its unprecedented economic hardships for at least two more years.\n\nAFP",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday, on the last day of his two-day working visit to Ebonyi State, told leaders of the South-east geo-political zone that the court would determine the fate of the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra\u2019s leader, Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nThe Igbo leaders, during a meeting with the President at the Government House, Abakaliki, had pleaded with Buhari to release Kanu.\n\nThe Chairman, South-East Traditional Rulers Council, Eze Charles Mkpuma, delivered the plea.\n\nResponding, the President said: \u2018\u2018I have listened carefully to the various appeals from the elders to the traditional leaders regarding a wide range of options, and as I have said previously, this matter remains in the full purview of the courts where it will be properly adjudicated.\n\n\u201cMy worry is for our hardworking and innocent civilians, for whom life is already tough and would like to earn a decent and honest living.\n\n\u2018\u2018There are many that fit this profile and the government owes them that obligation to protect lives and property.\n\n\u2018\u2018I will once again repeat, no one has the right to carry an AK-47, and anyone seen in any part of the country doing so and is not a law enforcement officer is a threat to our peaceful coexistence and should be treated as such.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari pledged his administration\u2019s readiness to protect innocent and hardworking Nigerians from terrorists and those causing break down of law and order in the South East zone.\n\nHe expressed concern over the deteriorating security situation in the region, reiterating his directive to security agencies to \u201cflush out\u201d those perpetrating violence in the land.\n\nHe said: \u201cI must register my deep and grave concern with regards to the deteriorating state of security affairs in this region.\n\n\u201cIn the last 48 hours, I have been informed of the latest in the round of brutal actions carried out by gun-wielding terrorists, who prey on innocent and hardworking citizens. Unfortunately, these barbaric acts were visited upon those who have committed their lives to protect their fellow citizens.\u201d\n\nThe President paid tribute to members of the Nigerian Armed Forces who recently lost their lives in the region.\n\nOn infrastructure, President Buhari highlighted some of his government\u2019s achievements in the zone, dismissing those peddling false narratives of lack of care and consideration for the people of the South-east by this administration\n\nThe President said he was proud of the reconstruction of the runway of the Akanu Ibiam International Airport and ongoing upgrade of the International Terminal Building, assuring Ndigbo that the N200 billion Second Niger Bridge and 10km six-lane expressway in Onitsha and Asaba would be completed before the end of the year.\n\nHe added that the $5.5 million Diagnostic Centre in Umuahia was already operational.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State said President Buhari would be remembered as a man who did not use the plight of the people of the South-east to play politics, but came to their rescue severally.\n\nThe governor urged South Eastern leaders to work towards finding a political solution in resolving some challenging issues, warning that the region was at \u201ccrossroads.\u201d\n\nUmahi said: \u201cOn this issue of a political solution, I have never believed in IPOB\u2019s method of operation, I disagree with them, but we have gotten ourselves to a very terrible and pitiable situation.\n\n\u201cSome of us warned that we will get to this situation and some were playing politics with it.\n\n\u201cMr. President, we are at a crossroads. I have been to you and I have begged you for a political solution. Surprisingly and graciously, you granted that. You said our people should initiate that and at the forefront is Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s lawyer.\u201d\n\nThe governor, therefore, urged the President of Ohaneze Ndigbo to meet with elder statesman, Mbazuluike Amaechi, the Chairman of Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), South East, the Chairman of South East Traditional Rulers Council, Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s lawyer and a few others to initiate the political solution.\n\nOn the forthcoming 2023 elections, Umahi said he believed strongly in the demand for the presidency to be zoned to the South-east region on the basis of fairness, equity, justice and morality.\n\nThe Ebonyi State Governor, who is also a presidential aspirant, commended some leaders from outside the region for expressing their support for the next president of Nigeria to emerge from the South-east.\n\nThe Chairman of South-east Traditional Rulers, Eze Charles Mkpuma and CAN Chairman, South-east, Very Rev. Fr. Abraham Nwali, also spoke in favour of the President of Nigeria of South East extraction come 2023.\n\nThe leaders, while expressing support for a united Nigeria, appealed to the President to grant pardon and release the IPOB leader, urging other agitators to cease all forms of hostilities.\n\nThe Ohanaeze had in a statement on Tuesday hoped that Buhari\u2019s visit to Ebonyi State would kick-start the process to get Kanu freed.\n\nThe Igbo socio-cultural organisation, in the statement said, \u201cOhanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide has given assurances of peace and security ahead of the planned presidential visit to Ebonyi State.\n\nKanu is standing trial on an amended 15-count charge bordering on treasonable felony.\n\nIn April, a federal high court in Abuja struck out eight out of the 15-count charge filed against the IPOB leader.\n\nMike Ozekhome, Kanu\u2019s lead counsel, described the charges as \u201cdefective and baseless.\u201d\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja",

Emefiele has not officially indicated interest in competing for the Presidential flag of the APC, saying he is focused on strengthening the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nExpressing the reason for their push for Emefiele, the farmers said the CBN governor\u2019s tenure as head of the Nigerian apex bank, \u201chas shown capacity, focus, courage and worked tirelessly with the economic team of President Mohammadu Buhari to keep the economy of our great country afloat above recession and outright collapse.\u201d\n\nThey said they took the decision having realised that the CBN governor \u201cis one of the trusted and tested Nigerians that have the commitment and competence to protect the interests of farmers across the country and give priority to commodity and agricultural value chain.\u201d\n\nThe leaders of 30 farmers\u2019 associations met in Abuja last Wednesday to articulate their position on the Nigerian presidency, saying that they are the biggest stakeholders in the country ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\nOne of the conveners of the meeting, Malam Ibrahim Garba said the robust national security the country needs now could only be achieved through food security.\n\nGarba said: \u201cAgriculture is the key to achieving national security. Through agriculture, millions of Nigerians are economically empowered and gainfully engaged, our industries are revived, a multifaceted value chain ecosystem created, and food security is ensured.\n\n\u201cDespite the Covid-19 pandemic, Nigerians were never short of food. We were never hungry even when every country in the world shut its borders for nearly a year.\n\n\u201cOnly God knows what would have happened if we were importing the food we eat.

          "text": "The Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) has served notice of ceasing operations on Monday, May 9, over the high cost of aviation fuel otherwise known as JetA1.\n\nIn a statement co-signed by the leading executives of Air Peace, Max Air, Arik Air, United Nigeria Airlines, Aero Contractors, Ibom Air, Azman Air, Overland Airways and Dana Air, the airlines complained of subsidising their services to customers in the last four months due to the \u201castronomical hike\u201d in the price of aviation fuel from N190 per litre to N700.\n\n\u201cAirlines have engaged the Federal Government, the National Assembly, NNPC and Oil Marketers with the view to bringing the cost of JetA1 down which has currently made the unit cost per seat for a one hour flight in Nigeria today to an average of N120,000,\u201d the AON statement said.\n\n\u201cThe latter cannot be fully passed to passengers who are already experiencing a lot of difficulties,\u201d said the operators who recently had to raise base fares fir a one hour flight to N50,000.\n\nThe operators revealed that aviation fuel is about 40% of an airline\u2019s operating cost globally but the recent hike in prices has shot up Nigerian airlines\u2019 operating cost to about 95%.\n\nRead the Statement in full below:\n\nAIRLINE OPERATORS TO SHUT DOWN OPERATIONS AMIDST HIGH COST OF JETA1, SYMPATHISE WITH PASSENGERS\n\nIt is with a great sense of responsibility and patriotism that the Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) have carried on deploying and subsidizing their services to our highly esteemed Nigerian flying public in the last four months despite the steady and astronomical hike in the price of JetA1 and other operating costs.\n\nOvertime, aviation fuel price (JetA1) has risen from N190 per litre to N700 currently. No airline in the world can absorb this kind of sudden shock from such an astronomical rise over a short period. While aviation fuel worldwide is said to cost about 40% of an airline\u2019s operating cost globally, the present hike has shut up Nigeria\u2019s operating cost to about 95%.\n\nIn the face of this, airlines have engaged the Federal Government, the National Assembly, NNPC and Oil Marketers with the view to bringing the cost of JetA1 down which has currently made the unit cost per seat for a one hour flight in Nigeria today to an average of N120,000.\n\nThe latter cannot be fully passed to passengers who are already experiencing a lot of difficulties.\n\nWhile AON appreciates the efforts of the current government under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari to ensure air transport in Nigeria grows, unfortunately, the cost of aviation fuel has continued to rise unabated thereby creating huge pressure on the sustainability of operations and financial viability of the airlines.\n\nThis is unsustainable and the airlines can no longer absorb the pressure. To this end therefore, the Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) hereby wishes to regrettably inform the general public that member airlines will discontinue operations nationwide with effect from Monday May 9, 2022 until further notice.\n\nAON uses this medium to humbly state that we regret any inconveniences this very difficult decision might cause and appeal to travelers to kindly reconsider their travel itinerary and make alternative arrangements.\n\nSigned: Alhaji (Dr.) Abdulmunaf Yunusa Sarina President Jointly signed by: 1.
