          "title": "NDLEA intercepts N6.5bn drugs in Lagos, goes after fleeing baron",
          "text": "A suspected drug baron, Tony Onwurolu, has been declared wanted by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency as the agency recovered a consignment of 26.150 kilogrammes of heroin at the SAHCO shed of the Murtala Mohammed International Airport, Ikeja, Lagos.\n\nIt was gathered that the drug, with a street value of N6.5bn, arrived in Lagos on June 30, 2021, in 25 parcels from South Africa through a private Nigerian airline.\n\nA statement by the Director, Media and Advocacy, NDLEA, Femi Babafemi, on Sunday, said the consignment was detained for screening following reasonable suspicion of the content.\n\nBabafemi stated that narcotic officers at the MMIA Command on July 1, 2021, trailed the driver and clearing agent assigned to deliver the consignment to Onwurolu\u2019s house on Lateef Adegboyega Street, off Ago Palace Way, by Grandmate Bus Stop, Okota, Lagos.\n\nHe said, \u201cDuring the follow-up operation, Tony Chidi Onwurolu, who mounted counter-surveillance around his neighbourhood, fled his home before the arrival of the team of operatives who stormed his residence. They were, however, able to search his home and recover a number of documents to establish his true identity.\n\n\u201cFollowing the development, the Chairman/Chief Executive of NDLEA, Brig. Gen. Mohamed Buba Marwa (retd), has directed that the fleeing drug baron, Tony Chidi Onwurolu, be declared wanted immediately and his details submitted to Interpol for tracking across the world. He, therefore, directed the agency\u2019s directorate of assets and financial investigations, as well as the directorate of intelligence, to deploy their networks to fast track the arrest of Onwurolu.\n\n\u201cMarwa said in view of the volume of heroin brought into the country by the fleeing baron, the agency would deploy all available mechanisms, locally and internationally, to track him and bring him to face charges in a law court.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the agency said it intercepted a 4.3kg skunk concealed in nine packs of cereals and imported from Canada on an Ethiopian airline.\n\nOperatives of the agency also intercepted one Babatunde Bakare on July 9 with 550 grams of cannabis and 50g of Rohypnol concealed in six jerrycans of local herbal mixtures called Gabo at SAHCO export shed, MMIA, Ikeja.\n\nAccording to Babafemi, the drug was detected during the outward clearance of cargo going to Dubai.\n\nBabafemi added, \u201cEarlier on Tuesday, 6th July, operatives of the MMIA command conducted a follow-up operation at Gate 2, Ladipo Oluwole Street, opposite Guinness Bottling Company, Ikeja, where one Animashaun Kabiru was apprehended for questioning about a bag containing bitter cola, which was brought for export to the UK. When the bag of bitter kola was searched, it was discovered that the bitter kola was mixed with some wraps of a substance suspected to be an illicit drug. Thirty-six wraps of the suspected substance later tested positive for cocaine, weighing 600grams.\n\n\u201cIn a related development, a Uber driver, Lawal Tunde Rasheed, arrested on 8th June in connection with the seizure of a cocaine consignment, has been let off the hook following his cooperation that led to the arrest of the real owner of the drug, Mr Egbo Emmanuel Maduka, who in his statement, accepted ownership of the consignment and absolved Lawal of any complicity.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Governors in the South-West geopolitical zone have proposed conversion of the present six geopolitical zones into federating units, as part of the ongoing review of the 1999 Constitution by the National Assembly.\n\nThe South West Governors\u2019 Forum, in a document presented to members of the National Assembly from the geopolitical zone, also made other proposals to weaken central government, while allocating more powers to the federating units and states.\n\nOur correspondent obtained the document containing the proposals by the governors, which was presented to the South-West caucus of the National Assembly on Tuesday.\n\nThe governors had met with the lawmakers in Abuja behind closed doors last week.\n\nThe governors at the meeting were Rotimi Akeredolu (Ondo State), who is also the Chairman of the South West Governors\u2019 Forum; Seyi Makinde (Oyo), Kayode Fayemi (Ekiti State), Gboyega Oyetola (Osun), Babajide Sanwo-Olu (Lagos) and Dapo Abiodun (Ogun).\n\nAfer the meeting, Akeredolu had said the South-West would be approaching the constitution amendment with a common front.\n\nHe added that the meeting had set a committee made of up senators led by the caucus chairman (Opeyemi Bamidele) and House of Representatives caucus chairman (Femi Fakeye) and attorneys-generals of the South-West states.\n\n\u201cThe committee is to harmonise our position so that we can present it when necessary before the two Houses and at the end of the day, have a constitutional amendment and have our serious input. Thank you all,\u201d he had said.\n\nThe PUNCH reliably learnt on Friday that the joint Senate and House committee would fine tune the proposals and ensured that they were captured in the constitution review exercise.\n\nIn the document titled, \u2018Proposals for the Review of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (As Amended): Presentation by South-West Governors\u2019 Forum\u2019 and dated July 5, 2021, the governors sought amendment to Section 3(1) and (3) of the constitution.\n\nThe present Section 3(1) reads, \u201cThere shall be 36 states in Nigeria, that is to say, Abia, Adamawa, Akwa Ibom, Anambra, Bauchi, Bayelsa, Benue, Borno, Cross River, Delta, Ebonyi, Edo, Ekiti, Enugu, Gombe, Imo, Jigawa, Kaduna,Kano, Katsina, Kebbi, Kogi, Kwara, Lagos, Nasarawa, Niger, Ogun, Ondo, Osun, Oyo, Plateau, Rivers, Sokoto, Taraba, Yobe and Zamfara.\u201d\n\nThe governors added, \u201cWe propose that Section 3(1) be amended as a federation consisting of six geopolitical zones constituted from the states. The federating units or regions are divided into the following geopolitical zones: North-West Zone, North-Eastern Zone, Middle \u2013 Belt Zone, South-East Zone, South-South Zone, South-West Zone and the Federal Capital Territory.\n\nThe forum added that \u201cthe geopolitical zones have been recognised and accepted by Nigeria\u2019s political class.\u201d\n\nIt also said, \u201cSection 3(6) be amended to provide for a number of local governments or such autonomous administrative units to be created by the respective federating units or states, the criteria of which shall include population, taxable capacity, ethno-religious or other cultural and social affinities.\u201d\n\nAnother major proposal in the presentation is an amendment to Section 7 of the constitution which is about local government.\n\nThe governors asked that the section \u201cinclude an additional (sub)section prohibiting the dissolution of elected local government councils.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis will be in compliance with the Supreme Court decisions in ALGON v. Oyo State Government; AG Plateau State & Others v. Goyol & Others; Governor, Ekiti State v. Olubunmo & Others,\u201d the forum added.\n\nAlso, the South-West governors proposed that Section 8 be amended by deleting Subsections 5 and 6, thereby removing the powers to create state from the Federal Government.\n\nThe proposal reads, \u201cSection 8(5) and (6) should be expunged. Section 8 (1) and (2) provides for the procedures for creation of state while Section 8(3), (4), (5) and (6) provides for the procedure for creation of local governments.\n\n\u201cHowever, Section 8(5) and (6) should be expunged to make local government creation the exclusive duty of the state government.\u201d\n\nThe governors also wanted the wordings of Section 14(4) changed.\n\nThe present version reads, \u201cThe composition of the government of a state, a local government council, or any of the agencies of such government or council, and the conduct of the affairs of the government or council or such agencies shall be carried out in such manner as to recognise the diversity of the people within its area of authority and the need to promote a sense of belonging and loyalty among all the people of the federation.\u201d\n\nThe proposed version reads, \u201cThe composition of the government of the federation or any of its agencies and the conduct of its affairs shall be carried out in such a manner as to reflect the federal character of Nigeria and the need to promote national unity, fair representation of individuals and groups and also command national loyalty, thereby ensuring that there shall be no predominance of a particular gender and also to command national loyalty, thereby ensuring that there shall be no predominance of persons from a few ethnic or other sectional groups in that government or in any of its agencies.\u201d\n\nIf the proposed amendment to Section 15 eventually becomes law, Nigeria\u2019s motto would be changed to \u2018Unity and Faith, Equality, Peace and Progress.\u2019\n\nThe forum also called for deletion of Section 29(4)(b), which confers adulthood status on a married under-18 woman.\n\nExplaining the proposal, the governors say, \u201cSection 29(4)(a) and (b) contradicts each other. While (a) says \u2018full age means the age of 18 years and above\u2019, (b) says \u2018any woman who is married shall be deemed to be full of age.\u2019 This reinforces child marriage which negates the Convention on the Rights of the Child 1989 and the Child\u2019s Rights Act 2003, which outlaws child marriage.\u201d\n\nThe governors also want the states to be in charge of mineral resources within their respective territories.\n\nConsequently, they have proposed an amendment to Section 44(3) that vests exploitation of mineral oils and natural gas in the Federal Government.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Maryam Ahmad further decried the high rate of out of school children in the country which stands at 13.5 million.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cThere are over 13.5 million children in Nigeria who are unable to access free and quality basic education, with the girl child in North Eastern states having a higher percentage of this figure. Crisis, insecurity, cultural and religious dispositions and poor funding have been limiting factors to quality education in these states.\n\n\u201cThe emergence of the novel COVID-19 pandemic has further put a strain on child education. It is a known fact that schools in Nigeria remained closed throughout the COVID-19 lockdown. This situation has increased the number of children especially girls who are unable to access free, compulsory, quality and basic education.\n\n\u201cAgainst this backdrop, LEDAP in conjunction with Malala Fund is raising awareness on the right to free, compulsory and quality basic education in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe project is aimed at providing solution to the low education enrollment and high rate of school drop out for children in Nigeria, and in the light of the Covid-19 pandemic; to mitigate its impact on the education of children in the state by ensuring that the Kano state government takes appropriate action to promote free and quality basic education for all, especially girls.\u201d\n\nShe further called on the ministries of Education and Justice of each state to prioritize right to education of the child in their agenda and to guarantee that no child in the state is denied access to free, basic and quality education.\n\n\u201cThe Government must bring back better by introducing gender responsive measures that will transform education system and address the barriers inhibiting girl child education in the state.\n\n\u201cLEDAP urges the government to commit resources to education through increased budget allocation and funding so as to ensure that no child is denied access to free basic education by any school and to drastically reduce the number of out of school children in Nigeria.\n\n\n\nIf this is done, there would be improved learning infrastructure, deployment and provision of incentives for qualified teachers and a massive enrolment of school children especially girls,\u201d Okoroigwe however stated.",

          "text": "\u2022Urges caution, need to deepen democracy\n\n\u2022Lawmaker alleges 20 illegal insertions to rig 2023 election\n\nChuks Okocha and Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nA recent alleged attempt to tamper with the country\u2019s draft electoral law might have attracted the attention of the diplomatic community, which met last week with the leadership of the National Assembly and followed up with a private letter appealing to the lawmakers to do all within their powers to deepen democracy through the current effort at amending the Electoral Act.\n\nThis development followed an uproar generated by reports that there was an attempt by a section of the National Assembly leadership to smuggle certain clauses into the draft electoral law banning electronic transfer of election results, even though the same section agreed to an electronic voting system.\n\nA meeting between the National Assembly leadership and a group of five foreign envoys, including the European Union, led by the United Kingdom held last week. The foreign missions expressed concerns over the electoral law review and urged the lawmakers to do their best to ensure that the gains of the over two decades of democratic experience were not wasted.\n\nTo further register their concern and the readiness to assist in the democratic process, the diplomatic community, allegedly, followed up with a letter, where some of the concerns expressed at the meeting were put in black and white.\n\nAccording to National Assembly sources privy to the meeting as well as the letter, the countries, included the United Kingdom, France, United States, and the European Union. They noted that they did not intend to interfere with Nigeria\u2019s electoral system, but were genuinely concerned about the possibility of losing the gains of the past.\n\nWhile urging the National Assembly leadership to bequeath to the country a legacy of strong and sound electoral system, they contended that it was not in the interest of the country and their foreign allies to lag behind in the collective effort to entrench a solid culture of democracy.\n\nSpecifically, the EU was said to have noted at the meeting that the support they give to Nigeria over the years was to ensure the entrenchment of a lasting democratic culture. It cited such support to include logistics and trainings.\n\nThe EU explained that the idea was to deepen the country\u2019s democratic process and not shut it down, adding that the amendment process is expected to advance the electoral system.\n\nMeanwhile, there have been different theories on those likely to be behind the attempt to tamper with the electoral law, just as the move has already begun to divide the political class, including the lawmakers. Many federal legislators have denied knowledge of the illegal insertion of anti-people clauses.\n\nBut fingers are being pointed at the leadership of the National Assembly. Many of National Assembly members are believed to be readying to seek election in other capacities in 2023.\n\nSupporters of a popular politician in the South-west are also believed to be divided over the matter, making the issue one of the most sensitive political concerns at the moment.\n\nSources hinted that while some politicians believed that the electronic transfer of results could undercut their chances in the election, there were those who held the view that it was the only way to put their traducers in check since the road to 2023 appears to be rough lready.\n\nAnother party source, who was opposed to the controversial insertions, said the excuses being pushed against electronic transfer of results did not hold water. This, he said, was because if network was the issue, INEC had since assured that where the network failed and voting had been done, the results would automatically download once network came on.\n\nContending that electronic transfer of results would be the best thing to happen to the country\u2019s electoral system, the source maintained that Nigeria would be better off dealing with the failure of the initiative than sticking with the analogue mode of transferring election results, which is generally believed to be prone to manipulation.\n\nLawmaker Alleges 20 Illegal Insertions to Rig 2023 Election\n\nA member of the House of Representatives from Benue State, Hon. Mark Terseer Gbillah, alleged that the Senate made 20 illegal insertions into the 2021 Electoral Bill under consideration in the National Assembly. Gbillah said the insertions were part of a larger scheme to rig the 2023 general election.\n\nThe lawmaker who was chairman of the House committee involved in the harmonisation of the bill, and who was deputy chairman of the House Committee on Petroleum (Upstream), also condemned the three per cent allocation to oil producing communities by the Senate in the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), describing it as \u201cunfortunate and ridiculous\u201d. He rejected the 30 per cent clause in the PIB for \u201cfrontier exploration\u201d, which he said was an invitation to corruption and remained unacceptable.\n\nSpeaking on Arise TV, Gbillah insisted that the Senate inserted 20 clauses that were not originally part of the Electoral Bill in the Senate version after harmonisation by the two chambers.\n\nGbillah stated, \u201cLet me go to the issue of Electoral Act. Chairman of the committee in the house mentioned and told our colleagues that she was not aware of any changes for the initial harmonised act of both chambers.\n\n\u201cObviously, there is an insertion. I can confirm that about 20 clauses have been inserted and it is alleged that it was inserted from the senate version. I want to say that we are at a point in the country, where you should not be playing politics with this issue in this country.\n\n\u201cI wonder why people think that they are going to stay in power in perpetuity. Tomorrow, it will be somebody else; we need to leave a legacy for our country. We need to leave a legacy for our nation. The world is moving forward and we are still deliberating on electronic transmission, when it is something that is a forgone issue in other nations.\n\n\u201cWe in the opposition are insisting that the issue of electronic transmission is sacrosanct and we suspect that those insertions were intentional, premeditated so that this Electoral Act will be contentious and won\u2019t be passed so that in the upcoming elections, the ability to rig and manipulate the result of the election will be possible.\n\n\u201cThis is unfortunate. This is something we are going to resist. We call on Nigerians to rise up, for this is the time, when they should take responsibility for the people they have elected to represent them. The servants cannot dictate to the owners.\n\n\u201cNigerians, you need to rise up and make your voices heard and some of us are there to support your position and to pursue what is best for this country.\u201d\n\nOn the three per cent allocation to the oil producing communities and 30 per cent provision for frontier exploration in the PIB, to which Niger Delta governors and stakeholders have objected, Gbillah said, \u201cThe issue of PIB percentages, these are all issues we believe need to be looked at. We are not immediately affected by the production now but the Benue trough is one of the initial siting of oil. We believe in equity and we believe in justice, the people of the Niger Delta have been saddled with this issue for several decades.\n\n\u201cThe environment has been destroyed. Three per cent is inadequate and the senate even made it much worse, which in my opinion is unfortunate and ridiculous. The 30 per cent for frontier exploration is unacceptable. It is not money that can be accounted for.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Earlier date wasn\u2019t sacrosanct, says Akpanudoedehe\n\n\u2022Tinubu, other presidential hopefuls now in suspense\n\nChuks Okocha and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nThe much-awaited congresses of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), earlier scheduled to commence July 10, may not hold, as the leadership of the party has written to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) demanding the immediate postponement of the exercise\n\nIn the letter dated July 6, 2021, with reference number APC/NHDQ/INEC/19/021/39, and addressed to Chairman of the electoral body, the ruling party did not state any reason for the indefinite postponement of the congresses.\n\nBut National Secretary of APC, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, said the party did not intend a postponement of the congresses but to cure legal landmines since the earlier date was not sacrosanct.\n\nUnfortunately, by the development, the 2023 permutations by one of the national leaders of the party, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, as well as other contenders, may have been put in suspense.\n\nThe letter, which was signed by National Chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Mai Mala Buni, and Akpanudoedehe, stated that the postponement served as a formal notification pursuant to the provisions of Section 85 of the Electoral Act (2010), as amended.\n\nThe letter read, \u201cWe refer to our letter reference number APC/NHDQ/INEC/19/012/20 dated 10th June, 2021 on the above subject and wish to inform the Commission that the party has rescheduled its Congresses and National Convention to a later date, which will be communicated to you.\n\n\u201cThis serves as a formal notification pursuant to the provisions of Section 85 of the Electoral Act (2010) as amended. While hoping to receive your cooperation, please accept the assurances of my highest esteem.\u201d\n\nThe timetable and schedule of activities released by the party\u2019s Director of Organisation, Professor Al-Mustapha Medaner, showed that the congresses would commence with the sale of nomination forms for the ward congress between July 1 and July 7. The party also fixed the inauguration of Ward/Local Government Area Congress Screening/Screening Appeal Committees for July 10, 2021; Ward Congress was billed for July 24, local government congress was slated for August 14, and the state congress was to hold on the September 18, 2021.\n\nTHISDAY investigation revealed that the inability of the national secretariat of the party to distribute the nomination forms for all the congresses to the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) led to the postponement.\n\nWhile the party has started taking delivery of the materials for the congresses in batches, as of the close of work on Friday, no state had taken possession of the nomination forms for any of the congresses.\n\nThe APC national secretary said, \u201cThe above document in circulation did not intend a postponement of the ccongresses. How it leaked from INEC is strange. It is to cure the legal landmine occasioned by Section 85 of the Electoral Act on the issuance of 21 days notice to INEC, bearing in mind that the earlier date we released was not sacrosanct.\u201d\n\nApart from logistics challenges that caused delay in the distribution of the forms, some states were still in crisis over membership registration and as a result, some members were allegedly denied registration. It was against this background that the leadership of the party, last week, approved the continuation of the party\u2019s membership registration revalidation and update exercise in Imo, Kwara, Ogun, and Rivers states.\n\nAkpanudoedehe had in a statement said the approval followed the recommendation of the membership registration appeals committee.\n\nHe said, \u201cWith this approval, the membership registration, revalidation and register update exercise in the four states will continue for two weeks.\n\n\u201cThose who have not been registered in these states can purchase forms for congresses, party office elections and convention. For congresses in Rivers State, all those who have purchased forms in the past will be allowed to participate in the congresses on the presentation of the bank teller as proof of payment.\u201d\n\nThe national secretary warned, \u201cAny attempt to deprive intending registrants would be dealt with accordingly in line with the provisions of the APC constitution and guidelines for the exercise.\u201d\n\nA group, Concerned APC Stakeholders, while reacting, decried the postponement as another scheme by the committee to perpetuate itself in office. The spokesperson of the group, Mr. Abdulahi Dauda, said the excuse they heard was that materials were being printed. But he alleged that the chairman did not carry other members of the caretaker committee along when the timetable for the congresses was issued.\n\nDauda stated, \u201cThe postponement is another scheme to perpetually remain in office, even though they are occupying such offices illegally. The excuse we heard was that the materials were being printed and the chairman did not carry along other members of the caretaker committee in issuing the last statement as regards the congresses through Director of Organisation.\n\n\u201cWe are reliably informed that CTC will meet next Tuesday to issue a statement on the new date. However, Buni and co should tread softly and not lead the party to destruction due to greed and inordinate ambition.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the indefinite postponement has not only altered calculations in the camps of presidential hopefuls, but also the national chairmanship aspirants, like Saliu Mustapha, George Akume, Al Makura, and Abduallahi Adamu.\n\nThe postponement, according to political analysts, may have put the permutations of potential presidential contenders in suspense. Among those who had been drumming for an early convention are the many supporters of the presidential aspiration of Tinubu, who see the election of new principal officers of the party as a first step in their bid for the presidential ticket.\n\nThe development is bound to unsettle the TIinubu camp as it has thrown their projections into confusion.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Gusau agog as PDP supporters welcome deputy governor\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja and Innocent Onuminya in Zamfara\n\nFollowing last week\u2019s defection of Zamfara State Governor Bello Matawalle from the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), the National Working Committee (NWC) of the former has approved a legal team led by a former Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Godwin Kanu-Agabi, to challenge the defection.\n\nBut a massive crowd of PDP supporters yesterday treated Zamfara State Deputy Governor Mahdi Gusau, who remained in the party, to a tumultuous welcome in the state capital, Gusau.\n\nThe legal action, THISDAY gathered, was not limited to Matawalle, as it would also challenge the legality of the defection of members of the national and state assemblies from Zamfara State.\n\nKanu-Agabi would lead a team of lawyers, including Senior Advocates of Nigeria (SAN), when the suit challenging the defections would be filed at the Federal High Court in Abuja this week.\n\nA PDP source said, \u201cA combined reading of Section 221 of the 1999 Constitution and the pronouncements of the Supreme Court in Faleke v. INEC (2016) are clear in holding that it is the political party that stands for election, that votes scored in election belong to the political party, and that the candidate nominated to contest at an election by his party acts only as the agent of his party.\u201d\n\nSection 221 of the 1999 Constitution states, \u201cNo association, other than a political party, shall canvass for votes for any candidate at any election or contribute to the funds of any political party or to the election expenses of any candidate at an election.\u201d\n\nThe legal team would also be relying on Sections 179 and 181 of the 1999 Constitution, as amended, and their implications and status in law, taking into account the Supreme Court judgement of June 2019 that brought in Matawella as the Zamfara State governor.\n\nPDP would seek the interpretation of the entire Section 68 of the constitution as regards members of the National and State assemblies, who also defected from PDP to the APC with Matawalle.\n\nSection 68 states, \u201c(1) A member of the Senate or of the House of Representatives shall vacate his seat in the House of which he is a member if \u2013\n\n\u201c(a) He becomes a member of another legislative house.\n\n\u201c(b) Any other circumstances arise that, if he were not a member of the Senate or the House of Representatives, would cause him to be disqualified for election as a member\u2026\n\n\u201c(e) Save as otherwise prescribed by this Constitution, he becomes a member of a commission or other body established by this Constitution or by any other law\u2026\n\n\u201c(f) Without just cause he is absent from meetings of the House of which he is a member for a period amounting in the aggregate to more than one-third of the total number of days during which the House meets in any one year;\n\n\u201c(g) Being a person whose election to the House was sponsored by a political party, he becomes a member of another political party before the expiration of the period for which that House was elected; Provided that his membership of the latter political party is not as a result of a division in the political party of which he was previously a member or of a merger of two or more political parties or factions by one of which he was previously sponsored.\u201d\n\nWhile some senior lawyers insist that no law prevents an elected governor from leaving for another party, some argue that the governor should relinquish his mandate on account of the platform with which he came into office.\n\nMeanwhile, PDP supporters, who came out in large numbers to welcome Gusau, carried placards with the inscriptions, such as: \u201cAPC is prohibited for us, we remain in PDP,\u201d \u201cWith Mahdi new Zamfara is possible,\u201d \u201cZamfara is PDP, PDP is Zamfara.\u201d\n\nThe PDP supporters blocked the Tsafe-Funtua road.\n\nThose who accompanied the deputy governor included his father, Gen Aliyu Gusau, and PDP caretaker committee members.\n\nAddressing the party faithful at his residence, Gusau enjoined them to remain calm, stressing that the defection of the governor would not affect the chances of the party in future elections. He maintained that as the highest political office holder in the party, he had become the leader of the party in the state.\n\nThe deputy governor explained that he would do everything possible to reposition the party in the state, even as he solicited the cooperation of members of the party.\n\n\u201cAs you all know, the recent political happening in the state, as the leader of the party, I would not relent in my effort in rebuilding the party,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe commiserated with the people of the state especially, the people of Maradun Local Government Area, where gunmen suspected to be bandits killed about 49 people last Thursday. The deputy governor condemned the killing, calling the act barbaric and inhumane.\n\nA PDP caretaker committee member and former publicity secretary of the party, Alhaji Faruku Ahmad Gusau, who spoke to THISDAY said, the large crowd that came out in solidarity with the party showed that PDP was on ground in the state. He stated that no amount of intimidation would make them defect to APC, saying people should watch, as PDP would soon bounce back in the state.\n\nThe former publicity secretary dispelled insinuations that all the state House of Assembly members had moved to APC with the governor.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Many Nigerians were thrown into mourning when the death of Olanrewaju Fasasi, the Nigerian rapper, singer, and songwriter better known as Sound Sultan, was announced.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKayode Fasasi, a member of the deceased\u2019s family, who broke the tragic news on Sunday, said the \u2018Jagbajantis\u2019 crooner died after battling cancer.\n\n\u201cIt is with heavy hearts that we announce the passing of multitalented veteran singer, rapper, songwriter Olanrewaju Fasasi a.k.a Soundsulatan,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\n\u201cHe passed away at the age of 44 following a hard-fought battle with Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma. He is survived by his wife, three children, and his siblings.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere is what you should know about the form of cancer that killed Sound Sultan.\n\nWHAT IS LYMPHOMA?\n\nLymphoma is a type of blood cancer that affects the lymphatic system, which removes excess fluids from your body and produces immune cells. Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell that fights infection, according to the American Society of Hematology.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnce present in the lymph system, lymphoma can quickly spread to different tissues and organs. The lymph system of the body are the spleen, thymus gland, bone marrow, and lymphatic vessels, which are the parts that store and transmit the white blood cells.\n\nAccording to the National Genome Research Institute, lymphoma can be broadly classified into two \u2014 Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma.\n\nThe cause of lymphoma is yet to be ascertained by scientists. However, those with weak immune systems or immune diseases are susceptible to this cancer.\n\nWHAT IS ANGIOIMMUNOBLASTIC T-CELL LYMPHOMA (AITL)?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the National Organisation for Rare Disorder (NORD), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) is a rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which is a group of related malignancies (cancers) that affect the lymphatic system.\n\nAITL is a form of cancer that affects the T-cells, which are the forms of white blood cells that destroy body cells that have become cancerous.\n\nWhen someone is affected by AITL, the T-cells of the white blood cells turn into malignant cells. Malignant cells are cancerous or abnormal cells that can negatively affect other parts of the body when they spread.\n\nWhen the malignant T-cells grow abnormally or multiply uncontrollably, it may cause the enlargement of some parts of the lymph system.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike lymphoma, the cause of AITL is also not known.\n\nSYMPTOMS OF AITL\n\nThe symptoms may vary from individuals:\n\nAbnormal weight loss Swollen glands, especially in the armpit, neck, or groin Sweating at night (night sweats) Poor health condition Skin rash Abnormal enlargement of liver and spleen Bleeding into the skin (thrombocytopenia) Weak immune system Shortness of breath\n\nDIAGNOSIS\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe diagnosis of AITL takes different processes. It involves observing the symptoms, computed tomography (CT) scans, clinical evaluation, bone marrow, and lymph nodes biopsy. In carrying out a biopsy, a certain part of the affected tissue is cut out to examine the extent of the disease.\n\nThe lymph nodes in some parts of the body like the arm, elbow, and groin regions will be examined to find out if they are swollen. Some internal parts of the body like the spleen and liver will also be examined to see if they are swollen.\n\nAfter a patient is diagnosed with AITL, there are further diagnostic tests that would be required to determine the stage.\n\nTREATMENT\n\nThe treatment of AITL is determined by the stage of the disease and it also involves the coming together of several medical practitioners such as medical oncologists, haematologists, radiation oncologists, oncology nurses, and dietitians.\n\nNORD listed corticosteroids, watch and wait, single-agent chemotherapy, and multiagent chemotherapy as the therapies used to treat individuals battling AITL.\n\nThe Lymphoma Research Foundation also suggested that a patient battling AITL may be treated with a steroid that can temporarily relieve the symptoms caused by the immune system\u2019s reaction to the cancer cells.\n\nCertain drugs can also be used \u2014 especially those that can prevent or destroy tumour cells \u2014 with the strict prescription of a physician.",

          "text": "Many Nigerians were thrown into mourning when the death of Olanrewaju Fasasi, the Nigerian rapper, singer, and songwriter better known as Sound Sultan, was announced.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKayode Fasasi, a member of the deceased\u2019s family, who broke the tragic news on Sunday, said the \u2018Jagbajantis\u2019 crooner died after battling cancer.\n\n\u201cIt is with heavy hearts that we announce the passing of multitalented veteran singer, rapper, songwriter Olanrewaju Fasasi a.k.a Soundsulatan,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\n\u201cHe passed away at the age of 44 following a hard-fought battle with Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma. He is survived by his wife, three children, and his siblings.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere is what you should know about the form of cancer that killed Sound Sultan.\n\nWHAT IS LYMPHOMA?\n\nLymphoma is a type of blood cancer that affects the lymphatic system, which removes excess fluids from your body and produces immune cells. Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell that fights infection, according to the American Society of Hematology.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnce present in the lymph system, lymphoma can quickly spread to different tissues and organs. The lymph system of the body are the spleen, thymus gland, bone marrow, and lymphatic vessels, which are the parts that store and transmit the white blood cells.\n\nAccording to the National Genome Research Institute, lymphoma can be broadly classified into two \u2014 Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma.\n\nThe cause of lymphoma is yet to be ascertained by scientists. However, those with weak immune systems or immune diseases are susceptible to this cancer.\n\nWHAT IS ANGIOIMMUNOBLASTIC T-CELL LYMPHOMA (AITL)?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the National Organisation for Rare Disorder (NORD), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) is a rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which is a group of related malignancies (cancers) that affect the lymphatic system.\n\nAITL is a form of cancer that affects the T-cells, which are the forms of white blood cells that destroy body cells that have become cancerous.\n\nWhen someone is affected by AITL, the T-cells of the white blood cells turn into malignant cells. Malignant cells are cancerous or abnormal cells that can negatively affect other parts of the body when they spread.\n\nWhen the malignant T-cells grow abnormally or multiply uncontrollably, it may cause the enlargement of some parts of the lymph system.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike lymphoma, the cause of AITL is also not known.\n\nSYMPTOMS OF AITL\n\nThe symptoms may vary from individuals:\n\nAbnormal weight loss Swollen glands, especially in the armpit, neck, or groin Sweating at night (night sweats) Poor health condition Skin rash Abnormal enlargement of liver and spleen Bleeding into the skin (thrombocytopenia) Weak immune system Shortness of breath\n\nDIAGNOSIS\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe diagnosis of AITL takes different processes. It involves observing the symptoms, computed tomography (CT) scans, clinical evaluation, bone marrow, and lymph nodes biopsy. In carrying out a biopsy, a certain part of the affected tissue is cut out to examine the extent of the disease.\n\nThe lymph nodes in some parts of the body like the arm, elbow, and groin regions will be examined to find out if they are swollen. Some internal parts of the body like the spleen and liver will also be examined to see if they are swollen.\n\nAfter a patient is diagnosed with AITL, there are further diagnostic tests that would be required to determine the stage.\n\nTREATMENT\n\nThe treatment of AITL is determined by the stage of the disease and it also involves the coming together of several medical practitioners such as medical oncologists, haematologists, radiation oncologists, oncology nurses, and dietitians.\n\nNORD listed corticosteroids, watch and wait, single-agent chemotherapy, and multiagent chemotherapy as the therapies used to treat individuals battling AITL.\n\nThe Lymphoma Research Foundation also suggested that a patient battling AITL may be treated with a steroid that can temporarily relieve the symptoms caused by the immune system\u2019s reaction to the cancer cells.\n\nCertain drugs can also be used \u2014 especially those that can prevent or destroy tumour cells \u2014 with the strict prescription of a physician.",

          "title": "Overworked staff, mass exits: The inside story of GTBank\u2019s mobile app and USSD transaction failures",
          "text": "On April 29, Mayowa, 32, was distraught when he couldn\u2019t pay for a 19km Uber ride he had taken to visit a friend in Park View Estate, a well known residential community in the highbrow area of Ikoyi, Lagos. His orange branded Guaranty Trust Bank (GTB) app had not launched as he tried severally to make a transfer from his current account to the empty savings account linked to the debit card on his Uber app.\n\nThinking his MTN data service was the problem, he tried punching his bank\u2019s *737# short code to make the transfer but he got an unresponsive code message.\n\nHe tried again, and again and again without success. Frustrated, he made a last attempt accessing his account through GTB\u2019s mobile website, but it took forever to load. To make matters worse, Mayowa\u2019s buddy was away from home, at a dragging management meeting and wouldn\u2019t pick up his frantic calls.\n\n\u201cTen minutes had passed by now. The Uber driver was looking at me funny. It was embarrassing. I had to plead with him to have some patience,\u201d a laughing Mayowa shared.\n\nOut of Service\n\nMayowa is one of many GTB customers who suffered embarrassment, inconvenience or loss of opportunity, as downtimes on the bank\u2019s USSD or mobile banking services became frequent in the first half of 2021, sometimes stretching days on end.\n\n@gtbank why is your bank frustrating customers? I have not been able to access my GT Mobile App for days now. And when money is sent to my account I don't receive alert be it SMS or Email alert.\n\nI recharged 1k few days ago I was debited, but my phone wasn't credited. \u2014 Precious Oye (@BarrypOye) April 30, 2021\n\nWhat is going on @gtbank_help. I am fed up with you guys @gtbank. Everything is stressful.\n\nWhy have I been experiencing this all evening \ud83d\ude29? Now it's CT11, no more E150.\n\nI am starting to tire of your channels pic.twitter.com/cmLjiiaiEL \u2014 Dr. Ameena (@amkmusty) March 22, 2021\n\nAn employee explained that the E105 and CT11 error codes pop up when a partner firm Clickatell\u2019s server is down or GTB\u2019s API is unreachable to initiate the transaction\n\nBuying airtime on @gtbank app is just pure scam, they would deduct the money n not deliver the airtime and I\u2019m just tired of complaining. \u2014 Abbie \ud83d\udc3e (@Abigailsluvv) June 16, 2021\n\nHow can GTB be silent at a time like this? I know they can see the complaints. Do traditional Nigerian banks no longer care about proving quality customer support & help? Tomorrow, they will still charge us a silly \u2018convenience\u2019 fee \ud83e\udd22 \u2014 Koromone Koroye (@Koromone_K) April 29, 2021\n\nA comparative analysis conducted by TC Insights, of customer complaints on Twitter about the mobile app and USSD services between the first half of 2020 and 2021, showed a 54% spike.\n\nA customer representative with the company explained under anonymity that most of the complaints this year have been about the USSD platform, mobile application, unexplainable SMS charges and lately, One Time Password (OTP) issues.\n\n\u201cThese are the recurring problems and complaints. Just ask any GTB customer. They will share some bitter experiences,\u201d she said.\n\nSeven years ago, Guaranty Trust Bank, Nigeria\u2019s third-largest lender, increased the popularity of mobile banking with its *737# USSD service in Nigeria, introducing a new level of ease to customers.\n\nToday, other banks have adopted it and an estimated 40 million Nigerians use USSD services for mobile banking. According to the GTB\u2019s financial report, its revenue from USSD fees was \u20a62.13 billion ($5.3m) in 2019, a significant 34% increase from the \u20a61.58 billion ($3.9m) made in 2018.\n\nGTB didn\u2019t reveal its USSD revenue for 2020 but it disclosed that the total amount it processed via USSD was \u20a63.89 trillion, a 9.4% increase from the \u20a63.55 trillion processed in 2019. Its mobile app also has over a million downloads on the Google play store alone.\n\nStaff churn and delayed promotions\n\nTechCabal has learnt, from interviews with 19 former and current employees of the bank\u2019s IT division, that the division has suffered a spike in attrition within the last six months. It has resulted in technical gaps and work overload for current employees.\n\nAccording to these sources, the absence of promotions in 2020 for already overworked employees who felt they were deserving triggered the first wave of exits into the labour market which had attractive offers for their talent. The shortage in talent began compounding into increased workload and mounting pressure for remaining IT employees.\n\nAt least ten team members resigned this year from the application development team, a unit which often consists of 20 members, according to a former software developer with the bank .\n\n\u201cI was handling one application then it doubled as a result,\u201d Stanley* said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a particular team where three members left in the space of one month. Now, four people\u2019s responsibilities are being juggled by one person,\u201d another employee, at the time of the interview in May, shared.\n\n\u201cThe pressure is crazy. One person is doing three people\u2019s jobs all in the name of efficiency. That\u2019s why our cost to income ratio will always be the lowest in the industry,\u201d Michael*, an ex-employee exclaimed.\n\nGTB\u2019s operating expense increased by \u20a616.5bn from its 2019 figure (\u20a6131bn) due to additional investment in technology to enable staff to work from home and costs associated with implementing safety procedures as well as COVID 19 protocols.\n\nThe frequent loss of experienced talents without a commensurate hiring rate resulted in gaps in technical capabilities, a source explained.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe application I am managing was handled by two people, but my partner has gone to join another team. If I\u2019m leaving now, a new person can\u2019t cram and get a good grip of everything in my handover note within 3 weeks. We simply need more people on the team!\u201d\n\nThis gap is often reflected when there is a service downtime towards the end of the month caused by server overload. During this period, transaction volume increases due to salary payments and other month-end payments, leading to more pressure on existing resources.\n\nAccording to sources, towards the end of the month, experienced hands would usually be proactive in tracking certain metrics and moving different applications across servers to ensure there\u2019s space for the surge. But in the absence of such hands, performance management and quality control suffer.\n\nTechCabal contacted Guaranty Trust Bank for comments but had not got a response at the time of publishing this article.\n\nIt\u2019s not enough\n\nThe bank appears to have taken some steps to solve at least part of the problem that have caused recurring transaction problems this year.\n\nOn June 2nd, 2021 about 900 staff of GTB received a long overdue announcement: they had been promoted. It offered some consolation to many who had been expecting for a while.\n\nHowever, a software developer who was promoted made it clear that this promotion won\u2019t serve as a solution.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still understaffed. The App development team is almost half of what it was at the beginning of the year. They haven\u2019t replaced people. Some people even got promoted but left because they don\u2019t want the stress again,\u201d he said.\n\nAdamu*, a mid-level associate disclosed that complaints have been made to line managers who encouraged the units and explained that recruitments are ongoing for entry-level and experienced hands who will begin resuming from July.\n\n\u201cSo\u2026 let\u2019s wait and see\u201d, he said.\n\n*Name changed to protect the source\u2019s identity.\n\n$1 = \u20a6 400\n\nWritten by Staff Writer Daniel Adeyemi and Editor-in-Chief Adegoke Oyeniyi\n\nDid you enjoy reading this article?

          "title": "Peter Njonjo wants to change the way food moves in Africa",
          "text": "My Life In Tech is putting human faces to some of the innovative startups, investments, and policy formations driving the technology sector across Africa.\n\nPeter Njonjo started his first business in high school. He noticed a problem; the school canteen was too far from the dormitories.\n\nEvery day, he and his classmates made the tiresome journey from their beds to the canteen to buy bread. Peter\u2019s solution was simple \u2013 buy all of the bread in the canteen, bring it to the dormitories, sell to customers from the comfort of their beds and charge a small fee for this convenience.\n\n\u201cI built a very successful franchise because there were many dormitories so I couldn\u2019t do it alone,\u201d he said to me during our call.\n\nToday, he is solving a similar problem on a much larger scale. He is the CEO and co-founder of Twiga Foods, a company that is taking fresh and processed foods from over 4,000 farmers and manufacturers who are often far away and delivering to more than 35,000 vendors across Kenya \u2013 while charging a small fee for this convenience.\n\nFrom having an incomplete MBA to heading Coca-Cola\u2019s operations across 33 African countries, his story is one of a man who is passionate about making the lives of people just a little easier.\n\nHis name is Peter Njonjo and this is his life in tech.\n\nPeter Njonjo and the case of the incomplete MBA\n\nIf you scroll down to the Education section of Peter Njonjo\u2019s LinkedIn page today you would find an entry for an MBA in Strategic Management from the year 2000 and right below it are the words \u201cMasters Incomplete\u201d.\n\nDuring our call, Peter tells me that he completed the coursework required to get the MBA. The incompleteness would boil down to his final MBA paper and the professor who was in charge of it. Put simply, they were not very cooperative.\n\n\u201cThey were very fussy, they were always changing their minds. And I was very busy.\u201d\n\nYou may ask what could have made a 21-year old Peter too busy to focus all his time on placating his professor \u2013 his job at Coca-Cola.\n\nAround the time when he applied for his master\u2019s program, Peter was also starting a job as an accountant in Coca-Cola with his newly minted degree in finance \u2013 which he had gotten in nine months.\n\n\u201cSo many people have stories of growing up in university and all the partying. For me, it just passed so quickly and I was always in the library.\u201d\n\nDuring the typical two-year window between high school and university, Peter decided to become a Certified Public Accountant (CPA). In that time he made considerable progress. He chose to attend the United States International University Africa (USIUA), a private university in Nairobi.\n\n\u201cBecause of all the work I\u2019d done during my CPA, my undergraduate lasted nine months.\u201d\n\nHis fizzy rise to the top at Coca-Cola\n\nIn 1998, Peter Njonjo was one of the youngest CPAs in the entire country. He joined Coca-Cola as an accountant in that same year and his first task on the job was to reconcile some accounts that just wouldn\u2019t balance.\n\n\u201cI spent very very long hours trying to figure that out.\u201d\n\nBut that was only the start of his 18-year career at the company.\n\n\u201cIf you look at a lot of people who worked in Coca-Cola, the tenures are very long. It\u2019s a company where if your DNA matches that of the company, there are a lot of opportunities for growth.\u201d\n\nAnd Peter was taking as many of these opportunities as he could. For him, it was a case of being an entrepreneur within an existing organisation and owning processes. He was, as he puts it, \u201cusing other people\u2019s money to create value\u201d. This approach endeared him to a lot of people early on and helped to advance him through the ranks so that by the time he turned 31, after 10 years in the company, he became country manager for Kenya.\n\nThree years later, he would be in charge of Coca-Cola\u2019s operations in six countries across East Africa: Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Mozambique. In this time, he would put together deals worth more than a billion dollars in CapEx (Capital Expenditure).\n\nBut he wasn\u2019t slowing down. During his time as general manager of Coca-Cola East Africa, he started his own company with his co-founder and friend Grant Brooke.\n\nTwiga Foods was not the first business they would try to run together. Their first had been a business that involved felling timber and replenishing the plantation where they got the timber from. The business did not work out.\n\nSometime later, Grant came to Peter with an idea. He wanted them to sell bananas.\n\n\u201cIn my mind, I was like \u2018Oh God, this doesn\u2019t sound like one of those things I want to be involved in for the long term. But let me just listen.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd listen he did.\n\nGoing bananas and starting Twiga\n\nA fun fact that would help Peter Njonjo take the leap into the world of bananas is that bananas are one of the biggest traded commodities in the world.\n\nSo the plan was to export bananas. But that was far from a walk in the park.\n\n\u201cWe realised that the supply chains were so broken and there were so many challenges out there. It was not going to be as straightforward as we thought.\u201d\n\nWhen they were unable to sell even one container outside of Kenya, Peter felt it was time for them to sell the bananas locally. But even there, they met broken supply chains that made it hard for them to create any value as many parts of the retail industry was fragmented and informal.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re trying to formalise something that\u2019s informal, you\u2019ll encounter all sorts of challenges.\u201d\n\nOne of those challenges was the absence of a standard for packaging produce. This made it hard for a business like theirs to calculate their gross profit margin per unit because, effectively, the concept of a unit in the market was foreign.\n\n\u201cSo we had to introduce bananas with crates and teach people that you can actually by bananas in crates and buy them ripened instead of buying them and ripening yourself and losing half of it.\u201d\n\nIn the middle of tweaking Twiga\u2019s business model and figuring out the best way to create value, Grant ran the business while Peter sat on the board and helped direct the business. He also continued to rise through the ranks at Coca-Cola, eventually becoming President of Coca-Cola West and Central Africa overseeing 33 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. He would leave this role in 2019 to become CEO of Twiga Foods.\n\n\u201cI had discussed with Grant that if the business ever became too big, then I would be happy to step in. Because, for me, it was a major investment.\u201d\n\nIt was such a big investment for him that while they made attempts to raise more capital for the business, he and his wife decided to sell the home they had built to finance the business in the meantime.\n\n\u201cIt was actually my wife\u2019s idea. We had a term sheet from the lead investor but the due diligence was taking time and I was afraid the company would run out of money before the round closed.\u201d\n\nBut according to Peter, they were fairly confident about where the business was going and so it made sense for them. They would eventually close a $1.75 million seed round.\n\n\u201cAnd I think one of the things you can learn is don\u2019t get too attached to material assets. Instead, focus on legacy and the things you need to build.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlexa, play Legacy by Jay-Z\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m turning 45 this year. I was born and bred in Nairobi, Kenya. I\u2019m the firstborn of four children.\u201d\n\nThat is how Peter Njonjo starts his story on our call. He and his siblings were born to their mother, a retired accountant who is now involved in the family business, and their father, an engineer who is still active in the real estate market.\n\nPeter and his wife Tina have four children. When I ask him about what personal plans he has for him and his family he said, \u201cEnsuring that I\u2019m there for my kids as they grow up and enjoying my marriage with my wife and figuring out things we can pursue that are tied to our passions; be it philanthropy or angel investing.\u201d\n\nFor Twiga, big plans abound as well. In September the company plans to commission the largest standalone banana ripening facility in Africa.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve spent a good amount of time fine-tuning our business here in Kenya so that should help us scale fast. In the next five years, we want to be in 12 countries on the continent, serving about 100,000 customers a day.\u201d\n\nWith the success it has already recorded in Kenya, Twiga Foods is well on its way to achieving these goals.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) on Thursday said it has directed commercial banks to freeze the accounts of MultiChoice Nigeria Limited (MCN) And MultiChoice Africa (MCA), in an attempt to recover \u20a61.8 trillion in taxes from the companies.\n\nMultiChoice Group is a South African entertainment giant and owner of the popular DStv and GOtv services. Its operations in more than 20 other African countries contribute up to a third of the company\u2019s revenues, with Nigeria being the largest market.\n\nA statement issued by the Director of Communications and Liaison Department of FIRS, Abdullahi Ahmad, accused the company of persistently breaching all agreements and undertakings with the tax agency. MultiChoice also allegedly denied access to their records for auditing, according to a Reuters report.\n\n\u201cThe companies would not promptly respond to correspondences, they lacked data integrity and are not transparent as they continually deny FIRS access to their records,\u201d the executive chair of FIRS, Muhammad Nami, was quoted as saying.\n\n\u201cThe companies are involved in the under-remittance of taxes which necessitated a critical review of the tax-compliance level of the company. Particularly, [MultiChoice Nigeria Limited] has avoided giving the FIRS accurate information on the number of its subscribers and income,\u201d he said.\n\nNami revealed that the revenue service has now instructed banks to sweep the balances in MultiChoice Africa and MultiChioce Nigeria\u2019s accounts before carrying out any other transaction on behalf of the companies. \u201cIt is further requested that the FIRS be informed of any transactions before execution on the account, especially transfers of funds to any of their subsidiaries.\u201d\n\nThe MultiChoice Group reports revenues in primarily two segments \u2013 South Africa and the rest of Africa. According to the FIRS chair, Nigeria contributed 34% of total revenue for the group and the bulk of revenue for MultiChoice Africa.\n\nMeanwhile, MultiChoice\u2019s latest results for the year ended March 31 show that South Africa accounted for 64% of total revenue, while its operations in the rest of Africa contributed 32% of revenue. The rest was generated from its international technology segment.\n\nThe Group, in a statement responding to the accusations, said it had not been formally notified about the matter and the case appeared to be based on \u201cunfounded allegations\u201d that MultiChoice Nigeria had not fully disclosed all its existing subscribers to the authorities.\n\n\u201cWe have engaged openly with FIRS and the engagements are ongoing in a transparent and constructive manner,\u201d it said, adding that it believed the issue could be amicably resolved.\n\nMultiChoice is the latest South African firm involved in a huge tax scandal in Nigeria. In 2018, the Nigerian unit of MTN Group was ordered to pay $2 billion in taxes relating to the importation of equipment and payments to foreign suppliers from 2007 to 2017. Though the tax demand was eventually dropped.\n\nBeing one of DStv\u2019s biggest markets, the tax dispute in Nigeria could significantly disrupt the operations of MultiChoice if it is not resolved quickly.\n\nDid you enjoy reading this article?

          "text": "Daystar Power, a provider of hybrid solar power solutions to businesses in West Africa, has secured a facility of $20 million from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to fund its project pipeline in Nigeria.\n\nFounded in 2017 by Sunrah Ventures, Daystar Power is an off-grid power service provider whose solutions, \u201cSolar-as-a-Service\u201d and \u201cPower-as-a-Service\u201d provide clean and reliable power while significantly reducing overall power costs for clients.\n\nThe $20 million facility takes Daystar\u2019s total raised funding to $62 million this year. It comes on the back of a $38 million Series-B fundraise in January to expand across West Africa and a $4 million financing for its Ghanaian subsidiary.\n\nThe company, which started out in Nigeria, is now currently active in Ghana, Senegal, and Togo as well, with a representative office in Ivory Coast.\n\nThe IFC investment is split into two equal tranches. Daystar Power will receive a $10 million local currency loan from IFC, which will be provided to its Nigerian subsidiary, Daybreak Power Solutions.\n\nWith the fundraising, the company will invest in hybrid renewable energy systems in Nigeria, where it currently manages and operates 150 power installations.\n\nAnother $10 million subordinated loan will be provided by the Canada-IFC Renewable Energy Program for Africa. Daystar Power is working with the Canadian-funded IFC program, Energy2Equal, to close gender gaps and increase women\u2019s participation in the renewable energy sector.\n\nDaystar Power has 29 megawatts (MW) of installed solar power capacity to date. It plans to expand that capacity to 140MW by 2024, as well as grow its client base in the financial services, manufacturing and agricultural sectors. The IFC investment is important to this ambition.\n\n\u201cThe funds will allow us to grow our installed capacity of solar projects and serve more Nigerian businesses in need of clean and affordable power,\u201d said Jasper Graf von Hardenberg, CEO and Co-founder of Daystar Power.\n\nHardenberg adds that Daystar Power gains \u201cmore than just capital\u201d from the IFC investment. This, according to him, is because the corporation brings a wealth of in-depth knowledge of renewable energy projects and project finance in emerging markets.\n\nThe IFC has financed more than 50 gigawatts of power generation to date, according to information on its website. In terms of renewable energy, the corporation has funded low-cost renewable energy projects with a generation capacity of more than 8 gigawatts in hydropower, 4 gigawatts in wind energy, and 5 gigawatts in solar energy.\n\nMore fundraising news is expected from Daystar Power as it looks to power businesses in West Africa, a region where the rate of access to electricity is 52% on average and power cuts of up to 80 hours are recorded per month, per a World Bank report.\n\nThe company had earlier revealed plans to raise $100 million in the next three years to finance its expansion across the region. The funds, which is a debt, will be raised through five rounds of $20 million each.\n\nDid you enjoy reading this article? Please fill out this survey.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

Existing investors like Khosla Impact, ValueStream Ventures, Beta.Ventures, 500 Startups, and Story Ventures participated. New VCs like LocalGlobe, Intercept Ventures, and Future Africa also took part in the round.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn total, Smile Identity has raised $11 million from investors with this latest funding round. In 2019, it raised $4 million in seed funding.\n\nWhat does Smile Identity do? Founded by Mark Straub and Willliam Bares in 2017, Smile Identity provides identity verification and KYC compliance tools to help African banks, telecom companies, financial service providers, and ride-sharing businesses better engage their customers.\n\nExpansion so far? Following the co-founders\u2019 arrival in Africa, the business has made key strides in its activities, such as the establishment of a local presence in six African countries: Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, Ghana, Rwanda, and Uganda.\n\nInterestingly, the company claims to connect to over 15 different identity authorities, while its ID validation covers over 250 million identities on the continent.\n\nThe new investment will allow the company to offer even better services and grow in new markets. It will also support more ID types and hire more engineers and staff on the continent.\n\nFor context, read here.\n\nSafaricom increases the cost of airtime\n\nKenyan President, Uhuru Kenyatta, has accepted the Kenyan Parliamentary Committee\u2019s additional taxes proposal.\n\nLast week, I wrote about the Kenyan Parliamentary Committee\u2019s recent call for new taxes on airtime and data service prices. Finally, the bill has been passed into law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause of recent changes to the taxation of telephone and Internet data services, Safaricom, one of Kenya\u2019s top telecom companies, has adjusted the pricing of its products and services.\n\nWhat does this mean for Safaricom\u2019s subscribers? Calls made between 8 a.m. and 10 p.m. will now cost Sh4.87 per minute, while calls made between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. will only cost Sh2.50 per minute.\n\nThe cost of Safaricom home fibre for the lowest package will rise to Sh2,999 from Sh2,900, while the silver package increases to Sh4,100 from Sh3,999.\n\nThe gold and diamond packages \u2014 up from Sh5,699 and Sh11,499 \u2014 will now cost Sh6,299 and Sh12,499, respectively.\n\nAdditional fees were also introduced for roaming and international calls. The cost to send a single short message is now Sh1.20.\n\nMeanwhile, the cost of browsing via airtime (without bundles) will increase at a similar rate to voice calls.\n\nSimilar? Mobile network operators, including Airtel Kenya and Telkom Kenya, have also adjusted their calling charges. The two telecom companies have raised the rate of calls to Sh2.78 per minute. Also, the price of Telkom Kenya\u2019s SMS message has increased to Sh1.15.\n\nMarketForce raises $2 million pre-Series A round\n\nFeatured Image Credit: TechCrunch\n\nAnother funding? Yes. Kenyan B2B retail platform, MarketForce, has raised $2 million pre-Series A to focus on its business-to-business (B2B) retail marketplace, RajeRaje.\n\nWho participated in the round? P1 Ventures, Y Combinator, Launch Africa, V8 Capital, Future Africa, GreenHouse Capital, Rebel Fund, Remapped Ventures, and other unnamed investors.\n\nBefore now, the retail distribution platform raised $350,000 in seed round and a $150,000 cheque from Y Combinator as part of the accelerator\u2019s Summer 2020 batch. This round brings the funds raised by the company to $2.5 million.\n\nThe retail distribution platform got into Y Combinator accelerator\u2019s Summer batch 2020, and upon graduation, they decided to attempt the RejaReja model.\n\nRajeRaje is a B2B e-commerce marketplace for merchants and was launched in 2020 to assist informal retail merchants purchase and sell FMCGs and digital financial services.\n\nWith RejaReja, it\u2019s interesting to see MarketForce joining other supply chain revamp startups like TradeDepot and Sokowatch to fix Africa\u2019s unorganised retail supply chains.\n\nRejaReja has more than 15,000 retail customers in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania who use the platform to process thousands of orders daily.\n\nExpansion plans? It\u2019s planning on expanding to Nigeria with the new funds and expanding its product across East Africa.\n\nIncredibly, the founders \u2014 Tesh Mbaabu, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), and Mesongo Sibuti, Chief Technology Officer (CTO) \u2014 are computer science graduates with little experience in retail distribution, eCommerce, and fintech.\n\nFor context, read here.\n\nNigeria to block MultiChoice Nigeria and MultiChoice Africa\u2019s accounts\n\nDStv dish.

Yesterday, Thursday, July 8, 2021, Nigeria\u2019s Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) announced that it had directed commercial banks to freeze the accounts of MultiChoice Nigeria Limited (MCN) and MultiChoice Africa (MCA) in an attempt to recover \u20a61.8 trillion in taxes from the companies.\n\nWhy did it happen? Abdullahi Ahmad, the Director of Communications and Liaison Department, said the company has continuously violated all contracts and agreements with the tax agency.\n\nBesides, MultiChoice allegedly denied the FIRS access to their records for auditing, according to a Reuters report.\n\nMuhammed Nami, Executive Chairman, FIRS, said that the companies have failed to provide relevant and timely responses to correspondences, and their records are not accurate and accessible.\n\nSo, the banks that handle business for MultiChoice Africa and MultiChoice Nigeria were instructed to perform a balanced search on their accounts before undertaking any other transaction on their behalf.\n\nNonetheless, MultiChoice believes that the case is based on \u201cunfounded allegations\u201d because they were not formally notified on the matter. Also, they said they had not given authorities full access to their subscribers\u2019 information.\n\nMultichoice told Reuters that they had previously engaged in an open, transparent, and constructive dialogue with FIRS, and they hoped that issue could be resolved amicably.\n\nSimilar? In 2018, MTN Nigeria Group was ordered to pay $2 billion in taxes on imports and other payments from 2007 to 2017.

They did not promptly respond to correspondences and lacked data integrity and transparency. It also added that the group\u2019s performance did not reflect in their tax obligations and compliance level in the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReferring to the group\u2019s Nigerian subsidiary, the tax authority said MCN \u201chas avoided giving FIRS accurate information on the number of its subscribers and income.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mohammed Nami, Executive Chairman FIRS, Nigeria contributed 34% of total revenue for the group and the bulk of revenue for MultiChoice Africa.\n\nHowever, per TechCabal, MultiChoice\u2019s results for the year ended March 31 show that South Africa accounted for 64% of total revenue, while its operations in the rest of Africa contributed 32% of revenue. The rest was generated from its international technology segment.\n\nAccording to Reuters, MultiChoice Group makes a third of its business elsewhere on the continent outside South Africa. From the company\u2019s annual report, Nigeria is its biggest market in that segment.\n\nInterestingly, at the close of business yesterday, MultiChoice stocks on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange were down 7.38% from the previous day. The fall reached levels that have not been seen since October 2020.\n\nNigeria\u2019s tax to GDP ratio has steadily declined between 2001 to 2020, reaching a record low of 6.3% in July 2020\n\nWith such an abysmal tax to GDP ratio \u2014 one of the lowest in the world \u2014 the country has tried to increase its tax base. In 2017, it introduced the Voluntary Assets and Income Declaration Scheme (VAIDS), from which the government claimed to have raised \u20a670 billion\n\nIn 2019, it also increased its Value Added Tax from 5% to 7.5%, generating \u20a61.53 trillion in 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMultiChoice becomes the second South African company to face a crackdown from Nigerian authorities. MTN has been the subject of several penalties, the most recent which occurred in 2018 involved a $2 billion tax bill for payments to foreign suppliers. The bill was later withdrawn.\n\nIn an official reply, MCN said it had not received any notification from FIRS yet. It has however indicated that it is willing to engage the tax authority transparently and constructively. It also said its operations in Nigeria are continuing.\n\nThe company says it has been and is currently discussing with FIRS regarding their concerns and believes they can resolve the matter amicably.\n\nIt remains to be seen if these words will ring true in the coming days.",

          "text": "Amid fears of the spread of the deadlier Delta variant of COVID-19 confirmed by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to have crept into the country, the Lagos State government has alerted to the likelihood of the third wave of the disease, warning residents against letting down their guard at this time.\n\nThe state governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, in a statement issued on Sunday and personally signed by him, said the state was already experiencing a gradual resurgence of the disease and increased occupancy rate in isolation centres in Lagos, a disturbing development that calls for concern.\n\nRead Also: Nigeria confirms first case of delta strain of COVID-19\n\n\u201cFrom the beginning of July, we started to experience a steep increase in the number of daily confirmed cases, with the test positivity rate going from 1.1 percent at the end of June 2021 to its current rate of 6.6 percent as of July 8, 2021. The rapid increase within a week gives great cause for concern.\n\nAlso, within the last two weeks, the occupancy rate at our isolation centres increased from an average of 1 percent to 6 percent. This is the new and disturbing reality that now confronts us,\u201d Sanwo-Olu said, warning religious centres and private organisations to immediately step up preventive measures.\n\nHe said so far, the state government has successfully isolated 2,386 passengers who arrived in Lagos from outside the country, and of this number, 15 percent, unfortunately, absconded.\n\nHe warned of sanctions such behaviour as approved by the Federal Government, saying \u201cfor foreigners, revocation of their permanent residency, and deportation; and for Nigerians, prosecution to the full extent of the Lagos State COVID-19 Law.\u201d\n\nElucidating further in the statement, Sanwo-Olu said it was regrettable that in spite of the hard work and dedicated efforts towards sustaining the return to normalcy in Lagos over the last three months, \u201cwe are now finding ourselves at what appears to be the start of a potential 3rd wave of the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d in the state.\n\n\u201cAs you all know, Lagos has been the epicentre of the pandemic since the start, and the way we manage it here has a significant impact and reverberating effect on the national outlook and outcomes. So, Nigeria is counting on us in Lagos State to be resolute in our stand against the virus.\n\nWe will continue to test aggressively. We will also focus on sequencing the samples we are collecting to ensure we are detecting and keeping track of the different variants in circulation. It is only by testing and sequencing comprehensively that we can collect the data required for informed decision-making.\u201d\n\nThe governor stressed that greater vigilance was required at this time in our churches and mosques and other places of religious worship, adding that \u201ceven as we are pleased that religious houses are now open for worship, after the lengthy closures of 2020, we must not allow ourselves to be carried away by the illusion that all is now back to normal.\u201d\n\nThis is especially critical, as Sallah approaches, in a little over a week from now. The festivities will no doubt bring people together in large numbers and create conditions that can sadly cause the spread of the Coronavirus. We must not allow this to happen.\u201d\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the governor called for full compliance with all protective protocols such as compulsory use of masks in all public places, social distancing, temperature checks, provisions for hand-washing and sanitisers, and a maximum of 50 percent occupancy in enclosed spaces.",

          "text": "Lagos to demolish 70 defective buildings, enforce building insurance\n\nThe Lagos State Building Control Agency (LASBCA), is set to demolish 70 defective buildings in the coming week in a bid to rid the state of dilapidated and distressed structures and end the era of building collapses.\n\nThis follows the demolition of a partially collapsed building at No. 19, Church Str, Lagos Island which was confirmed not to be fit for human habitation and to prevent another collapse.\n\nThe disclosure is contained in a statement issued on Friday by LASBCA spokesman, Mr Gbadeyan Abdulraheem, saying that the General Manager of the agency Mr Gbolahan Oki, supervised the demolition exercise, according to NAN.\n\nOki said that several other defective buildings had been marked for removal to rid the state of defective buildings, in a bid to end the era of building collapses, noting that his team had earlier visited the distressed building site to get an on-the-spot assessment and asked the residents to relocate for their safety.\n\nWhile speaking on the 70 distressed buildings that had been marked for demolition, Oki explained that 20 of the structures were discovered on Lagos Island.\n\nRead Also: The Week Ahead\n\nThe LASBCA boss assured that due process would be followed for Non-Destructive Tests (NDTs) to be carried out on affected buildings in order to ascertain their structural integrity. He added that the test would also determine if the buildings could be either renovated or demolished if found not safe for human habitation.\n\nOki further reiterated that the government has absolutely zero tolerance for building collapse, hence all building codes regulation within the state would be strictly enforced. He added that enforcement would include ensuring all buildings above two floors obtained insurance, as contained in the Building Regulations 2019 (as amended).\n\nHe issued a warning to developers and property owners to always do the right thing by involving LASBCA at various stages of construction works and obtaining all required approvals and completion certificates.\n\nThe UK set to relax quarantine rules on vaccinated Nigerians in the coming week\n\nThe United Kingdom has removed travel warning against Nigeria, as the former updated its travel advisory which previously placed the most populated black nation on its warning list.\n\nThis was confirmed from the foreign travel advice on Coronavirus on UK\u2019s website on Thursday.\n\nThough Nigeria is on the amber list, double vaccinated travellers will not have to quarantine in the UK when coming from amber list countries, including Nigeria after July 19. This is coming as the British government has moved to relax quarantine rules on vaccinated travellers as part of its efforts to ease Covid-19 travel restrictions.\n\nThe nation\u2019s Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps, had said that UK residents, who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19, will no longer self-isolate upon their return from another country.\n\nShapps, who made this known on Thursday, July 8, 2021, explained that individuals who have been fully vaccinated through UK\u2019s mass immunisation programme or rollout will no longer have to self-isolate when they return to the country from countries on the UK\u2019s amber list.\n\nReports have it that over 140 countries are currently on the UK\u2019s amber list, which involves a 10-day quarantine upon arrival in the U.K. with a test before arrival and 2 tests on day two and eight after arrival. People can \u2018test out\u2019 after day five with a negative test.\n\nGold Post Gains for the 3rd Week in a row\n\nGold ended the week bullish and that counts as the third straight weekly gain for the yellow metal. The safe-haven asset has returned above the $1,800 trading zone which is considered a crucial support area. However, the outlook for Gold remained unsure as a result of the uncertainty on how long it will take for the much-touted U.S. inflation to accelerate its gains.\n\nThe benchmark gold futures have gained over $40 representing a 2.69% growth, since its last negative weekly close that occurred a month ago, when it declined to a two-month low of $1,761.20. The gains recorded on Gold is a result of a weaker U.S dollar and U.S Treasury yield rate. The pair usually move inversely against the yellow metal.\n\nThe U.S Federal Reserve has indicated that it expects two hikes before 2023 that will bring interest rates within a range of 0.5% to 0.75% from a current pandemic-era super-low of zero to 0.25%. They have also not set a timetable for the tapering or complete freeze of the $120 billion in bonds and other assets it has been buying since March 2020 to support the economy through the Covid crisis.\n\nEven though the Federal Reserve has not set the timetable for tapering, it has not stopped senior bankers from commenting on it at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, talking about the likelihood of a taper or rate hike in their public speeches. Typically, any speech on tapering or rate hike by a Fed official ends up affecting the price of Gold.\n\nGold prices are expected to hold steady in the coming week, given concerns over the U.S. labour market recovery and Delta coronavirus variant.\n\nNBS economic data release calendar for the week ahead\n\nThe NBS release calendar for the coming week indicates the following:\n\nThursday 15 th July 2021: CPI and Inflation Report June 2021\n\nFriday 16 th July 2021: Premium Motor Spirit (PETROL) Price Watch June 2021\n\nOil Prices record a weekly decline\n\nOil prices remained steady on Monday as investors and traders awaited the crucial talks by OPEC following the disagreement over output within the group that could lead to major producers opening up their taps to gain market share.\n\nUnited Arab Emirates (UAE) on Monday maintained that it accepts a proposal to raise output in stages by about 2 million bpd from August to December 2021 but rejects an extension of cuts beyond April 2022 without adjusting its baseline production.\n\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) on Monday noted that the rebound in global gas demand to 2024 following a record fall last year is set to knock down the global climate goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\nThe former US Energy Secretary, Dan Brouillette, on Tuesday opined that oil prices could very easily hit $100 a barrel in the aftermath of the failed OPEC+ talks, and on the flip side, it possibly could collapse. According to sources from Russia on Thursday, Russia is leading efforts to close the divisions between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to help strike a deal to raise oil output in the coming months.\n\nBloomberg on Wednesday reported that the US shale producers have started boosting their hedges to lock in the price of oil they plan to pump in the coming months. India\u2019s newly appointed Petroleum Minister, Hardeep Singh Puri, on Thursday, said it plans to boost domestic production of oil and gas and increase the role of natural gas in the country\u2019s energy mix as India works toward a $5-trillion economy.\n\nOil prices started Friday mixed but rose over $1 later in the day yet heading for a weekly loss as uncertainty about global supplies fuelled by the OPEC+ impasse weighs in on the optimism from a draw in U.S. inventories. Brent had a weekly decline of -0.36%.\n\nIn the coming week, oil prices are expected to be bearish amid uncertainty over global supplies after an OPEC+ impasse.\n\nCurrency Market\n\nThe currency market was flat last week at the BDC market while it depreciated at the official window.\n\nIt remained flat against the US dollar sold at $/N500, appreciated against the British Pound by -0.56% to close at \u00a3/N700, while it remained flat against the Euro at \u20ac/N600 on a week-on-week (W-o-W) basis at the BDC window.\n\nAt the I & E FX window, the Naira fell week-on-week by +0.12% and +0.21% at the NAFEX window.\n\nThe Naira closed the week at $/N411.75 at the I&E FX window, at the NAFEX (spot market) it closed at $/N411.29.\n\nMore of the same is expected in the week ahead as the Naira is anticipated to continue to hover around N406/$1-N412/$1 threshold in the NAFEX window.\n\nMoney Market\n\nInterbank rates at the beginning of the previous week contracted significantly due to the increase in system liquidity. However, at the close, rates spiked up, this was propelled by the twin impact of an N142.95 billion Repo and N11.05 billion Standard Deposit Facility outflow which tightened system liquidity at the end of the week.\n\nAt the close of the trading session last week, funding rates rose significantly. Open Buyback (OBB) closed at 19.75% while Overnight (O/N) rates closed at 20.50% indicating a W-o-W rise of +64.58% for OBB and +64.00% for O/N rates.\n\nFunding rates are expected to continue their double digits trend in the coming week in the absence of any maturity.\n\nTreasury Bills Market\n\nThe overall trading session of the Nigerian Treasury Bill market was mixed.\n\nAt the close of the market on Friday, average benchmark yields for T-bills was up by +4.69% to 6.89% while OMO bills fell marginally by -0.33% W-o-W to close at 9.89%, CBN\u2019s Special Bill fell by 0.11%.\n\nWe expect activity next week to be dictated by the market liquidity situation.\n\nFGN bond and Eurobond market outlook\n\nThe Bullish momentum in the Bond market waned at the start of last week as improved offers were seen across the board particularly on the long end of the curve.\n\nAt the close of the week, the overall market was bullish with buying interest seen majorly at the short and mid tenor notes.\n\nThe overall average benchmark yields closed at 9.54% for the week which fell W-o-W by -0.81%.\n\nWith the U.S. on their Independence Day holiday on Monday, activities were muted in the Eurobond market at the start of the week. For most of the trading session last week, the market was quiet, as the decline in crude oil prices overshadowed the impact of the sharp decline in the U.S. 10-year Treasury yields.\n\nMarket sentiment is expected to remain soft as inflation concerns continue to linger.\n\nNigerian Capital Market\n\nThe Nigerian bourse closed the week on a negative note with a decline of -0.57%. The Nigerian Stock Exchange lost N123.71bn thus, year-to-date return moderated to -5.65%, while the market capitalization settled at N19.79 trillion.\n\nThe volume and value of stocks traded on the exchange this week advanced by +15.61% and +34.40% respectively.\n\nSectoral performance across sectors tracked was broadly bullish this week as the NGX Oil and Gas was the highest gainer for the week with +6.53% while NGX Main Board recorded the highest decline with -2.22%. NGX Banking, NGX-30, NGX-IND, NGX Insurance +3.29%, +0.80%, +0.19%, +0.17% respectively while NGX Consumer Goods closed the week negative with -0.32%.\n\nMarket breadth for the week closed positive with 44 gainers led by UAC-PROP and CUTIX as against 22 losers led by REDSTAREX and ETERNA.\n\nIn the coming week, we expect the possibility of sustained bargain hunting as investors look to take advantage of good bargains; however, press releases from listed companies and other macroeconomic developments are likely to impact investors\u2019 decisions.\n\nIn addition, we expect investors to monitor the movement of yields in the fixed income market.\n\nThe Nigerian economy in retrospect\n\nThe Nigerian Senate on Wednesday approved the request of President Muhammadu Buhari to take new external loans amounting to N2.34tn to fund the deficit in the N13tn 2021 Appropriation Act. The proceeds are expected to be used to fund various specific capital projects especially in specific priority sectors of the economy such as Power, Transportation, Agriculture, and Rural Development, Education, Health, Provision of counterpart funding for Multilateral and Bilateral Projects, Defence and Water Resources.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Senate passed the N982.729billion supplementary budget into law. The appropriation committee had reviewed the original amount of N895.842 billion upward by N86.9 billion. An analysis of the budget shows that N123,332,174,164 billion is allocated for Recurrent (Non-Debt) Expenditure; and N859,397,521,179 billion as a contribution to the Development Fund for Capital Expenditure.\n\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund, Nigeria currently faces a six-year delay in achieving Sustainable Development Goals. In a statement released on Tuesday, The IMF president noted that achieving the SDGs will be even more challenging as the financing needs of the SDGs increase by an annual average of $60bn per year for low-income countries. This, therefore, would account for the lengthening of the journey to achieving the development goals in the case of Nigeria by six years and in that of Rwanda by five years.\n\nThe Federal Government earlier in the week stated that the proposed Funtua, Katsina State Integrated Textile, and Garment Park, will create at least 10,000 direct jobs and 60,000 indirect jobs for Nigerians when it becomes fully operational. According to a senior official of Nigeria Export Processing Zone, the Federal Government has spent N500 million on the project, and that it is expected that the project would be completed in 18 months.\n\nThe GMD of Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kyari on Monday said the NNPC in collaboration with other oil exploration and production companies operating in Nigeria has brought down the cost of oil production in the country by 30 percent. He said they used contract renegotiation and discounts with contractors and launched the National Upstream Cost Optimisation Programme.\n\nYemi Osinbajo, OPEC, NNPC, DPR, and other stakeholders on Tuesday kicked against plans to end investment for fossil fuels and the financing of net-zero ambition.\n\nThe minister of finance, Zainab Ahmed, on Wednesday amid growing oil prices said Nigeria will set a crude oil benchmark price of $57 per barrel at 1.88 million barrels a day for its 2022 budget.\n\nNigeria\u2019s oil output recorded the largest drop in June despite an increase in the combined crude oil production by OPEC and its allies in June.\n\nIn the previous week, Fiscal authorities were active, first, we saw the passage of the supplementary appropriation bill and then the senate approval of the proposed N2.3trn external loan. The Appropriation committee had decided to upwardly review the original supplementary budget from N895bn to N982.7bn to more adequately meet pressing needs for military arms and equipment. However, the fact that N722.4bn of the amount is to be borrowed, given the debt position of the country further suggests that the country may be approaching the fiscal cliff.\n\nAnalysts, while citing the Q1 Debt service to revenue generated ratio of 98% note that the fiscal position of the country does not exactly provide for sustainable growth. The Federal Government however prefers to look at the Debt-GDP ratio of 21% which is still lower than the IMF prescribed threshold of 25% for developing countries.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, we anticipate the release of June inflation figures in the middle of the month while the MPC is expected to meet later in the month. The MPC\u2019s stance has for some time been aimed at striking a balance between stimulating growth and containing inflation. Inflation data for the month of May shows that headline inflation eased to 17.93% from 18.12% but analysts foresee a rise in inflation in June owing to an increase in the price of Diesel, increased levels of insecurity and exchange rate pressures.",

          "title": "Don\u2019t elevate injustice to statecraft, Nigerians tell Buhari",
          "text": "Many Nigerians are increasingly getting disturbed about the style of governance of the Muhammadu Buhari administration. The administration appears to have two definitions of citizenship and who a citizen actually is.\n\nThe President thus deals with individuals, groups, zones, and states depending on his own definition of who a citizen is. This, many believe, has been the major trouble with Nigeria.\n\nNigeria is often in the news for the wrong reasons. From being rated among the most corrupt countries, the most populous African nation is also sitting well among the world\u2019s poorest countries, amid growing crime rate and high level of insecurity.\n\nIn recent times, the level of injustice in the country is said to have become unprecedented.\n\nToday, Nigerians point to obvious cases of \u2018robbing Peter to pay Paul\u2019. The concern for many people is that the alleged injustice is being elevated to a statecraft.\n\nThe general belief in the country today is that the President, unlike his \u201cI belong to nobody\u201d claim, really \u201cbelongs to some people.\u201d\n\nRecall that during his inaugural speech in 2015, President Muhammadu Buhari had promised that his administration would uphold the rule of law, take the interest of all sections of the country into consideration in decision making.\n\nBuhari had emerged victorious, became the first opposition candidate to defeat a sitting president in a landmark election earlier that year, he had equally vowed to lead an administration committed to the needs of over 200 million Nigerians.\n\n\u201cHaving just a few minutes ago sworn on the Holy Book, I intend to keep my oath and serve as President to all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cI belong to everybody and I belong to nobody. A few people have privately voiced fears that on coming back to office I shall go after them. These fears are groundless. There will be no paying off old scores. The past is prologue,\u201d Buhari had said.\n\nHowever, six years down the line the reverse appears to be the case. Observers say Nigeria is on the verge of collapse, if urgent steps are not taken to correct the glaring division arising from the non-inclusive style of the Buhari administration.\n\nConcerns have continued to grow in Nigeria in recent years over the leadership style of President Buhari.\n\nAttention of the Presidency and the President has constantly been drawn to obvious government\u2019s double standard on issues affecting Nigerians, but they have always explained things away.\n\nPresently, there is general belief that the country is divided as never before, while the policies, conduct, programmes of President Buhari have fueled hatred among the different ethnic groups.\n\nBuhari\u2019s perceived loyalty to a section of the country is never in doubt; this is amid the spate of insecurity and rising impunity across Nigeria.\n\nOne such instance is the insistence by the President to give approval to the return of open grazing practised during the First Republic where herdsmen used designated grazing routes to move cattle to several parts of the country.\n\nSpeaking in an interview recently, the President said he had asked the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami to begin the process of recovering land from persons who have converted cattle grazing routes for their personal use.\n\nHis comment came despite the daily criminal and violent crimes committed by herdsmen across the country and had generated outcry among Nigerians.\n\nUnfortunately, the President does not consider the huge disruption such an exercise would cause in society, just to please a group of people.\n\nIkedy Isiguzo, a public affairs commentator, said: \u201cBuhari is not thinking of conflicts that would result from demolishing new communities that have sprouted since the abandonment of the grazing routes.\n\n\u201cHas anyone wondered what would happen in routes government property obstructs? New routes would be found at the expense of ordinary Nigerians. The consistent reference to government property suggests that places like Abuja would pave ways for the routes, possibly through the city centre.\u201d\n\nIsiguzo wondered: \u201cWhat can Buhari not do for cattle? Without clarity about the contributions of cattle to the economy, Buhari uses public funds to promote cattle rearing, a private business. The mute National Assembly is impressed.\n\n\u201cBuhari\u2019s cattle policies are escalating insecurity in Nigeria. His brazen partiality for Fulani herdsmen creates more enemies for the otherwise peaceful herdsmen now emboldened by the knowledge that Buhari knows and approves their lawlessness.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, in 2017, there was a revelation by the President of the World Bank, Jim Kim, that President Buhari directed the financial institution to focus development in the Northern part of the country.\n\nAlthough the Presidency had denied Kim\u2019s revelation, many Nigerians believed every word about it going by Buhari\u2019s style.\n\nThe administration makes no pretences about its dalliance with certain groups and has constantly shown that it was out to promote the interest of such groups above that of the country.\n\nOn numerous occasions, there has been criticism from ethnic nationalities and political leaders; they say that the fury over Buhari\u2019s handling of the nation\u2019s diversity has increased secessionist agitations in the country, while describing him as a sectional leader.\n\n\u201cHis action actually makes people begin to think that there is no basis for staying together. How many years will he stay as a President? He has only two years to go. I would suggest that we allow him to just stay and leave rather than divide the country when we can fix it,\u201d Monday Ubani, former vice president of the NBA, said.\n\nAccording to Ubani, \u201cHis actions have called for more agitation. The point is that if we need a country that would function for all of us, we need to restructure Nigeria. If we are united and manage this country well, Nigeria is one of the best countries in the world.\u201d\n\nHe further stated that the only solution to the country\u2019s problems and injustice in the Buhari\u2019s administration is for Nigeria to practise true federalism.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIf we restore the country in such a manner that we operate a proper federal system of government, where the federating units would possess devolution of powers. The powers should be taken from the centre and given to federating units where everyone would move at its own speed.\n\n\u201cIf we fail to restructure the agitations would continue and we would never have peace. Only true federalism can guarantee peace in the country.\u201d\n\nKunle Okunade, a political analyst, said the only solution was for the government to change its leadership style by running inclusive government, adding that it was obvious that the administration had polarised the country and was responsible for the present agitations for divisions.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe leadership of the Nigerian state in its governance attitude encourages state injustice and so, this breeds the various agitations we are experiencing in the southern part of the country. It is obvious that issues raised by these agitators both in the Southwest and the Southeast had colouration of social injustice which many believe can be avoided.\n\n\u201cThe approaches deployed by the Federal government in addressing the challenges have made many analysts conclude that clamping down on southern agitators violently, using state apparatus and deployment of subtle approaches on bandits and terrorists in the North, further polarise or rather divide the Nigerian people.\u201d\n\nOkunade further noted that \u201cThe challenges facing the country can only be resolved if the central government displays a leadership act of cohesion rather than sectionalism. And this can only show through the policies and body-language of the President\u201d.\n\nAs Umoh Edem, an Eket, Akwa Ibom indigene describes it, injustice is the cankerworm that has eaten honesty and hard-work in the Nigerian society.\n\nThe Petroleum Engineer graduate from the University of Port Harcourt regrets that he couldn\u2019t get a job at Mobil in Eket, his home town, while those less-qualified than him and from far places are living large from the natural resources in his domain.\n\nA few years ago, a female journalist from Calabari in Rivers State, got angry with her father, a high chief, who couldn\u2019t get her job at the Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) at Eleme.\n\nThe argument of the father had always been that Rivers State has exhausted its quota, but the female journalist, who is tired of her less-paying media job, would always retort, but there is no quota in stealing our oil and gas.\n\nToday, she has relocated to Michigan in the United States of America as she couldn\u2019t understand why those from far north are occupying positions in establishments in her hometown, while indigenes rot in joblessness.\n\nGoing to the root, Omololu Fadaka, a senior lecturer at a Lagos private university, decried that the quota system, which was included in the Constitution in 1979, killed merit and upheld injustice.\n\nFrom education, employment, appointment, promotion, award of contracts, among others, quota system, according to Fadaka, flagged off the injustice that has grown out of hand in the country today.\n\n\u201cWith merit at 45 percent, catchment area at 35 percent, and 20 percent to educationally-less developed states, which are mostly situated in the northern part of the country, injustice was enshrined in the Nigerian constitution long ago\u201d, Fadaka said.\n\nIt would be recalled that at the conferment of the Nigerian National Order of Merit Award in 2016 on Omowunmi Sadiq and Tanure Ojaide, two professors, Yemi Osinbajo, vice president, said the nation had placed quota before merit which \u201cwe know does not work\u201d.\n\nIn other words, injustice is reigning. It is also believed that the situation has become worse in the last six years.\n\nThe southern part of the country seems more unjustly treated by the government.\n\nObservers have been crying foul over the injustice as well. Currently, agitators from the Southern part of the country are being prosecuted for daring to ask for better opportunities and equal treatment for their people.\n\nThere have been arguments on why Nnamdi Kanu is arrested, while the government beg to negotiate with bandits, why Sunday Igboho is molested for fighting off herders on his farmland, while killer herdsmen still roam the forests freely.\n\nMoreover, the regular meetings of southern governors are becoming a concern for the government, while the meetings of northern governors, which have been on for ages have not given the government sleepless night.\n\nAs Abidemi Oniga, a Lagos-based economist rightly pointed out, resources in the southern part of the country are commonwealth of the nation and have been used to develop the entire country while the north reserve theirs.\n\n\u201cWe all know the crisis in Zamfara is because of the gold being mined illegally there. The government knows and nothing is being done, but illegal refineries are being destroyed in Niger Delta. Are both not our natural resources, just because the oil is in the south?\u201d he said.\n\nHe is angered over the slashing of the percent given to oil producing areas in the recently passed Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) by the Senate.\n\n\u201cIt is laughable that the eyes of the north have been on the small percentage given to oil producing areas whose environment has been destroyed by the exploration activities over the years. If the oil had been in the north, I don\u2019t think it would be shared by all the country. It is injustice\u201d, he lamented.\n\nOniga suggested that the solution is to go back to the root and to the drawing table once again to write a constitution that will protect the interest of all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe need a better constitution that will serve and protect all interests; a constitution that will ensure that a killer dies no matter who kills, who is killed or where he comes from,\u201d Oniga said.\n\nEdem thinks that the government should force all oil companies to relocate their headquarters to Niger Delta, and offer jobs to the region\u2019s indigenes on merit.\n\nOn his part, Fadaka thinks that the quota system should be abolished, while Southern governors should keep the pressure on government to balance the equation across all areas of injustice in the country.\n\nThe recent decisions by the Southern governors on a number of national issues, truly explain how frustrated the state chief executive officers have become under the current administration.\n\nAlthough a number of them are in the same party with the President, they do not believe things are being done the right way in the country, at the moment.\n\nIt was the frustration that led to the meeting in Asaba, Delta State in May where a decision was taken to end the open grazing by herdsmen.\n\nAgain, it was the same frustration that resulted in the Lagos meeting last Monday, where they also frowned at other likely policies that lend themselves to injustice.\n\nOn the now passed Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) Law, the governors commended the National Assembly for the progress so far made. The governors rejected outright the proposed 3percent and supported the 5percent share of the oil revenue to the host community as recommended by the House of Representatives;\n\nThey also rejected the proposed 30percent share of profit for the exploration of oil and gas in the basins, rejecting however, \u201cthe ownership structure of the proposed Nigeria National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC).\u201d\n\nThe Southern governors disagree that the company be vested in the Federal Ministry of Finance but should be held in trust by Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA) since all tiers of Government have stakes in that vehicle.\n\nLast week, following the re-arrest of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of IPOB, Governors Nyesom Wike and Samuel Ortom of Rivers and Benue States, respectively, upbraided Abuja, challenging the President to show same energy in arresting the killer Fulani herdsmen, Boko Haram and bandits terrorising Nigerians.\n\nAlthough they did not support Kanu, insisting that the law must take its course, the governors noted that it was hypocritical on the part of the President to shield his people while going brutal against others that commit same offence.\n\nWike, for instance, said the Federal Government must demonstrate its resolve to address insecurity crisis facing the country, and must deploy the same dragnet with which government re-arrested Kanu to urgently clamp down on bandits and Miyetti Allah militias terrorising the country.\n\n\u201cWe must not make hullabaloo about the prosecution of Nnamdi Kanu. I don\u2019t agree with his principle. I have come out and said you (Kanu) cannot annex my state to be your own. But that does not mean that you\u2019ll not allow the law to take its course,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou cannot afford to discriminate at this point. You cannot say because Nnamdi Kanu is from a particular area, let us prosecute him. The same thing must apply to all other people, the bandits, Miyetti Allah,\u201d Wike further said.\n\nAbubakar Umar, a retired colonel and former Military Administrator of Kaduna State, a few days ago, blamed President Buhari and the Federal Government for separatist agitations threatening national unity.\n\nUmar pointedly said that the current administration, has failed to unite the country.\n\nHe lambasted the government for what he described as undue attention to threats of separatist movements in contrast to the more daunting threats posed by bandits, kidnappers and insurgents in the North West, some parts of North Central and North East.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday titled: \u2018Nigeria; A Nation Challenged,\u2019 the former MILAD said the best way to unite a diverse and fragile nation like Nigeria was through justice, fairness and equity.\n\nHe stated the current administration has so far exhibited poor skills management of national diversities despite availability of great examples by past administrations and statesmen.\n\nSpeaking on challenges he considers more daunting than the threats of separatists agitations, Umar said: \u201cIt is quite strange and disturbing the Federal Government is according undue attention to the threats of separatist movements in contrast to the more daunting ones posed by bandits, kidnappers and insurgents in the North West, some parts of North Central and North East.\n\n\u201cActivities of those criminals have resulted in the evacuation of over 20 percent of the villages in NW and NE. Hundreds are being murdered and maimed every week. Many more are kidnapped for ransom.\n\n\u201cMillions have been rendered internally displaced, facing disease and starvation. Over one thousand school children were abducted in the past 8 months with over 300 still in the hands of the bandits and kidnappers demanding humongous ransom payments.\u201d\n\nHe further noted that \u201cRape of women and young girls has become a daily occurrence. Most economic activities, particularly farming, which is the mainstay of the people in these areas, are now all but impossible.\n\n\u201cGovernment\u2019s earlier claim of having technically defeated the BH insurgency in the NE has turned out to be empty propaganda. Contrary to this claim, the enemy has morphed into a more determined and deadly force, threatening to overrun the whole of the NE.\n\n\u201cFor the average Northerner living in these zones, who is barely aware of the activities of separatists, banditry, kidnappings and insurgency are of greater threat and concern to him. The arrest of Nnamdi Kanu is of no serious consequence, since it does nothing to ameliorate his harsh and brutal condition.\u201d",
          "summary": "Many Nigerians are increasingly getting disturbed about the style of governance of the Muhammadu Buhari administration.\nThe concern for many people is that the alleged injustice is being elevated to a statecraft.\nObservers say Nigeria is on the verge of collapse, if urgent steps are not taken to correct the glaring division arising from the non-inclusive style of the Buhari administration.\nConcerns have continued to grow in Nigeria in recent years over the leadership style of President Buhari.\nPresently, there is general belief that the country is divided as never before, while the policies, conduct, programmes of President Buhari have fueled hatred among the different ethnic groups.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nLagos \u2013 Operatives of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA, have intercepted a consignment of 26.150kilograms of heroin with a street value of over N6.5billion at the SAHCO shed of the Murtala Mohammed International Airport, MMIA, Ikeja, Lagos.\n\nIn a statement by Femi Babafemi, Director, Media & Advocacy, NDLEA Headquarters, Abuja, the illicit drug had arrived Lagos in 25 parcels from South Africa through an Airpeace Airline flight on 30th June, 2021 and was detained for screening following reasonable suspicion of the content of the consignment.\n\nA follow up operation was subsequently carried out the following day, 1st July when narcotic officers of the MMIA command trailed the driver and a clearing agent that were assigned to deliver the consignment to the house of a baron, Tony Chidi Onwurolu at No. 132 Lateef Adegboyega Street, off Ago palace way by Grandmate bus stop Okota, Lagos.\n\nDuring the follow up operation, Tony Chidi Onwurolu who obviously mounted a counter-surveillance around his neighbourhood fled his home before the arrival of the team of operatives who stormed his residence. They were however able to search his home and recovered a number of documents to establish his true identity.\n\nFollowing the development, the Chairman/Chief Executive of NDLEA, Brig. Gen. Mohamed Buba Marwa (rtd) has directed that the fleeing drug baron, Tony Chidi Onwurolu be declared wanted immediately and his details submitted to Interpol for tracking across the world.\n\nHe therefore directed the Agency\u2019s Directorate of Assets and Financial Investigations as well as the Directorate of Intelligence to deploy their networks to fast track the arrest of Onwurolu.\n\nMarwa said in view of the volume of heroin brought into country by the fleeing baron, the Agency would deploy all available mechanisms, locally and internationally, to track him and bring him to face charges in the law court.\n\n\u201cThose who have been on the run for 10 years and some for five years, we have since tracked them and are now facing charges while cooling their heels behind bars. The latest one won\u2019t be an exception, because he can only run but cant hide for too long before we get him\u201d, Marwa vowed.\n\nIn the same vein, operatives of the Command also intercepted a 4.3kg of skunk imported from Canada. The package, which came on Ethiopian Airline, was concealed in nine packs of cereals.\n\nAlso on 9th July, one Babatunde Usman Omogbolahan Bakare was intercepted by NDLEA operatives with 550grams of cannabis and 50grams of Rohypnol (Flunitrazepam) concealed in six jerry cans of local herbal mixtures called Gabo at SAHCO export shed, MMIA, Ikeja.\n\nThe drug was detected during outward clearance of Cargo going to Dubai.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday 6th July, operatives of the MMIA Command, conducted a follow-up operation at Gate 2, Ladipo Oluwole Street, opposite Guinness Bottling Company, Ikeja, where one Animashaun Kabiru was apprehended for questioning about a bag containing bitter cola, which was brought for export to the UK.\n\nWhen the bag of bitter kola was searched, it was discovered that the bitter kola were mixed with some wraps of a substance suspected to be illicit drug.\n\nThirty-six wraps of the suspected substance later tested positive for Cocaine weighing 600grams.\n\nIn a related development, an Uber driver, Lawal Tunde Rasheed, arrested on 8th June in connection with the seizure of a cocaine consignment has been let off the hook following his cooperation that led to the arrest of the real owner of the drug, Mr. Egbo Emmanuel Maduka, who in his statement accepted ownership of the consignment and absolved Lawal of any complicity.\n\nWhile commending officers and men of the MMIA Command of the Agency for the series of seizures and arrests in the past week, Gen. Marwa asked them not to rest on their oars, adding that \u201cwe must all remain fully prepared and proactive at all times if we have to battle this scourge to a standstill.\u201d\n\n...",

          "text": "Mr. Bello Hassan, the Managing Director/Chief Executive of the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC), has called on the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN) to include courses on the deposit insurance system (DIS) into the Institute\u2019s programs and modules to deepen the understanding of the scheme within the banking public.\n\nThe NDIC Boss made the call during a courtesy call on the Corporation\u2019s Management in Abuja by the Council Members of ICAN, led by the President of the Institute, Mrs. Comfort Eyitayo.\n\nAccording to Hassan, this would help to bridge the knowledge gap and address misconceptions on the benefits and limitations of the DIS, particularly its contributions to financial system stability.\n\nMr. Hassan noted that public awareness was a critical factor towards ensuring the maximum impact and penetration of the benefits of the deposit insurance system on the general public and the financial system as a whole. He said that partnership with ICAN and other stakeholders to promote public awareness of the DIS had become necessary in view of the novel nature of the scheme in Nigeria and world at large, adding that the Corporation would continue to place premium on collaboration with its strategic stakeholders in the overall discharge of its mandate.\n\nThe NDIC Boss thereafter, congratulated Mrs. Eyitayo on her assumption of office as the 57th ICAN President. He urged her to ensure chartered accountants continue to uphold the ideals of accuracy and integrity as enshrined in the Institute\u2019s motto. He assured the Institute of the Corporation\u2019s continued support and collaboration.\n\nIn her remarks, Mrs Eyitayo acknowledged the invaluable contributions of the NDIC in stabilizing the financial system in Nigeria. For an efficient financial services industry, the ICAN President stressed the need to sustain depositors\u2019 trust and confidence by continuous reassurance of the safety of their deposits at any given time.\n\nShe expressed the commitment of the Institute towards the continued partnership with the Corporation to achieve greater awareness of the deposit insurance system amongst members of the Institute.",

Today, Nigerians have a choice of our various Endoscopic services or pin-hole surgeries as they are commonly referred to or the new-age non-invasive solution using High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU). This procedure uses ultrasound rays to literally burn off the fibroids without any invasive method.\n\n\u201cNigeria by virtue of this new technological acquisition, has joined a unique league of 29 countries in the world where this feat is possible. HIFU is a scientific breakthrough which is available in 29 counties and about 350 Centres globally. On the African continent, HIFU is available in only three countries: South Africa, Egypt and now Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is significant to note that Lagos state by virtue of this centre, becomes the first to host a HIFU Facility on the West African Sub-Region. Thereby, putting Lagos on the HIFU Map,\u201d he added.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAjayi said, \u201cWhen we conceived this project, we had only one thing on our mind, seeing women live more fulfilled lives despite their challenge with Fibroids. With HIFU, patients can walk in, have the procedure done and, in a few hours, return to their normal lives,\u201d he added.\n\nMeanwhile, some of the women who have accessed fibroid treatment at the centre, expressed gratitude to God, for using Dr. Ajayi to help them live more fulfiled lives.\n\nFor instance, Dr. Joy Oluwatunbi told LEADERSHIP that life has not been easy, living with Fibroid, adding that the condition affected all spheres of her life.\n\nOluwatunbi said she initially wanted to travel abroad to remove the Fibroid, but due to COVID-19, she couldn\u2019t. \u201cI am so grateful that Dr. Ajayi brought the HIFU machine to Nigeria, because it has saved me the stress and high cost of treatment abroad. I urge women to try the HIFU treatment option. The procedure is just two hours, no blood transfusion, no cutting and within few hours, you are back on your feet,\u201d she added.",

I urge women to try the HIFU treatment option. The procedure is just two hours, no blood transfusion, no cutting and within few hours, you are back on your feet,\u201d she added.",

          "text": "A rights organisation, the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has asked a Federal High Court in Abuja to order the Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC) and the National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission (NSIWC) to review downward the remuneration and allowances of President Muhammadu Buhari, Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, 36 governors and members of the National Assembly.\n\nThe group said this should be done by the duo by performing their statutory functions.\n\nSERAP in a suit number FHC/ABJ/CS/658/2021 filed last Friday, SERAP seek \u201can order of mandamus to direct and compel the RMAFC to send its downward review of the remuneration and allowances of these high-ranking public office holders and recommendations to the National Assembly for appropriate remedial and legislative action, as provided for by the Nigerian Constitution 1999 (as amended).\n\nSERAP said slashing jumbo pay for these high-ranking political office-holders would reduce the unfair pay disparity between political officer holders and judicial officers.\n\nThe rights organisations said addressing the persistent poor treatment of judges, would improve access of victims of corruption to justice and effective remedies.\n\nSERAP is also seeking \u201can order of mandamus to direct and compel the RMAFC to perform its mandatory constitutional duty to urgently review upward the remuneration, salaries and allowances, as well as the conditions of service for Nigerian judges.\u201d\n\nJoined in the suit filed on behalf of SERAP by its lawyers, Kolawole Oluwadare and Ms Adelanke Aremo, are Senate President, Ahmad Lawan; Speaker of House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, for themselves, and on behalf of all members of the Senate and House of Representative; and the National Judicial Council.\n\nSERAP said while high-ranking political office-holders continue to enjoy lavish allowances, including life pensions, and access to security votes, which they have powers to spend as they wish, the remuneration and allowances of judges are grossly insufficient to enable them to maintain themselves and their families in reasonable comfort.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe rights organisation said, \u201cThe huge pay disparity between these high-ranking political officer-holders and judges is unfair, unjust and discriminatory, especially given the roles of judges to the people and the country.\u201d\n\nSERAP is also seeking \u201can order of mandamus to direct and compel NSIWC to perform its mandatory legal duty to urgently examine, streamline and recommend upward remuneration and allowances of Nigerian judges, and to recommend a downward review of allowances of President Buhari, Vice-President Osinbajo, 36 governors and lawmakers to the National Assembly.\u201d\n\nNo date has been fixed for the hearing of the suit.\n\nThe suit said the remuneration and allowances of judges have fallen substantially behind the average salaries and allowances of high-ranking political office-holders such as President, Vice-President, governors and lawmakers.\n\nThe suit reads in part, \u201cWhile government reviewed upward the salaries and allowances of political office holders on four occasions between May 1999 and March 2011, the salaries and allowances of judicial officers were only reviewed twice during the same period.\n\n\u201cThe review of the remuneration, allowances, and conditions of service for political, public and judicial office holders carried out by the RMAFC in 2009 shows a huge disparity between the remuneration and allowances of judges and those of high-ranking political office-holders.\n\n\u201cThe NSIWC in a letter to SERAP admitted that it has powers to examine, streamline and recommend the salary scales applicable to each post in the public service but informed us to redirect our request to the RMAFC.\n\n\u201cThere is a legal duty upon the RMAFC to urgently review downward the remuneration and allowances of high-ranking political office-holders.\u201d\n\n\u201cJudges should get all to which they are reasonably entitled, and it is unfair, illegal, unconstitutional, and discriminatory to continue to treat judges as second-class people while high-ranking political office-holders continue to enjoy lavish salaries and allowances.\u201d\n\n\u201cDespite their important roles and responsibilities, Nigerian judges are poorly treated, particularly when their remuneration, salaries, allowances, and conditions of service are compared with that of political office-holders. Judges should not have to endure the most poignant financial worries.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe increase in the cost of living and the injustice of inadequate salaries bears heavily on judges, as it undermines their ability to effectively perform their judicial functions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe roles and functions performed by judges across the country are second to none in their importance, including in facilitating access of victims of corruption and human rights violations to justice and effective remedies.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a safeguard of judicial independence, the budget of the judiciary ought to be prepared in collaboration with the judiciary having regard to the peculiar needs and requirements of judicial administration.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe remuneration and pensions of judges must be secured by law at an adequate level that is consistent with their status and is sufficient to safeguard against conflict of interest and corruption.\u201d\n\n\u201cNigerians would continue to bear the brunt of denied access to justice, a better judiciary and a better administration of justice until judges across the country are paid what they rightly deserve.\u201d",

          "text": "Nnamdi Kanu, the embattled leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, was captured in Kenya and returned to Nigeria, according to new information.\n\nAccording to a source familiar with the situation, Kanu was kidnapped from an airport parking lot in Kenya and held in a house for eight days, where he was allegedly abused and tortured before being returned to Nigeria.\n\nKanu did not fly to Kenya with his Nigerian passport, but rather with his British passport, according to Sahara reporters. The source reportedly disclosed;\n\n\u201cKanu had arrived in Kenya and settled down in a house. On June 19, 2021, he drove himself in a car to the international airport to meet a person arriving in the country for a high-level IPOB meeting. He drove into the underground parking lot at the airport and was arrested before exiting the car.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was taken to a house and brutalised for 8 days while the Nigerian authorities perfected how to forcefully relocate him to Nigeria. He was travelling on a British passport, not a Nigerian passport as alleged by Malami. He was brought into Nigeria on a Saturday and arraigned on Monday.\u201d\n\n\u201cBuhari upon learning of his abduction decided to cancel his trip to the UK to manage the diplomatic fallouts at home instead of going to London. Kanu was interrogated in the presence of his lawyers in the DSS office in Abuja. The Nigerian government didn\u2019t get his passport, laptop, and three major phones.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was taken out of Kenya without passing through immigration.\u201d\n\nUK Newspaper, The Guardian reported that Kanu got a Kenyan visa which was to expire in June, and he had been around in the country before his sudden arrest and extradition.\n\n\u201cEvidence seen by the Guardian shows Kanu entered Kenya this year on his British passport on a visa expiring in June. His UK passport remains in Kenya. Kanu was not in possession of a Nigerian passport, his family said, and he has verbally renounced his Nigerian citizenship in broadcasts. The abduction of a person from a foreign country with the aim of rendition to justice is illegal under international law,\u201d the UK newspaper report revealed.\n\nIfeanyi Ejiofor, Kanu\u2019s lawyer, had stated that the pro-secession figure is suffering from health issues as a result of the alleged torture and beatings he experienced. He has expressed confidence, though, that his client will be released shortly.",

Also, within the last two weeks, the occupancy rate at our 2 isolation centres increased from an average of 1% to 6%. This is the new and disturbing reality that now confronts us.\n\n\u201cGreater vigilance is required at this time in our Churches and Mosques and other places of religious worship. Even as we are pleased that religious houses are now open for worship, after the lengthy closures of 6 2020, we must not allow ourselves to be carried away by the illusion that all is now back to normal. This is especially critical, as Sallah approaches, in a little over a week from now.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe festivities will no doubt bring people together in large numbers and create conditions that can sadly cause the spread of the Coronavirus. We must not allow this to happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor this reason, we are mandating full compliance with all protective protocols. Compulsory use of masks in all public places, Social distancing, Temperature checks, Provisions for hand-washing and sanitizers, and a maximum of 50 percent occupancy in enclosed spaces. Resisting Pandemic Fatigue Whilst both the Federal and State Governments have a huge role to play in the management of the COVID-19 pandemic, the responsibility of managing the third wave ultimately belongs to all of us.\u201d",

Judges should not have to endure the most poignant financial worries,\u201d it said.\n\nBeyond the disparity between the remuneration of judges and political office holders, SERAP\u2019s suit is also based on the impact of the increase in cost of living and the importance of the roles played by judges, a role it considers as second to none with regard to providing justice and protecting human rights.\n\n\u201cAs a safeguard of judicial independence, the budget of the judiciary ought to be prepared in collaboration with the judiciary having regard to the peculiar needs and requirements of judicial administration,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cThe remuneration and pensions of judges must be secured by law at an adequate level that is consistent with their status and is sufficient to safeguard against conflict of interest and corruption.\u201d\n\nNo date has been fixed for the hearing of the suit.",

          "text": "The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) has intercepted a consignment of 26.150 kilograms of heroin with a street value of over a \u20a66.5 billion at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport (MMIA), Lagos.\n\nIn a statement issued on Sunday, NDLEA spokesman, Femi Babafemi, said the illicit drugS had arrived in Lagos in 25 parcels from South Africa through an Air Peace Airline flight on June 30 and was detained for screening following suspicion of the content of the consignment.\n\nHe explained that a follow-up operation was subsequently carried out the following day when narcotics officers of the MMIA command trailed the driver and a clearing agent that were assigned to deliver the consignment to the house of a baron, Tony Chidi Onwurolu at No. 132 Lateef Adegboyega Street, off Ago palace way by Grandmate bus stop Okota, Lagos.\n\nDuring the follow-up operation, Tony Chidi Onwurolu, who obviously mounted counter-surveillance around his neighborhood fled his home before the arrival of the team of operatives who stormed his residence. They were however able to search his home and recovered a number of documents to establish his true identity.\n\nFollowing the development, the Chairman/Chief Executive of NDLEA, Brig. Gen. Mohamed Buba Marwa (Retd) has directed that the fleeing drug baron, Tony Chidi Onwurolu, be declared wanted immediately and his details submitted to Interpol for tracking across the world. He, therefore, directed the Agency\u2019s Directorate of Assets and Financial Investigations as well as the Directorate of Intelligence to deploy their networks to fast track the arrest of Onwurolu.\n\nMarwa said in view of the volume of heroin brought into the country by the fleeing baron, the agency would deploy all available mechanisms, locally and internationally, to track him and bring him to face charges in the law court.\n\n\u201cThose who have been on the run for 10 years and some for five years, we have since tracked them and are now facing charges while cooling their heels behind bars. The latest one won\u2019t be an exception, because he can only run but can\u2019t hide for too long before we get him,\u201d Marwa said.\n\nSimilarly, operatives of the Command also intercepted a 4.3kg of skunk imported from Canada. The package, which came on Ethiopian Airlines, was concealed in nine packs of cereals.\n\nAlso on July 9, one Babatunde Usman Omogbolahan Bakare was intercepted by NDLEA operatives with 550grams of cannabis and 50grams of Rohypnol (Flunitrazepam) concealed in six jerry cans of local herbal mixtures called Gabo at SAHCO export shed, MMIA, Ikeja.\n\nThe drug was detected during outward clearance of Cargo going to Dubai.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, July 6, operatives of the MMIA Command conducted a follow-up operation at Gate 2, Ladipo Oluwole Street, opposite Guinness Bottling Company, Ikeja, where one Animashaun Kabiru was apprehended for questioning about a bag containing bitter cola, which was brought for export to the UK.\n\n\u201cWhen the bag of bitter kola was searched, it was discovered that the bitter kola were mixed with some wraps of a substance suspected to be an illicit drug. Thirty-six wraps of the suspected substance later tested positive for Cocaine weighing 600grams,\u201d the NDLEA spokesman stated.\n\nIn a related development, an Uber driver, Lawal Tunde Rasheed, arrested on June 8, in connection with the seizure of a cocaine consignment has been let off the hook following his cooperation that led to the arrest of the real owner of the drug, Mr. Egbo Emmanuel Maduka, who in his statement accepted ownership of the consignment and absolved Lawal of any complicity.\n\nWhile commending officers and men of the MMIA Command of the Agency for the series of seizures and arrests in the past week, Gen. Marwa asked them not to rest on their oars, adding that \u201cwe must all remain fully prepared and proactive at all times if we have to battle this scourge to a standstill.\u201d",

          "title": "Billionaire Adventurer Richard Branson Reaches Space in His Own Ship",
          "text": "Swashbuckling entrepreneur Richard Branson hurtled into space aboard his own winged rocket ship Sunday, beating out fellow billionaire Jeff Bezos.\n\nThe nearly 71-year-old Branson and five crewmates from his Virgin Galactic space-tourism company reached an altitude of about 53 miles (85 kilometers) over the New Mexico desert \u2014 enough to experience three to four minutes of weightlessness and witness the curvature of the Earth \u2014 and then safely glided to a runway landing.\n\n\u201cThe whole thing, it was just magical,\u201d a jubilant Branson said after the trip home aboard the gleaming white space plane, named Unity.\n\nThe brief, up-and-down flight \u2014 the space plane\u2019s portion took only about 15 minutes, or about as long as Alan Shepard\u2019s first U.S. spaceflight in 1961 \u2014 was a splashy and unabashedly commercial plug for Virgin Galactic, which plans to start taking paying customers on joyrides next year.\n\nBranson became the first person to blast off in his own spaceship, beating Bezos by nine days. He also became only the second septuagenarian to go into space. Astronaut John Glenn flew on the shuttle at age 77 in 1998.\n\nBezos sent his congratulations, adding: \u201cCan\u2019t wait to join the club!\u201d \u2014 though he also took to Twitter a couple of days earlier to enumerate the ways in which be believes his company\u2019s rides will be better.\n\nWith about 500 people watching, including Branson\u2019s family, Unity was carried aloft underneath a twin-fuselage aircraft. Then, at an altitude of about 8 1/2 miles (13 kilometers), Unity detached from the mother ship and fired its engine, reaching more than Mach 3, or three times the speed of sound, as it pierced the edge of space.\n\nSpectators cheered, jumped into the air and embraced as the rocket plane touched down. Branson pumped his fists as he stepped out onto the runway and ran toward his family, bear-hugging his wife and children and scooping up his three grandchildren in his arms.\n\nMike Moses, a top executive at Virgin Galactic, said that apart from some problems with the transmission of video images from inside the cabin, the flight was perfect, and the ship looked pristine.\n\n\u201cThat was an amazing accomplishment,\u201d former Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield, a one-time commander of the International Space Station, said from the sidelines. \u201cI\u2019m just so delighted at what this open door is going to lead to now. It\u2019s a great moment.\u201d\n\nVirgin Galactic conducted three previous test flights into space with crews of just two or three.\n\nThe flamboyant, London-born founder of Virgin Atlantic Airways wasn\u2019t supposed to fly until later this summer. But he assigned himself to an earlier flight after Bezos announced plans to ride his own rocket into space from Texas on July 20, the 52nd anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing. Branson denied he was trying to outdo Bezos.\n\nBranson\u2019s other chief rival in the space-tourism race among the world\u2019s richest men, SpaceX\u2019s Elon Musk, came to New Mexico to watch and congratulated Branson for a \u201cbeautiful flight.\u201d\n\nBezos\u2019 Blue Origin company intends to send tourists past the so-called Karman line 62 miles (100 kilometers) above Earth, which is is recognized by international aviation and aerospace federations as the threshold of space.\n\nBut NASA, the Air Force, the Federal Aviation Administration and some astrophysicists consider the boundary between the atmosphere and space to begin 50 miles (80 kilometers) up.\n\nThe risks to Branson and his crew were underscored in 2007, when a rocket motor test in California\u2019s Mojave Desert left three workers dead, and in 2014, when a Virgin Galactic rocket plane broke apart during a test flight, killing one pilot and seriously injuring the other.\n\nEver the showman, Branson insisted on a global livestream of the Sunday morning flight and invited celebrities and former space station astronauts to the company\u2019s Spaceport America base in New Mexico. R&B singer Khalid performed his new single \u201cNew Normal\u201d \u2014 a nod to the dawning of space tourism \u2014 while CBS \u201cLate Show\u201d host Stephen Colbert served as master of ceremonies.\n\nBefore climbing aboard, Branson, who has kite-surfed the English Channel and attempted to circle the world in a hot-air balloon, signed the astronaut log book and wisecracked: \u201cThe name\u2019s Branson. Sir Richard Branson. Astronaut Double-oh-one. License to thrill.\u201d\n\nBut asked afterward whether he is planning any more adventures, Branson said he will \u201cdefinitely give it a rest for the time being\u201d because \u201cI\u2019m not sure it would be fair to put my family through another one.\u201d He said he thinks he holds the record for being pulled out of the sea five times by helicopter.\n\nUpon his return to Earth, he announced a sweepstakes drawing for two seats on a Virgin Galactic jaunt.\n\nVirgin Galactic already has more than 600 reservations from would-be space tourists, with tickets initially costing $250,000 apiece. Blue Origin is waiting for Bezos\u2019 flight before announcing its ticket prices.\n\nKerianne Flynn, who signed up in 2011 to fly with Virgin Galactic, had butterflies ahead of the launch Sunday.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s going to be nothing like going up there and looking back down on the Earth, which is what I think I\u2019m most excited about,\u201d she said. She added: \u201cHopefully the next generations will be able to explore what\u2019s up there.\u201d\n\nBlue Origin and Musk\u2019s SpaceX both fly Apollo-style, using capsules atop rockets, instead of an air-launched, reusable space plane.\n\nSpaceX, which is already launching astronauts to the space station for NASA and building moon and Mars ships, plans to take tourists on more than just brief, up-and-down trips. They will instead go into orbit around the Earth for days, with seats costing well into the millions. The company\u2019s first private flight is set for September.\n\nMusk himself has not committed to going into space anytime soon.",

          "text": "This is not how USA Basketball expected to open its Olympic summer.\n\nNigeria probably didn\u2019t expect it, either.\n\nIf there was any expectation of invincibility for the Americans heading into the Tokyo Olympics, it\u2019s already gone \u2014 after Nigeria beat the U.S. 90-87 on Saturday night, an international shocker pulled off by a roster primarily filled by little-known NBA players that found a way to beat a group of All-NBA, All-Star and max-contract performers.\n\n\u201cWe just wanted to compete,\u201d said Nigeria\u2019s Gabe Nnamdi, who goes by Gabe Vincent when playing for the Miami Heat. \u201cWe know what USA Basketball means around the world and what they\u2019ve stood for for so long.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. had lost 11 games before Saturday in major international play \u2014 Olympics and World Cups, mostly \u2014 since NBA players began filling the American rosters with the first Dream Team in 1992. None of those losses came against a team from Africa.\n\n\u201cI thought that the Nigerian team played very physically, did a great job in that regard and knocked down a lot of 3s,\u201d U.S. coach Gregg Popovich said. \u201cGive them credit.\u201d\n\nNnamdi led Nigeria with 21 points. Caleb Agada scored 17 points, Ike Nwamu added 13 and Nigeria outscored the U.S. 60-30 from 3-point range.\n\nKevin Durant, who had never before played in a loss for USA Basketball in 39 senior international games, had 17 points. Jayson Tatum added 15, Damian Lillard had 14 and Bam Adebayo 11.\n\n\u201cJust goes to show that we have to play better,\u201d Tatum said.\n\nA lot better.\n\nThe Americans had gone 39-0 in their last three Olympic seasons \u2014 including pre-Olympic exhibitions \u2014 on their way to gold medals and had been 54-2 in major exhibitions since NBA players began playing for USA Basketball in 1992. Plus, they\u2019d beaten Nigeria by a combined 127 points in their last two meetings, one at the 2012 London Games, the other a warm-up for the 2016 Rio Games.\n\nNigeria lost to the U.S. at the 2012 Olympics by 83 points. Lost to the Americans again four years later in an exhibition, that time by 44 points.\n\nNot this time.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s come a long way with their basketball,\u201d USA Basketball managing director Jerry Colangelo said.\n\nIke Iroegbu \u2014 a former Washington State player who some time in the G League \u2014 hit a 3-pointer with about 1:15 left to put Nigeria up 88-80. Durant scored the next seven points for the U.S.; a 3-pointer, two free throws following a turnover, then two more from the line with 16.5 seconds remaining.\n\nNnamdi made two foul shots with 13.2 seconds left to restore Nigeria\u2019s 3-point edge. The Americans ran 9.7 seconds off the clock on the ensuing possession without getting a shot off, and Zach LaVine missed a pair of free throws \u2014 the second intentionally \u2014 with 3.5 seconds left.\n\nPrecious Achiuwa got the rebound for Nigeria, and that was it. It\u2019s only an exhibition \u2014 but the upset was still of the massive variety, the 22nd-ranked nation by FIBA beating the No. 1-ranked team and three-time reigning Olympic gold medalists.\n\nPopovich heard the final buzzer and shook hands with Nigeria coach Mike Brown, the Golden State assistant, as the Americans walked off stunned.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, it doesn\u2019t mean much in the standings as far as where we\u2019re trying to get to,\u201d Brown said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a good win for us. I don\u2019t think any African team has been able to beat USA Basketball in an exhibition game or a real game. \u2026 We\u2019re trying to get a little bit of momentum for Nigeria and for the continent of Africa.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. led 43-41 at the half, then pushed the lead out to 52-43 early in the third. But the Nigerians connected on 3s on their next three possessions \u2014 Vincent, Achiuwa and Nwamu all connected \u2014 and just like that, the game was tied.\n\nAchiuwa took one 3-pointer all season with the Heat. It missed. But he connected in this one, as did Miye Oni \u2014 who made two 3s in the fourth quarter, including the one that put Nigeria up for good with 6:08 left. Oni averaged all of 1.9 points per game this season for Utah, and made two enormous shots late Saturday to help seal the U.S. fate.\n\n\u201cWe kept the game simple,\u201d Nnamdi said, \u201cand came out on top.\u201d\n\nTIP-INS\n\nNigeria: Achiuwa had perhaps the night\u2019s top defensive play with 1:23 left in the first half, reaching with his left hand to block a Durant dunk attempt. \u2026 Nigeria outrebounded the U.S. 46-34.\n\nUSA: Darius Garland and Saddiq Bey were Select Team players who got into the game. The Olympic team needed extra players because Khris Middleton, Jrue Holiday and Devin Booker are at the NBA Finals. \u2026 The U.S. got 32 free-throw attempts to Nigeria\u2019s 10.\n\nFREE THROW DEFENSE\n\nNigeria\u2019s Chimezie Metu had a brilliant play in the third quarter \u2014 committing what would be goaltending in the NBA. Durant was taking a free throw, and as his shot bounced on the rim Metu reached up and knocked the shot away. That\u2019s a legal play under FIBA rules.\n\nINJURY SCARE\n\nLaVine got hurt in the second quarter on a play where he was closing out against Nnamdi. He went airborne after a head fake and came down awkwardly, grabbing at his left ankle before getting up and going directly to the U.S. locker room. LaVine was fine and returned in the third quarter.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nNigeria: Face Argentina on Monday in Las Vegas.\n\nUSA: Face Australia on Monday in Las Vegas.",
