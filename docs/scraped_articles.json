          "title": "Expelling me from APC will cause more crisis, Marafa threatens Buni",
          "text": "Senator Kabiru Garba Marafa\n\nBy Omeiza Ajayi \u2013 Abuja\n\nChieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) from Zamfara state, Senator Kabiru Garba Marafa has brushed off threats by the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the party to throw him out of the APC, saying doing so would only aggravate the problems afflicting the party.\n\nMarafa in a statement issued Wednesday in Abuja urged Governor Buni to respect the rule of law, saying the Yobe state Governor should stop deluding himself as the national chairman of the APC, declaring that he is only chairman of the party\u2019s convention planning committee.\n\nHe dismissed threats by the caretaker committee to expel him for expressing reservations on its legality, describing it as an empty threat.\n\nMarafa, who represented the Zamfara Central Senatorial District in the last assembly, had on Sunday, threatened to institute legal actions against Governor Buni\u2019s CECPC over what he termed gross violations of the party\u2019s constitution in the conduct of party\u2019s affairs.\n\n\u201cAPC is a political party, not a committee. Committees are created to serve specific functions not to usurp the powers of the entire legal entity.\n\n\u201cThe function of the Mai Mala committee is to plan a convention just as its name implies. Mai Mala is the chairman of the APC convention planning committee and not APC itself,\u201d said Marafa.\n\nAccording to him, Section 12.3 of the APC constitution lists the party\u2019s National Executive Committee NEC members \u201cand it made the National Chairman of the party and not the chairman of any committee by whatever name as the chairman of the organ while Section 12.3 (xxxi) lists the President and Vice President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as members only, so the question is; who approved the constitution and subsequent extensions of tenure of office of the illegal and obnoxious CECPC?\u201d\n\nALSO READ: We\u2019ve lost 20 colleagues waiting for unpaid benefits by INTELS \u2014 Disengaged dockworkers\n\n\u201cThis is the situation we find ourselves. The Chairman of APC today is an overzealous chairman of convention planning committee only and a sitting governor\u201d, Marafa declared.\n\nThe CECPC had in a statement issued Monday in Abuja through its Secretary, Sen. John James Akpanudodehe warned Marafa to shape in or shape out.\n\nThe party threatened to wield the big stick, saying Marafa\u2019s actions and utterances constitute insubordination and reduction of party issues to personality contest.\n\nReacting to the threat, Marafa said he cannot be silenced by the caretaker committee.\n\n\u201cExpelling me from the party will only aggravate the problem. It will herald the beginning of the agitation; rule of law must be respected.\n\n\u201cThe committee is illegal and alien to the constitution of the party. We are building everything on nothing. Rather than the expulsion threat, the committee or the chairman should respond to issues I raised,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat does our party constitution says that renders Buni\u2019s committee null and void? Section 17 (4) of the constitution of our beloved party, says \u2018no officer in any organ of the party shall hold executive position office in government concurrently\u2019. Article 20 states the only way the leadership of the party can evolve.\n\n\u201cSection 13.3(iv) which was relied upon to create the illegal body called CECPC talked about the power of NEC to create committees.\n\n\u201cMai Mala should choose between Yobe or APC. The combination of the two is no longer tenable\u201d, Marafa declared.\n\nMarafa reiterated his determination to institute legal actions to save the party from what he tagged, \u201cover ambitious Buni\u201d if he refuses to revert to his original assignment as chairman convention planning committee.\n\n\u201cWe will show him the way out dishonourably. We will not allow the party we contributed immensely to develop to be destroyed by over-ambitious self-centred and enemies of the party, and the country.\n\n\u201cThis is the party we laboured, toiled and laid the foundation for its success. We will not allow those who have little or no stake in the party to destroy it or to please certain individuals and achieve their selfish interests,\u201d he said.\n\nMarafa, while insisting that he has committed no offence, said the party should revert to the path of constitutionality and rule of law or face extinction.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "title": "Act on #EndSARS panel report, UN, US, AI, CSOs, Falana, others tell Lagos govt",
          "text": "\n\nBy Dapo Akinrefon, Olasunkanmi Akoni, Victoria Ojeme, Henry Ojelu, Ozioruva Aliu & Elizabeth Osayande\n\n\u2026Only a White Paper can confirm Lekki killings, says CDS\n\nTHE United Nations, United States of America, Amnesty International Nigeria, Civil Society Organisations, Human Rights lawyer, Mr. Femi Falana, SAN, and former Military Administrator of Ondo State, Commodore Bode George, retd, yesterday, charged Lagos State government to act on the report submitted by the panel for victims of SARS-related abuses and other matters.\n\nThis came as the state government reserved its comments over the leaked report.\n\nCommissioner for Information and Strategy, Gbenga Omotoso, said yesterday: \u201cNo comment for now. Mr. Governor has set up a four-man committee to come up with the White Paper, until then, no comment, please.\u201d\n\nThe Judicial Panel of Inquiry and Restitution on Lekki Toll Gate Shooting Incident and Cases of Police Brutality as well as human rights violations, had on Monday, indicted the Nigerian Army and the Police of complicity in the death of protesters at the Lekki Tollgate in 2020.\n\nPanel makes 32 recommendations\n\nThe Panel also made a total of 32 recommendations. They include sanctioning of the officers of the Nigerian Army and the Nigerian Police Force who participated in shooting, injuring and killing of unarmed protestors at the Lekki Toll Gate on October 20 and 21, 2020; development of more robust engagement between the youth and the government; and setting up of a standing committee/tribunal to deal with cases of violation of human rights by security agencies and a trust fund to settle compensation awarded by such committee/tribunal.\n\nIt equally called for a public apology to #EndSARS protesters who were killed, injured and traumatized by the incident of October 20, 2020.\n\nGovernor Sanwo-Olu had promised to treat the report appropriately, saying history was there to judge the state government well or otherwise.\n\nOnly a White Paper can confirm Lekki killings, says CDS\n\nBut the Chief of Defence Staff, CDS, General Lucky Irabor, in his reaction to the report yesterday, said only a White Paper on the report would confirm the alleged incidents.\n\nHe, however, assured that the Nigerian Armed Forces remained committed to its professional calling of protecting the territorial integrity of Nigeria.\n\nHe also cautioned Nigerians against making inciting comments on what was happening across the country.\n\nSpeaking to journalists shortly after a courtesy visit on Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State, Irabor said: \u201cI am sure those of you in the media must have seen that there is a report that was released.\n\n\u201cWhether it is a true report, I can\u2019t tell but I would like to indicate that the normal procedure is to have such a report submitted to the convening authority and then, there will be a white paper, based on which one can make informed comments.\n\n\u201cBut whatever you see currently, I will like to indicate that the armed forces of Nigeria are professional, we are peopled by Nigerians and we remain committed to constitutional mandates. We do not at this point, think that Nigerians should make disparaging remarks regarding the armed forces of Nigeria in the sense that we are professional armed forces and if there are issues, of course, we address them within the ambits of the provisions of the law.\n\n\u201cIt will not be right to disparage men and women who have worked so hard to ensure that the territorial integrity of this nation is kept intact. Meantime, until I see the full report, I may not be able to comment, but I can assure you that the armed forces of Nigeria are well disciplined and we do not engage in any ignoble acts.\n\n\u201cIf Nigerians don\u2019t trust us, then we wouldn\u2019t have been doing what we are doing and in any case, it is the armed forces of Nigeria. So let us not make inciting comments that will put the entire space on fire. That is not right.\u201d\n\nGovt must implement recommendations \u2014UN\n\nReacting to the report, the United Nations urged government\u2019s commitment to implementing the panel\u2019s recommendations\n\nIn a statement by the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Nigeria, Mr. Edward Kallon, the body said: \u201cI welcome the submission to Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, of reports of the judicial panel on claims of brutality and shooting in the Lekki area of Lagos State, during the 2020 EndSARS protests.\n\n\u201cI urge the government to implement the recommendations of the judicial panel to rebuild trust and start the process of healing and reconciliation.\u201d\n\nLASG should address abuses, grievances of victims \u2014US\n\nSimilarly, the United States government, in its reaction to the panel report, called on the Federal and Lagos State governments to seek suitable measures to address the alleged abuses, as well as the grievances of victims of the 2020 #EndSARS protest.\n\nThe statement issued by the US Embassy in Nigeria, said: \u201cThe United States welcomes the conclusion of the Lagos State Judicial Panel of Inquiry with the transmission of its final report. We look forward to the Lagos State government\u2019s response as part of a process that represents an important mechanism of accountability regarding the #EndSARS protests and the events that took place near the Lekki Toll Gate on October 20, 2020.\n\n\u201cThose events led to serious allegations against some members of the security forces, and we look forward to Lagos State and federal governments taking suitable measures to address those alleged abuses as well as the grievances of the victims and their families.\u201d\n\nPerpetrators must face justice \u2014 AI Nigeria\n\nSimilarly, the Director of Amnesty International Nigeria, Osai Ojigho, said perpetrators must face justice.\n\nOjigho said: \u201cAmnesty International welcomes the panel\u2019s report, which confirms that Nigerian army and police shot peaceful protesters at the Lekki toll gate on October 20, 2020. The panel\u2019s findings revealed the truth about what happened at Lekki toll gate and contradict the shameful denial by the Nigerian government that deadly force was used against peaceful #EndSARS protesters.\n\n\u201cFor the survivors and relatives of the dead, the judicial panels findings are only the first step towards justice and restitution. President Buhari must act promptly to ensure that those found to be responsible for shooting and attacks on peaceful protesters are brought to justice in fair trial. Nigerian authorities must ensure access to justice and effective remedies, including adequate compensation, restitution, and guarantee of non-repetition to victims and their families.\u201d\n\nLASG must implement panel recommendation \u2014Falana\n\nOn his part, the Interim Chairman, Alliance on Surviving COVID-19 and Beyond, ASCAB, Mr Femi Falana, SAN, commended the courage of members of the panel and insisted that Lagos State government was duty-bound to implement the recommendations of the panel.\n\nFalana said: \u201cThe members of the Okuwobi Judicial Commission of Inquiry deserve commendation for the thorough investigation of police brutality in Lagos State. In particular, the revelation that some of the 99 dead bodies dumped in the various mortuaries in Lagos by soldiers were traced to the Lekki Toll Gate has exposed the official lie that the report of the brutal killing was a figment of the imagination of the protesters. A certified copy of report of the panel should be forwarded to President Muhammadu Buhari, given the recommendation that the soldiers and police personnel who engaged in the torture and reckless murder of citizens be sanctioned.\n\n\u201cHaving received the report of the Judicial Commission, Lagos State government is urged to accelerate the issuance of the White Paper as well as implementation of the far-reaching recommendations. The policemen, who were killed by criminal elements during the protests ,should be honoured notwithstanding that their family members have been compensated by Lagos State government.\u201d\n\nThe report has exposed govt lies, says Malachy\n\nAlso, former President of the Committee for Defence of Human Rights, Mr Malachy Ugwummadu, said: \u201cMoving forward, victims and relatives of victims of this illegal and callous violence can pursue further legal redress, including the enforcement of the fundamental rights of their relations in our regular high courts. I pursued a case on behalf of a victim before the panel and got compensation but that was on behalf of a living victim. The Fundamental Rights (Enforcement Procedure) Rules 2019 allows the victimised families or even friends of the deceased to approach the high court for redress and compensation.\n\n\u201cSecondly, the identified security operatives and their enablers must be court-marshalled and subjected to room-orderly trial but all must, thereafter, be prosecuted by the Nigerian State (AGF) to show the clear resentments and disapproval of the Nigerian State. If the Nigerian government fails to prosecute the culprits, then the campaign will be intensified to expose the suspected security personnel, including their commanders, to the International Criminal Court ICC for crimes against humanity, having declared the events of October 20, 2020, as a massacre.\u201d\n\nArmy must court-martial culpable soldiers \u2014 Bode George\n\nSimilarly, Commodore Bode George, retd, urged the Nigerian Army to fish out soldiers responsible for the Lekki toll gate shooting and court-martial them.\n\nHe said: \u201cSanwo-Olu should know that he has a family name behind him, both from his mother and his father\u2019s side and that the truth has already been told.\n\n\u201cHe should be straight with himself and his government and take the appropriate actions. To err is human and to forgive is divine. If he reads the document from the panel and makes amends and apologise to the people of the state, that would be great. Lives were lost. He should read that document, make amends and apologise to the people of the state.\n\n\u201dThe military command should investigate what happened and the right thing should be done.\u201d\n\nIndicted persons must be prosecuted\u2014 Peterside\n\nAlso reacting to the report, Chairman Standard IBTC, Bank Plc, Atedo Peterside said: \u201cFirst, let me commend the Judicial panel because many of us were not sure they will stand up and be counted and I think they have done very well.\n\n\u201cBut when I saw elements and highlights of their report, I didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or to cry.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s wait for the white paper from Lagos State government; I will like to see how Lagos State will not prosecute people who were involved in the cover-up and how they prosecute people who refused to appear in a judicial panel.\n\n\u201cIn the United States Capitol incident, five people died, only one was a bullet wound, the others were natural causes.\n\n\u201cHere, many people died and we know that. My advice to who is in charge of justice is to rise; this is your moment, stand up and be counted.\n\n\u201cThe judicial panel has stood up and we must clap for them, I advise the youths in the #EndSARS protest to channel their anger at the next elections in two years and not to the judicial panel report.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Themed; \u201cAccess to Diabetes Care; If Not Now, When?\u201d\n\nWorld Diabetes Day is celebrated globally every 14th of November.\n\nOne of the speakers at the event was a Professor of Endocrinology at the College of Medicine, University of Lagos, Olufemi Fasanmade.\n\nThe don advised Nigerians to be more active, keep slim and fit as a way to remain healthy.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nProf Fasanmade said: \u201cThe first thing to do is to move; it\u2019s very cheap.\u201d\n\nHe warned that sedentary activity is as deadly as smoking or drinking.\n\nHe advised people to take advantage of the step counter which is available on many smartphones and which measures the number of steps one takes daily.\n\nFasanmade said: \u201cWe should make about 10,000 steps per day to keep hypertension, diabetes and cancer away. So you can do three in one; physical activity.\u201d\n\nThe endocrinologist notes that only a small percentage of people who are diabetic manifest symptoms.\n\nHe listed some of the symptoms of the condition to include passing \u201cplenty\u201d of urine, poor vision, poor erection, poor stamina, poor obstetric history including miscarriages and stillbirth, and itching on the skin.\n\nHe advised people living with protruding tummies to \u201cchange your lifestyle. If you have a protruding tummy, you have a high risk of diabetes. Watch what you eat and drink. It is not poverty that makes a person look slim.\u201d\n\nWhile raising alarm that diabetes can affect all age groups including children, the professor advised people to go for checkups, \u201cThe simple way to do this is to check your own blood sugar in a laboratory whether or not you have diabetes.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, Lifestyle Medicine Physician, Dr. Chinasa Amadi, said \u201cWith recent statistics predicting that one in 10 children born after the year 2000 will develop type 2 diabetes, there is no better time than today to begin advocacy.\n\nShe outlined some risk factors like unhealthy dietary habits, cigarettes, older age, physical inactivity, obesity, and family history of diabetes.\n\nAmadi added: \u201cWe need to go back to the basics \u2013 plant-based foods, our local foods, cooked not canned and processed.\u201d\n\nWith diabetes described as a chronic disease according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), Diabetes Product Manager Mega Lifesciences, Ibukun Adetuyi cited that in 2019, diabetes was the ninth leading cause of death with an estimated 1.5 million deaths directly caused by diabetes.\n\nShe, therefore, urged Nigerians to take their health seriously.\n\n\u201cAccording to WHO, a healthy diet, regular physical activity, maintaining a normal body weight and avoiding tobacco use are ways to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Managing Director, Mega Lifesciences, Manesh Mehra, shared the vision of the firm \u2013 to take free screenings to communities and smaller towns across the nation to help them stay healthy.\n\nMehra said \u201cWe want to take medical outreach and quality education about the diabetes and its complications and lifestyle.

So, there will be no need for them to travel long distances to get pasture since the seasonal migration poses serious security risks and exposes them to economic loss,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Registrar, who is the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Nigerian Institute of Animal Science, Prof. Eustace Ayemere Iyayi, said the endeavour would help in meeting the increasing demand for fodder.\n\nProf. Iyayi explained that the institute would use irrigation and rain-fed pasture production techniques to develop the four hectares it received.\n\nManaging Director of Kano State Agricultural and Rural Development Agency\u2019s (KSADP\u2019s) executing agency, Dr Junaidu Yakubu Muhammad, promised that the state government would create the enabling environment for a mutually rewarding and sustainable partnership with the Nigerian Institute of Animal Science.",

          "text": "By Beifoh Osewele, Wilfred Eya, Chinelo Obogo, Romanus Okoye, Chukwudi Nweje, Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye and Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja\n\nThe ghost of #EndSARS, the popular movement organised by youths across the country to protest police brutality, has come to the fore, over one year after, following the release of report of probe panel report in Lagos.\n\nGovernor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, had, on October 19, 2020, inaugurated the Judicial Panel of Inquiry to investigate alleged cases of brutality and human rights violations perpetrated by the police and operatives of the dissolved Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS). The panel was also saddled with the investigation of the alleged shootings that took place on October 20, 2020, at the Lekki Tollgate.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nOn Monday, the Justice Doris Okuwobi-led panel submitted its report, stating that the armed forces shot and killed protesters at Lekki Toll Gate in Lagos last year.\n\nThe report accused Nigerian Army officers of having \u201cshot, injured and killed unarmed helpless and defenseless protesters, without provocation or justification while they were waving the Nigerian flag and singing the national anthem and the manner of assault and killing could, in context, be described as a massacre.\u201d\n\nThe report said nine #EndSARS protesters were killed while security operatives at the scene reportedly prevented ambulances from reaching injured demonstrators.\n\nWhile the US government said it was watching to see how governments would handle the report, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), elder statesman and leader of Afenifere, Chief Ayo Adebanjo and others said the report has proved that innocent Nigerian youths were actually killed.\n\nReacting in a statement, yesterday, the United States said it \u201cwelcomed the conclusion of the panel\u2019s report\u201d and was looking forward to \u201csuitable measures\u201d the Federal Government would take on allegations of abuses against some security agents indicted in the Lagos #EndSARS panel report.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to the Lagos State government\u2019s response as part of a process that represents an important mechanism of accountability regarding the #EndSARS protests and the events that took place near the Lekki Toll Gate on October 20, 2020.\n\n\u201cThose events led to serious allegations against some members of the security forces, and we look forward to the Lagos State and Federal Government\u2019s taking suitable measures to address those alleged abuses as well as the grievances of the victims and their families.\u201d\n\nPDP, in a statement by Kola Ologbondiyan, urged Nigerians to stand for the slain youths by insisting that those behind the Lekki toll gate killing are prosecuted.\n\n\u201cThe report of the Lagos EndSARS panel, which confirms the massacre of Nigerian youths in Lekki, has further shown the APC and its government as bloody liars whose hands are stained with the blood of our innocent compatriots.\n\n\u201cOf course, all those whose hands have become blood stained will never know peace.\n\n\u201cThe nation must ensure that such individuals are brought to book for their act of wickedness to humanity,\u201d the party said.\n\nAdebanjo, who described the Minister of information, Lai Mohammed, as a liar for claiming that nobody died, said the development has shown that the Federal Government tells a lot of lies to the public.\n\n\u201cYou and I knew that people were killed at Lekki, but the Federal Government said nobody was killed. We are finished in this country. Is it not the same Lekki that the Minister of Works, Babatunde Fashola, talked about recovering a camera which was planted at the toll gate?\u201d\n\nThe former governor, who had visited the state last year to assess the extent of damage caused by hoodlums, \u201cspotted\u201d a camcorder, which he handed over to a government official. The viral footage of the recovery trended for weeks on the social media with many commentators doubting Fashola\u2019s claims.\n\nThis is as Mr. Femi Falana, senior advocate and interim chair, Alliance on Surviving COVID-19 and Beyond (ASCAB), said Lagos State government was duty bound to implement the recommendations of the panel even as he said it deserved commendation for the thorough investigation of police brutality in Lagos State.\n\n\u201cA certified copy of the report of the panel should be forwarded to President Muhammadu Buhari in view of the recommendation that the soldiers and police personnel who engaged in the torture and reckless murder of citizens be sanctioned.\n\n\u201cHaving received the report of the judicial commission, the Lagos State government is urged to accelerate the issuance of the White Paper as well as the implementation of the far reaching recommendations. The policemen who were killed by criminal elements during the protests should be honoured, notwithstanding that their family members have been compensated by the Lagos State Government. However, as police brutality has continued unabated, we call on the government to set up the Lagos State Human Rights Committee in line with the recommendation of the Panel. This was part of the unanimous resolutions of the members of the National Economic Council.\u201d\n\nFormer deputy national chairman of the PDP, Chief Olabode George, urged Governor Sanwo-Olu to apologise to Nigerians for the killing of defenseless protesters.\n\nGeorge said, during a press conference in Lagos, that, as the chief security officer of the state, the governor should take responsibility for what happened. He also advised the governor against reopening the toll gate.\n\n\u201cThe members of the panel acted well and have changed my mindset about the country. It is gladdening that we still have credible people. It was not just one person, it was a panel that sat and their names will be written in gold that they told the truth. They listened for months to testimonies and went through throve of evidence and wrote the report the way they saw it. The younger generation will read the report and judge the panel well, so I want to congratulate them.\n\n\u201cSanwo-Olu should know that he has a family name behind him both from his mother and his father\u2019s sides and that the truth has already been told. He should be straight with himself and his government and take the appropriate actions. To err is human and to forgive is divine. If he reads the document from the panel and make amends and apologise to the people of the state, that would be great. Lives were lost. He should read that document, make amends and apologise to the people of the state.\n\n\u201cThe killings that happened took place under Sanwo-Olu\u2019s watch. I was a governor and I left in 1990, and I have been in and out of leadership. If I had misbehaved, will I have the nerves to go into politics and talk to people? Sanwo-Olu is from an honorable family and, even if people are pushing him to reopen the toll gate, he should know that the truth about what happened there is already in the open,\u201d he said.\n\nA former deputy governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and presidential aspirant of the African Democratic Congress (ADC) for 2023 elections, Kingsley Moghalu, in a statement personally signed, said individuals in the Army and the Police who gave the unlawful orders for the extrajudicial killings, as well as those who pulled the trigger, must pay for their crimes with prosecution and imprisonment.\n\n\u201cAs I said when the news of the killings broke to the world, these are violations of international humanitarian law in addition to national laws. This was mass murder and attempted mass murder, pure and simple. The perpetrators must not go free, and adequate restitution, which also is within the mandate of the judicial panel, must be made to all the protesters who were murdered in cold blood, injured or assaulted.\u201d\n\nAlso, human rights activist, Malachy Ugwummadu, said the report reinforced the first-hand account of the Nigerian youths who insisted that their colleagues were unlawfully and extrajudicially murdered by the Nigerian law enforcement agencies.\n\n\u201cThe local and international media centres and organisations including CNN, BBC and even Amnesty International that held the view that Nigerians were unlawfully killed stand vindicated today.\n\n\u201cMoving forward, victims and relatives of victims of these illegal and callous violence can pursue further legal redress including the enforcement of the fundamental rights of their relations in our regular High Courts. I personally pursued a case on behalf of a victim before the panel and got compensation but that was on behalf of a living victim.\u201d\n\nSecretary General of CNPP, Chief Willy Ezeugwu, expressed happiness that the panel report was out and observed that it has proved yet again that Nigerians are dealing with a government that is not sincere with the citizenry.\n\n\u201cMinister of Information, Lai Mohammed, should resign with immediate effect. He has so much tarnished the image of the country. The government has been trying to cover up what happened at the Lekki Toll Gate but the truth has come out. With this report, the international community will now know that what Nigerians are saying is true,\u201d he said.\n\nExecutive Director of Rule of Law and Accountability Centre, Mr. Okechukwu Nwanguma, thanked the panel for demonstrating the highest level of courage and patriotism in dealing with the massacre and urged the White Paper Committee to ensure that they do not water down the key issues in the report.\n\nHe said those found culpable should be punished to serve as a deterrence to what has become a habit of soldiers and policemen shooting protesters.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nFormer president Goodluck Jonathan has said Nigeria is still grappling with the consequences of poor management of the country\u2019s diversity and differences.\n\nJonathan, who spoke at the second Igbo Nsukka Zik Annual Merit Award 2021 in Abuja, yesterday, appealed to Nigerians to focus on the factors threatening the realisation of Azikiwe\u2019s dream regarding integration, national unity and economic emancipation.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\n\u201cI believe the ideals, philosophy and wisdom of Azikiwe are very relevant now, as we seek to chart a way forward for our beloved country, at this particular time in our nationhood. The nation owes Azikiwe a debt of gratitude. His outstanding role while working with other great nationalists to secure the independence we enjoy today was legendary.\n\n\u201cNigerians of different generations will continue to remember his extraordinary efforts towards keeping Nigeria one, and his belief in Nigeria\u2019s greatness anchored on equity, justice and inclusion.\n\n\u201cAn indigene of Eastern Nigeria, born in Northern Nigeria and established in Western Nigeria, Azikiwe had a cosmopolitan life experience and disposition that prepared him for his role in the society.\n\n\u201cThis enabled him to envision a progressive Nigeria, whose diverse tribes and tongue would blend to produce a great nation to lead the rest of Africa.\n\n\u201cWhether as a political leader, author, journalist and media owner, Zik was sincere in his consistent rhetoric about freedom and economic emancipation. He spent most of his life fighting for the progress of this country and the well-being of her people.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, a thing of great significance that this group: Igbo Nsukka United Front, chose this very special day to evoke the nationalist spirit and principles of Azikiwe and restore to our consciousness, those ideals that raised our optimism about a cohesive and peaceful nation.\n\n\u201cA nation that would draw its strength in ethnic tolerance and accommodation and project to the world the beauty of unity in diversity.\n\n\u201cIn those early days, Azikiwe never minced words on his belief and optimism in the great potential of our uniquely diverse society. He lived and died for one Nigeria, believing that what binds us is greater and more beneficial than what divides us as a people.\n\n\u201cWhile most political pundits insist the potential for Nigeria\u2019s greatness remains potent, our nation has continued, since independence, to grapple with the consequences of poor management of our diversity and differences.\n\n\u201cRecently, I addressed another forum where I delivered a paper entitled: \u2018Redefining Democracy: Yearnings of the Minority in a Democratic Setting\u2019, which dealt extensively on Nigeria\u2019s diversity and minority rights.\n\n\u201cIn that discourse, I made the point that our inability to manage our diversity is a major stumbling block to our socio-economic development as a nation.\n\n\u201cWhen I convened the 2014 national conference as president, my intention was to create an environment that would enable our citizens to dispassionately address those issues that are pushing us towards divisive politics and sowing the seeds of discord in our polity.\n\nSpeaking while proposing a toast, former governor of Anambra State, Chukwuemeka Ezeife, lamented that Nigeria is not the dream of Azikiwe even as he noted that there was still a glimpse of hope.\n\n\u201cThis is certainly not the Nigeria of Zik\u2019s dream. He will not be happy with the monumental failure we are seeing today. I, however, believe it is not a hopeless situation. There is still hope and bright future for a new Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, George Obiozor, enumerated what Zik would have done in the present day Nigeria.\n\nRepresented by the group\u2019s National Publicity Secretary, Chiedozie Alex Ogbonnia, he said if Zik were alive, he would convinced President Muhammadu Buhari to view the South East through the same lens as those that voted for him en masse during the 2015 and 2019 general elections.\n\n\u201cIf Zik were alive, he would have invited all the serving governors, senators, National Assembly members, ministers, the clergy, the business moguls, youth leaders, women groups and other social movements in the South East with a view to addressing the Igbo needs in Nigeria.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "\u2022Says there\u2019s strong synergy between monetary and fiscal authorities\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja and Nume Ekeghe in Lagos\n\nThe Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, has revealed that the central bank has so far disbursed about N3 trillion to households, small and medium scale enterprises (SMEs), smallholder farmers, pharmaceutical companies as buffer against the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nSpeaking in an exclusive interview with Arise Television on the sidelines of the recently-concluded Nigerian International Partnership Forum in Paris, France, Emefiele noted that the insinuation that the CBN was overreaching its statutory bounds, was baseless, explaining that the bank had continued to play its monetary management role effectively.\n\nHe also reiterated that the monetary and fiscal authorities were working hand in hand to deliver a stronger economy to Nigerians.\n\nEmefiele pointed out that the job of the CBN was to complement the efforts of the fiscal side, emphasising that it had never happened in the country where the central bank would lend funds for a tenure of 10 years with a two-year moratorium, like the CBN had done in recent times.\n\n\u201cAnd I can tell you this, between 2020 and now, our data shows that we have disbursed at least N2 trillion, almost N3 trillion in loans to households, to MSMEs, to smallholder farmers, to pharmaceuticals and health institutions.\n\n\u201c We have also given these funds to some of our large agricultural companies that want to get back again to business, to manufacturing companies who are accessing long term 10 years loan with two-year moratorium with single digit rate. I have data that shows we are playing our part,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the recently launched \u201c100 for 100 \u201c, he noted that it was floated to support employment creation, assuring that the central bank would do everything possible to provide foreign exchange to import plants and machinery.\n\nHe added that the programme would complement the plan by President Muhammadu Buhari to create millions of jobs and make credit available at a cheap rate even for a long tenure.\n\n\u201cIn terms of the prerequisites, at least 80 per cent of the employees within these new corporate entities would have to be Nigerian,\u201d Emefiele insisted.\n\nHe added, \u201cWe know that people would like to play some games but I can assure you that the central bank has the resources to monitor.\n\n\u201cEven our current intervention programmes, whether in agriculture or in manufacturing, those who have accessed those facilities will tell you that at least twice a year, our people go to check and investigate to know whether those projects have been set up and are meeting their objective.\u201d\n\nHe maintained that the insinuations that there was no alignment between Nigeria\u2019s fiscal and monetary policies were baseless, stressing that on Covid-19 for instance, the CBN had been working with the finance ministry to reduce the devastating impact.\n\n\u201cIf you ask the Finance Minister, we are always in contact and she would tell you that there are no issues about the relationship between the monetary and fiscal authority. So, when people say there is no synergies, again, I wonder where that is coming from.\n\n\u201cWhen the COVID-19 hit, Mr. President tasked the Finance Minister and I to work together to bring us an immediate response and I went back to the Bankers\u2019 Committee and we came up with immediate response.\n\n\u201cAnd the Minister of Finance and I had opportunities several times to go back to brief the president. So, it is left for you to respond whether there is collaboration between monetary and fiscal authority there.\n\n\u201cAfter that, the president said we should establish the Economic Sustainability Program (ESP) chaired by the Vice President. The central bank played an active part in the development of that program to the extent that the fiscal authorities were only meant to contribute N500 billion and monetary authorities were left to provide almost about N1.5 trillion,\u201d he added.\n\nHe expressed joy that Nigeria now produces and consumes its own rice, stressing that the wheat programme had also taken off with expected yield very encouraging.\n\nHe stated that Nigeria would not be a guinea pig for cryptocurrency use, saying the CBN has now launched its own digital currency which is safer and more secure than crypto.\n\nEmefiele stated that with e-naira, some payment products that were costly, will be reduced forcing the banks to review their processes, saying that Nigeria will not make its platforms available for crypto. \u201cWhy is it encrypted. It means that there\u2019s level of illegality associated with it,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe argued that no country with high level financial standards endorse cryptocurrency, insisting that \u201cwe will not allow it to happen.\u201d\n\nEmefiele disclosed that he was always in contact with the minister of finance, budget and economic planning, insisting that there are no issues concerning the relationship between the monetary and fiscal authorities. \u201cSo, when people say there is no synergy, again, I wonder where that is coming from,\u201d he said.\n\nThe CBN governor added that the current administration would continue to focus on the provision of infrastructure and deliver legacy project.\n\n\u201cBy the time we sit back after we have left this job and we see it doing well, we would thank God we had an opportunity to serve our country,\u201d he noted.\n\nAccording to the CBN helmsman, it was high time Nigeria stopped relying on an economy that depends on oil.\n\n\u201cWe must diversify the economy into the non-oil sectors. We must deepen our economy so that we can truly position ourselves as a country that is self-sufficient,\u201d he explained.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Peterside flays lies\n\n\u2022Falana calls for implementation of report\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja, Chiemelie Ezeobi in Lagos, and Adibe Emenyonu in Benin City\n\nThe just-released report of the Judicial Panel of Inquiry (JPI) on the Lagos #EndSARS protests last year has continued to generate interest within and outside the country, with the United Nations (UN) and the United States (U.S.) yesterday calling on both the federal and Lagos State governments to ensure the implementation of the White Paper on the report.\n\nThe UN, in a statement yesterday by its Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria, Edward Kallon, urged the country to carry out a thorough execution of the recommendations of the judicial panel to rebuild trust and start the process of healing and reconciliation in the aftermath of the events of October 20, 2020.\n\nFounder of Stanbic IBTC Bank Plc and renowned economist, Mr. Atedo Peterside, yesterday took a swipe at the government for denying the Lekki Tollgate killings, insisting that no country can make progress when it is led by people he described as \u201cprominent liars.\u201d Peterside spoke during a programme on Arise Television, THISDAY\u2019s broadcast arm.\n\nIn a similar tone, human tights activist and lawyer, Mr. Femi Falana (SAN), said Lagos State was duty-bound to implement the report of the judicial panel of inquiry. Falana, who is Interim Chair of the Alliance on Surviving COVID-19 and Beyond (ASCAB), stated that the report had exposed the official lie that the brutal killings were a figment of the protesters\u2019 imaginations.\n\nHowever, Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), General Lucky Irabor, said on Tuesday in Benin City that only a White Paper from the #EndSARS judicial panel\u2019s report could be the basis for informed comment.\n\nBut Corporate Accountability and Public Participation Africa (CAPPA) demanded the institution of criminal prosecution against those indicted in the #ENDSARS report. The civil society group said this in a statement by its Director of Programmes, Philip Jakpor.\n\nThe judicial panel led by Justice Doris Okuwobi (rtd) had on Monday submitted a 309-page report to the Lagos State governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, which indicted the army, police, and the Lekki Concession Company (LCC) for various crimes, ranging from killing innocent protesters to trying to conceal evidence.\n\nThe federal and Lagos State governments had at various times maintained that there were no deaths at the Lekki tollgate, effectively absolving themselves of any blames in the October 20, 2020 incident.\n\nHowever, the panel of inquiry said 48 casualties were recorded at the tollgate, including 11 deaths, several missing persons, and many injured persons. It said 96 other corpses were presented to it by a Forensic Pathologist, Professor John Obafunwa.\n\nA statement yesterday by the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria said the submission of the report of the judicial panel was a welcome development. He stated that the submission of the findings of the panel would accelerate the process of justice and accountability for those impacted by the incident.\n\n\u201cI urge the government to implement the recommendations of the judicial panel of inquiry to rebuild trust and start the process of healing and reconciliation,\u201d Kallon added.\n\nIn a similar release yesterday, the U.S. government called for accountability in the implementation of the JPI report. It urged the Lagos State government and the federal government to take appropriate steps to address the alleged abuses.\n\nThe U.S. government said the report seriously indicted some members of the country\u2019s security apparatus, stating that it is eagerly awaiting the response of government at the state and federal levels to the document.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cThe United States welcomes the conclusion of the Lagos State Judicial Panel of Inquiry with the transmission of its final report. We look forward to the Lagos State government\u2019s response as part of a process that represents an important mechanism of accountability regarding the #EndSARS protests and the events that took place near the Lekki Tollgate on October 20, 2020.\n\n\u201cThose events led to serious allegations against some members of the security forces, and we look forward to the Lagos State and federal governments taking suitable measures to address those alleged abuses as well as the grievances of the victims and their families.\u201d\n\nPeterside said on Arise Television that Nigerian youth now had a chance to channel their anger and energies to make a statement in the 2023 general election by ensuring only credible persons run the affairs of the country henceforth.\n\nAccording to the businessman, to ensure peace and unity in Nigeria, justice and truth must be critical principles guiding both the leaders and the followers.\n\n\u201cA nation that prominent liars are at the front will not make any progress and it becomes very dangerous because even when they are trying to tell the truth, nobody believes them,\u201d he stated.\n\nPeterside insisted that it was laughable that someone could sit in Abuja and confidently deny what occurred at the Lekki Tollgate, when those at the scene of the killings gave first-hand accounts of what transpired.\n\nHe stated, \u201cIt is tempting to laugh at those in government who came out and started making all kinds of wild statements. Why would somebody who was in Abuja be making statements about what happened and did not happen in Lekki when the named soldiers who were in Lekki have refused to open their mouths to say anything in front of a judicial panel?\n\n\u201cMy assumption as a lay person is that the person who was on a crime scene knows that if he goes to a judicial panel and takes an oath and they ask him, did you or did you not kill somebody? Who did you shoot? He could be in trouble.\n\n\u201cSo, if that person is running away, I expect others to have the wisdom to say, hang on a second, don\u2019t ask me any questions, go and ask those who were at the scene.\u201d\n\nPeterside described officials who pushed a contrary narrative on the incident as \u201coverzealous people in government\u201d making hasty conclusions. But he commended the panel members for their courage and forthrightness.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, we have some heroes from this exercise and it\u2019s at such moments that nations get formed. If there was no Lekki Tollgate, there are many things that may never happen in this country,\u201d he stated, cautioning the Lagos State government against shielding security operatives and government officials indicted by the report.\n\nAccording to Peterside, \u201cThe Lekki Tollgate incident of October 20, 2020 may well be an important tipping point. Let\u2019s wait for the White Paper from the Lagos State government. But from the little we all saw, and we\u2019ve got brains, I would like to see how the Lagos State government would not prosecute people who were involved in the cover-up. And we want to see how Lagos State Government will not prosecute the people who refused to appear before a judicial panel.\u201d\n\nPeterside also urged the Lagos State Ministry of Justice to rise up to its responsibility, pointing out that Nigeria will not change until people stand up and do the right thing. \u201cThe judicial panel has stood up and we must clap for them,\u201d he noted.\n\nHe added, \u201cThe governor of Lagos State must meet its own obligations and, like I told the youth during the #EndSARS, yes, you are angry and this judicial panel report might make you even angrier because the evidence is there that people were lying.\n\n\u201cBut that anger should be channelled at something and it should be channelled towards the next election which is in 15 months\u2019 time.\u201d\n\nFalana said, in a statement, that a certified copy of the report of the panel should be forwarded to President Muhammadu Buhari in view of the recommendation that the soldiers and police personnel who engaged in the torture and reckless murder of citizens be sanctioned.\n\nHe urged the Lagos State government to accelerate the issuance of the White Paper as well as the implementation of the far-reaching recommendations. The human rights activist also said the policemen who were killed by criminal elements during the protests should be honoured, notwithstanding that the Lagos State government had compensated their family members.\n\nHe stated, \u201cHowever, as police brutality has continued unabated, we call on the government to set up the Lagos State Human Rights Committee in line with the recommendation of the panel. This was part of the unanimous resolutions of the members of the National Economic Council (NEC).\u201d\n\nFalana commended the witnesses and their lawyers for exposing what he termed \u201cthe official cover-up of the egregious human rights abuse perpetrated by the merchants of death\u201d. He called on the Lagos State government to designate venues where aggrieved citizens could hold rallies in exercise of their fundamental rights to freedom of assembly and expression.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe violent attack of unarmed protesters during peaceful rallies by police and military personnel should be completely outlawed since Section 83 (4) of the Police Establishment Act, 2020 has imposed a duty on the police to provide adequate security for citizens who participate in peaceful meetings and rallies.\u201d\n\nBut the CDS said only a White Paper could for the basis for comment on the #EndSARS panel report. He assured, however, that the Nigerian Armed Forces remained committed to their professional calling of protecting the territorial integrity of the country. Irabor cautioned Nigerians against inciting comments on happenings across the country.\n\nSpeaking to journalists shortly after a courtesy visit to Governor Godwin Obaseki at Government House, Irabor said the operations of the armed forces should not be compared to that of the police, adding that his men and women remain professionals.\n\nIrabor, who was on a familiarisation visit to military formations in Edo State, said, \u201cI am sure those of you in the media must have seen that there is a report that was released, though, in my view, a wrong channel that is making the rounds in the social media.\n\n\u201cWhether it is a true report, I can\u2019t tell but I would like to indicate that the normal procedure is to have such a report submitted to the conventional authority and then there will be a White Paper based on which one can make informed comments.\n\n\u201cBut whatever you see currently, I will like to indicate that the armed forces of Nigeria is professional, we are peopled by Nigerians and we remain committed to constitutional mandates. So we do not at this point think that Nigerians should make disparaging remarks regarding the armed forces of Nigeria in the sense that we are professional armed forces and if there are issues, of course, we address them within the ambit of the provision.\n\n\u201cIt will not be right to disparage men and women who have worked so hard to ensure that the territorial integrity of this nation is kept intact. So in the meantime, until I see the full report, I may not be able to\u2026\n\n\u201cBut I can assure you that the armed forces of Nigeria are well disciplined and we do not engage in any ignoble acts.\n\n\u201cIf Nigerians don\u2019t trust us, then we wouldn\u2019t have been doing what we are doing and in any case, it is the armed forces of Nigeria and remember, we are not talking about the police, we are talking about the armed forces, with emphasis, armed forces, so when the armed forces are called out, it is because there is a need for the armed forces; there is no one who do not require and desire to live in peace. We need to understand that the armed forces is there to keep the peace, to provide the ambience that will enable each and every Nigerian to live up to his desires in peace and harmony.\n\n\u201cLet us not make inciting comments that will put the entire space on fire, that is not right.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Obaseki lauded the CDS for his efforts at improving security in the country. Obaseki sought the collaboration and support of the defence chief in the effort to eliminate bandits and other criminals from Edo forests.\n\nThe governor told Irabor, \u201cYou are one person that we are very proud of; apart from being a well-decorated officer, in a short while, you have taken charge of the defense functions through your network. We have been watching with admiration the way you are coping and thriving with the very difficult challenge of stabilising the security of this country.\u201d\n\nObaseki added, \u201cWe have been able to record quite a lot of success in relation to what is going on in the rest of the country. We have some challenges and we would like you to support us. We are currently experiencing problems in some of our forests, particularly the Okomu axis, which borders the Ose River.\n\n\u201cWe find bandits and criminals coming there to undertake massive logging of woods and transport them; they now buy arms to reinforce their activities there. I am glad you came with all the men in the navy to see how you can give us additional support to patrol the waterways to checkmate the activities of these criminals.\u201d\n\nHe further noted, \u201cIn the last couple of weeks, we have found lifeless bodies in the forest, which is now a den for cultivation of cannabis. We would like to work with the military to root out these criminals.\n\n\u201cWe want to assure you that you can always count on us in Edo to help in working with you to stabilise the security situation in this country.\u201d\n\nCAPPA, in its statement, recounted that the panel sat for over a year before submitting its findings to the Lagos State government on November 15, after establishing the fact that the Nigerian Army, led by Lieutenant Colonel Bello, was at Lekki Gate on October 20, 2020, and further described the event of that day as a \u2018\u2019massacre in a context\u2019\u2019.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cPart of the recommendations of the panel included that all men of the Nigerian Army, excluding Major General Omata, that were deployed to the Lekki Toll Gate on October 20, 2020, should be made to face appropriate disciplinary action and, or stripped of their status and dismissed, while disciplinary actions should be taken against Major General Godwin Umelo and Lt. Col S.O. Bello, who refused to honour the summons of the panel in order to frustrate the investigation.\n\n\u201cThe panel indicted Nigerian Army officers of having \u2018shot\u2019, injured and killed unarmed helpless and defenceless protesters, without provocation or justification, while they were waving the Nigerian Flag and singing the national anthem and the manner of assault and killing could in context be described as a massacre.\u201d\n\n\u201cDespite an abundance of evidence which includes testimonials and visuals, the Nigerian government continued to deny that protesters were shot and killed. Minister of Information, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, even went as far as describing the Lekki incident as a \u2018phantom massacre\u2019.\u201d\n\nIn is reaction, CAPPA\u2019s Executive Director, Akinbode Oluwafemi said the events of October 20, 2020 were a sad commentary on the country.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe findings of the judicial panel that the Lagos State government received is what we confirmed long ago and documented in our report Lies and the Hail of Bullets.\u201d\n\nOluwafemi pointed out that in the face of undeniable atrocities perpetrated by Nigerian security forces the Nigerian government and their image-makers walked the lonely road of woeful denial, adding, \u201cwhat we are now demanding is justice for the victims.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe report both in print and video documentary format was accompanied by a follow-up letter by CAPPA to the United Nations, office of the High Commissioner and the International Criminal Court, urging both bodies to act and investigate the incident.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "NNPC Gets $1bn Boost from Afreximbank, Sees Oil at $100pb",
          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) yesterday signed a five-year agreement worth $1.04 billion with the African Export\u2013Import Bank (Afreximbank), in a deal that has been described as the biggest so far at the ongoing Intra-African Trade Fair in Durban, South Africa.\n\nThis is just as the Group Managing Director of the NNPC, Mallam Mele Kyari yesterday predicted that crude oil prices may hit $100 per barrel mark in the coming months as global inventory tightens and the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) continues to resist pressure to pump more oil into the market.\n\nIn terms of the NNPC and Afreximbank deal, it was gathered that it did not involve exploration of crude oil, but mainly for trade financing and export of the crude produced by the national oil company, although details still remained sketchy last night.\n\nArise News Channel reported that the $1.04 billion would be repaid to the continental bank with about 25,000bpd of crude oil produced by the state oil company.\n\nIt quoted the President of the bank, Benedict Oramah, as saying that the deal would benefit Nigeria, promising to fund similar projects across Africa.\n\nThe bank also signed a $250 million contract with an aviation logistics company, Blue Horn, to fund the upgrading of three airports in Nigeria and another $270 deal for oil exploration activities with Mars E&P.\n\nThe Intra-African Trade Fair (IATF2021) kicked off on 15th November with the the theme: \u201cBuilding Bridges for a successful AfCFTA\u201d, and has so far attracted thousands of visitors to the Durban International Convention Centre where it\u2019s taking place.\n\nMeanwhile, speaking on Bloomberg Television, Kyari also raised doubts about the ability of the producers\u2019 group to ramp up production in the short term as investment in the industry continues to wane.\n\nOPEC has continued to stick with its agreed plan since July, to release an additional supply of 400, 000 barrels every month to gradually return the cuts it embarked upon in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic last year, despite promptings from the United States, India, Japan and other countries to supply more barrels.\n\nCurrently, the global oil market has a deficit of over 600,000 bpd, a development that has led to increase in oil and gas prices and bringing along attendant inflationary pressures.\n\nDespite the over 1.6 million bpd allocated to Nigeria in September and October, the country was only to supply 1.399 million bpd and 1.354 million barrels in September and October respectively on the back of weak infrastructure and sabotage.\n\nSpeaking further, Kyari argued that the plan by the United States to release oil from its special reserves has to be very significant to make any long-term impact on global oil prices, explaining that although Nigeria has faltered in meeting its OPEC allocation, by the end of the year, the country may be able to hit 1.8 million bpd, excluding condensates.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very obvious that by the close of the year, we will get back to the 1.7 barrels to 1.8 barrels per day of crude oil. When I mention this figure, I am only talking about crude oil because we also produce condensates and when you combine, we can easily hit 2.0 million barrels by the end of the year,\u201d he stressed.\n\nThe GMD reiterated that Nigeria was hugely impacted by its inability to restart the oil facilities after the COVID-19-induced shutdowns, emphasising that with the fresh clarity around the fiscal environment with the introduction of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), more investments were being expected in the country\u2019s oil and gas industry.\n\n\u201cThe fact is very clear, during the covid-19 pandemic, we shut down some of these wells and they usually don\u2019t come back as early as we want them.\n\n\u201cRight now, we do have some challenges around the facilities and these are being taken care of. There\u2019s enormous work going on that will get us back before the end of the year.\n\n\u201cThere was some level of lack of clarity in our own fiscal environment and this is being sorted out by the passage of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) . And the meaning of this is that we are seeing very good traction with our key partners in the deep offshore asset development,\u201d he mentioned.\n\nHe said the proposed release of the United States of oil from its special reserve could have some marginal impact on global oil prices, since supply is not matching demand, but added that the release has to be really significant to make any difference.\n\n\u201cOf course, it\u2019s going to dampen prices for a little while, but because demand is growing and several economies are recovering, it may not be enough or sufficient to create that change that we expect. That means that we still see a situation of $80 in time to come.\u201d Kyari said.\n\nProbed further, he noted that if a situation arises when the United States bans export of its crude, prices would likely remain in the $80s, but less than $100, adding that $100 was still within sight.\n\n\u201cThat is too ambitious. $200 is too ambitious. $100 looks like it, I don\u2019t see a situation of $100 plus in the short term,\u201d he stated.\n\nKyari stated that a number of issues, including financing, inability to quickly fill the oil supply deficit were responsible for OPEC\u2019s defiance of calls to raise output, saying that it may not be realisable in the short term to pump more oil and fix the existing spare capacity.\n\nOn gas , he said: Yes, we are supplying more gas to Europe, but we are definitely in short supply from LNG because there are a number of issues concerning our gas supply. This is improving and we are taking a number of steps to ensure full production of trains 1-6 of the LNG and focus on train 7.\n\n\u201d For 2022, I see some kind of decline in our ability to supply to the market, but this is being mitigated. I am not sure we will be able to do full catch-up by the end of the year, but clearly, the forecast is about 90 cargoes of LNG to be out of the market, but we are doing everything to bring that number below 58 and that will be quite possible and that means more supply to Europe.\u201d\n\nAs of 2020, an S&P Global document noted that Nigeria LNG exported around 300 cargoes of liquefied natural gas annually from the Bonny plant, representing about 40 per cent of global LNG supplies.\n\nIn the same vein, NLNG\u2019s 6-train LNG facility, which has been in operation since 1999, has delivered over 4,700 LNG cargoes around the world.\n\nKyari noted that the oil and gas industry continues to remain in a state of transition, explaining that gas will play a major role in the energy supply mix in the future.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very obvious that the energy industry is in a huge transition. These are very exciting times. Countries are working very hard to meet the NetZero target in 2050, but some countries cannot make it as early as 2050. But obviously, the oil industry is adjusting, people are facing new realities and of course, the focus is changing.\n\n\u201cPeople are going for more gas development across the globe and also bringing on blue hydrogen. So much is happening and we as a national company see opportunities,\u201d he stressed.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Says report ought to have been submitted to convening authority and white paper issued\n\n*Insists Nigerian armed forces professional\n\n*Cautions Nigerians against making disparaging remarks about armed forces\n\nChief of Defence Staff, General Lucky Irabor, has reacted to the release of the Lagos State Judicial Panel of Inquiry on the ENDSARS protest, saying the report was released through wrong channel.\n\nFielding questions from reporters Tuesday, Gen Irabor said: \u201cI am sure those of you in the media must have seen that there was a report that was released, in my view through a wrong channel, that is making the rounds in the social media. Whether it is a true report, I can\u2019t tell.\n\n\u201cBut I will like to indicate that normal procedure is to have such a report submitted to the convening authority and then there will be a white paper that will be presented on the basis of which one can make informed comments.\u201d\n\nGeneral Irabor said, \u201cWhatever it is currently, I will like to indicate that the Armed Forces of Nigeria is a professional Armed Forces. We are peopled by Nigerians and we remain committed to our constitutional mandate. So, we do not at this point think that Nigerians should make disparaging remarks regarding the Armed Forces of Nigeria in the sense that we are a professional armed forces. If there are issues, of course we will address them within the ambit of the provisions.\u201d\n\nInsisting that it will not be right to disparage men who work so hard to ensure that the territorial integrity of Nigeria is kept in tact. Gen. Irabor said, \u201cIn the meantime, until I see the full extent of the report I may not be able to (comment).

          "title": "Emefiele: CBN Disbursed $3trn Loans to Nigerian Businesses in One Year to Cushion Impact of Covid-19",
          "text": "By Nume Ekeghe in Lagos and Emma Addey in Abuja\n\nGovernor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr Godwin Emefiele, has revealed that the apex bank has so far distributed about $3 trillion to households, Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (SMEs), smallholder farmers, pharmaceutical companies as a buffer against the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nSpeaking in an exclusive interview with Arise TV on the sidelines of the Intra-African Trade Fair, 2021, holding in Durban, South Africa, Emefiele noted that the insinuation that the CBN was overreaching its statutory bounds, was baseless, explaining that the bank had continued to play its monetary role effectively.\n\nHe pointed out that the job of the CBN was to complement the efforts of the fiscal side, emphasising that it had never happened in the country where the bank will lend funds for a tenure of 10 years with a two-year moratorium, like the CBN had done in recent times.\n\n\u201cAnd I can tell you this, between 2020 and now, our data shows that we have disbursed at least N2 trillion, almost N3 trillion in loans to households, to Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, to smallholder farmers, to pharmaceuticals and health institutions.\n\n\u201cWe have also given these funds to some of our large agricultural companies that want to get back again to business, to manufacturing companies who are accessing long term 10 years loan with two-year moratorium with single digit rate. I have data that shows we are playing our part,\u201d he said.\n\nEmefiele also reiterated that the monetary policy and fiscal policy were working hand in hand to grow the economy.\n\nHe noted that with every developmental policy and initiative from the Presidency, the CBN and its fiscal counterpart, the Ministry of Finance, collaborate to achieve set goals.\n\nHe added that the new financial instrument, \u201cThe 100 for 100 PPP \u2013 Policy on Production and Productivity\u201d would aid President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s vision to create 10 million jobs.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf you ask Finance Minister, we are always in contact and she would tell you that there are no issues about the relationship between the Monetary and Fiscal authority. So, when people say there is no synergy, again, I wonder where that is coming from.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen COVID hit, Mr. President tasked the finance minister and I to work together to bring an immediate response and I went back to the Bankers Committee to which we came up with immediate response. And the Minister of Finance and I had opportunities several times to go back to brief the President. So it is left for you to respond whether there is collaboration between monetary and fiscal authority there.\u201d\n\n\u201cSecondly, after that, the President said that we should establish economic sustainability program (ESP) chaired by the Vice President. The central bank played an active part in the development of that program to the extent that the fiscal authorities were only meant to contribute N500 billion and monetary authorities were left to provide almost about N1.5 trillion. Please let me correct this not as grant but as loans to support people who were impacted by COVID-19 so they can get their businesses back.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, he said: \u201cOur job is to compliment and that is why after every why at every opportunity when we hold a monetary policy committee meeting, we read out what we have done to compliment the efforts of the fiscal, and data is there.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, on what the CBN had done to cushion the economic effect of Covid-19 pandemic, he added the bank had disbursed loans close to N3 trillion to household and businesses since 2020.\n\nHe said: \u201cI can\u2019t tell you this, in 2020 till date our data shows that we have disbursed close to at least N3 trillion in loans to households, to micro small and medium enterprises, to smallholder farmers, to pharmaceuticals and health institutions. Also, to some of our larger agricultural companies that want to get back again on to business, to manufacturing companies who are now accessing long term 10-year loans with two year moratorium at single digit rate.\u201d\n\nFurther on the recent \u201c100 for 100\u201d policy, he said: \u201cAgain, the 100 for 100 is another program that came up out of the need to say that we must support more, do everything to create employment for our people. And that\u2019s why if you read the framework, we said employment, we said we must see measurable level of employment that would be provided by that projects.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have to be new projects and the central bank will do everything possible to provide foreign exchange to import plants and machinery. And by the time the plant or machinery are set up, import of raw material would be near zero so that we can begin look at our available local raw material, rather than importing them.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIt is meant again to compliment what Mr. president said that we had to create 10 million jobs in 10 years.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIt is time for Nigeria to stop relying on a country or economy dependent on oil and we must diversify the economy into the non-oil sectors of our economy. We must deepen our economy so that we can truly position ourselves as a country that is self sufficient. Self sufficiency has to do with what we talk about in the economy of import substitution, industrialization, which is produce to feed yourself, and then export.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC), an Islamic rights advocacy group, says Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo loves and accommodates Muslims despite being a Christian and a member of the clergy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe group was reacting to a recent allegation accusing Osinbajo of pursuing a religious agenda by appointing and nominating mostly Christians into government.\n\nIn a statement issued on Wednesday by Ishaq Akintola, MURIC director, the group said it conducted an investigation into the matter and discovered it to be false.\n\nMURIC said the vice-president accommodates Muslims and has appointed about 18 of them into his office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe group said objectivity demands that it speak up for the good Christians who do the right thing.\n\n\u201cBlackmail, character assassination, fake news and disinformation are not in the character of Muslims. It has never been part of us. Hurting the innocent is equally alien to our DNA. Instead of hanging their actions on the necks of their adversaries, Muslims own up when they are the culprits. They prefer to be punished in this world in order to escape from the punishment of the hereafter,\u201d the statement reads.\n\n\u201cIt is our oppressors who always make sure that they are the first to cry out when indeed they are the aggressors. No true Islamic group will engage in mischief, lies, deceit and intrigues. Genuine Islamic groups are transparent. You can read them just as you read a book.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is these characteristics that have been nagging at our conscience since the controversy surrounding the allegation of Christianisation levelled against Vice President Osinbajo began. The great Shaykh Uthman Bin Fudi said \u2018Conscience is like a wound, only truth can heal it. Our conscience was jogged and it is only by telling the world what we know that we can have rest of mind.\n\n\u201cDuring our investigation, we stumbled on an article written by a female Muslim presidential aide in the VP\u2019s office. The article, which surfaced recently on social media, affirmed the presence of 18 Muslim officials in Osinbajo\u2019s office. The onus is on those who accused the VP of Christianisation to prove that some or all of those Muslim names in the VP\u2019s office were fabricated to convince Nigerian Muslims that the VP is neither a hater nor an oppressor of Muslims.\u201d\n\nThe group said it also discovered that one Abdul Rahman Ipaye, a Muslim, is the most senior staff member in the office of the vice-president.\n\n\u201cAn opportunity to confirm one of the claims made in the article defending the VP came our way just by chance and we feel compelled by principle to share the information since we are stakeholders. Nations are built by stakeholders who speak the truth. On the other hand, they are destroyed by those who withhold the same truth,\u201d it said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe opportunity we refer to occurred way back in 2018 or 2019. It provided concrete and undeniable evidence which we witnessed by ourselves as a group and it confirmed that Mr Abdul Rahman Ipaye, a Muslim and a former commissioner in Lagos State who was mentioned in the article as the highest staff in the VP\u2019s office is, indeed, a bona fide staff of Osinbajo.\n\n\u201cMURIC is known for raising its voice against those who oppress Muslims but we do not wish to be known for remaining silent when we see Christians who accommodate Muslims. Objectivity demands that we speak up for the good Christian who accommodates Muslims. This is what we are doing today so that our consciences can rest.\u201d",

          "title": "Jumia records all-time high quarterly orders and unveils its fintech ambition",
          "text": "Yesterday, African e-commerce giant, Jumia, released its earnings report for the third quarter of 2021.\n\nDespite sharing healthy numbers as a result of accelerated growth across core usage KPIs\u2014including orders, annual active customers and gross merchandise volume (GMV)\u2014the markets responded differently with the stock price dropping by 20%.\n\nBefore sharing details of the report, recall that Jumia changed the functional (default) currency of its financial report from euros to dollars in Q2 2021. This will continue into the foreseeable future.\n\nHighlights from the report\n\nJumia\u2019s adjusted EBITDA and operating losses in Q3 2021 went up by 94% and 93% year-over-year, respectively, to $52.5 million and $64 million. This increase in loss was driven by a hike in the company\u2019s investment in sales & advertising and technology.\n\nSales and advertising expenses reached $24.0 million, up 228% year-over-year, while technology and content expenses increased by 27% to $9.4 million. This is a continuation of its return to aggressive advertising which slowed during the pandemic.\n\nCommenting on this result, the company\u2019s Co-CEOs Jeremy Hodara and Sacha Poignonnec said, \u201cWe believe that these investments are long-term in nature and that accelerating growth will ultimately contribute to profitability, leveraging the strong efficiency gains achieved throughout 2020 and the first half of 2021.\u201d\n\nJumia ended the quarter with $185 million in cash and cash equivalents and $399 million in financial assets.\n\nHistoric number of quarterly orders\n\nA major highlight from the report was that orders made on Jumia reached an all-time quarterly high of 8.5 million, representing a 28% year-over-year growth. It\u2019s the fastest growth rate of the past seven quarters, according to the company. Closely related to that, Jumia\u2019s annual active consumers reached 7.3 million and its gross merchandise value (GMV) reached $238 million, both up 8% year-over-year.\n\nIn the third quarter, FMCG inventories overtook fashion inventories as the fastest-growing category in terms of items sold. The former posted the highest ever volume number, almost doubling on a year-over-year basis.\n\nThe second-fastest-growing category was food delivery, growing by almost 40% year-over-year. This category posted its highest ever quarterly volume with over 2 million orders, surpassing the previous record registered in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nJumia noted that it saw growth momentum across all inventory categories, except phones & electronics. The company attributes this slowdown to a global supply disruption, including global chipset shortages.\n\nJumiaPay and its fintech ambition\n\nIn the second quarter, JumiaPay\u2014Jumia\u2019s financial and digital services\u2014posted its largest-ever quarterly GMV processed. The company followed by disclosing in its third-quarter report that JumiaPay processed 36% of all orders on Jumia, a significant feat considering that it competes with numerous payment options. Riding on that wave, JumiaPay has continued to grow as the company expands the range of services available to consumers on JumiaPay App.\n\nIn Nigeria for example, customers are now able to book bus tickets via the JumiaPay App, including a proprietary seat mapping selection that will be rolled out in other markets in the near future. In Egypt, JumiaPay added new consumers, including several universities which students can now pay their tuition fees online via the JumiaPay app as well as a major Arabic content streaming platform, Shahid.\n\nOptimistic about its fintech ambitions for JumiaPay, the company shared a picture of its roadmap. In the near future, it plans to launch payment cards, savings, insurance and \u2018buy now pay later\u2019 offerings to consumers of JumiaPay. For merchants, it\u2019s looking to roll out point of sale, QR Codes, consumer financing, and other offerings.\n\nSource: Jumia\n\nLogistics services\n\nFor its logistics service to third parties, Jumia reached a major milestone by recording $1 million revenue from this service. It delivered 2.9 million packages on behalf of 766 clients, this was a 123% increase on the 1.3 million packages that were delivered in Q2 2021.\n\nThe company also mentioned that it took part in impact initiatives such as Giga, a global initiative to connect every school in Africa to the Internet and every young person to information, opportunity and choice. It also partnered with Solar Taxi, a modern eco-friendly mobility company, to provide an affordable and eco-friendly delivery solution in Ghana.\n\nThe increase in losses incurred by Jumia in the third quarter wasn\u2019t good news to some investors but the company sees it as a necessary path to achieving its goal of profitability and scale.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Shuttlers, a logistics startup out of Lagos, Nigeria, has raised $1.6 million in seed funding to expand into African countries.\n\nThe investment round was led by VestedWorld, a Chicago-and-Africa-based investment firm, with Interswitch, Rising Tide Africa, Launch Africa, EchoVC, CMC 21 & Alsa, ShEquity, Five35, Consonance Investment, CcHub Syndicate, Sakore, and Nikky Taurus also participating in the raise.\n\nWith its new raise, Shuttlers intends to try its wheels in more Nigerian cities before expanding beyond the borders of the country into other African countries.\n\nShuttling Lagos\u2019 transportation system\n\nIn 2016, Damilola Olokesusi founded Shuttlers to tackle the inefficient transportation system in Lagos, Africa\u2019s most populous city. The startup was a tech-enabled bus-sharing company targeted at helping Lagosians commute in comfort at affordable rates.\n\nAt the time, Lagos was a city holding 23 million people and 90% of its transport system was road-based, with semi-formal mini buses or danfos accounting for 45% of trips while walking accounted for 40%. According to the Lagos Metropolitan Transport Authority in 2015, the city alone also accounted for 30% of the total number of road vehicles in Nigeria, with a vehicular density of 234 cars per kilometre.\n\nAlthough Lagos has a number of federal roads, its transport system is epileptic due to the poor nature of some of the roads and the lack of a formal or public transport system which accounts for only 2.5% of the system.\n\nShuttlers\u2019 solution\n\nAt launch, Shuttlers did not have a mobile app.\n\nThe company\u2019s model at the time was messenger-based, using Slack, email and WhatsApp to communicate routes and timelines to its customers. One of their very first clients was Andela, which took advantage of the startup\u2019s B2B2C option to ferry its workers across the state.\n\nBy 2019, Shuttlers revamped to introduce a mobile app where customers could subscribe to any of the three plans available, which includes a B2B where business clients pay the total fares of their employees, and B2C where individual customers pay fares themselves.\n\nPresently, the platform offers additional features including live bus tracking, digital payments and an on-trip menu.\n\nAlthough the company has only managed to raise about $6,000 in angel investments and grants, Shuttlers\u2019 route has been lauded with immense growth as the company claims to have over 10,000 users across its web and mobile-based platforms. With over 100 buses and 300 bus stops in Lagos, Shuttlers also claims to have recorded over 2 million trips since its inception in 2013.\n\nMoving forward\n\nFor CEO Damilola Olokesusi, the raise validates the hard work her team has put in for the past five years. Olokesusi also believes that it\u2019s an encouraging nod for female entrepreneurs in the tech space. \u201cIt shows that women can thrive in any industry they choose, especially tech which is highly male-dominated,\u201d she told TechCabal. \u201cI\u2019m not only a female entrepreneur, I\u2019m a huge supporter of women who are making a difference in their industries. I hope the work I do at Shuttlers inspires women to be daring with their aspirations.\u201d\n\nInvestors are also excited for the future of Shuttlers with Olokesusi at the helm. \u201cWe are very excited to back Damilola in this venture and work alongside a group of committed financial and strategic investors to scale this further,\u201d said Lavanya Anand, Principal at VestedWorld.\n\nSpeaking on the need for Shuttlers and its mission, the CEO emphasized the company\u2019s mission to transform the commuting challenges in African cities. \u201cOur mission at Shuttlers is to transform the way people commute around the world, by building a global partner network and connecting communities of shuttlers like we are presently doing in Lagos, Nigeria. The negative impact of inefficiencies in the mobility space is visible in the quality of life, mental health, and work productivity of commuters. We also see its impact on the more vulnerable and neglected population in our society; women, children, physically challenged, and the elderly. I\u2019m confident that our smart mobility solutions can solve some of these urban mobility challenges sustainably and also reduce carbon emission.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "This week, Africa Health Holdings, a healthcare startup that operates 40 medical facilities across three countries in Africa, said it has secured $18 million Series A funding.\n\nThe funding round was led by Asia Pacific Land and Natural World Limited, with the participation of a number of investors including TRB Advisors, Breyer Capital, M3, Inc., Valiant Capital, Kepple Ventures, and SUNU Capital. According to the startup, it has raised a total of $21 million in funding so far.\n\nAfrica Health Holdings plans to deploy the funds towards building its \u201ctech-forward healthcare system\u201d across the continent. Specifically, it intends to expand its telemedicine service beyond Ghana to Nigeria and Kenya, and scale its network of health facilities.\n\nFounded in 2017 by Sangu Delle, Africa Health Holdings operates in all three African countries under three brands: Meridian Health Group (in Kenya), Rabito Clinic Ltd (in Ghana), and Care Point Hospitals Ltd (in Nigeria).\n\nDelle is a Harvard and Oxford graduate, a TED Fellow, World Economic Forum Young Global Leader, and also the former CEO of Golden Palm Investments, an investment holding company with an interest in early-stage opportunities in Africa.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe founding of Africa Health Holdings was inspired by the need to \u201caddress Africa\u2019s disproportionate share of the global disease burden.\u201d\n\nBorn and raised in Ghana, Delle witnessed the challenges that everyday Ghanaians faced in trying to access quality healthcare: from proximity to medical facilities, availability of doctors and nurses, access to the right medical equipment, prescriptions, and more.\n\n\u201cMy father, a doctor, would often take time away from his private practice to do human rights work, providing healthcare to refugees from Sierra Leone and Liberia,\u201d he said. \u201cThis all had a lasting impact, making me interested above all else, in changing healthcare for the better, across the continent.\u201d\n\nDelle\u2019s first efforts aimed at improving healthcare in Africa came through Golden Palm Investments (GPI). As the former CEO of GPI, he and his team began making healthcare investments in 2010 and piloted the model for how technology could be leveraged to expand access to healthcare while increasing affordability. In 2017, Delle took his learnings from all the healthcare investments he lead at GPI and founded Africa Health Holdings.\n\nSangu Delle, founder and CEO of Africa Health Holdings. Image credit: HBS Alumni\n\nIn addition to its medical facilities, Africa Health Holdings operates pharmacies and labs throughout each of the countries, to provide its patients with requisite medications and lab results. In all, it serves more than 200,000 patients annually.\n\nA telemedicine mobile platform, MyCareMobile, connects each of the startup\u2019s brands. The app is said to provide patients with access to services through teleconferencing, including medical consultations, access to test results, and 24-hour emergency response.\n\nAs mobile penetration increases in Africa, MyCareMobile helps reduce in-person visits by allowing virtual follow-up consultations with doctors and nurses.\n\n\u201cOur online and offline care model allows our patients to access care anytime, anywhere,\u201d Delle said. \u201cWe are keeping healthcare costs affordable while broadening the availability of quality healthcare in the countries we operate in.\u201d\n\nMeridian has a total of 16 medical facilities\u201412 providing outpatient services and inpatient health services in Kenya, three hospitals, and a drug and alcohol recovery centre.\n\nRabito has a chain of 21 dermatology and general medical facilities, located throughout Ghana while Care Point has two hospitals and one clinic in Nigeria.\n\nThe next global healthcare frontier\n\nOn Monday, Nigeria-based DrugStoc also announced a $4.4 million Series A fundraising round, led by Africa HealthCare Master Fund, with participation from Vested World and German Development Bank.\n\nDrugStoc is focused on the medical supply chain and operates a digital platform that helps healthcare providers access pharmaceutical and healthcare products. It plans to expand its tech beyond Lagos by investing in cold chain infrastructure and building on its partnerships.\n\nThese developments reflect the growth of West Africa\u2019s digital health market as the sector attracts global investors. And according to Delle, the African continent, as a whole, is the next global frontier for healthcare.\n\n\u201cOur population is projected to grow by an additional 1 billion people by 2050, and 1 out of every 4 people in the world will be African,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will no longer allow past narratives of infectious, preventable diseases to continue to define Africa, our people, and our future.\u201d\n\nIn addition to expanding its footprint within the countries it currently operates within, Africa Health Holdings plans to expand to the Northern and Southern parts of Africa, in line with a grand vision to become \u201cthe biggest healthcare provider in Africa\u201d.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service).

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigeria\u2019s financial services industry has been exploding in 2020. Payments, digital lending, and savings companies have become popular with investors looking to take a slice of Nigeria\u2019s fintech market.\n\nConsequently, looking at Nigeria\u2019s financial services space will reveal several startups with diverse financial use cases. But for the founders of digital banking startup, Kredi Money, financial services consumers could receive a better experience.\n\nBetween 2005 to 2009, Afolabi Abimbola, CEO of Kredi Money, first plied his trade as a Sales Manager for Globacom, one of Nigeria\u2019s foremost telecom companies. In 2010, he became a Business Development Manager at Funds and Electronic Transfer Solutions (FETS) Limited, a pioneer of mobile payments in Nigeria.\n\nHe then held management-level positions at Renmoney, a prominent microfinance bank and digital lender, and Director-level positions at Kuda Bank and OPay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArmed with these experiences, Abimbola began to observe gaps in the financial services industry he aimed to close.\n\n\u201cFor instance, the average consumer in Nigeria uses a separate app for borrowing, another one for saving, and another one for investing. In some cases, some use a particular platform for the purpose of making payments only,\u201d Abimbola says.\n\nHe then brought on Samuel Orji, a legal professional and seasoned investment professional, as co-founder. His most recent position is with a US-based emerging markets-focused VC investor, where he has been responsible for leading fintech investments across Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nKredi money was pretty much the brainchild of their combined experiences in the market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Left to Right: Samuel Orji, Co-founder Kredi Money, and Afolabi Abimbola, CEO of Kredi Money. Source: Supplied\n\n\u201cThe early foundations for Kredi started being laid in early 2021. Over the past few months, we have been building our fully-digitised bank (Kredi Bank) in stealth.\u201d\n\nThey built Kredi Money to provide solutions across five financial areas: Savings, Spending, Investing, Borrowing (Loans), and protecting (Insurance) for Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (SMEs) and individuals at the mid-bottom of the pyramid.\n\n\u201cWe aim to be a one-stop-shop for financial solutions and be a welcome break from the current fragmented solutions that characterises the market. We currently serve users primarily through our apps (Kredi) available on the Android and iOS stores.\n\n\u201cHowever, we are developing a diverse suite of products that would enable us to reach users via multiple channels including web and offline through agents.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Abimbola, after executing the pilot phase that saw the company gain over 8,000 users across the country, it is now poised for a full launch.\n\nBuilding in a highly competitive market\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKredi will be entering a space currently dominated by traditional financial services companies, digital banks, and payments companies, but its unique offering seems to be catching on with its users.\n\nIts competitors include commercial banks, neobanks like Kuda, Sparkle, Carbon, Fairmoney, and companies like Branch playing in the micro-lending space.\n\nSide Note: Both Carbon and Fairmoney started as micro-lending companies before making the transition to digital banking.\n\nInterestingly, three of these neobanks \u2014 Kuda, Fairmoney, Sparkle \u2014 have raised a combined $125 million in 2021 alone, signifying investor confidence in digital banking, not unlike other parts of the globe.\n\nBesides bringing a one-stop-shop for the entire spectrum of financial services, Abimbola believes Kredi\u2019s focus on the mid to lower market, which has a fatter tail, is a significant advantage.\n\nWhile major Neobanks have either followed a payment driven model or a credit led model, Kredi\u2019s core business model is similar to that of other banks; mobilise deposits and then invest and issue loans.\n\nRemarkably, Abimbola points out that the business has witnessed strong growth in fees from its B2B component.\n\n\u201cWe are also leveraging our robust payment experience and expertise to provide API-based payment infrastructure services to fellow fintech startups that are either not fully licensed or don\u2019t have the technology to carry out mass payments,\u201d he explains.\n\nAbimbola also affirms that Kredi\u2019s payments arm has generated substantial revenues, and it\u2019s currently growing really fast.\n\nKredi\u2019s growing pains\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKredi has only been in existence for a few months. Most of it has been spent setting up the groundwork for the business.\n\n\u201cWe only just kicked off our pilot phase. However, we have grown quite well. We have already exceeded $10,000 in monthly revenue and processed over $2.4 million. We expect to break into profitability in the next couple of months,\u201d Abimbola says.\n\nAccording to Abimbola, Kredi currently has over 8500 users, and about 65% (5,525) are monthly active users. The company defines these as people who conduct at least three transactions on the platform each month.\n\n\u201cWorthy of note that we got these numbers in our pilot phase, without any marketing spend. Major partners on the B2B side of things include Crowdyvest, Youverify and Chipper Cash. We have a strong pipeline of B2B partners lined up.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKredi\u2019s growth in a short space of time has not been without its fair share of challenges.\n\nA recurring trend among budding tech entrepreneurs we\u2019ve featured in the last few years has been the difficulty of securing talent. Kredi was not an exception in this instance.\n\n\u201cAs with any startup, it\u2019s never an easy ride to get people to buy into your dream early on. But we have been extremely lucky to have come across some amazing folks who chose to go on this journey with us,\u201d Abimbola reveals.\n\nHe also says that the company has maintained a healthy workplace culture for its talented team.\n\n\u201cWe are proud that we are building an atmosphere that encourages openness, intellectual curiosity and empathy. There\u2019s still a long way to go, but we are excited for what the future holds on this front.\u201d\n\nFuture growth and expansion plans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far, Kredi Money has been largely bootstrapped to date with some support from Angel investors. Abimbola reveals that he wanted to lay the groundwork for a financial services company, before approaching institutional investors.\n\n\u201cWe have secured all the required licenses from the relevant regulators. We got to 8,000 users without any marketing spend. Customers clearly like our product. And we have big-name players looking to partner with us. We are at an inflection point in our growth and we are looking to scale this up.\u201d\n\nThe company is currently on the verge of opening a pre-seed round, and the founder says that investors are interested, clearly amazed by the traction the company has built without external funding.\n\n\u201cThis fundraise is exclusively for the purpose of driving growth and scaling up the business. This contrasts sharply with the practice in the industry where a significant chunk of initial fundraising is typically channelled towards securing licenses,\u201d Abimbola avers.\n\nIn the short term, the company is focused on growing its customer base in Nigeria and rolling out new products to serve customers of other banks. One of such products is \u201cTrickle\u201d.\n\nThough Abimbola didn\u2019t explain in much detail, Trickle will be a multibank savings and investment platform that would enable users save and invest while they spend.\n\nIn the medium term, a continental expansion seems to be in the works.\n\n\u201cRwanda would be our first destination; we already have arrangements for a licence there in the pipelines. We have also identified a few other markets, some in Francophone Africa others in Southern Africa.\u201d\n\nLast year, our trend analysis of Nigeria\u2019s fintech sector using insights from McKinsey and PwC, revealed that fintechs have largely focused on people already in the banking sector, and rarely released products to bring people into the financial sector.\n\nThis, however, reveals that there\u2019s still much room for growth.\n\n\u201cWe are bullish about this space. We believe that the current players have only scratched the surface and there is opportunity for innovation to go deeper and broader.\u201d Abimbola asserts.\n\nKredi\u2019s work might just turn out to be a first of many other companies looking to broaden the scope of digital banking in Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Senior Reporter at Techpoint Africa | Website Writer and Narrator.

Meme coins are crypto tokens inspired by social media trends, jokes, or movies. Currently, there are over 250 meme coins, including SHIBA INU and Dogecoin.\n\nThe latest in line is Wakanda Inu, named after the fictional African city, Wakanda, in the movie Black Panther. Aside from original gangster (OG) meme coins, most meme coins have no use case backing them, which makes trading in them a risky venture.\n\nFor the latest instalment of Crypto Explorer, our Reporter, Bolu Abiodun, goes into detail about meme coins.

Source: Supplied\n\nNigerian mobility startup, Shuttlers has raised $1.6 million in seed funding. VestedWorld led the round with participation from Interswitch, Rising Tide Africa, Launch Africa, EchoVC, Consonance Investment, CcHub Syndicate, CMC 21 & Alsa, ShEquity, Five35, Sakore and Nikky Taurus.\n\nNigeria\u2019s most populous city, Lagos, is notorious for its chaotic traffic situation, leaving visitors perplexed. After moving to the city from Ibadan, Damilola Olokesusi, Shuttlers\u2019 founder, was initially shielded from it as her workplace provided a staff bus. That changed after she left the job.\n\nA trip abroad in 2014 caused her to experience efficient transportation options and lit a fire in her. In 2017, she founded Shuttlers with some friends, all of whom are no longer with the company. Since its inception, the company has been bootstrapped except for some funding from family and friends.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, with other players in the space, like Treepz (previously known as Plentywaka), raising money and expanding, the startup has raised money to scale across Africa.\n\nWith this round of funding, the company plans to accelerate its expansion into other African cities. Already there are plans to launch in Abuja, with other cities set to follow. In addition, it would be ramping up its hiring process with an eye to improve its technology offerings.\n\nMuch of Africa\u2019s transportation sector is fragmented. However, a few startups are springing up to digitise the process.\n\nIn recent times, startups like Shuttlers, Treepz, and SWVL have seen sufficient interest from investors, signalling an acceptance that the sector is ripe for disruption.\n\nDrugStoc\u2019s Series A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe DrugStoc team. Source: TechCrunch\n\nNigerian healthcare startup, DrugStoc, has closed a Series A funding of $4.4 million. The round was led by Africa HealthCare Master Fund (AAIC) with other investors, including VestedWorld, the German Development Bank (DEG), and several high-net-worth individuals.\n\nChibuzo Opara and Adham Yehia founded DrugStoc in 2015 to link drug companies with hospitals and pharmacies in Nigeria. Since its inception, the startup has reportedly worked with over 3,000 healthcare facilities to serve about 14 million people.\n\nFollowing the completion of its Series A, the startup is set to embark on an ambitious expansion plan that would see it expand its operations to 16 states apart from Lagos, where it currently operates, after which it plans to expand into other African countries.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, we intend to expand beyond the 14 million we currently serve to cover just around 100 million people. And this would be achieved by expanding to about 16 states. Once we are done with the heavy lifting from that expansion, we will be training our sights on other countries,\u201d Opara said.\n\nOver the next few years, the company plans to invest heavily in last-mile delivery while building partnerships with financial institutions.\n\nNigeria\u2019s housing deficit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the United Nations, Nigeria has a housing deficit of about 22 million homes. Available data shows that this deficit grew the most between 2007 and 2015.\n\nFollowing the Federal Government\u2019s unveiling of the country\u2019s housing portal, we take a look at how the housing deficit has fared since 1991.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nA deep dive into the activities of PoS agents in Nigeria.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe current surge in the price of cryptocurrencies (bull run) is perhaps one of the most exciting in the crypto market in recent times. Things started with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) recording incredible numbers in the first quarter of 2021, with as much as $10 billion recorded at the end of the third quarter.\n\nNews of all-time highs floods the media, with some people doubling or even 23x their earnings, making mind-boggling amounts of money in a short amount of time.\n\nIn addition to unbelievable earnings, the rise of meme coins is another unique thing about this current bull run.\n\nYes, this isn\u2019t the first time meme coins are popping up, but it\u2019s safe to say that this is the first time we\u2019re seeing them in this magnitude. In fact, the first African themed meme coin, Wakanda Inu, has just been launched. But what are these meme coins, and are they worth the hype?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat are meme coins?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Old Money on Unsplash\n\nMeme coins are related to memes, those funny videos, pictures, or texts that reference a particular social or cultural phenomenon. The trending \u201cI wan dey do now\u201d is an excellent example.\n\nIn simple terms, meme coins are crypto tokens inspired by social media trends, jokes, or movies.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, there are over 250 meme coins, including Dodgelon Mars, Safemoon Inu, SHIBA INU, SHIBAVAX, Loser Coin, Rotten, and DogeZilla.\n\nFrom their names, it\u2019s possible to tell what some meme coins stand for.\n\nAlthough there are hundreds of meme coins, those referred to as OG (original gangster) meme coins are the most popular with the highest market capitalisation.\n\nThe biggest OG is Dogecoin, the ninth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation of $35.6 billion.\n\nSHIBA INU, which has been touted as the Dogecoin killer, is the second biggest with a market capitalisation of $28.29 billion, sitting two places below Dogecoin.\n\nInterestingly there\u2019s now an African-themed meme coin \u2014 Wakanda Inu \u2014 made to create wealth for Africans. Currently ranked 2818 with a market cap of $26.8 million, Wakanda Inu is far from being an OG.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Clay Banks on Unsplash\n\nHowever, supporters of the token are bullish about its growth, despite its ranking, with many claiming to have made a lot of money from the token.\n\nWhile meme tokens might be a product of social media trends with no fundamental use case backing them, they have recorded enormous growth and made their hodlers a lot of money.\n\nSide note: Hodl is a crypto term derived from misspelling \u2018hold\u2019; it also means \u2018holding on for dear life\u2019. It is a strategy where a coin is held for the long term for higher gains.\n\nHowever, investing in them still poses risks.\n\nMeme coins might make you a lot of money\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Crystal Mapes on Unsplash\n\nSome people, like Glauber Contessoto, aka Slumdoge Millionaire, who became a millionaire with Dogecoin, have publicly revealed how much they\u2019ve made from meme coins.\n\nOn February 5, 2021, he invested $250,000 in Dogecoins when a unit was worth $0.045 (4.5 cents). He became a millionaire two months later, on April 15, 2021. Contessoto told CBNC that he invested because of the strong community behind Dogecoin and Elon Musk\u2019s backing of the coin.\n\nThe Doge Millionaire believes that the coin will build him generational wealth.\n\nHowever, he lost his millionaire status after the value of Dogecoin decreased. Nevertheless, Contessoto remains bullish about the meme coin, refusing to sell and even more.\n\nDogecoin isn\u2019t the only meme coin making people millionaires. SHIBA INU also has its millionaires.\n\nAccording to Fortune, a man identified simply as Rob made an $8,000 bet on SHIBA INU and immediately retired after earning a million dollars on his bet.\n\nCNN also told the story of two brothers \u2014 Tommy and James \u2014 who invested in the Dogecoin killer and made a killing from it. The brothers also convinced other family members to invest in the coin. Before long, the family\u2019s $7,900 investment was worth almost $9 million.\n\nIn October, SHIBA INU was able to unseat Dogecoin as the biggest OG in the meme coin universe, gaining nearly 900,000,000% since it was created in August 2020.\n\nWhile meme coins have made people overnight millionaires, that is not always the case.\n\nYou can lose a lot of money with meme coins\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Nairametrics\n\nThe release of the Korean hit series Squid Game, in September, was the beginning of another massive Internet trend. The series became Netflix\u2019s biggest hit show, with over 130 million watches globally in October.\n\nThe record-breaking series made headlines, inspiring a lot of viral content in the process.\n\nThe series also spurred a meme token \u2014 the SQUID Token \u2014 that took advantage of all the noise the hit series created.\n\nThe timing was perfect, and the coin took off because Squid Game was perhaps the most popular thing on the Internet at the time\n\nAccording to the coin\u2019s whitepaper, it was built just like the series. It contained several games to be played by coin hodlers; however, instead of playing for their lives, hodlers played to earn coins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe series: Sqid Game. Source: BBC\n\nThe rise of the SQUID token was meteoric; it got a lot of attention and made headlines, increasing its popularity and the rally behind it.\n\nAn October 28, 2021, CNBC headline read, There\u2019s a \u2018Squid Game\u2019 cryptocurrency \u2013 and it\u2019s up nearly 2,400% in the last 24 hours.\n\nIt was a juicy coin and everyone wanted in on the action until the creators switched from green lights to red and decided it was time to cash out.\n\nAccording to WIRED, the media failed to point out that there were no ties between the Squid Game Netflix series and the coin.\n\nThe coin went from less than a dollar to $600 per coin, and many hodlers saw themselves as theoretical millionaires. The reality, however, was that they just partook in a huge two-week-long scam.\n\nThe hodlers of the coin couldn\u2019t sell it, which meant they had no way to liquidate their earnings if the price of the token fell. Although the red flags were all too evident, it was already too late to do anything.\n\nThe creators dumped their hodlings, bringing the token, which reached a value of about $2,860 per token in less than two weeks, to almost zero.\n\nPerpetrators of the \u2018rug pull\u2019 scam were estimated to have made away with at least $3.9 million, according to BscScan.\n\nAlthough scams like this paint meme coins in a bad light, the continued existence of Dogecoin and SHIBA INU signals that they might not all be out to get you broke, but how can you tell?\n\nNew meme coins are constantly being created, and it\u2019s getting increasingly hard to differentiate what\u2019s real from what\u2019s not. For example, the new African-themed meme token \u2014 Wakanda Inu \u2014 named after a fictional African city \u2014 Wakanda \u2014 in the movie the Black Panther is on the rise and rallying strongly.\n\nAlthough the token has the backing of popular Nigerian crypto trader and tutor, Chris Ani, the crypto market is notoriously volatile, and even well-meaning meme coins might not fly.\n\nThe African meme token \u2014 Wakanda Inu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWakanda Inu home page\n\nAccording to the token\u2019s whitepaper, \u201cWakanda Inu is a community meme project forged from the deep and warm consciousness of humanity.\u201d\n\nIt says it is \u201ca decentralized meme token to drive growth in the industry, decentralized finance-oriented activities across the world.\n\nBe a pioneer on this mission. Wakanda Inu will outperform every meme coin out there. We are well on our way to inevitable widespread adoption.\u201d\n\nThe whitepaper also reveals that the token will drive charity oriented activities across the world.\n\nAs a community-driven token, the public will decide what happens with the token and which projects to embark upon.\n\nIt is simply a token created to enrich Africans through their collective efforts.\n\nWhile Wakanda Inu means well for Africans, one of the most crucial points to look out for in a token is utility which it doesn\u2019t seem to have yet.\n\nAccording to Mint, experts believe that rather than communities, a token should be backed by fundamentals, also known as utilities or use cases.\n\nFor example, many protocols have been built on the Ethereum network because it has the technology to help NFTs and DeFi, among others, work.\n\nMeme tokens, on the other hand, exist because of a trend and grow in value as long as more people buy and hodl it.\n\nSidharth Sogani, Founder and CEO of Crebaco Global, a crypto and blockchain-focused research, rating, and intelligence company, says meme coins \u201care just community tokens. These are pump and dump coins, which don\u2019t have any use cases.\u201d\n\nHowever, Dogecoin, which started as a meme coin, is working on a use case.\n\nAccording to Market Insider, the American movie theatre could start accepting Dogecoin as a form of payment.\n\nThe SHIBA INU whitepaper has also shown that the token\u2019s ecosystem will contain ShibaSwap, a DeFi platform that will facilitate crypto trading.\n\nWakanda Inu\u2019s whitepaper states that a DeFi platform or NFT farming staking platform could be in the works depending on what the community chooses to build.\n\nHowever, the token is still entirely dependent on the community to grow any form of value.\n\nIn addition to use cases, a YouTuber, Mentoraa\u2019s World, pointed out other red flags within the Wakanda Inu infrastructure.\n\nHe discovered an address that held 8.6775% of the Wakanda Inu token. According to the YouTuber, no wallet address is supposed to be holding up to 4% of a particular token. If the address decides to dump the token, it could adversely affect its value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWallets holding Wakanda Inu on BscScan\n\nHe analysed the token with Token Sniffer, a website that analyses the risk level of a token, and it was ranked highly risky.\n\nThere were also anomalies within the token\u2019s source code that could allow the transfer of the tokens to be halted. This means hodlers might not be able to transfer the token.\n\nHowever, the analysis by the website is experimental and isn\u2019t 100% accurate.\n\nIt is important to note that crypto tokens have become increasingly easy to make, increasing the probability of encountering scam tokens.\n\nTherefore, adequate research is necessary before investing in crypto, especially meme coins.\n\nAs the rally behind Wakanda Inu grows, time is perhaps the only factor that can reveal where it is headed.\n\nDisclaimer: The contents of this article are not financial advice.

          "title": "Pension funds embrace stocks as bond yields decline",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s pension funds are finding solace in domestic stocks with N874 billion investments as of September 30, 2021, amid declining bond yields, according to figures from the National Pension Commission (PenCom).\n\nPension Fund Administrators (PFAs), managers of the fund, in a continuous search for better returns on investment (ROI) for its retirement savings account holders with safety as priority, have during the past few months increased their stakes in stocks.\n\nFrom the unaudited report on pension funds industry portfolio for the period ended September 30, 2021, released by PenCom, N873.49 billion was invested in stocks, as against N846.55 billion in August 2021.\n\nAccording to analysts at FBNQuest, Nigerian pension funds, share of domestic equities rose slightly from 5.1 percent to 6.7 percent over the past 12 months, and members holding rose by 49 percent to N874 billion.\n\nThe all-share index (ASI) also rose by 50 percent over the same period, implying a modest shift by the PFAs into domestic equities, state the analysts.\n\nThey note that the pension industry\u2019s exposure to Nigerian Treasury Bills (NTBs) continues to trend downward. The share of NTBs fell to 63.6 percent y/y and 30.9 percent m/m to N284 billion, equivalent to 2.2 percent of the total asset under management (AUM).\n\n\u201cThe corresponding figures in 2018, 2019 and 2020 were 18.0 percent, 23.6 percent and 6.7 percent, respectively, which it noted was as a result of significant decline in NTBs, which made fund managers to direct their proceeds from OMO bills maturities into the NTBs space, following CBN directives baring domestic non-bank players from its OMO auctions in October 2019,\u201d the analysts note.\n\nRead Also: Pension industry sees more M&As as recapitalisation intensifies\n\nFGN bonds accounted for 60.3 percent of total AUM at the end of September, up from 57.4 percent in the year earlier period, they further note.\n\nThey however attribute this to the government\u2019s planned deficit financing in the 2022 budget.\n\n\u201cThe FGN\u2019s huge deficit financing requirement of N5.6 trillion in the 2021 budget (before the passage of the supplementary budget by the National Assembly) has contributed to pushing up yields.\n\n\u201cWe do not see this trend changing soon considering the Federal Government of Nigeria\u2019s FY 2022\u2019s deficit of N5.6 trillion, of which N2.51 trillion has been set as the domestic borrowing target,\u201d the FBNQuest Capital analysts say.\n\nGlory Etaduovie, managing director/CEO, IEI-Anchor Pensions, believes that renewed interest in the stock market was a reflection of the environment, given all that is playing out in the investment market.\n\nHe however notes that there was a deep-down movement in almost everything as result of COVID-19, and currently there are efforts by those who remained afloat to better their situation, and this could be reflected in increment in the stock market space.\n\nAccording to Etaduovie, after the COVID, it again became clearer that foreign direct investment was slowing since global investors focused on domestic economies. For us, we are left with no option but to rebuild our own economy, Etaduovie states.\n\nDave Uduanu, managing director/CEO, Sigma Pensions, says there is nothing fundamental in the investment figures on stocks, but a sign of recovery from COVID-19. As you are aware, a lot went down at that period, so we are coming from a low base, and not as if the economy has bounced back, he says.\n\nThere are a lot of things driving the market, including absence of foreign portfolio investors, crave for dividend, liquidity, and good results in some names, he states.\n\n\u201cI think in September, there was an open fight for control of First Bank, so stocks like Aritel rallied, MTN rallied because Airtel Africa has investment in many other countries. So, these are good names that could drive a rally.\n\n\u201cMost especially, PFAs will always invest in stocks once we get new money. What has happened was that, with the absence of foreign portfolio investment, any new money put in will lead to a rally in some good names (good stocks), and that could mean higher state,\u201d he says.",

          "title": "Ibom Air to spend N138bn on 10 new A220 planes",
          "text": "At the cost of about N138 billion, Ibom Air, indigenous airline of Akwa Ibom State, on Monday placed an order for 10 A220 aircraft with Airbus, at the ongoing Dubai Air show, taking place in Dubai.\n\nWorking in collaboration with the Airbus team, Ibom Air took an innovative approach to making the choice of the A220. With the purchase agreement signed, deliveries of the aircraft to Ibom Air will commence in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nAirbus last published its list prices in 2018, where a brand new A220-300 was listed with a cost of $91.5 million. In 2019, the European firm made a call to discontinue list prices as airlines rarely end up paying them.\n\nAir Austria\u2019s three shiny new A220s were listed in August 2021 with a market value of $38.07 million, 41.6 percent of the 2018 list price for the aircraft.\n\nThe current market value for each is $33.5 million, 41.4 percent of the 2018 list price.\n\nThis implies that Nigeria\u2019s Ibom Air may be purchasing these aircraft at the cost of $33.5 million or slightly lower. This also implies that the airline may have plans to pay a sum of $335 million for 10 of these aircraft.\n\nUsing the central bank exchange rate of N410 to a dollar, the airline may be paying a sum of N137.6 billion.\n\nRead Also: Nigeria\u2019s Ibom Air nears order for 10 Airbus A220 jets \u2013 Reuters\n\nGeorge Uriesi, the airline\u2019s chief operating officer, spoke with BusinessDay on its finance plans for the newly ordered aircraft.\n\nAccording to Uriesi, the simplest way to explain the aircraft acquisition financing is to say that commercial aircraft are high value mobile assets, usually financed long-term as they cannot be financed with cash.\n\n\u201cThe trick to securing financing is in being able to utilise the aircraft optimally enough to pay for them. The more optimally an airline can utilise their aircraft, the easier it is to pay for the financing and make an operating profit on the asset.\n\n\u201cSo, once an airline can demonstrate that it has the ability to utilise aircraft optimally (and safely), and demonstrate this via its operating and financial records, financiers will line up behind your aircraft acquisition transactions,\u201d he explained.\n\nIt is not a \u2018hire purchase\u2019 type of thing like with cars as financiers finance based on their confidence that operators know what to do with the aircraft, while airlines strive to operate aircraft optimally, pay the financiers and make a profit, he said.\n\nIbom Air started by wet-leasing two A220s for a year, to test the suitability of the aircraft for their needs. Within six months of this process, the airline was able to validate the A220 as the right choice for its domestic and regional aspirations.\n\nThe order of the 10 Airbus A220 is said to be in line with the airline\u2019s aggressive growth plan, which will see it expanding its footprint into new domestic routes as well as regional routes covering West and Central Africa in the immediate future.\n\nThe first phase of this expansion is set to cover cities like Malabo, Douala, Libreville, Kinshasa, Accra, Abidjan, Freetown, Banjul and Dakar. Ultimately, the airline intends to operate throughout the continent of Africa.\n\nThe all-new A220 is purpose built for efficiency, targeting the 100-150 seat market. It burns 20 percent lower fuel per seat compared with previous generation aircraft, and flies to a range of up to 3,400 nm (6,297km), offering performance similar to larger, single-aisle aircraft.\n\nThe A220s combination of a superior cabin product and low operating costs are a perfect fit for the airline\u2019s network growth strategy and will help Ibom Air offer its customers an unrivalled value proposition.",

          "text": "Nigerians said yesterday that the judicial panel report on the Lekki Toll Gate #EndSARS protest resonates with them, as youths say the findings of the report vindicate them.\n\nAn excited Akinseloyin Emmanuel, one of the protesters, told BusinessDay that the finding confirmed the truth about the Lekki massacre as against the Federal Government\u2019s claims.\n\n\u201cEven before the investigation, we knew that people were murdered that day. I am just glad that this report has confirmed that it did happen and it will go on record,\u201d Emmanuel said.\n\nThe government should own up by punishing those who masterminded the massacre and compensate families of those killed, he said.\n\nSimilarly, Akin Olaoye, who was at the frontline of the protest that night, told CNN, \u201cThe findings are a big win and lead us on a pathway to obtaining justice for many of the innocent victims, survivors, and lost souls still lying in unmarked graves.\u201d\n\nThe #EndSARS campaign, which started on October 5, 2020, drew worldwide attention to Nigeria as youths took to the streets to protest against police brutality and the dismantlement of the country\u2019s Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS).\n\nRead Also: Key points from the #EndSARS Lagos State panel of inquiry report\n\nBut the aftermath of that led to a shooting on October 20, which ultimately crushed the #EndSARS campaign.\n\nBefore the report findings, there was evidence, especially video footage from the CNN, that protesters were shot but the government vehemently denied it.\n\nLast month, on the first anniversary of the shooting, Lai Mohammed, Nigeria\u2019s minister of information, described the incident as a \u201cphantom massacre\u201d and continued to dismiss CNN\u2019s investigation as fake news.\n\nHowever, findings from the report show that there were 48 casualties of the shooting incident, out of which nine were killed, four presumed dead and others injured.\n\n\u201cThe Lekki Toll Gate, officers of the Nigerian Army shot, injured and killed unarmed helpless and defenceless protesters, without provocation or justification, while they were waving the Nigerian flag and singing the National Anthem. The manner of assault and killing could in context be described as a massacre,\u201d the report stated.\n\nThe Judicial Panel of Inquiry and Restitution for Victims of #EndSARS Related Abuses and Other Matters also found that the conduct of the Nigerian Army was exacerbated by its refusal to allow ambulances to render medical assistance to victims who required such assistance.\n\n\u201cThe Army was also found not to have adhered to its own Rules of Engagement. There was also an attempt to cover up the incident by the cleaning of the Lekki Toll Gate and the failure to preserve the scene ahead of potential investigations,\u201d the report highlighted.\n\nAccording to Confidence MacHarry, a resident security expert at SBM Intelligence, the most important thing from the report is that it shows the government lied.\n\nHe said, \u201cThis may lead to some sort of de-legitimisation of the state governors in the eye of the people for the fact that the state governors would come out to lie. It tells of Nigerian already established norm as a known false society and it will get difficult to trust political statements and politicians going forward.\u201d\n\nIn her social media platform, DJ Switch, a popular disco jockey who live-streamed some of the events of that night, wrote, \u201cShattered so many lives, and tried to destroy mine. Only for what you desperately tried to hide to be made public\u2026 by you! The truth needs no defense! #EndSARS.\u201d\n\nThe soldiers were found to have parked their vans at the Toll Gate and removed as many bodies and corpses of the fallen protesters.\n\nOne of the protesters who was shot and taken for dead, Olalekan Sanusi, who eventually escaped to narrate his experience, stated that 11 corpses were in the van, where he was placed and presumed dead.\n\nDabira Ayuku, corroborating the above, stated that she saw about seven dead bodies placed in one of the military trucks on the night of October 20, 2020.\n\nAccording to the panel, the entire Police, as first responders, did not have adequate facilities, manpower, experience and training to prepare them for such a civil and orderly protest as the one that happened at the Lekki Toll Gate on October 20, 2020.\n\nFrom the evidence of Serah Ibrahim, as well as Onileowo Legend, Dabiraoluwa Ayuku, and Kamsichukwu Ibe, who participated in the protest, the panel took their accounts as coming from that of eye-witnesses.\n\nEvidence from the testimonies of all witnesses that appeared before the panel indicated that there were protests that emanated from opposition to alleged police brutality and perceived human rights violations and demand for police reforms.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki has reiterated the need to pay critical attention to the development of basic education, urging the federal government to take deliberate and urgent steps towards reducing the large number of out-of-school children in the country.\n\nObaseki gave the charge when he received the Minister of Education, Mallam Adamu Adamu; the management of Universal Basic Education Commission, and the Chairmen of State Universal Basic Education Boards (SUBEB), who were on a courtesy visit at the Government House, Benin City.\n\nThe governor, who expressed worry over the rising number of out-of-school children in Nigeria, called on President Muhammadu Buhari to disband Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC) if it fails to return 50 percent of the children back to school.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe have 50 million or so children under our care and over 10 million of them are not in school. What is our reason for existing if we have this kind of problem?\n\n\u201cSo, for me, Mr. President, if UBEC and SUBEB cannot get 50 percent of these school children back to school in the next two to three years, disband them as there is no basis for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst, if we do not focus on basic education and restore quality into our basic educational system, what we are having today as banditry will be a joke in another ten to twenty years\u2019 time.\u201d\n\nObaseki noted, \u201cFor us in Edo, we had no choice, because you find children leaving secondary schools, either working as barbers or something else. Some even sell whatever they have because someone has promised them a job in Europe or travel to Libya.\n\n\u201cAt a point in time, we had about 30 thousand young men and women from Edo in Libya, waiting to cross to Europe. If they had education and could think, read and write, they would ask more questions before deciding to embark on such a risk.\n\n\u201cYou can imagine; if we had over 30 thousand of them in Libya, how many would have died in trying to cross? The problem is that they were not properly educated.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor us, that was a wake-up call. For my brothers in the North East and North West, with the rising wave of banditry, I think the wakeup call is to bring these children back to school and get them to learn,\u201d he advised.\n\nEnumerating the administration\u2019s efforts at improving basic education in the state, Obaseki further noted: \u201cWhat was the Edo miracle? The first was to tell ourselves the truth that the structure of SUBEB we met was not working. So, I had to post out everybody we met and recruited fresh ones into the system. We focused on training our teachers as part of our reforms in transforming our education.\n\n\u201cWe trained our teachers on how to use technology to teach. The training was focused on the use of YouTube to make the children interested in learning; it was focused on using the tablet, which we gave them, to remove the drudgery of preparing lesson notes and monitoring attendance of the students. For them, it was practical and motivational.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, community participation is also key in transforming our schools. Infrastructure is also key, but a fine school without well-trained and equipped teachers won\u2019t impact quality education,\u201d he added.\n\nEarlier, the minister, who was represented by Basic and Secondary Education Director, Dr. Folake Olatunji-David, said that Edo was chosen as the destination for their quarterly meeting due to its stride in using technology.\n\nHe stated, \u201cIt\u2019s not by any coincidence that Edo is hosting this quarterly meeting, bearing in mind strides and commendable steps your state has been taking in the field of education.\n\n\u201cSo, we are here to enjoy the hospitality of the good people of Edo State. And to deliberate, we are looking at enhancing accessibility and standards of basic education through technology-driven initiatives.\u201d\n\n...",

In the post-pandemic era, people are faced daily with the problem of finding credible investment platforms to grow their wealth. This problem is even further complicated by the proliferation of Ponzi schemes promising high and unrealistic returns, hence the need for investors\u2019 education. At NGX, we therefore continue to prioritise investor education to ensure that investors understand capital market investments and mechanisms, as only then will they be empowered to make sound investment decisions.\u201d\n\nHe further highlighted that as a multi-asset Exchange, NGX has various products like equities, fixed incomes, Exchange Traded Fund (ETFs) and derivatives for every investor regardless of what their investment goals, risk appetite or return expectations may be.\n\nThe webinar featured two presentations the first of which was presented by Mr. Joshua Olutola, Senior Equity Trader, ARM Securities Limited with the theme Building Your Own Portfolio. Taking participants through the topic, Opportunities for Diversification in Nigeria\u2019s Capital Market was the Head, Secondary Markets, NGX, Mr. Franklin Nwaubani. Delivering the closing remarks at the event was Head, Retail Investor Coverage, NGX, Mr. Olumide Orojimi.\n\nOver the years, NGX has shown relentless commitment in deepening retail participation in the capital market by organizing various investors\u2019 education programs to equip existing and potential investors with adequate knowledge and skills to effectively manage and grow their financial resources. These efforts received a boost with the recently launched X-Mobile app. The dynamic and user-friendly mobile app was designed to enhance investors\u2019 participation in the Nigerian capital market.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "BY EMEKA EJERE\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has so far distributed about $3 trillion to households, Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (SMEs), smallholder farmers, pharmaceutical companies to cushion the impact of Covid-19, the governor, Godwin Emefiele, has revealed.\n\nEmefiele, who made the revelation in an interview with Arise TV at the ongoing 2021 Intra-African Trade Fair in Durban, South Africa, described the insinuation that the CBN was overreaching its statutory bounds as baseless, saying that the bank had continued to play its monetary role effectively.\n\nPointing out that the job of the CBN was to complement the efforts of the fiscal side, Emefiele stressed that it had never happened in the country where the bank will lend funds for a tenure of 10 years with a two-year moratorium, like the CBN had done in recent times.\n\n\u201cAnd I can tell you this, between 2020 and now, our data shows that we have disbursed at least N2 trillion, almost N3 trillion in loans to households, to Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, to smallholder farmers, to pharmaceuticals and health institutions.\n\n\u201cWe have also given these funds to some of our large agricultural companies that want to get back again to business, to manufacturing companies who are accessing long term 10 years loan with two-year moratorium with single digit rate. I have data that shows we are playing our part,\u201d he said.\n\nReiterating that the monetary policy and fiscal policy were working hand in hand to grow the economy, Emefiele noted that with every developmental policy and initiative from the Presidency, the CBN and its fiscal counterpart, the Ministry of Finance, collaborate to achieve set goals.\n\nHe added that the new financial instrument, \u201cThe 100 for 100 PPP \u2013 Policy on Production and Productivity\u201d would aid President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s vision to create 10 million jobs.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf you ask Finance Minister, we are always in contact and she would tell you that there are no issues about the relationship between the Monetary and Fiscal authority. So, when people say there is no synergy, again, I wonder where that is coming from.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen COVID hit, Mr. President tasked the finance minister and I to work together to bring an immediate response and I went back to the Bankers Committee to which we came up with immediate response. And the Minister of Finance and I had opportunities several times to go back to brief the President. So it is left for you to respond whether there is collaboration between monetary and fiscal authority there.\u201d\n\n\u201cSecondly, after that, the President said that we should establish economic sustainability program (ESP) chaired by the Vice President. The central bank played an active part in the development of that program to the extent that the fiscal authorities were only meant to contribute N500 billion and monetary authorities were left to provide almost about N1.5 trillion. Please let me correct this not as grant but as loans to support people who were impacted by COVID-19 so they can get their businesses back.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, he said: \u201cOur job is to compliment and that is why after every why at every opportunity when we hold a monetary policy committee meeting, we read out what we have done to compliment the efforts of the fiscal, and data is there.\u201d\n\nGoing furthermore on what the CBN had done to cushion the economic effect of Covid-19 pandemic, he added the bank had disbursed loans close to N3 trillion to household and businesses since 2020.\n\nHe said: \u201cI can\u2019t tell you this, in 2020 till date our data shows that we have disbursed close to at least N3 trillion in loans to households, to micro small and medium enterprises, to smallholder farmers, to pharmaceuticals and health institutions. Also, to some of our larger agricultural companies that want to get back again on to business, to manufacturing companies who are now accessing long term 10-year loans with two year moratorium at single digit rate.\u201d\n\nFurther on the recent \u201c100 for 100\u201d policy, he said: \u201cAgain, the 100 for 100 is another program that came up out of the need to say that we must support more, do everything to create employment for our people. And that\u2019s why if you read the framework, we said employment, we said we must see measurable level of employment that would be provided by that projects.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have to be new projects and the central bank will do everything possible to provide foreign exchange to import plants and machinery. And by the time the plant or machinery are set up, import of raw material would be near zero so that we can begin look at our available local raw material, rather than importing them.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIt is meant again to compliment what Mr. president said that we had to create 10 million jobs in 10 years.\u201d\n\nEmefiele said, \u201cIt is time for Nigeria to stop relying on a country or economy dependent on oil and we must diversify the economy into the non-oil sectors of our economy. We must deepen our economy so that we can truly position ourselves as a country that is self sufficient. Self sufficiency has to do with what we talk about in the economy of import substitution, industrialization, which is produce to feed yourself, and then export.\u201d",

The village also is razed down.\u201d\n\nThe Senate, thereafter, held a minute silence to honour those killed by the Ambazonia separatists from Southern Cameroon in Manga community.",

          "text": "\n\nChief of Air Staff Air Marshal Isiaka Oladayo Amao has assured Nigerians that the end of insurgency and banditry is in sight.\n\nAlso, the Senate, through its committee on Air Force, tasked the nation\u2019s military to intensify its onslaughts against insurgents and bandits for the required peace and development in the affected areas.\n\nThe positions came three days after a senior army officer, Brigadier-General Dzarma Zirkusu and four soldiers were killed by the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) terrorists in Askira Uba, Borno state.\n\nAmao assures\n\nGiving the assurance Tuesday during the 2022 budget defence session before the lawmakers, Air Marshal Amao said insurgents of whatever faction, be it Boko Haram or ISWAP, \u201chave been devastatingly decimated and degraded with attendant loss of fighters and weapons, forcing several of them to surrender voluntarily on weekly basis.\n\n\u201cRequired onslaughts tactically and strategically are already mapped out to route out remnants of the insurgents attacking villages and military outposts in pretence of still being potent.\n\n\u201cIn line with the core mandate of the Air Force and military generally, the territorial integrity of Nigeria is being protected from against the insurgents and bandits who, in no distant time, will be completely be wiped out.\u201d\n\nThe Air Force chief further said as the 2021 budgetary allocations given to the Nigeria Air Force (NAF) was judiciously used in prosecuting the war against the insurgents and bandits as well as improving the welfare of officers and men, the 2022 allocations would also be expended judiciously for similar purposes.\n\n\u201cIn the face of challenges at hand, prudency and accountability have been the guiding principle of implementation of budgetary allocations by the Nigeria Air Force,\u201d Amao said.\n\nIn his remarks before the session went into closed door, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Air Force, Senator Ibn Bala Na\u2019 Allah (APC Kebbi South), tasked the military outfit to use all resources within its disposal in routing out the remnants of the insurgents in particular and make the forests inhabitable for bandits , kidnappers and all forms of criminals .\n\n\u201cThe Air Force and by extension the military generally, deserve commendation from Nigerians as far as war against insurgency and banditry are concerned. But Nigerians want these enemies of the nation to be completely defeated as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cFor us on this committee and in the National Assembly, required appropriations in terms of procurement of weapons, armaments and enhancement of welfare of officers and men in the military, shall be made since essence of governance itself is security and welfare of citizenry,\u201d the lawmaker said.\n\nNULGE\n\nMeanwhile, the Nigeria Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE) has demanded the immediate release of 12 of her members in Zaria local government council, Kaduna state, kidnapped since November 8, 2021.\n\nNULGE National President Comrade Akeem Ambali Olatunji made the demand Tuesday in an interview with journalists in Abuja.\n\nHe frowned at the \u2018silence\u2019 of the Kaduna state government since their abduction, warning that the union might be forced to take a drastic action nationwide if her plea for the workers\u2019 release fell on deaf ears.\n\nHe said nine out of the 12 workers were nursing mothers and married women, stressing that urgent action must be taken to secure the their release without delay.\n\nOlatunji further disclosed that the kidnappers had contacted the families of the victims and were demanding N40million ransom.\n\nOn the ill-fated day, the NULGE leader said of the 13 local government workers, one of them-a driver-was released to report the incident to the victims\u2019 families.\n\n\u201cThese workers have been in captivity of kidnappers since 8 of November, 2021 thereby causing untold hardship in the mind of the family and the union leadership.\n\n\u201cWe are disturbed because Kaduna state government kept mute till now as if all is well, when it has become dangerous for workers to go to work within official working hours or move about within the local government or the state. This calls for great concern.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the reasons NULGE has been canvassing for total freedom of local government. Our belief is that if local government is made functional and is directly funded, LGAs have what it takes to tame the tide of insecurity along the rural areas. Our belief is that all security challenges are local. This has further amplified our clamour for actualisation of local autonomy.\n\n\u201cIn a state that people are been kidnapped here and there, the state government appears to be helpless and this calls for concern. We are therefore making a serious appeal to the government of Kaduna state to make it a matter of urgency and importance the need to work assiduously towards the release of our members in good health.\n\n\u201cWorkers must have the freedom to work, to move about within their locality. So we are therefore sounding this as our first plea, if this is not done, the union would not wait and watch our helpless members being harassed, kidnapped, raped and killed,\u201d Olatunji said.\n\nThe union leader further said: \u201cThe kidnappers have contacted the families of their victims and are demanding for N40million ransom for the remaining 12 persons. 13 of them were kidnapped in a local government official vehicle and one of them was freed, the driver to go and tell the families.\n\n\u201cYou see, the scenario was made worse because of the shutdown of telecommunications in Kaduna state. It has further affected easy communication between the people and even ability to give warning signals to members of our staff and even the people of the state.\n\n\u201cThey said they have to shutdown network communication in Kaduna and so many other areas to improve security, but what we are witnessing now is becoming worst. So for us, NULGE cannot raise N40million, the family members are so poor, they cannot raise money, these are poor workers whose N30, 000 minimum wage is not fully paid. I don\u2019t know how they intend to secure their release.\n\n\u201cAnd to make the matter worse, government is saying they cannot pay ransom. If they are not paying, they should be proactive and secure the release of these people, we can\u2019t allow them to be killed. Something urgently needs to be done, enough of this situation in Zaria local government.\n\n\u201cWe are calling on President Muhammadu Buhari to use his good office since Kaduna state government appears to be overwhelmed by insecurity, to come in quickly to ensure that our local government workers will be fully secured from the den of kidnappers.\n\n\u201cIf the situation remains the same in the days ahead, the national leadership would have to take a proactive action to send a signal to both state and the federal governments that our members are very important, because the first duty of any government is to secure life and property.\u201d",

          "text": "A swathe of alleged fake appointment and recruitment letters in possession of many employment seekers has compelled the setting up of service-wide verification exercise for all officers recruited by the Federal Civil Service Commission (FCSC) from 2013 to 2020.\n\nThis follows accusation and counter accusations from the commission and some Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) that expressed serious reservations over the commission\u2019s persistent seizure of recruitment and appointment letters they forwarded to the FCSC for authentication and subsequent documentation and enrolment for the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS) capturing.\n\nFCSC\n\nThese letters, which bear insignia and stamp of the FCSC, as well as the signature of the director recruitment and appointment who does that on behalf of the chairman of the commission, are accepted and honoured by the MDAs.\n\nBut the FCSC frowned at those letters on the grounds that they did not emanate from them.\n\nBlueprint Newspapers investigation spanning over three months, reveals that on an average, no fewer than two dozens of such fake appointments and recruitment letters in the possession of desperate job seekers were weekly seized by the commission.\n\nFor instance, our investigation revealed that no fewer than 300 of such alleged fake appointment and recruitment letters from one of the core ministries located at Mabuchi were seized by the commission within two months in 2019, and subsequently, a further 20 from the same ministry during the peak month of the COVID 19 saga last year.\n\nThe authenticity of such letters, we learnt, is usually questioned by the commission when request for their confirmation is sought by the respective registries of the MDAs for subsequent documentation of the \u2018newly\u2019 appointed and \u2018recruited\u2019 staff and enrolment for the IPPIS capturing of staffers to enable them draw statutory benefits as bonafide civil servants in the federal civil service.\n\nObscure ministries worst hit\n\nMost of the fake appointment and recruitment letters, sources observed, are largely from the MDAs, especially \u201cvery obscure agencies which are largely a drainpipe of public funds as they are hardly noticeable and of any significant socio-economic cum political value\u201d, according to a top Federal Character Commission (FCC) source.\n\nSome of the fake letters obtained by our reporter showed that all cadres of staff allegedly recruited and appointed by the FCSC, were sent directly to the respective ministries as against the statutory practice of recruited technical officers being sent to their designated ministries by the Office of the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation.\n\nIn two of many instances, computer analysts and other middle level technical officers were sent directly from the FCSC to the then Federal Ministry of Power, Works and Housing in 2017 and in 2019, a development that aroused suspicion from some staff members in the registry department of one of the now dual ministries.\n\nAccording to a dependable source, one of the staff member who raised an alarm got permission from his superiors to seek the commission\u2019s confirmation of the authenticity of the letters.\n\nTheir fears were confirmed as those letters were found to be fake and thereafter seized even as the bearers disappeared into the thin air.\n\nFCSC reacts, initiates verification exercise\n\nA key player in the recruitment and appointment department of the FCSC who wished not to be mentioned said \u201cthe commission is fully aware of the prevalence of fake recruitment and appointment letters being paraded about by employment seekers. We are particularly concerned because cases of such fake letters are increasingly embarrassing to the commission. To say the least, it\u2019s terrible.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are particularly concerned that it is rampant and the culprits are mostly from the MDAs. In fact, on an average, we have seized between two and above dozens of such letters weekly and we are working hard to prosecute those found with such incriminating letters\u201d, the source said looking pensive.\n\nSimilarly, the Director of Recruitment and Appointment in the commission, Mr Ibrahim el-Yakubu, said the frequency of occurrence of such letters necessitated the FCSC to carry out a service-wide verification exercise for all officers recruited by it from 2013 to 2020.\n\nHe said the essence is to curb cases of immorality in recruitment.\n\nThe circular FC3171/S.7/T3/101 issued on the 27th of August, 2021, directed all MDAs to carry out the exercise.\n\nThough the verification exercise, which began on the 4th of October ought to have been rounded off on the 9th of October, the director said it is ongoing and therefore could not confirm the outcome of the exercise and what percentage of verified staff were found wanting.\n\nBlueprint can confirm that the exercise has been conducted at the ministries of commerce, industries, information and orientation, education, trade and investment, water resources, OSGF, justice, agriculture, women affairs, science and tech, youth and sports and foreign affairs and interior, among others.\n\nEmployment seekers pay between N.8m to N1.5m\n\nFurther investigation also revealed that desperate employment seekers are compelled to pay between N800, 000 and N1.5million to officials of the commission and some directors in the MDAs.\n\nAccording to a source who declined being mentioned by name, some directors in the MDAs would declare vacancies by way of replacements and connived with certain elements in the FCSC to recruit whoever has the means to buy the job.\n\nAccording to him, at the commission, an officer may demand for payment of N400,000 or more to get the recruitment and appointment letter issued, while the director or whoever may be in charge of wherever the vacancy is declared, demands N500,000 and above, depending on the \u2018liquidity\u2019 of the agency or ministry.\n\n\u201cFor instance, some months ago, an employment seeker coughed out N1m which he sourced from relatives to \u2018buy\u2019 an employment in one teaching institution in one of the states in the North Central region,\u201d the source said.\n\nOHSF queries ministries, ICPC steps in\n\nFollowing petitions by some concerned staffers of various ministries, the Office of the Head of Service of the Federation, we learnt, has on several occasions queried some of the MDAs as was the case when sometimes last year it asked the Ministry of Works to respond to one of the petitions raised by concerned staff member over alleged practice of documenting new recruits with fake letters of appointment, including those whose letters were supposedly seized by the FCSC.\n\nWe could not confirm whether the ministry and indeed others queried by the OHSF have acted in line with the request.\n\nAnti-graft agencies step in\n\nHowever, we can confirm that the anti-graft agencies have stepped into some of the cases.\n\nIt was gathered that the anti-graft bodies have received petitions from either the victims of the employment racket or junior staff being singled out by suspected \u2018rogue\u2019 senior officers who may have connived with other elements at the FCSC, for undeserved punishment by way of transfer out of the ministry and denial of due benefits.\n\nAlready, the Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related offences Commission (ICPC) acknowledged receiving a number of petitions, including one against the works ministry for such misdemeanour.",

          "text": "Immediate policy action is needed to curb the long-run impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on the lives and livelihoods of Nigerian households, the World Bank has said in a new report.\n\nIt stated that the pandemic has hit countries with a health and economic shock whose effects would be felt far into the future, and in countries like Nigeria, the pandemic has continued to affect health outcomes, human-capital accumulation, household poverty and coping strategies, as well as labour-market dynamics.\n\nThe report, \u201cCOVID-19 in Nigeria: Frontline Data and Pathways for Policy,\u201d shows both the extent of such impacts on Nigerians and promising policy options that could accelerate the nation\u2019s recovery.\n\nIt also draws on innovative sources of high-frequency data, namely, the Nigeria COVID-19 National Longitudinal Phone Survey (NLPS), to inform the choices that Nigerian leaders now face.\n\n\u201cThe COVID-19 crisis has provided a wake-up call to address the long-standing structural challenges that could constrain the government\u2019s ambition to lift 100 million Nigerians out of poverty,\u201d said Shubham Chaudhuri, World Bank Country Director for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThere is no time like the present for the country to prepare for future climate and conflict shocks and seize the promise of its young population to lay strong foundations for inclusive growth.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Suspects Arraigned Over Killing Of Police Officer In Lagos\n\nEscape Poverty\n\nAccording to the World Bank, the NLPS represents a successful collaboration between the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) and the Data Production and Methods team at the global financial institution.\n\nIt was launched in April 2020 \u2013 almost immediately after the COVID-19 pandemic began \u2013 and has since regularly collected information on key social and economic outcomes, up to 12 times, from households across the country.\n\nThe report, the World Bank explains, shows that the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic for human capital, livelihoods, and welfare are proving to be severe.\n\nIt stressed that while many schools have reopened across Nigeria, learning that was lost during the COVID-19 crisis needed to be recouped and some children have not returned to school.\n\nEven though many Nigerians have returned to work, the jobs to which they have shifted \u2013 mainly in small-scale non-farm enterprises \u2013 may not offer income security, making it difficult for households to escape poverty, the report added.\n\nIt raised concern that the pandemic has ushered in associated shocks \u2013 especially to food prices \u2013 and social protection remained rare, saying households\u2019 food security and their welfare at large were under serious threat.\n\nThe report\u2019s findings underscored the urgency of far-reaching reforms to strengthen Nigeria\u2019s economy and development outcomes.\n\nBedrock For Recovery\n\nIt proposed three immediate priorities that could provide the bedrock for recovery, including the rollout of vaccines quickly and equitably to reduce the direct health threat posed by the virus.\n\nThe report believes it will be essential to help children remediate the learning losses incurred during the pandemic \u2013 by getting them back to school or by finding low-tech remote solutions that work for the poor where such is not possible, as well as expanding social protection to provide short-term relief for the welfare losses Nigerian households are currently facing.\n\nThe report also explained how the crisis has provided renewed impetus for the longer-term policies needed to provide sustainable pathways out of poverty.\n\nThis includes effecting the macro-economic reforms that could energise job creation and supporting the farm and non-farm enterprises that will dominate employment in Nigeria for many years to come.\n\nHowever, the report stressed that it would be vital to keep generating fresh data that track Nigeria\u2019s progress out of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cEvidence from the NLPS and other sources already puts Nigeria\u2019s policymakers in a position of strength, and the country\u2019s unique commitment to phone surveys throughout the COVID-19 crisis has set the standard for high-frequency welfare monitoring,\u201d said Tara Vishwanath, World Bank Lead Economist in the Poverty and Equity Global Practice and co-author of the report.\n\n\u201cContinued investment in producing and then using data \u2013 so that the voices of Nigeria\u2019s people can be heard \u2013 will be crucial for designing the policies required to build back better.\u201d\n\nBy committing to generating and using data in this way, the results of Nigeria\u2019s policy innovations can fully benefit the nation\u2019s citizens and inspire other countries around the region and the globe, the report stated.",

If Nigerians do not trust us, then we won\u2019t be doing what we are doing, and in any case, it is the Armed Forces of Nigeria; we are not talking of the police.

But we are not going to say they should go away as we also have to reach out to them. When the general populace pushed us to get ourselves organised that they will vote PDP, even some of our members did not believe it would work.\n\nWe said something to ourselves that we may have a disagreement because there will always be disagreement in every human interaction. But what we are saying is that even if we have a disagreement, let us get ourselves together to get power and then those disagreements will go to the Government House where we will all settle it.\n\n\u201cAnd today, we are here in the Exco Chamber. Yes, we may not be able to satisfy everybody. Anytime we have challenges with anybody, let them bring those things to the table and we\u2019ll fix it.\n\n\u201cWe are lucky in Oyo State. Today, the Deputy National Chairman (South) of the party is from Oyo State. So, there is a channel to reach the very top decision-makers. \u201cSo, I want to promise you that everything we are supposed to work out to ensure that the party structure is well oiled and maintained, will be done.\n\n\u201cEverything that we have to do in terms of providing logistics and incentives will get to you. We are the ones at the state level but anything we are doing must get to the grassroots level because those are the people that will interface with the general populace.\n\n\u201cWe are drinking from the PDP well and it is my prayer that others will also drink from the same well. So, that is why we must not pollute the well no matter how angry we may be. And I am sure that all the things each and every one of us is expecting will get to us.\n\n\u201cAnother issue the chairman raised is about the party and government being on the same page because where we normally have the beginning of failure is when people are facing different directions unknowingly.\n\n\u201cAs the leadership and administrator of the party in Oyo State, we must have the commitment to be fair and just to all the party members and even to those that claimed to be aggrieved. Once you bring them to the fold, deal with everybody as one. Let us try our best to do all we need to do and leave the rest for God.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the newly elected state Chairman, Dayo Ogungbenro, appreciated the governor for hosting members of the new executive committee.\n\nHe, however, assured, on behalf of the new Exco, that he would make it a point of duty to instill discipline in the party and continue to support the current administration to succeed in all ways.",

Several parts of the city recorded figures close to or higher than 400 on Tuesday, which is categorised as \u201csevere\u201d.\n\nA figure between zero and 50 is considered \u201cgood\u201d, and between 51 and 100 is \u201csatisfactory\u201d, according to the the air quality index or AQI.\n\nA mix of factors like vehicular and industrial emissions, dust and weather patterns make Delhi the world\u2019s most polluted capital. The air turns especially toxic in winter months as farmers in neighbouring states burn crop stubble. And fireworks during the festival of Diwali, which happens at the same time, only worsen the air quality. Low wind speed also plays a part as it traps the pollutants in the lower atmosphere.\n\nThis year, the pollution has become so dire that it prompted a stern warning from India\u2019s Supreme Court, which directed state and federal governments to take \u201cimminent and emergency\u201d measures to tackle the problem.\n\nFollowing the hearing, a meeting was called by Delhi\u2019s Commission for Air Quality Management and emergency measures were announced.\n\nOther measures announced by the panel include a ban on the entry of trucks in Delhi and neighbouring states of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan until 21 November, except those carrying essential commodities.\n\nThe panel also directed Delhi and other states to \u201cencourage\u201d work from home for 50% in all private offices that fall in the National Capital Region during the period.",

          "text": "A deadly storm described by officials as a once-in-a-century weather event has severed road and rail links around Vancouver, Canada.\n\nTwo motorways connecting the West Coast city were closed after being damaged by severe flooding.\n\nA woman was killed in a highway landslide, and rescuers say at least two other people are missing.\n\nThousands of people were forced to leave their homes due to the massive storm, which struck on Monday.\n\nThe woman\u2019s body was found near Lillooet, about 250km (155 miles) from Vancouver, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP).\n\nRCMP Sgt Janelle Shoihet said that rescuers had not yet determined the number of \u201coccupied vehicles that were lost in the slide\u201d, according to AFP news agency.\n\nMotorist Kathie Rennie told CBC News she saw the landslide come down on traffic that was already at a standstill south of Lillooet.\n\n\u201cNo sooner do we get back into our vehicles, the people that were in front of us are just screaming and running,\u201d she said. \u201cThe look on their faces, it was like a tsunami was coming. It was the scariest thing that I\u2019ve ever seen.\n\n\u201cI just turned around, and I\u2019m just watching the whole side of the mountain coming down and taking out these cars\u2026 everything just being swept away. Just complete panic.\u201d\n\nThe provincial minister of transportation, Rob Fleming, told a news conference it was the \u201cworst weather storm in a century\u201d.\n\nThousands of homes in British Columbia were evacuated after an \u201catmospheric river\u201d dumped the region\u2019s monthly rainfall average in just 24 hours.\n\nAll 7,000 residents of Merritt, about 120 miles north-east of Vancouver, were ordered to flee their homes on Monday.\n\nSnow fell on there on Tuesday, and cars could be seen floating in icy flood waters in town.\n\nHelicopter crews were also sent to the mountain town of Agassiz to rescue about 300 people who became trapped on a cut-off road.\n\nMonday\u2019s rains and winds had largely finished by Tuesday afternoon, but several communities remained stranded.\n\nPart of the Trans-Canada Highway, which connects Vancouver to the rest of the country, was submerged under water.\n\nA chunk of the Coquihalla Highway, which links Vancouver to the province interior, appeared to have crumbled into floodwaters.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters in Ottawa he was monitoring the situation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be there to help in any way, shape or form,\u201d Mr Trudeau said.\n\nAt one point the main available land route out of Vancouver was to enter the US and then return to Canada. However, re-entering Canada from the US requires a negative coronavirus test, and roads in the border state of Washington were also affected by the storm.\n\nThe port of Vancouver, the largest in Canada, was forced to suspend all rail access because of the flooding and landslides, halting shipments of food, fuel and other goods.\n\nThe port moves about C$550m ($440m) worth of cargo every day, according to Reuters news agency. Fuel pipelines in the area have also been turned off as a precaution.\n\nIt comes after British Columbia suffered a record high heat wave over the summer that killed more than 500 people, and wildfires that destroyed an entire town.\n\nEarlier this month, a tornado was spotted in British Columbia \u2013 the first time one has been seen in the area in five decades.",

Ndudi Elumelu at the plenary.\n\nElumelu had while moving the motion, noted that Nigeria and the UAE have had a positive diplomatic relationship and in 2009 the UAE established its embassy in Nigeria.\n\nHe also recalled that in December 2020 a memorandum of understanding was executed between Nigeria and the UAE to provide a platform for both countries to engage each other bilaterally and narrated the cause of the dispute between both countries.\n\nHe also expressed concern that hundreds of legal resident Nigerians living in UAE were losing their jobs on account of the refusal of the authorities to renew their work permit which he also pointed out offends the letters of bilateral agreements which both nations are signatory to.\n\nAdopting the motion, the House also resolved to set up an adhoc committee from the following house committees on Aviation, Foreign Affairs, PTF on Covid-19, national security and intelligence and Interior (Immigration Service), National Orientation Agency, Diaspora and Treaties respectively to interface with the ministry of Foreign Affairs, Aviation and National Intelligence Agency (NIA), PTF on Covid-19, immigration Service, Diaspora commission and National Orientation Agency on best ways of resolving this crisis.\n\nThe adhoc committees were given four weeks to carry out the exercise and report back to the house.\n\nUdora Orizu in Abuja",

          "title": "Nigeria: PDP Will Adopt Consensus Presidential Candidate in 2023, Says Benue Governor Ortom",
          "text": "Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom on Tuesday said the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) would adopt consensus option for the emergence of its presidential candidate for the 2023 election.\n\nHe also called on President Muhammadu Buhari to return the amended Electoral Act sent to him for assent to the National Assembly, saying the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) does not have the capacity to monitor direct primary elections among 18 political parties.\n\nAddressing a media briefing in Abuja, Ortom said the PDP would adopt consensus option at all levels, including the presidential candidate in choosing its standard-bearers for the 2023 general elections.\n\nThe Benue State governor also alleged that so far, over 1700 citizens and 100 security officials had been killed in the security crisis involving the herdsmen and farmers in the state\n\nHe said: \u201cIn 2023, we are going to adopt a consensus option in the nomination of all candidates and where we cannot reach a consensus as we did in the election of the members of the National Working Committee (NWC) and where we cannot reach a consensus, we will have elections\u201d\n\nHe said contrary to reports, it was the former Senate President, David Mark that recommended the PDP National Chairman designate, Iyotchia Ayu as a national chairman, saying they are good friends and brothers.\n\nOn the proposed direct primary election for political parties, the Benue State governor called on President Buhari to return the amended Electoral Bill to the National Assembly, insisting that INEC does not have the capacity to monitor direct primary elections in 18 political parties.\u201d\n\nHe said the electoral college system or indirect primaries remained the best for the nomination of candidates\n\nAccording to Ortom, \u201cthe best option is indirect primaries, political parties ought to be allowed to evolve a system and processes that would help them grow and develop internal democracy within them.\n\n\u201cThe direct primary system is more expensive, discourages internal democracy,\u201d he said, explaining that the governors and party members were taken aback about the proposed legislation.\n\nHe urged President Buhari to make haste to return the bill to the National Assembly for necessary amendments\n\nAccording to Ortom, the indirect primary was more democratic, fair and transparent and ensures equity.\n\nHe disagreed with the insinuation that the governors use the indirect primary elections to their advantage and manipulate the nomination processes.\n\nHe explained further, \u201cAs a governor, it is easier to manipulate the direct primary than the indirect primary. In an indirect primary, the delegates can easily revolt or protest, when the processes are tampered with or manipulated\n\n\u201cHow can INEC conduct a direct primary in Benue State where there 276 wards alone, let alone the remaining 25 states and the Federal Capital Territory. The direct primary will give the governors more powers. If any governor wants to manipulate the processes, it is easier for manipulation. Above all, INEC doesn\u2019t have the capacity. It will be too much load on INEC.\u201d\n\nOrtom said that if the amended electoral laws was returned to the National Assembly it could still be amended and assented into law before the lawmakers proceed on the yuletide break, saying, \u201cnothing is impossible when there is the political will.\u201d\n\nResponding to a question on the panel report on EndSARS that was released on Monday, the Benue governor said, \u201clet justice and equity be allowed to take its place. For me, I believe in justice. I am not the Lagos State governor, in Benue State, we implemented the outcome of the panel report to extent that justice is seen to have been done to all concerned. \u201c\n\nOn the state of the economy, Orton said that Nigeria has been taken back 40 years\n\nAccording to him, President Buhari has been hijacked by a cabal.\n\nHe argued that this was not the Buhari he knew before the 2015, asking, \u201cwhere are we now? We are just paying lip service and the country is going down day by day\n\n\u201cThe cabals have taken over President Buhari. He meant well when he assumed office. But the people are intimidated. Unknown gunmen and known gun men have taken over the country and yet we cannot take action till one day, they will over run the country\n\n\u201cI believe in Nigeria. I believe in the unity of this country, but let us not take the line of mediocrity. There is injustice, there is no equity. There is no fairness in this country any longer. Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Igboho are detained for one reason or the other, but no one is after kidnappers and bandits who are busy having a field day in the country\n\n\u201cThe security agencies are not going after them. In Benue State over 1700 people have been killed and over 100 Army, Police and DSS officials have been killed and the federal government is helpless.\n\n\u201cThis government has failed; this government has demonstrated that they have no capacity and collectively we have failed \u201c, Ortom stated.\n\nOn his relationship with President Buhari, he said, \u201csycophants and cabals have tried to distance him from me,\u201d however, he said he has a positive relationship with security agencies in Benue State, explaining that it was because of this that he recently signed a bill that empowered the Community Volunteers Guards to carry arms in the state.\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja",

          "text": "The Nigerian Institution of Structural Engineers (NIStructE) has attributed the cause of the collapsed building on Gerald Road, Ikoyi, Lagos State, on November 1, to several variations on the original design of the building that was initially planned to be six-storey, but was later increased to 21-storey.\n\nThe NIStructE\u2019s view was contained in statement obtained on Tuesday, which was signed by the President of NIStructE, Dr. Kehinde B. Osifala.\n\nOsifala explained: \u201cThere are clear indications of several design brief changes on the project and the engineering and management of these changes appear to have been seriously inadequate. The building that collapsed was initially designed for just six floors, and later to 12 floors, before this was further changed to Fifteen 15 floors.\n\n\u201cIt could not yet be established the adequacy of any properly designed and documented further revision to the eventual (and tragically, final) Twenty-One (21) floors that was being implemented and which collapsed.\u201d\n\nHe also said the preliminary investigation on the collapsed building showed that, \u201cthere are also indications that more than two structural engineering design firms worked on the project at different times.\n\n\u201cThe preliminary investigation also revealed some evidence of structural inadequacy in the construction and that signs of some structural distress had already started to show within certain elements of the building. Some remedial measures were already being undertaken to address some of this. The method of implementation of this was not in accordance with sound structural engineering practices.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Osifala explained that, \u201clack of proper quality control and quality assurance measures and processes during the construction was evident becoming noticeable as seen in the poor quality of concrete materials and workmanship observed during the examination of the collapse debris.\n\n\u201cAll the above findings, which are very significant from the structural engineering point of view, need to be investigated further during the detailed investigation stage so that all factors related to the cause or causes of the collapse can be truly established and the appropriate lessons identified and implemented.\n\n\u201cWe expect that the various committees that are being set up will have full access to much more information (such as all the structural drawings, the calculations, documents prepared and submitted for planning approval and for construction, material test results, site instructions and records, records of meetings, more eyewitness accounts, etc.\u201d\n\nThe institute stated that a thorough and comprehensive structural integrity appraisal should be carried out on the other two buildings respectively that are on same site, in the light of the already gathered preliminary information about the noted inadequacies of the collapsed building.\n\nOsifala advised members of the public to always engage only competent and capable registered professionals on their projects, adding that \u201cit is extremely important that the appraisal is carried out by qualified and registered structural engineers who have the requisite experience.\u201d\n\nHe stated that a \u2018Structural Integrity Appraisal\u2019 should not be limited to carrying out some non-destructive tests to evaluate the properties of the concrete, but should be \u201ccomprehensive and all-inclusive structural engineering evaluation of the entire structure, which is tailored to suit the full objectives of the appraisal. It is only after this that a clean bill of health can be confirmed for the building.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Institution of Structural Engineers (NIStructE) maintains a register of its registered members and can be consulted on any matter of structural importance or concern,\u201d he said.\n\nIt further stated that the institute waited this long in order to gather verifiable information and carry out physical assessment on the collapsed building before going public with its views.\n\n\u201cWe are now in a position to make factual statements and provide guidance to the general public that will hopefully be enlightening but also reassuring that structures once well designed and implemented with the use of the appropriate professionals should remain safe throughout their service life.\n\n\u201cAs these findings remain preliminary until the recommended comprehensive investigation is carried out, and the outcome of the various government\u2019s and institutional panels have been determined, we and should not in any way jeopardise the outcomes of the more detailed investigations being organised by various professional and regulatory bodies, it is our view that the outcome of our preliminary investigation will give a general indication of what likely led to the unfortunate incidence,\u201d it added.\n\nDike Onwuamaeze",
