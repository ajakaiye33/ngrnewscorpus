          "text": "The United Kingdom has said it hoped that the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), will assent to the Electoral Act 2010 (Amendment) Bill transmitted to him by the Federal Government.\n\nThe British High Commissioner to Nigeria, Catriona Laing, at the opening ceremony of YIAGA Convergence 3.0 on Thursday, noted that she was in Zimbabwe where she observed elections and she recognised how powerful the civil society could be.\n\nLaing, while noting that the next generation election in Nigeria is \u201cmake or break,\u201d said, \u201cWe honestly really believe for Nigeria, for Africa, for the World that the outcome of this election and the conduct of this election is massively important.\u201d\n\nAccording to the High Commissioner, it has been \u201ca little bit of a rocky road\u201d for Nigerian democracy since 1999 but the country has \u201cstuck with it.\u201d\n\nShe said \u201cthe world will be looking at this election\u201d and whether it would be secured and conducted \u201crelatively well\u201d as well as if the electorate would accept the results and rally round the new leadership.\n\nThe diplomat added in part, \u201cSpeaking for my government and the new US administration, we are very conscious\u2026we need to build a coalition of democracies.\u201d\n\nLiang said it is hoped that the Independent National Electoral Commission would deliver \u201ca good election and the Electoral Act, hopefully, will be passed soon by the President for the electronic transmission of votes.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cBut fundamentally, it needs people to register to vote.\u201d\n\nAccording to her, while the British Government has been monitoring the voter registration process and it has been going quite well, \u201cwe need to up the ante.\u201d\n\nVotes\u2019ll count in 2023 elections, Buhari pledges\n\nMeanwhile, the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has promised Nigerians and the international community that his regime will ensure free and fair elections in the 2023 general elections.\n\nBuhari also assured Nigerians of a peaceful transfer of power, even as he called on global partners to support Nigeria\u2019s efforts in tackling insurgency and terrorism.\n\nHe spoke on Friday at a Virtual Summit for Democracy organised by President Joe Biden of the United States.\n\nSpecial Adviser to the President (Media and Publicity), Femi Adesina, disclosed this in a statement titled, \u2018We\u2019ll ensure free, fair elections in 2023, transfer of power to winners \u2013President Buhari\u2019.\n\nAccording to him, necessary mechanisms will be strengthened to ensure that Nigeria witnesses another peaceful transfer of power.\n\n\u201cAs we count down to our next general elections in 2023, we remain committed to putting in place and strengthening all necessary mechanisms to ensure that Nigeria will not only record another peaceful transfer of power to an elected democratic government, but will also ensure that the elections are conducted in a free, fair and transparent manner.\n\n\u201cYour Excellencies, Nigeria will continue to actively support the democratisation processes in our region; West Africa, and the African continent at large. But regrettably, our democratic gains of the past decades are under threats of unconstitutional takeover of power.\n\n\u201cThis unwholesome trend, sometimes in reaction to unilateral amendments of constitutions by some leaders, must not be tolerated by the international community. Nigeria fully supports the efforts by ECOWAS to address this growing challenge and appreciates the support of both the African Union and the United Nations,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nThe President said Nigeria continued to face security challenges which posed a threat to democracy, calling \u201con global partners to support our efforts in tackling insurgency and terrorism.\u2019\u2019\n\nStill speaking, the President thanked Biden, government and people of the United States for hosting the Summit.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "How I secured release of 100 inmates from Kuje prisons-Sen. Orji Uzo Kalu",
          "text": "says many languishing in detention for not fullfiling requirements of law\n\n\u2026set to build new cells\n\nBy Levinus Nwabughiogu-Abuja\n\nSenate Minority Leader, Dr. Orji Uzo Kalu said yesterday that God used him to secure the release of over 100 inmates from Kuje prisons.\n\nNarrating the event on his verified Facebook page, Kalu who paid a special visit to the facility on Friday in the spirit of Christmas said that many Nigerians were languishing in the prison for not fulfilling the requirements of the law.\n\n\n\nREAD ALSO:COVID-19: Reps urge FG migrated workers\n\nWhy he noted that there were many who actually earned their place in the facility, the Senator also stated that many other inmates were happy and willing to live behind bars for life.\n\nOn an emotional note, Kalu recounted two separate incidents in his left that had brought tears to his eyes.\n\nAccording to him, the first was when Igbos were deported from Lagos to Onitsha in Anambra State and the second being the day he was taken to prison.\n\nIt will be recalled that Kalu who was a two term governor of Abia State between 1999 and 2007 was upon his exit from office accused of embezzling about N7.1billion from the State coffers by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC.\n\nIn December 2019, Kalu was pronounced guilty by a court and sent to Kuje prisons in Abuja to serve a 12 year jail term.\n\nHowever, in May, 2020, respite came his way as the Supreme Court quashed the conviction and ordered a retrial.\n\nSimilarly, by an application, a court also barred EFCC from including the Senator in the fresh trial.\n\nBut the anti-graft agency was miffed by the decison of the court and has reportedly appealed the matter for it to be set aside.\n\nKalu who shared pleasantries and ate with some officials of the prisons wrote:\n\n\u201cAs part of my covenant with God to encourage and support the mental wellbeing of those in detention, I have been visiting and spending time with them and today is one of those days.\n\n\u201cSince I became an adult and as long as I can remember, there have been two occasions I wept and couldn\u2019t hold back. The first was the day Igbos were deported from Lagos to Onitsha. After my reaction to the unceremonious event, I questioned the humanity in this country and the embarrassment attached. I never foresaw that such could ever happen in my lifetime.\n\n\u201cThe second was when I was at the Nigerian Correctional Service Medial Security Custodial Centre, Kuje, Abuja. Somehow, one young man (names withheld) approached me and sought an audience which I granted. He told me a pathetic story of how he found himself in prison. He is the only child of his parents and his father was also imprisoned. That night, I prayed and thanked God for encountering him. I didn\u2019t need anyone to tell me it was a set up for his family. After my intervention by engaging the services of a lawyer, himself and his father were freed. May God bless him.\n\n\u201cWith God\u2019s grace , I was able to secure the release of not less than 100 inmates who were in detention because they couldn\u2019t afford a lawyer or bail. My stay in Kuje actually gave me an opportunity to see the deepest and lowest ebb of the downtrodden. While many in detention are guilty of one crime or the other, there are several others who are languishing in detention because they could not fulfill the requirements of the law to be freed. They just needed little intervention and I am grateful to God for using me. However, I also noticed there are a few who do not want to leave the prison. For reasons best known to them, they feel much more comfortable spending their entire lives in prison. It\u2019s a deep world.\n\n\u201cAs I visited the Nigerian Correctional Service Medial Security Custodial Centre, Kuje today in compliments of the season, I ate, drank and shared jokes with a few. Among other interventions in the Nigerian Correctional Service Medial Security Custodial Centre, Kuje, I am very happy that the solar power project I sponsored has helped the prison with 24 hour power supply.\n\n\u201cBy 2022, we will commence the building of a new cell to decongest the already congested prison.\n\n\u201cI thank the Comptroller General of the Nigeria Correctional Service for his commitment and great improvement in the correctional center\n\n\u201cI also thank the head of the Nigerian Correctional Service Medial Security Custodial Center, Kuje, Abuja, and staff for their selflessness and generosity in discharging their duties.\n\n\u201cWishing everyone merry Christmas in advance! #OUK #KeepHopeAlive\u201d.",

This shall be the last adjournment,\u201d the judge warned.\n\nHe then adjourned the matter until Jan. 11, 2022, for report of settlement or hearing. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that AMCON, in a writ of summons marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/387/2021 dated and filed on June 24, had sued the governor of Adamawa and the, Attorney-General (AG) as 1st and 2nd defendants.\n\nAlso Joined in the suit include the Commissioner of Health, Permanent Secretary of Ministry of Health, and the Ministry of Health as 3rd to 5th defendants respectively.\n\nAMCON, through his lawyer, Paul Okache, had alleged that the 5th defendant (Ministry of Health) sometimes in July, 2015 approached a bank for an overdraft facility when it was in dire need of financial assistance.\n\nHe said after several appeal, the Union Bank eventually raised the overdraft facility. He told the court that despite several demands by the bank, the facility and the accrued interest had remained unpaid.\n\nRespondents thereafter engaged the services of Abbas El-Yakub & Co. to among other things demand payment of the facility.\n\nNAN reports that Justice Ekwo had, on June 24, granted AMCON\u2019s ex-parte application seeking an interlocutory order to freeze the respondents/debtors accounts in not less than 17 commercial banks.\n\nALSO READ: FG laments $1.3bn spent annually on dairy importation \u2015 Abubakar\n\nBut the state government had filed a preliminary objection challenging the jurisdiction of the court to hear the matter, saying such case should be filed at the state where the cause of action took place.\n\nThe judge had given them a time to resolve the matter and adjourned the matter.\n\nAt the resumed proceeding, Okache told the court that the settlement option had failed as there was no seriousness on the part of the defendants.\n\nThe lawyer to the state government, Thliza, explained that the settlement process was ongoing and a five-man committee had been constituted by her client.\n\n\u201cWe could not call the claimant because we are yet to finish with terms of settlement,\u201d she said.\n\nThe judge then asked her the date of the last sitting.\u201cIt was Oct. 6 my lord,\u201d she said.\u201cYou think this is a joke?

It is a lack of love among the citizenry that is responsible for all these challenges.\n\n\u201cWhen we love genuinely, things will get better in Nigeria. It is love that will make someone put others first. I am not doing this for politics but for love and to assist the less privileged because I will remain a man of God for life.\n\n\u201cSome of these things being distributed will go to some mosques and churches in the town other than CAC, that is how it should be.\n\n\u201cWe must seek for love, if there is no genuine love it will be difficult for us to experience perfect peace and rest in our land\u201d.\n\nOn the need for Nigerian leaders to always show love to the people by delivering good governance, he said, \u201d If a governor has a genuine love for his people, he will do the right thing that will speak for him while in office and when they are no longer there.\n\n\u201cIt is love that people saw in people like Chief Obafemi Awolowo which make them identify with him and continued to eulogise them even after their death several years ago.\n\n\u201cIf late Chief Awolowo did not love his people, he will not establish the best university, first television station in Africa and gave free education to the people. It is because they love the people and the nation. This kind of love is lacking today, that why you will see blood brothers taking arms against each other because of political position, even in the Christendom, there is segregation\u201d.\n\nHe, however, urged Nigerians to work hard to become somebody in order to be a source of blessing to others.\n\n\u201cThe time has come to give back to society.

We can\u2019t be a terror organisation and still maintain presence in over 100 countries.\n\n\u201cNigeria keeps releasing real terrorists who are still fighting and killing their citizens including security agents without reasons, yet at the same time framing up innocent freedom seekers as terrorists just to implicate them and discredit their global reputation. But they will never succeed.\n\n\u201cChinese government and the people of China should know that Biafrans are peace-loving and hospitable. We don\u2019t spill blood. We are enterprising people scattered across the surface of the earth.\n\n\u201cThere is hardly any country on earth where Biafrans are not residing and thriving with their legitimate businesses even in China. They should check if we have been linked with any barbarity like kidnapping in any part of the globe. How come it is in Nigeria that we will resort to such criminality?

          "title": "Rich countries are to blame for omicron",
          "text": "The saddest thing about the emergence of the omicron variant is its utter predictability. For months, even longer, public health officials have been warning that as long as the coronavirus can circulate freely and widely, it would change its form, and that those mutations could be more difficult to handle than the original variant. In October, former British prime minister, Gordon Brown predicted this. He said: \u201cWe in the West may feel safe and blessed at the moment, because we\u2019ve had the vaccines, but we may find a new variant that comes out of Africa or Asia, where people have not been vaccinated and are not protected. And it obviously isn\u2019t susceptible to the vaccines that we have at the moment.\u201d\n\nThe solution was also utterly obvious: to vaccinate the rest of the world \u2014 and fast. But that never happened, and the resulting disparities are stunning. Close to 70 percent of the European Union and about 60 percent of the United States have been fully vaccinated, and yet only about eight percent of people in the world\u2019s poorest countries have received even one dose. Earlier this year, this failure could be attributed to a problem of production and supply. But the world is now producing 1.5 billion doses of vaccine monthly. The problem has been one of distribution \u2014 or, to put it bluntly, of the rich world hoarding vaccines at the expense of the poor. By the end of September this year, the rich countries of the world \u2014 United States, European Union, United Kingdom, Canada and China \u2014 were estimated to have a surplus of around 670 million doses of vaccines, according to the health data company Airfinity. And this is accounting for every person over 12 in these countries being fully vaccinated plus receiving a booster.\n\nIt\u2019s estimated that 100 million of the doses stored by Western countries will expire and have to be thrown away by the end of the year if they are not used \u2014 and yet they sit stockpiled while the poorest 1.6 billion people in the world have only about five percent of the world\u2019s vaccinations.\n\nThis is not a case of global institutions failing. There exists an effective mechanism to share and distribute the vaccines worldwide, COVAX, set up by a group of international health organizations. But rich countries have been stingy about actually making donations. The United States pledged the most \u2014 1.2 billion doses \u2014 but so far has delivered just around 280 million. The European Union, Iceland and Norway have collectively pledged about 500 million doses and delivered about 112 million. China has recently increased its pledge to 850 million doses, up from 100 million, and has delivered about 89 million. As a result, 82 countries are at risk of falling short of the World Health Organization\u2019s goal of vaccinating 40 percent of every country\u2019s population by the end of the year, which means that the virus will keep replicating and mutating freely among billions of people.\n\nWhat is the chance that we will not see another variant in the next year?\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nVaccinating the world would be good for the world economy \u2014 meaning mostly the rich countries that dominate it. In May, the International Monetary Fund released a proposal that calculated that vaccinating everyone by 2022 would cost $50 billion. But a failure to do so could cost the world $9 trillion by 2025. Put another way, an investment of 0.06 percent of global gross domestic product could have a 180-fold return.\n\nCovid-19 and public health are not the only areas where we see a self-destructive nationalism at work. The hot economic topic these days is inflation and what is causing it. The Biden administration\u2019s covid relief spending is often blamed for triggering it, and it has almost certainly played some role. Strikingly, though, we see rising inflation almost everywhere, including in countries that did not spend freely after the pandemic. So what could explain global inflation?\n\nProtectionist policies such as Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China and President Biden\u2019s Buy American. Former treasury secretary Lawrence H. Summers recently wrote that, \u201cTariff reduction is the most important supply-side policy the administration could undertake to combat inflation.\u201d\n\nThe connection between rising protectionism and inflation is obvious. For the past three decades, countries have been aggressively sourcing goods from across the world because they are cheaper. Once they began reshoring, finding domestic supplies and putting in place versions of Biden\u2019s \u201cBuy American\u201d provisions, they are paying more for those same goods. Add to this supply chain disruptions and sudden increases in demands for goods and you have inflation rising everywhere. Just last week, the Biden administration doubled tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber.\n\nSo far, the rhetoric of nationalism has been cheap. But as countries have turned that rhetoric into policy, the costs are mounting. They are being felt by the poorest in the world and will hurt the working classes in rich countries the most. The answer is greater global cooperation \u2014 in public health, trade and more. But will any national leader dare to say this?",

We must be a united country. The Southeast should put up their team, move around and lobby. They have a genuine quest like every other geo-political zone.\n\n\u201cIf they lobby, they will be surprised what Nigerians will say and do. For ACF, we will always show understanding to whatever is in the best interest of Nigeria.\u201d.\n\nOn the declaration of bandits as terrorists, Ogbe, a former Peoples Democratic Party national chairman and Agriculture minister, said, \u201cit is a good decision to declare bandits as terrorists.\u201d\n\nHe described as \u201cbarbaric,\u201d the incident in Sokoto in which travellers were set ablaze in Sokoto.\n\nOgbe attributed the insecurity in the country to failure of the government to boost the economy, reduce the high cost of living, and stem unemployment.\n\n\u201cUnemployed youths now migrate to the city and mostly for lack of what to do, take into drugs and ended up taking solace in criminality. We encourage the security agencies to improve on their present efforts to end these senseless killings and all forms of criminalities,\u201d he said.\n\nResponding to the ACF\u2019s advice to the Southeast, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, said: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong about it.

So, we are moving about.\n\n\u201cWe want to use this opportunity to remind the ACF that in 1959, the Igbo through Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe supported the North.\n\n\u201cTwenty years after in 1979, the Igbo through Alex Ekwueme, Kingsley Mbadiwe, and others also supported the North which saw the emergence of Alhaji Shehu Shagari as the president.\n\n\u201cAnother 20 years after, the Igbo supported President Olusegun Obasanjo, and thereafter, we supported Umaru Yar\u2019adua and later Dr. Goodluck Jonathan.\n\n\u201cWe have always been supporting others.

          "text": "BY PHILIP NWOSU\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday laid the keel for two warship to be built at the Naval Dockyard in Lagos by Nigerian Navy engineers.\n\nThe laying of the keel came on heel of the commissioning of the third Seaward Defence Boat (SDB) christened NNS OJI, built by naval engineers at the Naval Dockyard Limited.\n\nThe locally built warship NNS Oji, is the third of its series to be built at the Naval Dockyard Limited, Lagos solely by Navy engineers after the successes of NNS Adoni, and NNS Karaduwa which were commissioned in 2012 and 2016 respectively.\n\nSpeaking at the event, , President Buhari said the new inductions to the Naval fleet would boost the force\u2019s capability in securing Nigeria\u2019s maritime domain.\n\nHe charged all naval personnel to maintain professionalism and ensure good use of the newly built and recently acquired platforms including NNS LANA, KANO, IKENNE, ABA, SOKOTO and OSUN.\n\nHis word: \u2018\u2018We should note that we are in a critical period where our country is faced with a serious decline in our revenue and the security challenges we are facing.\n\n\u2018\u2018The present realities, therefore, call for prudent resource management, innovativeness, accountability and careful maintenance.\n\n\u2018\u2018I wish to reiterate that despite these challenges, our administration is very determined to ensure that the Navy is well supported to achieve its statutory responsibilities.\n\n\u2018\u2018Let me assure you that the Government will continue to support the ideals of the Nigerian Navy in the performance of its constitutional duties. God bless the Nigerian Navy, God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Onward Together.\u201d\n\nBuhari commended the Nigerian Navy for maintaining a steady course in its drive for local content development which is in tandem with the philosophy of this administration.\n\nHe said the Federal Government\u2019s commitment to properly equip the Navy with the right mix of platforms has seen the Service take delivery of NNS LANA in May this year from France.\n\n\u2018\u2018I commend the business dependability of Messrs OCEA Shipyard \u2013 France, the builders of our Navy\u2019s first-ever purpose-built Offshore Survey Vessel for a conclusive and successful execution of the contract.\n\n\u2018\u2018Local partners should share in this commendation for their efforts at local facilitation as outlined in the Government\u2019s local content policy,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nPresident Buhari acknowledged that the Federal Government is aware of the Navy\u2019s dedication towards ensuring the security of the vast oil and gas industry in the nation\u2019s maritime environment as well as sea lanes of communications.\n\nAccording to him, given the present high dependence on oil and gas revenues, the Navy is undeniably a major contributor to the economic well-being of Nigeria.\n\n\u2018\u2018Arrests of those involved in illegalities have yielded results as some pirates, illegal bunkering syndicates, pipeline vandals and other miscreants have been convicted during this year.\n\n\u2018\u2018Such successes were made possible through the enforcement of our new anti-piracy law on Suppression of Piracy and Other Maritime Offences Act 2019.\n\n\u2018\u2018Furthermore, the provision of the new policy directives by the current administration of the Navy codified in such documents as the Nigerian Navy Strategic Plan 2021-2030; the Chief of the Naval Staff Strategic Directive 2021-5 and the Total Spectrum Maritime Strategy have given the Service credible guidelines and leverage for improved operational efficiency,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nBuhari also used the occasion to laud the Navy\u2019s efforts in the fight against maritime crimes in the Gulf of Guinea region, praising the Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral AZ Gambo and all the officers, ratings and civilian staff of the Navy for remarkable achievements.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "title": "Mass protest rocks north over insecurity",
          "text": "From Fred Ezeh, Abuja\n\nThere was temporary unrest in some northern states, notably, Katsina, Bauchi, Kano and Abuja, on Friday, following peaceful protest by some aggrieved people, mostly women over unending killings in northern Nigeria.\n\nThere are indications that people from Kaduna, Gombe, Yobe and Kebbi states would join the protest tomorrow, while Sokoto and Zamfara states would join once they are done with the necessary arrangements.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nIn Abuja, the aggrieved young women and men converged at the Unity Fountain, Abuja, bearing placards with several inscriptions written in Hausa Language, chanting solidarity songs to call for local and global attention on the ongoing \u201cgenocide\u201d in northern Nigeria.\n\nThe women vowed to continued the protest next week access until realistic solutions are provided by the government to end the growing banditry and other criminal activities that had crippled the economy of the north and had led to the death of thousands of people, and communities destroyed.\n\nThe Convener, Rahama Abdulmajid, told Saturday Sun that they have kept quiet enough about the ongoing \u201carmed war\u201d in northern Nigeria, hence their decision to raise local and global attention to the insecurity in the north.\n\nShe said: \u201cWe are out this time to raise global attention on the level of human carnage going on in northern Nigeria. Evidently, lives are not long valuable in Nigeria. People are being slaughtered daily like chicken and nobody is saying anything about it. We are tired of this killings and we will continue this protest until steps are taken to end this.\n\nToday (Friday), the protest was successfully held simultaneously across four northern states of Katsina, Bauchi, Kano and Abuja. On Saturday, there will be similar protest in Kaduna, Gombe, Yobe and Kebbi. Sokoto and Zamfara states are still making arrangements for theirs. In no distant time, we, the 19 northern states, would all assemble for joint protest.\n\n\u201cWe would continue this protest until we see concrete action to end this killings going on in northern Nigeria.\u201d\n\nOne of the protesters, Zainab Binti Hijazi, however, told DW Hausa, that gradually, people are becoming more confident, bold and confrontational against harassment and intimidation of the Police against protesters who are peacefully seeking justice.\n\nShe said: \u201cPeople have been afraid to speak truth to the government on the level of daily unreported or underreported killings in northern Nigeria. But I think we can\u2019t take that any more. We are out here to take our destinies in our own hands. It\u2019s better we die with our dignity intact than to be slaughtered like chickens as being experienced in some communities where people are killed in their sleep, markets, roads, and other locations recklessly.\u201d\n\nShe suggested that government use loans being procured from foreign countries and other financial institutions to purchase modern arms and other weapons to prosecute the war against banditry in the north.\n\nShe said: \u201cWe appreciate the efforts of the President in the fight against insurgency. He should drop every other thing on his table and face the issue of insecurity before we are all consumed. We didn\u2019t elect him to inflict economic pains on us neither was he elected to increase fuel price, VAT and other things.\u201d\n\nShe advised government to reduce the huge presence of security officials attached to VIPs and unnecessary locations like the Unity Fountain, Abuja, and redeploy them to areas that require their services after relevant trainings.\n\nShe said: \u201cWhen we came to start this peaceful protest, they confronted us and denied us entry. They insist that we are not allowed to carry out protest in the place. After several confrontations, they allowed us but rejected the option of going beyond the Unity Fountain to, maybe, Three Arms Zone for whatever reason.\n\n\u201cHowever, we would not relent. We would continue this protest because armed enemies have risen against our communities and the people, and we should take action to defend ourselves, otherwise, we would wake up one day and discover that we have lost our inheritance to criminals.\n\nMeanwhile, a security expert, Dr. Yahuza Geso, who was part of the first day of the protest, lamented the level of wickedness against people in the north by bandits most of whom he alleged are known to the government.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have said it repeatedly that if government claims not to know these people, we would show them where they are as long our identities are protected. There about 126 towns and villages that I know, you can\u2019t move a kilometer without seeing somebody hanging AK-47 riffle on his shoulder.\n\n\u201cFew days ago, some travellers were burnt alive inside the bus they were traveling with. It may interest you to know that the people that were burnt in that bus in Sokoto were fleeing refugees whose original inhabitation were destroyed by the criminals in some parts of the north.\u201d\n\nHe expressed confidence in the capacity of the government forces to tackle the security challenges, but pointed to the fact that most of the security agents drafted to fight the war lack the necessary motivation, welfare and other things that would boost their morale and encourage them to confront the criminals.\n\nHe, however, disclosed that the criminals have begun to recruit children from the IDP camps and other local communities whom they train for further criminals.\n\n\u201cMany of the elites in the north have ran to hide in Abuja, Lagos and other \u2018safe\u2019 locations but I can confirm to you that no one is safe anymore because Abuja is also feeling the heat of the insecurity.\u201d\n\nHe assured government of citizens support if only they would be sincere in their approach against the criminals. \u201cFor instance, people have volunteered information in the past but there were exposed by the security agents, thus endangering their lives. These are discouraging factors.\u201d\n\nRecall that on Thursday, Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammadu Sa\u2019ad Abubakar, raised the alarm that northern Nigeria was fast turning to killing field by armed bandits and other terrorists operating in the region.\n\nThe Sultan who spoke in Abuja, at the opening ceremony of the fourth quarterly meeting of the Nigeria Inter-Religious Council (NIREC), with the theme \u2018NIREC, Security Agencies and Peace in Nigeria\u2019 indicated that the bandits are holding the region spellbound especially northwest, and accused elites of being responsible for the unending security challenges in Nigeria.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe need to sit down and talk about ourselves. We need to come up with possible solutions to the problems of Nigeria, particularly as regards rising insecurity. In this room, we are the minority, we are the elites and the elites are the problems of this country because we always want things to go our way\u201d, he said.\n\nThe Sultan lamented that terrorists unleash terror on communities and kill people on a daily basis in north \u201cfreely\u201d, and should be stopped forthwith.\n\nHe said: \u201cEvidently, Nigeria is faced with series of challenges, and if leaders doesn\u2019t wake up, come together to understand the issues facing the country, the challenges might escalate and possibly consume all.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not deceive ourselves, everything is not alright in our country, and I have spoken about repeatedly in different fora. To know that you have a problem means you have part of the solution. The earlier we rise to the occasion, come together, the better for us.\u201d\n\nThe Sultan reminded some religious leaders of the enormous respect, loyalty and followership they command, hence they should guide their utterances and actions particularly towards their followers to avoid unnecessary bitterness and incitement.\n\n\u201cWe have to be careful in the way we handle, say and do things as religious leaders. We are not political leaders, and therefore, we have to be weary of what we say, where and how we say such things, because our followers will definitely believe in what we say and feel that it is from the Holy Koran or the Holy Bible.\u201d\n\nPresident, Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Dr. Samson Ayokunle Olasupo, in his remarks, complained about the activities of kidnappers and other criminals on Nigerian roads.\n\n\u201cTravelling on Nigerian roads has become a very great risk now. Kidnapper are everywhere and they don\u2019t only come out to kidnap but also to kill. So, you don\u2019t know who the next victim is going to be.\n\n\u201cWhy should these people be killing and hiding people in our territory without being challenged? Why should it be easy for them to hide people somewhere within the state and the security agencies in the state within few days or weeks will not be able to fish them out?\u201d, he queried.\n\nThe CAN President who is the Co-Chairman of NIREC, thus, advocated intelligence gathering to tackle the challenge.\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates).

The airline wants to operate 14 weekly flights to Lagos and another seven weekly to Abuja airports.\n\n\u201cHowever, Air Peace only requested for three weekly flights to Sharjah, not even Dubai airport, but the CAA refused the airline. The CAA only approved one weekly frequency to the airline. The only excuse they gave was that they don\u2019t have enough slots. Where is the justice in this? That is capital flight out of Nigeria. Nigeria should protect its own.\u201d\n\nNCAA in a statement signed by the Director General also recalled that following the lifting of the ban on Emirates Airline passenger flights to Nigeria by the Government, the UAE based airline applied to Federal Ministry of Aviation for approval of its Winter Flight Schedule.\n\nThe requested schedule consisted of twenty-one (21) weekly passenger flight frequ\u2026\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Decries military threat to democracy in W\u2019Africa\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nWith barely 18 months to the end of his eight-year rule, President Muhammadu Buhari, on Friday assured the international community of the readiness of his government to hand over the reins of power to winners of free and fair general election in Nigeria by 2023.\n\nHe also declared that democratic rule in the West African sub region is currently being threatened by undemocratic takeover of government by the military.\n\nSpeaking at a Virtual Summit for Democracy organized by President Joe Biden of the United States, President Buhari said necessary mechanisms will be strengthened to ensure that Nigeria witnesses another peaceful transfer of power by May 29, 2023.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs we count down to our next general election in 2023, we remain committed to putting in place and strengthening all necessary mechanisms to ensure that Nigeria will not only record another peaceful transfer of power to an elected democratic government, but will also ensure that the elections are conducted in a free, fair and transparent manner.\n\n\u201cI am proud to state that Nigeria has had over two decades of uninterrupted democratic governance and has unequivocally remained committed to upholding the core values and principles of democracy.\n\n\u201cSince assuming office in 2015, we have been able to introduce mechanisms to ensure free, fair and credible elections. We have strengthened our key anti-corruption agencies in collaboration with international partners and have undertaken several anti-corruption measures and initiatives.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, Nigeria continues to face security challenges which pose a threat to democracy, and therefore called \u201con global partners to support our efforts in tackling insurgency and terrorism\u201d.\n\nPresident Buhari thanked President Biden, the government and people of the United States for hosting the summit.\n\n\u201cAs you are aware, democracy has remained the most popular and universally recognised way of governance thus far.

          "title": "NCAA: Why Nigeria Reduced Emirates\u2019 Flights from 21 to One Weekly",
          "text": "Chinedu Eze\n\nThe Director General of the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), Captain Musa Nuhu has confirmed that Emirates Airlines flight operations to Lagos has been suspended, while it is allowed to operate once in a week to Abuja.\n\nThe Director General explained to aviation correspondents in Lagos Friday that government decided to respond to the way United Arab Emirates (UAE) treated Nigerian airline, Air Peace, saying that it is the responsibility of government to protect Nigerian businesses.\n\nUAE reduced Air Peace request for three times weekly flight to one, claiming it did not have enough slots for the airline.\n\nNuhu said that NCAA withdrew the approval to Emirates following the refusal of the General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA) of UAE to grant equal rights to the sole Nigerian carrier, Air Peace flying to Dubai via Sharjah.\n\nNuhu explained that the Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika, had graciously granted Emirates Airlines 21 frequencies weekly to two major airports in Nigeria; Lagos, 14 and Abuja, seven.\n\nHe regretted that despite this approval, the GCAA refused to grant Air Peace three weekly frequencies to Sharjah, which the airline requested for, but rather approved just one frequency weekly.\n\nAccording to him, the GCAA had attributed its refusal to grant the three frequencies to the airline to inadequate slots in Sharjah airport, stressing that the government would continue to protect Nigeria\u2019s businesses.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Government was gracious to grant Emirates Airlines 21 frequencies it requested for. The airline wants to operate 14 weekly flights to Lagos and another seven weekly to Abuja airports.\n\n\u201cHowever, Air Peace only requested for three weekly flights to Sharjah, not even Dubai airport, but the CAA refused the airline. The CAA only approved one weekly frequency to the airline. The only excuse they gave was that they don\u2019t have enough slots. Where is the justice in this? That is capital flight out of Nigeria. Nigeria should protect its own.\u201d\n\nNCAA in a statement signed by the Director General also recalled that following the lifting of the ban on Emirates Airline passenger flights to Nigeria by the Government, the UAE based airline applied to Federal Ministry of Aviation for approval of its Winter Flight Schedule.\n\nThe requested schedule consisted of twenty-one (21) weekly passenger flight frequencies to Nigeria, comprising of two daily flights to Murtala Mohammed Airport, Lagos and one daily flight to Nnamdi Azikwe International Airport, Abuja.\n\n\u201cThe Honourable Minister of Aviation graciously approved the Winter Schedule as requested without any hindrance or arrival slots requirements in the spirit and intent of the Bilateral Air Services Agreement (BASA) between Nigeria and UAE.\n\n\u201cAir Peace Airlines, the only Nigerian airline that operates passenger flights to Sharjah International Airport in UAE, requested for three weekly passenger flight frequencies and was granted only one weekly passenger flight frequency. The Director General of General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA) attributed this action due to non-availability of arrival slots at Sharjah International Airport,\u201d the statement said.\n\nNCAA explained that Bilateral Air Services Agreement (BASA) between countries are based on the principle of reciprocity for transparency and fairness to both sides, noting that while Nigerian Authorities approved the request of Emirates Airlines, UAE Authorities acted in total disregard of the terms and provisions of the BASA between the two countries by approving one out of the three weekly passenger flight frequencies requested by Air Peace Airlines.\n\n\u201cDG NCAA held a meeting with his GCAA (UAE) counterpart on Thursday 9th December 2021 at the sidelines of the ICAO Air Negotiation Conference (ICAN) in Bogota, Colombia which ended in a stalemate.\n\n\u201cThe Honourable Minister of Aviation decided to apply the principle of reciprocity and withdraw the approval of the Winter Schedule given to Emirates Airlines and instead approved one weekly flight frequency to Abuja on Thursday. The DG NCAA notified The Country Manager of Emirates Airlines and DG GCAA of the new approved weekly passenger flight schedule.\n\n\u201cWe want to assure the public that national interests in all aviation matters will be jealously guided and protected while regretting any inconvenience this action might\n\nReacting to the action of the federal government, many industry stakeholders commended government for the decision to withdraw Emirates flights from Lagos and leaving one flight a week to Abuja, saying that the principle of reciprocity encourages countries to respect one another.\n\nIndustry analyst and the publicity secretary of Aviation Round Table (ART), Olu Ohunayo, told THISDAY that what the Nigerian government did was commendable, noting that the he hopes that the Nigerian government would not dissolve the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19 (PSC) because the committee has done so much for aviation.\n\n\u201cWhat the federal government has done has not happened before in the industry and I applaud the PSC because they have given a bite to the aviation industry. The aviation industry is about reciprocity; that is what is used to negotiate power with nations.\n\n\u201cI have said it before and I stand on it. When you designate a carrier to represent you. That carrier, irrespective of the ownership, becomes the flag of Nigeria as long as it is representing Nigeria. Once it is your flag, all the support you can give to your national carrier you give to that airline that is carrying your flag; except it is going on a private charter. So the designated airline must get the same protection as British Airways, it must get the same protection as Emirates.\n\n\u201cI am happy I am seeing this in my life time. It is the time to call the bluff of Emirates,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Akande: Buhari Promised to Pick Tinubu as Running Mate in 2015, Then Reneged",
          "text": "*Chronicles how Osinbajo eventually emerged\n\n*Former gov attacks Adebanjo, Falae, others\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nFormer Governor of Osun state and ex-interim Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief Bisi Akande, yesterday narrated how Gen. Muhammadu Buhari, as he then was, the presidential candidate of the party at the time, promised to pick Bola Tinubu as his running mate in the 2015 election.\n\nChronicling the events that led to the eventual selection of Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, Akande, in his autobiography, \u201cMy Participations\u201d, published by Gaskia Media Limited, disclosed how Buhari who was then under pressure to drop the former Lagos governor, later reneged on the agreement.\n\nIn the book which was launched in Lagos, the octogenarian also took a swipe at the trio of Ayo Adebanjo, Olu Falae and Sir Olaniwun Ajayi, coming short of accusing them of selecting themselves to represent the Yoruba people during Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s National Conference because of what he termed \u201cgenerous allowances.\u201d\n\nAkande stressed that despite the pledge to make Tinubu his vice presidential candidate, Buhari later faltered, saying that he only said that he wanted the former Lagos governor to \u201cpartner with him.\u201d\n\nBut the politician admitted that at the time Buhari was under enormous pressure, especially from some northern governors who insisted that a Muslim-Muslim ticket arrangement was a no-go area.\n\nHe revealed that it would be the second time that Tinubu would be getting very close to becoming a vice presidential candidate, noting that the first time was in when Atiku Abubakar, who was then contesting as president later chose Ben Obi.\n\nAkande confirmed that Tinubu was instrumental to the emergence of Osinbajo as running mate to Buhari after he was formally dropped and asked to submit three names from the South-west from which Buhari would pick one.\n\nAccording to the book, Buhari at a point during the formation of the APC started to admire Tinubu for his business acumen and his ability to organise people, key features that got then candidate Buhari close to the APC national leader.\n\n\u201cIn April 2014, I was in Abuja when Buhari called me and asked me to persuade Bola to run with him. Governor Masari was the one who came to call me. When I followed him into Buhari\u2019s private lobby, Bola Tinubu was already seated there.\n\n\u201cSo, when Buhari tabled the matter, I cautioned them that this must not get out beyond the four of us. \u2018How could he be talking of a running mate when he had not secured the ticket?\u201d I mused.\n\n\u201cI thought such information, if leaked to the general public, might affect the conduct of the party\u2019s congress at the presidential primaries, if not its choice of candidate. I thanked Buhari for thinking so highly of our friend.\n\n\u201cBola later told me that Buhari\u2019s emissaries had been coming to him, but he tried to dodge the gesture and not to show interest. We agreed that we would reopen the matter when Buhari had secured the ticket,\u201d he explained.\n\nHowever, he expressed surprise that thereafter, when Buhari became the party\u2019s candidate, things changed, with former APC chair, Odigie Oyegun, who was supported by Tinubu to become chairman of the party, asking for names from the geopolitical zones from where Buhari will pick his running mate.\n\n\u201cHe said it was from this list that Buhari would choose a running mate. I objected. I turned to Buhari. \u2018General, where are you choosing your running mate from?\u2019 He answered, \u2018The South-west.\u2019 \u2018Oh! I didn\u2019t know,\u2019Oyegun said. He apologised.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know why Oyegun made that proposition and at whose behest. As the chairman of the party, maybe some people pushed him to do that,\u201d he noted.\n\nAkande continued: \u201cThen, I called Buhari aside. \u2018Is our arrangement still standing?\u2019 I referred him to our discussion in April. He said yes! \u201c\n\nAccording to him some members of the party eventually agreed that a committee should be set up to search for Buhari\u2019s running , a move himself and former Governor of Edo state, Adams Oshiohmhole, opposed.\n\n\u201cAdams Oshiohmhole , then Governor of Edo State, stood up and said we were being dishonest. He said he was a serving governor and many of those in the Elders Committee had been governors.\n\n\u2018\u2019Did we set up a committee to give us our running mates?\u2019 He asked. \u2018It is not fair!\u2019 He further said what we were pushing was a dangerous act and that we should allow Buhari to choose his running mate. So, we left,\u201d he narrated\n\nAkande stated that he later came to know that some people constituted themselves into a group, called the Northern Interest Group, and they prevailed on Buhari not to allow a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\nAccording to him, it was the following day after the Elders\u2019 Committee meeting which was deadlocked, that Buhari phoned Tinubu to give him three names from which he would pick a running mate.\n\n\u201cWe were all in Abuja and Tinubu rushed to me with this information. He wanted to know whether the understanding we reached with Buhari had changed. I called Buhari and he told me he now needed three names from us. I was angry with him.\n\n\u2018\u2018General, this was not what we agreed upon,\u2019 I said in annoyance. \u2018You are changing our agreement?\u2019 He knew I was getting angry. He said he was under pressure from some governors from the north, including those who were Muslims. I told him the slot belonged to the South-West and among the Yoruba, religion is not a factor in leadership,\u201d he said.\n\nAkande added: \u201cOshiomhole was surprised about the narration. \u2018If indeed you promised to make Asiwaju your running mate, it would not be fair to renege,\u2019 he said. Buhari now said he never meant it that way. What he meant originally was that Tinubu should partner with him.\u201d\n\nThe former Osun governor explained that he didn\u2019t know what that meant because before they discussed the issue of Tinubu as the partner or vice-president\u2019s ticket, a merger had been accomplished and they had already partnered.\n\n\u201cWe were registered in July 2013, and he called me to prevail on Tinubu to be his running mate in April 2014. Buhari knew I was upset but we tried to manage the situation. Perhaps he was overwhelmed by all those pressures. We decided to let him go,\u201d Akande said.\n\nHe insisted that once it became apparent that Buhari would be the presidential candidate, he was interested in making Tinubu his running mate.\n\n\u201cIn our years of interactions and engagements, he seemed to have come to know and admire Tinubu.\n\n\u201cHe constantly seemed to admire Tinubu\u2019s business acumen; his courage in politics, his large heart, his native intelligence, his readiness to forgive those who have betrayed him but who now show remorse, his empathy for the under-privileged, his capacity as a tactician, and a strategist of the highest hue, his loyalty to the ideas of Nigerian unity and good governance, and his steadfastness to his friends,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to him, without Tinubu, the \u201cAPC miracle\u201d would have been more difficult if not impossible. \u201cAll these made Buhari to admire and respect him,\u201d he said.\n\nHe narrated that what prompted the push for a Tinubu as vice president for the first time under Atiku was that anytime they said they needed money, Atiku would say \u201cBola please help us\u201d.\n\n\u201cBola (Tinubu) was the only one spending the money among us. The rest of us were poor. Tinubu also put all his energy and resources into the formation of the AC and we felt he deserved a spot on the ticket,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHe also wrote about Tinubu\u2019s frustration with the entire rigmarole, eventually opting to leave Abuja for Lagos.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be part of whatever you are discussing now, \u2018he said. \u2018I don\u2019t trust Buhari anymore! Even if we give him names, he may decide to go outside the list. So, let him choose on his own. He was unhappy with Buhari.\n\n\u201cI told him that was not the attitude to adopt. We were trying to toy with some names and I wanted him to participate in the discussion. After some time, Amosun, Aregbesola and I were considering some names. Then I decided to call Tinubu again.\n\n\u2018We negotiated with Buhari in 2011 and gave him a name to choose instead of Pastor Bakare,\u2019 I spoke to Tinubu on phone. \u2018Who was that person?\u2019 l asked.\n\n\u2018It was Yemi Osinbajo,\u2019 Tinubu declared. I asked Aregbesola to find out where Osinbajo was. He called him on the phone. \u2018Yemi, where are you?\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t you know your case is coming up tomorrow?\u2019 \u2018l am in Abuja to argue your case.\u2019 Osinbajo answered at the other end. \u2018Which hotel are you staying?\u201d Osinbajo told him.\n\n\u201cI got a blank sheet of paper and wrote Yemi Osinbajo on it. I instructed Amosun and Aregbesola to deliver that note to Buhari immediately. It was almost midnight. Then the two of them left.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cI was waiting for Buhari to call me after he must have received my message. He did not. It was Tinubu who came to me at the wee hours of the morning. He was not in a good mood and was worried that Buhari might visit our efforts with bad faith.\n\n\u201cLet us go back to Lagos\u201d, he said. Why? I asked. \u201cMaybe Buhari has his own agenda,\u201d he said. Even if we give him a name , he might not use the person. Maybe he just wants to use us for whatever his agenda might be.\u201d\n\n\u201cI reassured him that Buhari will not disappoint us and that he would agree with our choice as the vice presidential candidate of our party,\u201d Akande said.\n\nTaking a swipe at the trio of Adebanjo, Ajayi and Falae, Akande said it was surprising that the elders could not find any younger Yoruba to send to the conference to represent the interest of the ethnic group.\n\n\u201c They believed, even in their old age, that they were the only people who could have gone there. Sir Ajayi, who was close to 90 at the time of the conference, has since joined his ancestors. Chief Adebanjo celebrated his 90th birthday in 2018. Chief Falae is in his 80s. Note that Jonathan paid the conference delegates generous allowances.\n\n\u201cChief Olu Falae, a trained civil servant, who after retirement became decorated into leadership by his former military bosses, has since been trying to blindly straddle Nigeria\u2019s complicated politics,\u201d he opined.\n\nHe characterised Adebanjo as a blank politically-minded leader who recognises readily and always that he never has what it takes to aspire for high political positions.\n\n\u201cHe constantly harbours lumps of yellow hate-bile in his heart for any co-political leader with brighter chances for any major public office within or outside his political party,\u201d he posited.\n\nAkande further noted in the autobiography that the APC did not have \u2018restructuring\u2019 in its manifesto for the 2015 elections but promised to support devolution of powers from the centre to the States.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore mischievous to place the responsibility for effecting restructuring on the APC or its presidency and not to appreciate that it would require deft negotiations among such members from different ethnic nationalities and constituencies or zonal and religious background before any political party or any ethnic nationality could successfully issue any fiat on the National Assembly to make laws on power devolution or on restructuring, whatever it might connote,\u201d he argued.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The Yobe State Police Command has said troops of the Nigerian Army didn\u2019t rescue 20 Nigerian Police Force personnel as claimed by the military.\n\nThe Acting Director, Defence Media Operations, Brig Gen Bernard Onyeuko, had in a statement on Thursday said troops of Operation Hadin Kai rescued the 20 policemen allegedly abducted by suspected terrorists.\n\nFile Photo\n\nHe had said, \u201cCumulatively, a total 62 terrorist elements were neutralized and 28 of them were arrested, while 54 assorted arms and 144 rounds of different calibre of ammunitions were recovered. Also, a total of 101 rustled livestock were recovered and 20 kidnapped NPF personnel, who were abducted when the terrorists attacked the Police Division, were rescued by own troops at Buni Yadi within the period.\u201d\n\nReacting in a statement on Friday, the Yobe State Police Command\u2019s spokesperson, ASP Dungus Abdulkarim, asked Nigerians to \u201cdisregard, ignore the said \u2018Kidnap & Rescue Claim\u2019 as false, mischievous and fake.\u201d\n\nThe statement added, \u201cThe attention of Yobe State Police Command has been drawn to a trending news making the rounds on both social media and the mainstream media platforms to the effect that \u201cTwenty (20) Police personnel kidnapped by Boko-Haram/ISWAP Insurgents during an attack on Buni-Yadi Police Division in Gujba Local Government Area of the state were rescued by troops of the Nigerian Army (Operation Hadin Kai).\u201d\n\n\u201cThe news item was further replicated in many online publications. It\u2019s disheartening to note that this fake news/story has been published in many media outlets, without seeking for clarification from the requisite police authorities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s even more worrisome that such a misleading story is alleged to have emanated from military sources.\n\n\u201cHowever, in view of the sensitive nature of the issue, and the prevalent security situation in the state, it\u2019s deemed imperative that such negative impression must be erased from the minds of the public by setting the records straight. It\u2019s equally important that the actual facts and circumstances surrounding the incident must be brought to light, for the sake of the families of police personnel serving in Yobe State.\n\n\u201cIn this regard therefore, the command wishes to reiterate as follows: The story or news item (on the alleged kidnaping of 20 police personnel in Buni-Yadi and their rescue by troops) is misleading, an utter fabrication and fake news, as no single police personnel was kidnapped from Buni-Yadi town on the day of the alleged incident, or at all; On Tuesday 30th November 2021, suspected members of Boko-Haram/ISWAP insurgents had attacked the Buni-Yadi Police Station in Gujba Local Govt. Area of the state and burnt down the structures, but there was neither any loss of life, nor was any Police personnel kidnapped, or declared missing.\n\n\u201cAll the conventional personnel of the division, as well as the PMF personnel, had been accounted after the incident; the general public is therefore, by this press release from the Yobe State Police Command, enjoined to discountenance/disregard/ignore the said \u2018Kidnap & Rescue Claim\u2019 as false, mischievous and fake.\n\n\u201cIt should be pointed out further that the said claim of \u2018rescue of the 20 personnel\u2019 had failed to disclose their identities; their ranks; the formations they belong to; or which medical facility they were taken to for check-ups; or who were they handed over to; or when and where were they handed over, etc. The absence of all these vital information in the publication means that the story is nothing but false, misleading and a misinformation.\n\n\u201cWhile reiterating the commitment and dedication of Police personnel currently serving in or deployed to Yobe State, in sustaining the relative peace and security in the State, we call on the entire members of the public to continue to cooperate and support the command, as always.\u201d",

          "title": "This may be African languages\u2019 best bet against extinction",
          "text": "The novelist Rita Mae Brown once said, \u201cLanguage is the road map of a culture. It tells you where its people come from and where they are going.\u201d If this is true, what then does an extinct language mean for its people? It means they have no culture, ancestral value, or true identity. As hyperbolic as this may sound, many languages have already gone extinct and more are predicted to join in the coming years.\n\nMore than 573 languages are extinct. The National Geographic Society says a language dies every two weeks, ceasing to be actively spoken. In Africa alone, at least 52 known languages have experienced either linguicide\u2014the death of a language due to natural or political reasons\u2014or glottophagy, which happens when a smaller language is absorbed in or replaced by a major language.\n\nIn another disturbing report, UNESCO data indicates that if no efforts are made to conserve them, half of the languages currently spoken today will be extinct by the end of the 21st century. How can this be avoided, especially for African languages? Some young Africans living and schooling in America are taking the lead in answering this question through their startup called Mandla, an app that helps people learn African languages.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nMandla, a Zulu and Xhosa word that means power, is an innovative e-learning language app created for those who seek to strengthen their connection with their African roots. The app combines education with gamification to create an enjoyable and effective experience. With the help of predictive AI, Mandla is able to personalise language lessons for all of its users.\n\nHow it started\n\nDuring the winter break of last year, Wenitte Apiou, a then freshman student of Electrical Engineering and Mathematics at the Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, shared the idea to build Mandla in a text to Boluwaji Odufuwa, another freshman studying Computer Science at Harvard University.\n\nApiou was born in Burkina Faso but moved to America when he was five. Odufuwa, on the other hand, was born in Nigeria but also moved to America in his early childhood. Because of their shared struggle with speaking and understanding their native language, Apiou\u2019s idea organically resonated with Odufuwa, and the duo launched into action.\n\nGrowing up, Apiou\u2019s family only spoke French\u2014Burkina Faso\u2019s official language\u2014and some English in the household. His parents are from two different ethnic groups: his mother speaks M\u00f2or\u00e9, the most spoken indigenous language in Burkina Faso; and his father speaks Kasem, a minority language spoken only by about 100,000 people in southern Burkina Faso and Northern Ghana.\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshots of Mandla app\n\n\u201cThe only language I\u2019m fluent in besides English is French, which makes it difficult to communicate with some of my older family members who never went to school and were not able to learn French fluently,\u201d Apiou told TechCabal in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s harder being in the United States as well. The only people that can help would have been my parents, and they did not speak those languages in the house.\u201d\n\nApiou was stuck in-between two foreign languages: French in the house and English everywhere outside the house. This is the reality of many young Africans, especially those who have parents of diverse ethnic backgrounds.\n\nEven though the idea had stuck with him since high school, Apiou couldn\u2019t do much because of school work and time barrier. He had some coding skills and had built two apps in high school, but he didn\u2019t want to start building the app and then drop it. So the winter break and the COVID-19 lockdown availed them the time to solve the problem for themselves and millions of young people in America and across the world.\n\nA diverse team building a diverse product\n\nAs the duo built, they realised they needed more diverse hands. After all, Africa has 54 countries and over 3,000 tribes. Building a diverse solution should involve a diverse team, they thought. So they sought more hands.\n\nEmeka Ezike, a sophomore Computer Science student at Harvard University, who also originally came from Nigeria, joined as the CTO. Kwesi Afrifa, born and raised in Ghana and an International student studying Computer Science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), joined to lead the web platform effort. Delanyo Mensah, a sophomore student of Human and Organisational Development at Vanderbilt University, originally from Ghana, joined to lead Mandla\u2019s growth and marketing team.\n\n\u201cWe brought a number of smart young Africans to join in the effort\u2014a few engineers and Delanyo, who\u2019s passionately pushing our growth, especially on TikTok where a bunch of our audience are,\u201d said Apiou.\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshots of Madla app\n\nToday, Mandla has grown into a 10-man core team. The startup also accepts volunteers that can help create learning content around the languages currently on its platform and upcoming ones.\n\nGrowth and challenges\n\nMandla currently has more than 15 languages including Nigeria\u2019s Yoruba and Igbo; Ghana\u2019s Twi; Ethiopian\u2019s Amharic; and East Africa\u2019s Swahili on its platform. According to Apiou, the plan is to continue adding more languages until they\u2019ve covered a large extent of African cultures.\n\nAs young founders, the natural thing is to find a way to scale on social media, and that\u2019s what the team has done; they are creating captivating content on social media, especially TikTok, which now houses over a billion users.\n\nThe app is currently growing organically and, according to Apiou, has 5,000 registered users, pegged at about 50 signups per day and about three to 400 daily active users.\n\nThe team thinks it\u2019s time to scale their technology and build a more powerful marketing strategy, from organic to paid. But the problem is funding. Apiou said they\u2019ve reached out to hundreds of investors to no avail.\n\nBut why no funding yet?\n\nApiou stated a number of reasons for this. One is \u201cbeing a black college student. In the United States, there aren\u2019t very many people looking to fund someone who has an unproven track record,\u201d he said, agreeing to his lack of experience as a major barrier. \u201cSecond is the domain, edtech. While there is a lot of VC interest in it, it\u2019s relatively new because many people don\u2019t see a path to profitability, or huge billion-dollar success for edtech companies,\u201d Apiou said.\n\nThis statement may not be completely correct, however, as there are a couple of unicorn edtech companies, like Udemy and Coursera, and even Duolingo, which is one of the startup\u2019s competitors.\n\nThe third Apiou raised is about niche: their product focuses on Africa and African languages and culture. He narrated their experience when they went to college pitch competitions. \u201cWe have not won a single pitch competition, despite the fact that\u2014and I mean no disrespect to the other teams\u2014our product has a more natural need and significant traction than some of the teams that beat us out.\u201d\n\nHowever, they have gotten some support from Angel Onuoha, a graduate of Harvard University, ex-Googler, and a serial entrepreneur who\u2019s somewhat popular for his bullish tweets on African tech.\n\nThe team believes that with more funding, they could build more tech stacks, hire more talent, and go full-frontal on their marketing efforts and then compete on a larger scale.\n\nUnlike other language learning apps that are including African languages just to check a diversity-and-inclusion box, Mandla\u2019s mission is deeper than educational or entertainment purposes; it\u2019s really about cultural preservation.\n\n\u201cAnd what better way to preserve a culture than to preserve its language?\u201d Apiou asked with the signatory laughter he had kept throughout the call.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "This article was contributed to TechCabal by Conrad Onyango, bird\n\nA preference for mobile money, the fast takeup of digital currencies, the growing allure of regulated cryptocurrencies among central banks and now, a call for a continental cryptocurrency. Could this spell the end of paper money in Africa?\n\nThe era of cash could be drawing to an end as central bank-backed digital currencies (CBDC\u201ds) takes root in Africa.\n\nThe cryptocurrency era\n\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly accelerated the use of cashless payments \u2013 mainly through mobile money platforms and online banking \u2013 the period has also ushered in widespread use of cryptocurrencies, with the result that digital currencies are fast becoming mainstream across the continent.\n\nEconomic and financial experts are the latest to rally behind the mainstreaming of cryptocurrencies through a call for a common African digital currency to spur trade and economic development post-pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe need to come up with a cryptocurrency that is acceptable to each member state. It\u2019s better to do it at the continental level, and we have the expertise to do it,\u201d Anouar Hassoune, Professor of Finance and CEO of the West Africa Rating Agency, told delegates at the 2021 African Economic Conference last week.\n\nSo far, it\u2019s only Nigeria that has launched an official, state-backed digital currency \u2013 christened the eNaira \u2013 on the continent as more countries continue to express interest.\n\nLast month, Tanzania\u2019s central bank joined a growing list of African countries to express the intention of launching its own, regulated digital currency, taking its cue from the rising adoption of cryptocurrencies and wanting to avoid \u2018being left behind.\u2019\n\nSouth Africa is currently piloting project Dunbar, an international financial settlement system that uses multiple central bank digital currencies, while Mauritius has a digital currency in the development stages.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nOther countries in Africa \u2013 including Kenya, Morocco, Tunisia and Ghana \u2013 are researching the best model to deploy in their jurisdictions, according to US think tank Atlantic Council\u2019s digital currency tracker.\n\nPanellists at last week\u2019s African Economic Conference, organized by the African Development Bank, the United Nations Development Programme, and the Economic Commission for Africa, said there would first need to be reform in the financial sector through harmonization of national rules and protocols governing the financial systems of individual countries, to make a pan-African cryptocurrency a reality.\n\n\u201cWe should not forget that there is a lot of work to be done on the digital infrastructure, the development of payment systems, payment system interoperability really needs to be worked on, so there is a lot of work to be done in collaboration with the financial institutions on digitalisation of delivery and payment channels,\u201d said Emmanuelle Riedel Drouin, head of the Economic and Financial Transition Department at Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement.\n\nA common cryptocurrency, Hassoune said, would ease the cost of doing business, give the continent an identity and serve as an alternative means to monetise some of the continent\u2019s endowments, such as gold and other commodities.\n\nNestcoin, a new African venture launched last month and headed by former Binance Labs director, Yele Bademosi, has set out to make cryptocurrencies mainstream across the continent, with a promise to make crypto accessible to anyone.\n\n\u201cThe power of crypto lies in its potential to circumvent poorly designed economic infrastructure and connect anyone to a global economy with access to unlimited financial opportunities,\u201d Bademosi said in a statement.\n\nNelly Chatue-Diop and her West African crypto startup, Ejara, made waves earlier this year with the biggest capital raise by a women-led startup in the sub-region, to date. Chatue-Diop\u2019s company provides users with a non-custodian crypto wallet (described in the industry has having your own \u201cbank\u201d) and the company\u2019s markting focus is on women in French-speaking West Africa.\n\nCurrently, three countries are driving the continent towards a cashless era, with a widespread use of both mobile money, or crypto adoption, or both, driven partly by the pandemic.\n\nThe Baobab Network has traced at least 60 cryptocurrency companies in Africa, with the majority (43 percent) of them headquartered in Nigeria, followed by South Africa (18 percent) and Kenya (11 percent).\n\nSimilarly, global digital payments solution provider Visa in a September report showed a growing preference for mobile wallets, particularly in Kenya (56 percent) followed by Nigeria (14 percent) and South Africa (7 percent).\n\nThis is affirmed by another comparative study by GSMA published in March 2021 showing more than half of 310 live mobile money services in 2020 across the globe were found in Africa.\n\nWith over 55 percent of the world\u2019s mobile money services recorded in Africa and a significant population turning to e-wallets and cryptocurrency, the question now becomes whether the continent might ditch paper money altogether.\n\nShare this article",

Its solution, which can be integrated into merchant websites, is used by a wide array of businesses, from e-commerce platforms to digital public services, insurance companies, and schools.\n\nFounded by Idriss Monthe and Daniel Dindji in 2016, CinetPay claims to have processed over 30 million transactions for 350 active merchants in nine countries, including Ivory Coast, Senegal, Cameroon, Mali, Togo, Burkina Faso, Benin, and Guinea.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe seed investment is expected to boost CinetPay\u2019s sales and marketing efforts in the countries it operates across West and Central Africa.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve watched firsthand as thousands of merchants waste crucial time, even up to 6 months, getting their payment systems in order,\u201d CinetPay CEO and co-founder, Monthe, said in a statement. \u201cNow we\u2019ve got the resources to market and sell our solution across the region.\u201d\n\nFor Flutterwave, backing CinetPay\u2014a startup it\u2019s partnered with since 2019\u2014marks the unicorn\u2019s first direct investment in the francophone Africa region. According to Olugbenga Agboola, Flutterwave\u2019s founder and CEO, both startups have a \u201cshared vision to simplify payments on the continent.\u201d\n\nAll over Africa, the mobile money market is booming with West Africa being one of the fastest-growing regions in the continent. In Ivory Coast, CinetPay\u2019s first market, up to 75% of the population owns a mobile money account whereas less than 25% have a bank account.\n\nSimilarly, up to 80% of the population in the French-speaking African region have a mobile money account and less than 20% bank accounts.\n\nCinetPay\u2019s gateway aggregates all payment options available in the region, enabling merchants, through digital accounts, to accept online payments and reduce the reliance on cash.\n\nWalter Baddoo, co-founder and General Partner at 4DX Ventures reveals that the VC firm has been \u201ctracking the francophone Africa market\u201d for some time now and is impressed by CinetPay\u2019s ambitious goal to digitise payments across the region. The company is an investor in Flutterwave as well.\n\n\u201cFor a first institutional investment, we couldn\u2019t have asked for two better partners in 4DX Ventures and Flutterwave,\u201d Monthe said. \u201cWe\u2019ve selected highly strategic partners as investors and are excited about the immediate next steps we take together in terms of simplifying and improving digital payments in francophone Africa.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "MainOne, a West African data centre and connectivity solutions provider with a presence in Nigeria, Ghana, and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is set to be acquired for $320 million by American multinational Equinix Inc., the US company said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nThe all-cash transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of next year, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions including the requisite regulatory approvals.\n\nFounded by Funke Opeke in 2010, MainOne is a key provider of enterprise connectivity solutions, with an estimated 800+ business-to-business customers. These include major international technology enterprises, social media companies, global telecom operators, financial service companies, and cloud service providers.\n\nThe company owns and operates an extensive submarine network extending 7,000 kilometers from Portugal to Lagos, Accra, and along the West African coast, with landing stations in Nigeria, Ghana, and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. These provide connectivity to and from Europe, West African countries, and the major business communities in Nigeria.\n\nMainOne also owns digital infrastructure assets that include three operational data centers, with an additional facility under construction expected to open in Q1 2022. These are in addition to key internet exchanges enabling low latency to key global networks, including Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Facebook.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, the management team, including CEO Opeke, will continue to serve in their respective roles.\n\n\u201cThe MainOne team is excited about the partnership created through the acquisition,\u201d Opeke said in the statement. \u201cWith similar values and culture to what we have built in 12 years, Equinix is the preferred partner for our growth journey and will accelerate our long-term vision to grow digital infrastructure investments across Africa.\u201d\n\nFor Equinix, a global specialist in data centres and internet connectivity, the deal marks the first step in a long-term strategy to become a leading provider of digital infrastructure in Africa.\n\nEquinix believes MainOne to be one of the most exciting technology businesses to emerge from Africa, making the acquisition a pivotal entry point for the US company into the continent.\n\n\u201cExpansion in Africa has long been a strategic priority for us. With MainOne, we have found a company that not only has highly complementary data center and connectivity assets but can further accelerate the expansion of our business model and growth objectives,\u201d said Eugene Bergen, EMEA President at Equinix.\n\nEquinix\u2019s data centres around the world.\n\nGiven the huge supply gap in digital infrastructure in sub-Saharan Africa, Ayobami Omole, a Lagos-based telecom analyst at Tellimer, expects more of such transactions in the coming years. \u201cDeals like the MainOne acquisition will keep drawing foreign investors\u2019 attention to the region,\u201d Omole told TechCabal over the phone.\n\nThe UN International Telecommunication Union (ITU) estimates SSA is home to approximately 700 million of the world\u2019s 3.7 billion people without access to the internet. More so, available infrastructure in the region is barely enough for the current internet users.\n\n\u201cWith increasing internet traffic, smartphone penetration, and digitisation, we can only expect demand for cloud services and digital infrastructure to increase with foreign players looking to plug that gap,\u201d Omole added.\n\nGlobally, Platform Equinix is comprised of 237 data centres across 65 metros and 27 countries, providing data centre and interconnection services for over 10,000 businesses, including more than 50% of Fortune 500 companies. When completed, the acquisition will extend Platform Equinix into West Africa.\n\n\u201cMainOne\u2019s leading interconnection position and experienced management team represent critical assets in our aspirations to be the leading neutral provider of digital infrastructure in Africa,\u201d added Charles Meyers, President and CEO of Equinix.\n\nMainOne\u2019s founding shareholders include Nigerian businessman and founder of Guaranty Trust Bank, Fola Adeola, MainStreet Technologies, the Africa Finance Corporation (AFC), Pan African Infrastructure Development Fund (PAIDF), First Bank, Polaris Bank, and the African Development Bank (AfDB).\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "Enterprise Hotel is democratising real estate investments for regular Africans",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLong before tech startups democratised investing in the stock market, anyone looking to invest in the stock market needed a significant amount of money. But that changed with the entrance of startups like Risevest, Bamboo, and Chaka.\n\nFor the first time, Nigerians could buy stocks with as little as $10 (\u20a65,000). Although most stocks available are of foreign companies, that innovation provided Nigerians with a way to invest small sums of money.\n\nSimilarly, Airbnb upended the hospitality industry when it made it possible for individuals to rent out their homes. In the process, it allowed people to get a slice of the pie that is the hospitality industry.\n\nHelping Africans to own commercial real estate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn some ways, owning a property is the Nigerian dream. However, the absence of suitable mortgage or financing options means one would require a considerable upfront investment to live their dream. With only 2% of Nigerians reportedly having up to \u20a6500,000 ($870) in bank deposits, owning a property is out of reach for most people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFractional investment startup, Enterprise Hotel, hopes to change this by offering Africans the opportunity to invest in commercial real estate with as little as \u20a630,000 ($52).\n\nLike the model used by investment tech startups, individuals can now own properties with minimal investments. The startup offers three product classes, the first being the room sale. Under this arrangement, individuals can outrightly purchase a room.\n\nThe block sale is the second level, and for this, Enterprise Hotel divides a room into ten blocks, allowing people to purchase each block. So, if the price for a room has been set at \u20a630 million, for instance, a block would cost \u20a63 million.\n\nThe unit sale is the last unit, and with this, Enterprise Hotel divides the room into a thousand parts. Consequently, it becomes easy for more people to purchase real estate regardless of their income levels.\n\nHow Enterprise Hotel makes money\n\nEnterprise Hotel makes money in two ways. The first is via the sale of the rooms and the second is through a management fee paid by the investors. With the management fee, Enterprise Hotel covers management costs, including recruitment on behalf of the investors.\n\nSo why real estate? Uche Ajaere is the co-founder and CEO of Enterprise Hotel. You may recognise the surname, and that\u2019s because he\u2019s a director of GIG Group.\n\nWhile the GIG Group is popularly known for the transport company, GIGM, it also has investments in other industries, including real estate. For over eight years, Uche has been involved in the operations of the real estate division. Simultaneously, he has kept an eye on developments in Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nHis time working in real estate showed him that only a handful of people could afford to buy or own real estate. In Lekki, Lagos State, a four-bedroom duplex costs about \u20a6100 million ($173,913). This is out of the reach of most Nigerians who earn less than \u20a6150,000 ($300) annually.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a result, he decided on a startup that gives people a chance to own real estate regardless of how much they have.\n\nChallenges and competition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of the growth in Nigeria\u2019s startup space has been in fintech, with a handful of other industries represented. The real estate sector has seen very little innovation, with startups like Spleet and Muster attempting to solve the issue of rent for Nigerians.\n\nOne reason for this is that technology does not entirely solve the problems in real estate. At best, it only aids processes. Unlike other sectors, the barrier to entry in real estate is high. In addition, it could take as much as 15 years for investors to see a return on their investments. Consequently, it is not surprising that there is less investment going into real estate compared to other industries.\n\n\u201cPeople within the technology space will always think, \u2018how affordable is it to get this product? And how fast am I going to make my profit?\u2019\n\n\u201cWith the promise of higher returns in other industries, why would anyone want to invest in real estate,\u201d Uche asks.\n\nThis high entry barrier is what Enterprise Hotel is working to eliminate. If, for example, a room in an Enterprise Hotel is going for \u20a630 million ($52,173), when it is split into 1,000 units, that amounts to about \u20a630,000 ($60), which is a lot more affordable for most Nigerians.\n\nIn addition to affordability, Enterprise Hotel says it offers investors an opportunity to get a return on their investment within two to four years. That\u2019s impressive because it takes about 15 to 20 years for most real estate acquisitions to return the initial capital outlay.\n\nEnterprise Hotel provides its investors with several ways to earn. The primary route is through hotel bookings. However, that is not all, as investors can make money from every activity that takes place in the rooms they own as well as other services offered in the hotel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, for example, if a guest eats, drinks, or pays for dry cleaning services in the room, the investors also earn a cut of the earnings.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all. One of the reasons many Nigerians buy land is that it often increases in value. Uche reveals that investments done through Enterprise Hotel would be evaluated with the value reflected on the app. Investors can also sell their properties, although Enterprise Hotel would require that they be given the right of first refusal on any property.\n\nAlready, Enterprise Hotel has properties in Lagos, Abuja, Benin, and Port Harcourt, with plans to add more across Nigeria. Uche reveals that the goal is to have an Enterprise Hotel in every major city in the world.\n\nFor Enterprise Hotel, building in a sector with little or no examples to follow could be tough. While there are startups currently offering fractional investment services in Nigeria, the majority are in the financial services space. Yet, a lot can be learnt from their success.\n\nAlthough Enterprise Hotel\u2019s model could see them offer real estate investment for as little as \u20a630,000 ($60), that is still a significant investment for most Nigerians. While the ability to invest small amounts is attractive, the reality is that the returns earned on such investments would be small, and this could discourage potential users. Therefore, it may be that the key to Enterprise Hotel\u2019s success lies in serving a market with higher disposable income.\n\nAttracting investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding a startup like Enterprise Hotel requires enormous investments. So far, Enterprise Hotel has run without institutional investment. Uche discloses that while they are open to receiving investments, at the moment, the focus is on building significant traction before approaching investors.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not just selling an app like other startups. We want to make sure that in the next few months when we\u2019re talking to investors, we\u2019ll be talking based on value. We want to show them the first set of hotels that we have built and investors who\u2019ve bought into them and are already making money. Then we can start talking to investors.\u201d\n\nAside from helping more people gain access to real estate investments, Enterprise Hotel indirectly solves another problem. Uche reveals that users can use it as collateral when applying for loans since they own the properties outrightly.\n\nIn Nigeria, where Enterprise Hotel operates, traditional banks have typically shied away from offering loans to individuals outside their preferred high net worth group. And in cases where they are willing to do so, they require collateral. Enterprise Hotel offers users a way out. They can now invest in real estate while using the assets as collateral.\n\nBuilding a business of any sort is challenging. For Enterprise Hotel, operating in the real estate industry with its high financial requirements poses a significant hurdle. However, the success of startups like Bamboo and Risevest suggest that Enterprise Hotel might be onto something.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

For me, his name comes to mind whenever I hear or say the words fintech or finance.\n\nFor real? Oh yeah, Olowe has a wealth of experience in finance.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigeria-based mobility giant, GIGM, has launched a payment service for its users. This is the first of many services that the company intends to offer as it moves towards being a one-stop-shop for the needs of its customers.\n\nIn September 2019, the company revealed a slight name change, replacing \u2018Motors\u2019 with \u2018Mobility\u2019 as it looked to expand its offerings. Two years after that, it says it is redefining mobility to mean access rather than just movement.\n\nOver a chat with Techpoint Africa, Okhae Enahoro, the company\u2019s new CEO, said, \u201cWhen you look at the word mobility, it means the ability to move freely. Movement in itself may not necessarily mean physically transporting yourself from one place to another.\n\n\u201cIt just basically means advancement. It can mean growth. So when you look at these definitions, you realise that we\u2019re trying to enable lifestyles, so we want to bring services to people that allow them to do things easily.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor now, this service will only be available in Nigeria \u2014 GIGM\u2019s headquarters \u2014 and will allow users to make payments for airtime, electricity bills, cable TV, and Internet data. However, there are plans to launch in other African countries over the next few years.\n\nThe beginnings of a super app?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGozem riders (\u201cChampions\u201d). Source: Supplied\n\nThe super app model has gained popularity in emerging economies following the successes of WeChat and Alipay in China. Several startups have sprung up, especially in Asia, to replicate the model.\n\nIn Africa, Opay, Gozem, Safeboda, and Gokada have positioned themselves as super apps with varying degrees of success, and this latest feature could see GIGM becoming the newest entrant in this space.\n\nTypically, super apps start by offering a core service through which they get a foothold and can provide an array of services to the customer.\n\nThis service could be food delivery, transportation, or payments. For GIGM, this could be building on its tech-enabled transportation platform to offer payment services to its users.\n\nHowever, because its services are mainly for long-distance travel, the company would have to include more services than it currently offers to gain more customers.\n\nA look at its mobile app would provide some insight into how this could work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA screenshot of the GIGM app\n\nOne of the options on the app is called Danfo, named after the famous yellow buses in Lagos State. Tapping on it would redirect you to the app store to download the app.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDanfo is the company\u2019s bus-hailing platform that allows users to book intra-city rides. Although the service is not yet live, it provides insights into the company plans and could see it come up against Shuttlers and Treepz.\n\nLite from GIGM is another offering that will enable the company to onboard new users. Nigeria\u2019s fragmented transportation services mean that users cannot travel comfortably over short distances.\n\nWith Lite, the company plans to provide users with the ability to make short journeys outside a city that would ordinarily not be undertaken by ride-hailing services such as Uber and Bolt.\n\nEven with these offerings, ride-hailing could be the fastest way to attract many users and see it come up against Uber and Bolt.\n\nWith the large war chest available to these two startups in the form of venture capital, it would be a considerable challenge for the company. However, if there is any local player capable of pulling this off, it is GIGM.\n\nIn recent years, the company has focused on developing its technology offerings, deploying data across the business. Its understanding of the local business terrain gained over 20 years of operation gives it an advantage that other local companies lack.\n\nFor super apps to thrive, they must have a robust and frequent core use case, a good payment system, and relevant services close to the core use case.\n\nWith its position as a leading transportation service provider and the addition of a payment option, the company looks to be on the right path. However, the new services it offers could play a role in its success or failure.\n\nNigeria\u2019s low smartphone and Internet penetration also mean that more people would be using the Internet or smartphones for the first time every year. Providing these groups with relevant services could hold the key to success.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "The shareholders of Access Bank Plc, Nigeria\u2019s largest bank by asset will on Thursday December 16 at a Court-Ordered Meeting vote for or against the bank\u2019s proposed corporate reorganisation which will result in a new non-operating Holding Company (HoldCo) to be called Access Holdings Plc.\n\nThe indicative timeline shows that Access Bank will on December 29 file Scheme Resolution and Scrutineers\u2019 Report with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and notify Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) of the outcome of the Court-Ordered Meeting.\n\nOn February 25, 2022, it hopes to obtain CBN\u2019s final approval of the Scheme; while it also hopes to obtain SEC\u2019s final approval of the Scheme on March 28.\n\nAccess Bank will submit application for CBN final licence on March 29, 2022 seeking a final licence to operate as the Financial Holding Company (FHC) of the Bank and other non-banking subsidiaries, after the Scheme becomes effective.\n\nThe Bank will apply to be delisted from the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) and the Holdco will be listed on The NGX. The shares of the Holdco will be listed on the Nigerian Exchange Limited on April 15, 2022, the Scheme\u2019s indicative timeline shows. At N9.20 per share which Access Bank closed on December 9, it represents +8.9percent return year-to-date (YtD), outperforming the market\u2019s benchmark index at +3.51 percent same day.\n\nRead Also: Access, GTB, Zenith generate most return for shareholders in half-year\n\nOn the Effective Date, each shareholder will receive 1 (one) Holdco share, which will be credited as fully paid, in exchange for every 1 (one) Scheme share as at the Terminal Date. Each Scheme Share will be transferred to the Holdco without any further act or deed by the shareholder.\n\n\u201cThe Restructure will result in shareholders holding shares in the Holdco in the same proportion as their current holdings in the Bank and the Bank\u2019s shares being held wholly by the Holdco, which will be a regulated entity for CBN purposes.\n\nThe Bank will continue to be subject to the full suite of CBN banking regulations and, in all other material respects. The Banking Subsidiaries will continue to be subject to the oversight of the respective prudential regulatory authorities in their jurisdictions. The Group\u2019s firm-wide risk management framework will continue to apply across the entire restructured group,\u201d Ajoritsedere Awosika, Chairman, Access Bank Plc said in a letter to the bank\u2019s shareholders.\n\nShe said the Board considers the terms of the Scheme to be fair, reasonable and in the best interests of the shareholders, \u201cand unanimously recommends that you vote in favour of the subjoined resolution proposed at the Court-Ordered Meeting. It is particularly important that as many votes as possible are cast at the Court-Ordered Meeting to satisfy the Court that there was fair representation of shareholders at the Meeting.\u201d\n\nThe Holdco was incorporated with 2 (two) shareholders \u2013 Herbert Wigwe (2million units) and Roosevelt Ogbonna (2million units). As at the date of incorporation of the HoldCo \u2013 February 10, 2021 \u2013 Wigwe and Ogbonna were the only shareholders of the HoldCo. This has not changed.\n\nPursuant to the Scheme, the 35,545,225,622 ordinary shares of 50 Kobo each of Access Bank Plc held by qualifying shareholders will be exchanged for 35,545,225,622 ordinary shares of 50 Kobo each of Access Holdings Plc. The Share Capital for Access Holdings Plc would amount to N17.772billion.\n\nAccess Bank\u2019s shares outstanding of 35,545,225,622 units are valued at N325.238billion. Stanbic Nominees Limited holds 4,091,310,660 units representing 11.51 percent of the bank\u2019s shares outstanding while others shareholders hold 31,453,914,962 units or 88.49percent. Note that Stanbic Nominees held the shares as custodian for various investors. Stanbic Nominees does not exercise any right over the underlying shares.\n\n\u201cIf the Restructure is approved, the restructured group will have a structure like that of some major global financial institutions, including those that Access Bank considers to be its peers and competitors. The Board expects that the restructured group will have greater flexibility to adapt to future business opportunities, market and regulatory changes than is currently the case,\u201d Awosika added.\n\nChapel Hill Denham Advisory Limited is acting as the Financial Adviser in respect of the proposed Scheme of Arrangement (the Scheme). The Solicitors are Aluko & Oyebode and Africa Law Practice NG & Company. The stockbrokers to the Scheme are Coronation Securities Limited while the Registrars are Coronation Registrars Limited.\n\nKemi Awodein, Managing Director, Chapel Hill Denham Advisory Limited in a letter to Access Bank shareholders said, \u201cYour Board, and we, the Financial Adviser to the Bank, having considered the terms and conditions of the Scheme as well as the benefits thereof, recommend that you vote in favour of the Scheme Resolution which will be proposed at the Court-Ordered Meeting.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe statutory requirement to pass the Scheme Resolution at the Court-Ordered Meeting is a majority representing not less than three-quarters (3/4) in value of the Shares of the Shareholders present and voting either in person or by proxy at the Meeting,\u201d Awodein noted.\n\nAwodein further noted that the Holdco Shares to be issued pursuant to the Scheme, will rank pari-passu in all respects and shall form a single class with the existing issued ordinary shares of the Holdco. \u201cUpon the Scheme becoming Effective, the pre-Scheme shareholders of the Holdco will relinquish the shares held in Holdco to the Holdco before the Effective Date\u201d.\n\nPursuant to the requirements of the Financial Holding Company guidelines, Access Bank has sought and obtained an Approval-in-Principle (AIP) from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) in connection with the Restructuring.\n\nThe final licence will be sought from the CBN upon satisfaction of the requirements of the FHC Guidelines and subject to the approval of the terms and conditions of the Scheme by the Shareholders.\n\nAccess Bank Holdings Plc would have 100percent ownership in Access Bank and relevant non-banking subsidiaries. The Scheme would be completed in 2022. Dividend pay-out ratio of 90percent was assumed based on pay-out ratio of similar Holding Companies.\n\nThe SEC had issued a No-Objection in connection with the Scheme and cleared the Scheme Document. The Order of the Court is pursuant to the provisions of Section 715(3) of the Companies and Allied Matter (CAMA) sanctioning the Scheme.\n\nAccess Bank Plc is a leading full-service commercial bank operating through a network of more than 600 branches and service outlets across 12 countries.\n\nAccess Holdings Plc will become the listed parent entity of the bank and related group companies. The banking subsidiaries of Access Bank are Access Bank (Gambia) Limited; Access Bank (Sierra Leone) Limited; Access Bank (Rwanda) Plc; Access Bank (Zambia) Limited; Access Bank (R.D Congo) S.A.R.L; Access Bank (Ghana) Plc; Access Bank (Guinea) S.A; The Access Bank (UK )Limited; Access Bank (Mozambique) S.A; Access Bank Kenya Plc; Access Bank (South Africa) Limited; and African Banking Corporation of Botswana Limited.",

You are the ears and eyes that will give us more information that will help us fulfill all our electioneering promises. For those communities that we were unable to reach during our campaign, we will give them two SAs and one SSA.\n\n\u201cAs a governor, it\u2019s not possible to be in touch with all the communities, which is why I need you to coordinate your area for me. The appointment is not a favour, but a time for real work as I must get reports from you regularly.\u201d\n\nReaffirming the government\u2019s commitment to improving the livelihoods of the people, the governor said, \u201cWe are changing the politics of Edo as politics is local.

          "title": "The Nigerian Capital Market Celebrates Emergence of Its First Central Counterparty",
          "text": "The Nigerian Capital Market on Thursday, witnessed a monumental milestone as NG Clearing limited, the first Central Counterparty in West Africa, formally launched her operations.\n\nThe launch of NG Clearing as a CCP means that exchange-traded derivatives are now a possibility in the Nigerian Capital market. As a Financial Market Infrastructure (FMI), NG Clearing facilitates the clearing and settlement of exchange-traded derivatives, management of counterparty risk, reduction of systemic risk, and promotion of the safety and integrity of Nigeria\u2019s capital market. This opens new and clear opportunities for investors, stakeholders, and other players in Nigeria\u2019s capital market.\n\nThe event was hybrid, and it had a mix of high-profile physical and virtual participants. The Secretary-General to the Government of the Federation, Mr. Boss Mustapha was represented by Mr. Paul Kanu. The Governor of Lagos State was also represented by Mrs. Alake Sanusi. The legislative arm of the Nigerian Government was represented by Honorable Babangida Ibrahim, The Chairman, House Committee on Capital Markets.\n\nThe Governor of Edo State, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, The Honourable Minister of Finance, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, The Honorable Minister of Trade, Industry and Investment Otunba Adebayo Adeniyi, The Director-General of the SEC, Dr. Lamido Yuguda, The Deputy Governor, Financial Systems Stability Directorate, Mrs. Aisha Ahmad and Mr. Tony Elumelu CON, the Chairman of Heirs Holdings all participated virtually with speeches and special remarks.\n\nIn his opening speech, the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of NG Clearing Limited, Mr. Tapas Das expressed delight as he stressed the monumental significance of NG Clearing\u2019s launch for the Nigerian Capital Market. He linked the emergence of NG Clearing to the maturity of the Nigerian financial ecosystem stating that \u201cWith Nigeria\u2019s capital market maturing into offering advanced capital market products such as futures derivatives, it is only ideal to establish a CCP, in line with global best practices. The emergence of NG Clearing is not only an indication of our collective growth as a market but also a marker of the forward-looking intent of the Nigerian capital market.\u201d\n\nHe went on to describe the company\u2019s vision as well as the depth of capacity in place to ensure NG Clearing delivers on its vision. He explained that \u201cOur vision is to become Africa\u2019s most trusted CCP. With this vision in mind, we have left no stone unturned in ensuring that we offer world-class infrastructure, transparent and resilient processes, with an experienced team of worthy professionals.\u201d\n\nMr. Oscar N Onyema OON, the chairman of NG Clearing chronicled the origin of the NG Clearing dream in his address. He stated that \u201cThe NG Clearing dream was borne out of a firm commitment to position the Nigerian capital market as a stable and resilient market that offers local and foreign investors sound opportunities without compromising global standards. On this premise, we took steps to identify the gaps that inhibit our market from attaining this positioning. One of the gaps we identified was the absence of the financial market infrastructure known as a CCP.\u201d He also noted that having a CCP is key to the realization of the Nigerian Capital Market master plan.\n\nThe Minister of Finance, Dr. (Mrs.) Zainab Shamsuna Ahmed noted that NG Clearing\u2019s emergence will contribute to the post-covid-19 recovery of the Nigerian Economy. She also mentioned that \u201ca door of new possibilities has been opened for growth and development of the Nigerian economy\u201d. In a similar vein, the minister of Trade, Industry, and Investment, Otunba Adebayo Adeniyi opined that \u201cNG Clearing emergence redefines Nigeria\u2019s financial landscape, creating endless possibilities for products that can be developed and deployed.\u201d\n\nThe Director-General of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Dr. Lamido Yuguda asserted that the launch of NG Clearing as a CCP is historic for the Nigerian Capital Market. In his words, \u201cthe services of NG Clearing will help in deepening the market while placing it on the right path to achieving the required sophistication, depth, and breadth in terms of products and service offerings.\u201d He went on to note that the SEC will continue to deliver on its mandate of ensuring the Nigerian capital market is safe, orderly, and built on integrity.\n\nMrs. Aisha Ahmad, the CBN Deputy Governor, Financial Systems Stability Directorate, gave special remarks. She extensively detailed the important roles of NG Clearing in driving stability in the ecosystem. She also stressed the need to adopt sustainable approaches that contribute to the combating of climate change.\n\nThe governor of Lagos State, H.E Babajide Sanwoolu as well as the Governor of Edo State, H.E Godwin Obaseki profusely congratulated the Board and Management of NG clearing on the laudable feat of establishing the first CCP in West Africa.\n\nAt the event, there was a virtual in-depth panel session on how NG Clearing as a CCP will contribute to the resilience of Nigeria\u2019s Financial System. The session had Teo Floor, CEO of CCP12 (the Global Association of Central Counterparties), Alicia Greenwood, CEO of JSE Clear (South Africa), Narendra Ahlawat, CEO of Multi Commodity Exchange Clearing Corporation (MCXCCL, India), Uche Orji, CEO of the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA), and Ayodeji Balogun, CEO of AFEX Commodities.\n\nHaving been incorporated in 2016 and having also gotten the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s nod to begin operations in June 2021, the launch of NG clearing culminates a long journey towards the creation of a world-class- post-trade services provider with a focus on advanced capital market offerings.\n\nThe event was streamed live on zoom and YouTube, you can watch the replay here\n\nNG Clearing Limited (\u201cNG Clearing\u201d) is Nigeria\u2019s premier central counterparty (CCP) and serves as a market-wide financial market infrastructure (FMI) in Nigeria.\n\nThe Company was incorporated in May 2016. In September 2020, the Company received an approval-in-principle from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to provide CCP services in Nigeria, and final approval was issued by the SEC in June 2021.\n\nThe establishment of NG Clearing is in line with its strategy to support the growth and development of the Nigerian capital market as the \u201cgateway to African Markets\u201d.\n\nThe establishment of NG Clearing will position the Nigerian capital market as a leader amongst emerging markets by facilitating greater market transparency, increase trading volumes, and overall improvement of the efficiency and competitiveness of the Nigerian capital market.\n\nNG Clearing will also pave the way for the smooth introduction of exchange-traded derivatives and other financial instruments in the market, by delivering best-in-class post-trade services that manage counterparty credit risk and reduce systemic risk in the Nigerian financial system.",

          "text": "An Appeal Court sitting in Lagos has dismissed an appeal by the Chairman of Global Fleet Group, Barr Jimoh Ibrahim, challenging seizure of his properties by the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON).\n\nAMCON had taken over 12 assets belonging to Ibrahim and frozen all his accounts over a N69.4 billion indebtedness to the corporation, following an order of Justice Rilwan Aikawa of the Federal High Court, Lagos.\n\nIn a press release issued Friday, immediately after the appellate court\u2019s decision, Jude Nwauzor, Head Corporate Communications of AMCON, described the judgment as \u201canother victory for AMCON and the needed good news\u201d for AMCON\u2019s debt recovery drive.\n\nNwauzor said AMCON, enforcing Justice Aikawa\u2019s order, took effective possession of all 12 properties through its Debt Recovery Agent \u2013 Pinheiro Legal Partners. The assets include the building of NICON Investment Limited at Plot 242, Muhammadu Buhari Way, Central Business District, Abuja; NICON Hotels Limited building at Plot 557, Port-Harcourt Crescent, off Gimbiya Street, Abuja, and the building of NICON Lekki Limited also at No. 5, Customs Street, Lagos.\n\nOther properties are the building of Abuja International Hotels Limited located at No. 3, Hospital Road, Lagos; another Property at Plot 242, Muhammadu Buhari Way, Abuja; the former Allied Bank Building on Mile 2, Oshodi Express Way, Apapa Road, Lagos; Energy House located on No. 94, Awolowo Road, Ikoyi, Lagos; NICON Building at No. 40, Madeira Street, Maitama, Abuja; a Residential Apartment at Road 2, House A14, Victoria Garden City, Lagos; NICON Hotels Building at Plot 3, Road 3, Victoria Garden City, Lagos as well as the NICON Luxury Hotel\u2019s Building, Garki I, FCT, Abuja.\n\n\u201cIn addition to the takeover of the properties, the court also ordered the freezing of all accounts belonging to Ibrahim and his companies including Global Fleet Oil & Gas Limited and NICON Investment Limited all of whom are defendants in the suit No. FHL/L/CL/776/2016.\n\n\u201cAMCON in November 2020 following a court order seized the properties of Barrister Jimoh Ibrahim over an alleged debt of N69.4 billion, which was sold to AMCON by Union Bank as a non-performing loan in the early days of AMCON,\u201d Nwauzor said.\n\nFollowing the execution of the order, NICON Investment Limited, Global Fleet Oil & Gas Limited and Jimoh Ibrahim through their lawyers Chief Adeniyi Akintola SAN filed a motion dated November 19, 2020, seeking to discharge/set aside the order, which was made by Justice R.M. Aikawa of the Federal High Court sitting in Lagos. Some other entities, which AMCON alleged was linked to Jimoh Ibrahim to wit: NICON Insurance Limited, Nigerian-Re-Insurance Limited, Abuja Hotel Limited and NICON Hotels Limited also filed an application to discharge the said order of 4th day of November 4, 2020. After hearing the two applications and the arguments canvassed by parties through their respective counsel, Hon. Justice R.M. Aikawa proceeded to dismiss both applications by his ruling of February 16, 2021.\n\nAs a follow up to that decision, both sets of Applicants filed independent appeals in the Court of Appeal, Lagos division. AMCON was represented in the appeals by Kemi Pinheiro SAN, while the first set of Appellants were represented by Chief Adeniyi Akintola SAN and the second set by Chief Bolaji Ayorinde SAN.\n\nAt the hearing of the appeals on September 30, 2021, Pinheiro raised a preliminary objection to the appeal contending that the appeal was incompetent because the Appellants failed to seek leave prior to the filing of the appeal.\n\nSaid Nwauzor: \u201cIn a unanimous decision today (Friday) December 10, 2021, the Court of Appeal upheld the preliminary objection of AMCON and accordingly dismissed both appeals. The implication of this is that AMCON remains in possession of the properties attached by the order of Hon. Justice R.M. Aikawa on November 4, 2021.\n\n\u201cThe matter between Barrister Jimoh Ibrahim and AMCON has been interminable since the loan was purchased by the government debt recovery agency during the first phase of Eligible Bank Assets (EBA) purchases from Union Bank in the early days of AMCON. AMCON is however not deterred to recover the nearly N70 billion owed it by Barrister Ibrahim and his companies in the interest of the Nigerian economy and the public in general.\u201d\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "title": "NGX: Capital Market Set for Launch of Derivatives",
          "text": "All ducks now appear to be in a row for the launch of Exchange Traded Derivatives (ETDs) in the Nigerian capital market. This comes on the back of the official launch of NG Clearing as Central Counterparty (CCP) Clearing House in Nigeria on Thursday, 9 December 2021.\n\nSpeaking at the event, the Chief Executive Officer, Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX), Mr. Temi Popoola, CFA, stated, \u201cI am excited to witness the official launch of NG Clearing and must congratulate its Board and Management for this historic milestone. As a multi-asset Exchange, NGX recognises the importance of a well-developed Derivatives market, and we have worked hard to put the right regulatory and technology framework in place to support the launch of a standardized Exchange Traded Derivatives (ETDs) market. Our efforts will be further supported by NG Clearing, the best in class CCP and Clearing House. These are indeed exciting times for the Nigerian capital market and I am excited about the prospect of deepening Africa\u2019s position in the global financial market with the imminent launch of ETDs.\u201d\n\nThe activities of NGX in establishing a vibrant Derivatives market have also focused heavily on capacity building. Being the first line of contact for investors in the capital market, NGX has reiterated that it is imperative that participants who engage in the derivatives business have adequate knowledge of these instruments. As such, The Exchange has organised workshops, webinar and conferences the most recent of which was the 2021 Market Data Workshop with the theme, \u201cHow Market Data Powers Investment Strategies Using Derivatives Products.\u201d\n\nTaking a cue from NGX, perhaps it would be important to establish the right foundation in explaining what Derivatives are and some of the key elements that are required to successfully trade this asset class. Derivatives are financial instruments most popularly used to reduce or hedge risks, and are also believed to cover downside risks when large exposure exists in a portfolio long on stocks. Among the different commonly used financial instruments, index derivatives have raised a great deal of attention in researchers around the world.\n\nIndex derivatives exist for all asset classes, and over time their use has grown exponentially for a variety of purposes. The ability to leverage by investing a small amount to gain exposure to a much larger investment is the key benefit of index derivatives. While index futures have a symmetric impact on portfolio returns, index options can have an asymmetric impact. That said, both are valuable, cost efficient tools for a number of reasons for a portfolio manager.\n\nFor example, if an investor has shorted a large number of single securities, a single index call option can provide a great hedge against an inverse-market move. However, if an investor has large cash holdings that he or she wants to use for buying stocks after further research, a quick and easy way to deploy the funds is to go long on an index futures contract. This provides the exposure the investor is ultimately looking to gain, buys time to do the research, costs far less and manages the price impact of large trading in a short time frame. Small purchases over time reduce the effect over prices and will not create a market impact.\n\nSimilarly, when a large number of securities need to be sold off, buying an index futures gives time to ease in the selling over time and dampen price pressure. As cash positions are built over time, the index future maintains the overall security exposure until further investment decisions are made. This approach makes sense for both active and passive investors, where large trades can be counterbalanced with the use of index futures or options bought at a low cost by an investor to avoid having large price-impacting shifts in exposure.\n\nReports from NGX have shown that upon the introduction of ETDs in the market, index futures will be rolled out in the first year, while other products will follow as the market evolves in line with market readiness and demand. It would be recalled that NGX recently received approval for seven derivatives contracts from the SEC including the Access Bank Plc Stock Futures, Dangote Cement Plc Stock Futures, Guaranty Trust Bank Plc Stock Futures, MTN Nigeria Communications Plc Stock Futures, Zenith Bank Plc Stock Futures, NGX 30 Index Futures and NGX Pension Index Futures.\n\nUltimately, the Derivatives market is expected to complement existing cash markets and provide investors and other market players with the necessary tools for tactical asset allocation, risk management and cost management for effective portfolio management. It will, therefore, be interesting to see how the market responds once ETDs are introduced in the near term.",

But regrettably, our democratic gains of the past decades are under threats of unconstitutional takeover of power.\n\n\u201cThis unwholesome trend, sometimes in reaction to unilateral amendments of constitutions by some leaders, must not be tolerated by the international community. Nigeria fully supports the efforts by ECOWAS to address this growing challenge and appreciates the support of both the African Union and the United Nations,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nThe President said Nigeria continues to face security challenges which pose a threat to democracy, calling \u201con global partners to support our efforts in tackling insurgency and terrorism.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cI am proud to state that Nigeria has had over two decades of uninterrupted democratic governance and has unequivocally remained committed to upholding the core values and principles of democracy.\n\n\u201cSince assuming office in 2015, we have been able to introduce mechanisms to ensure free, fair and credible elections. We have strengthened our key anti-corruption agencies in collaboration with international partners and have undertaken several anti-corruption measures and initiatives.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari thanked President Joe Biden, government and people of the United States for hosting the summit.\n\n\u201cAs you are aware, democracy has remained the most popular and universally recognised way of governance thus far. It is one governance system that guarantees freedom of speech, rule of law, respect for human rights and inclusiveness in governance. It also promotes social justice, economic and social development and national and global peace.\n\n\u201cHowever, in spite of these laudable qualities, more is required from us as members of democratic societies, particularly in ensuring that democratic institutions and processes are strengthened, particularly during this period of a global pandemic which has threatened social cohesion in most democracies.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, must remain resolute and enhance cooperation, so that together, we build back better democratic institutions and sustainable democratic values,\u2019\u2019 the President added.\n\nPresident Buhari noted that the summit was taking place at a time when democratic institutions around the world were facing several challenges.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThis event will help promote a positive agenda for democratic renewal by focusing on some of the major challenges faced by democracies today. It is hoped that through our collective action, we can safeguard democratic values and principles,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President said the devastating impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, which had made it impossible to convene the meeting face to face, had taken a heavy toll on economies, health and democratic processes around the world.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, we have witnessed the resilience of democratic institutions in many countries that have held free, fair and transparent democratic elections under very challenging conditions,\u2019\u2019 he stated.",

But regrettably, our democratic gains of the past decades are under threats of unconstitutional takeover of power.\n\n\u201cThis unwholesome trend, sometimes in reaction to unilateral amendments of constitutions by some leaders, must not be tolerated by the international community.

We have strengthened our key anti-corruption agencies in collaboration with international partners and have undertaken several anti-corruption measures and initiatives,\u201d he said.\n\nHe thanked President Joe Biden, the government and people of the United States for hosting the Summit.\n\n\u201cAs you are aware, democracy has remained the most popular and universally recognised way of governance thus far. It is one governance system that guarantees freedom of speech, rule of law, respect for human rights and inclusiveness in governance. It also promotes social justice, economic and social development and national and global peace.\n\n\u201cHowever, in spite of these laudable qualities, more is required from us as members of democratic societies, particularly in ensuring that democratic institutions and processes are strengthened, particularly during this period of a global pandemic which has threatened social cohesion in most democracies.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, must remain resolute and enhance cooperation, so that together, we build back better democratic institutions and sustainable democratic values,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nBuhari noted that the Summit was taking place at a time when democratic institutions around the world were facing several challenges.\n\n\u201cThis event will help promote a positive agenda for democratic renewal by focusing on some of the major challenges faced by democracies today. It is hoped that through our collective action, we can safeguard democratic values and principles,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President said the devastating impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, which had made it impossible to convene the meeting face to face, had taken a heavy toll on economies, health and democratic processes around the world.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, we have witnessed the resilience of democratic institutions in many countries that have held free, fair and transparent democratic elections under very challenging conditions.\u2019\u2019",

          "text": "\u2026Subsidy payment not sustainable \u2013 FG \u2026It\u2019ll increase cost of doing business \u2013 MAN \u2026Subsidy exclusion unavoidable \u2013 LCCI \u2026Govt should build new refineries \u2013 Expert \u2018\u2026No law provides for subsidy\u2019\n\nThe issue of petrol price increase is not new to Nigerians; rather what is new is that the federal government is bent on removing subsidy on petrol for good by 2022. BENJAMIN UMUTEME, in this piece, looks at the issue and its implications on the average citizen in the face of the prevailing harsh economic realities.\n\nIn January 2012, when former President Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s administration announced the removal of subsidy on petrol, it set the stage for the beginning of the end of his regime as Nigerians from all walks of life kicked against the decision. According to them, the living standard of the average Nigerian would be worse off. That was when the exchange rate still went for as low as N186/$. That was when oil prices were high and daily production was above 2 million barrels per day.\n\nTen years down the line, it is like the economic indices have gone full circle plus. Presently, the exchange rate at the parallel market is over N530/$, oil production due to OPEC+ production quota agreement is about 1.4 million, leading to a significant drop in foreign exchange earnings for Nigeria. This added to the near absence of infrastructure, reduced Foreign Direct Investment (FDIs) and to crown it all, the worsening insecurity which has significantly impacted negatively not just agriculture, but other forms of business. This is not forgetting to add that debt payment is eroding the government\u2019s ability to meet its obligations to the citizenry.\n\nEnter fuel subsidy removal talks, vows\n\nIt was a bolt out of the blue when the group managing director of the NNPC, Mele Kyari, hinted that a litre of petrol may sell between N320 and N340 in 2022.\n\nThis hit the populace hard, and the reactions from Nigerians showed that they see the plan as further de-humanising the citizenry. According to Kyari, the government would exit the subsidy regime as the law does not provide for a subsidy; hence, its removal in 2022.\n\n\u201cThere will be no provision for it legally in our system, but I am also sure you will appreciate that the government has a bigger social responsibility to cater for the ordinary and therefore engage in a process that will ensure that we exit in the subtlest and easiest manner,\u201d he said.\n\nMany Nigerians continue to wonder why the strong interest in petrol subsidy when subsidy for gas and kerosene has long been removed. The minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, was even blunter.\n\nSpeaking with State House correspondents in Abuja, the minister was adamant that the subsidy regime of the government was becoming unsustainable. She noted that it was becoming very difficult for the NNPC to fulfill its obligation to the Federation Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC).\n\n\u201cIf you take N250 billion times 12 months, that is about N3 trillion. If we don\u2019t remove that, that is what it is costing us. This money from the petroleum subsidies we can use to apply to health and education.\n\n\u201cSo, for the petroleum subsidy, if we look at a cost of about 250 billion per month, and it has been increasing consistently. So, we are expecting something around N120 billion per month from NNPC. And now we are getting to a point where NNPC is remitting near zero.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t stop we will get to a point where they will tell you to pay me this for managing the fuel provision in the country,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to her, the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) has a provision that all petroleum products must be deregulated.\n\n\u201cIn the 2020 budget, we made a provision to assume that at the maximum by the end of June, we must exit the petroleum subsidy. So, this last FAAC the subsidy cost to the Federation was N243 billion.\u201d\n\nNigerians, experts react\n\nThe argument for the removal of subsidy by the government has been going back and forth among Nigerians,\n\nFor the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), the proposal will increase not only the cost of doing business; it will also lead to fuel-induced inflation.\n\nAccording to its director-general, Mr. Segun Ajayi-Kadir, the implication is that with the strategic importance of petrol to business activities in the country, the cost of production will skyrocket.\n\n\u201cRegardless of the arguments back and forth on the issue, petrol remains a commercial product. It is, therefore, not insulated from the laws of demand and supply.\n\n\u201cFrom an economic point of view and that is the area I am comfortable to talk about, it should not come as a surprise. The rise in the price of crude oil should signal the inevitable increase in the landing cost of PMS in the country. You have oil marketers importing the fuel with the need to recover their costs and make a profit. Taken together, it is inevitable that the pump price of PMS will increase.\n\nHe, however, said fuel-induced inflation might arise, adding that it would also increase the cost of doing business for manufacturers and small business owners.\n\n\u201cThe increase in the cost of transportation \u2013 and the multiplier effect on other costs \u2013 that will accompany the more than 100 per cent increase will erode the disposable income of the average Nigerian.\u201d\n\nFor the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), the removal of subsidy was becoming more unavoidable looking at the pressure it places on the government revenue.\n\nIts director-general of LCCI, Dr. Chinyere Almona, said spending up to N250 billion monthly on fuel subsidy at a time when the debt to revenue ratio was above 73 per cent was not economical.\n\nShe said an immediate implication of removing the subsidy would be the increase in transport and logistics which would translate into higher costs for goods and services, rising inflation, increased poverty from diminishing purchasing power, and a likely rise in the unemployment rate.\n\n\u201cHowever, with more money freed for other purposes, the government should be able to spend more on utilities to cushion the effects of the removal. With cost-reflective pricing, smuggling of the products to neighbouring countries will reduce due to reduced margins.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the chief executive officer of Financial Derivatives Company, Bismarck Rewane, said while the removal of the subsidy would lead to lesser consumption due to increasing prices, the government would have extra funds to trigger economic growth.\n\nRewane, however, questioned the process and essence of the distribution of the N5,000 transport palliative to 40 million Nigerians, which would likely cost about N2.4tn in one year \u2013 an amount that is N600 billion short of the N3tn for fuel subsidy.\n\nHe said, \u201cN5, 000 times 40 million is about N200bn a month. It is N2.4 trillion in one year. This means that the government wants to save N3tn to spend N2.4 trillion. Now, who are the 40 million people? For instance, I buy petrol, but I am not among those who will get N5, 000 a month. So, who are those 40 million to get this money? And how will it be disbursed?\u201d\n\nExperts\u2019 take\n\nExperts are of the opinion that the proposed removal by the government is a little bit tricky, saying the authorities should be very tactful in order to prevent a social backlash. For many, the plan was coming at a very difficult time due to the harsh economic situation.\n\nOn his part, a former director-general of LCCI, Muda Yusuf, said the government must be creative in handling the issue. He said there was no doubt in the sound economic and business case in favour of fuel subsidy removal, \u201cbut the social and political contexts are equally critical.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cCertainly, the subsidy is not sustainable, which is why there is a need to accelerate engagement with the relevant stakeholders to come up with a policy transition strategy that is sustainable, realistic and pragmatic.\u201d\n\nOlamilekan Adefolarin, a political economist and development researcher, noted that the issue of subsidy removal boils down to poor leadership.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian authorities are deficit as a developmental state. And this has impaired our level of national development especially if we have feeble leadership that is ready to implement neoliberal policies. This comes with loans and grants in return to adhere to anti-poor prescription such as removing subsidy on petrol.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the implication on small medium enterprises would firstly, increase their operational and overheads cost. Secondly, it would retard there business as some end up close shop. Thirdly, some SMEs without options may go into liquidation.\n\n\u201cFourthly, it could also lead to massive unemployment. Fiftly, this could also hamper the general health of the economy in all, we should expect the fall out to reverse whatever gains the government intervention fund disbursement to the SMEs in the year.\u201d\n\nPenny wise?\n\nSome Nigerians have described the second leg of the plan as penny wise, pound foolish. They wondered why the government would stop subsidies on petrol and pay N5, 000 to 40 million Nigerians. To cushion the effect on the citizens, the federal government said it would pay N5, 000 to vulnerable Nigerians.\n\nQuestioning the methodology for selecting the 40 million, the LCCI said the method of selecting the beneficiaries is faulty.\n\nShe said, \u201cOn the proposed N5, 000 to be given to some people, we always wonder how the selection is made and from what database or register. What is the guarantee that the money will end up with the right people needing the intervention? One of the biggest problems with our social investment programmes is that we do not have a systematic methodology on how beneficiaries are selected.\u201d\n\nEven for the NLC, \u201cThe intervention we want to provide is for between 30 and 40 million people and there is still a lot of work going on. We have a committee that is chaired by His Excellency, the vice-president, governors and a few of us ministers as members. So, we have to have a landing as to the exact number between 20 to 40 million.\n\n\u201cWe already agreed it will be N5, 000 and we have also agreed that the remittances have to be done digitally. So, the e-Naira will help, but also so are the various payment platforms that are currently available. What we will not do is pay people in cash.\n\n\u201cSo, the transfers that people will receive through one kind of electronic money or the other and it is meant to be for a period of six, nine or 12 months.\n\n\u201cSo, these are things that we are still in negotiation because it\u2019s still money that would have to come from the Federation account. So, everybody that is a member of FAAC will have to agree on the numbers. The maximum will be 12 months; the minimum will be six months.\u201d\n\nThe minister, however, justified the replacement of petroleum subsidy with N5, 000 monthly transportation grants to the \u201cpoorest Nigerians.\u201d\n\nGoing forward\n\nAdefolarin told this reporter that there was a need for the government to build new refineries to complement the ones already on ground.\n\n\u201cConversely, what should be the way forward is for the government to have the will to build new refineries to complement the on-going modular refineries being constructed but replicated across the country.\n\n\u201cSecondly, the Nigerian authorities must see the need to hinge on the development state principle instead of relying so much on market forces and orthodox theologies of price mechanism.\n\n\u201cThirdly, the Petroleum Industry Act law, the government must demonstrate total political will in making to work for all nigerians.PIA open door of opportunities that is not just regulation but making the government an active player in the sector providing petrol at accessible and affordable price for Nigerians through fair competitions as enshrined in the PIA objective,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated\n\nNo tags for this post.",

          "text": "Members of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) have threatened to embark on another industrial action following a three-week ultimatum issued by the union last month.\n\nThey, however, called on well-meaning Nigerians to prevail on the Federal Government to honour the agreement reached with the union.\n\nThe lecturers made the call on Friday at separate briefings held in the northern and southern parts of the country where they said the government\u2019s action has left them with no other option than to withdraw their services.\n\nAt the end of a meeting of the Ibadan Zone of ASUU held at the University of Ilorin, the zonal coordinator, Professor Oyebamiji Oyegoke, said the union has been pushed to the wall over the non-implementation of the Memorandum of Action (MoA) reached with the government in 2020.\n\nHe explained that the union was planning another strike because of the failure to fully implement the MoA.\n\nREAD ALSO: Another Strike Looms As ASUU Issues Three-Week Ultimatum To FG\n\n\u201cGovernment, by its piecemeal implementation of the contentious issues in the MoA of 2020, is not sincere in fulfilling its part of the agreement,\u201d said the don. \u201cSelective treatment of issues in dispute instead of a comprehensive approach will no longer be acceptable to our members; we shall no longer take the issue of welfare of our members for granted.\n\n\u201cAny treatment of MoA of 2020 that precludes its full implementation and rejection of IPPIS will be incomplete. If it has taken ASUU\u2019s position of resuming a suspended strike action to rouse the government from its sleep of non-implementation of the MoA of 2020, one needs to ask, how many of such reminders should ASUU give before its demands are met?\n\n\u201cIt is on the basis of the failure of government to meet up with the promises made as attested to in the MoA of 2020 that the union is calling on Nigerians to intervene at this critical moment. The demands of the union are realistic and holistic in the common interest of the country\u2019s educational and developmental pursuits. If nothing is done, we will be left with no other choice than to withdraw our services until reason prevails.\u201d\n\nAn Inalienable Right\n\nProfessor Oyegoke stated that the agreement was supposed to address the issues of revitalisation of public universities, full payment of the academic earned allowance, withheld salaries and promotion arrears, inconsistencies in the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS) payment, and renegotiation of the 2009 agreement.\n\nHe accused the government of demonstrating an intention to embarrass the collective resolve to save university education from total collapse.\n\n\u201cASUU cannot succumb to this insensitive disposition,\u201d the lecturer stated. \u201cAs we celebrate Human Rights Day today, 10th December, we recall the declaration of 1948 which acknowledged the struggles of the oppressed people around the world.\n\n\u201cSo, we use this opportunity to ask the Nigerian government to respect the rights of the people to education and decent working conditions.\u201d\n\nThe Ibadan zone comprises the University of Ibadan, University of Ilorin, Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Osun State University, and Kwara State University.\n\nA similar briefing was held by members of the Yola Zone of the union at the secretariat of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) in the Adamawa State capital.\n\nThe zonal coordinator, Dr. Reuben Jonathan, also appealed to Nigerians to add their voices by calling on the government to implement the MoA of 2020.\n\nHe asked them to hold the government responsible should the union embark on another strike, stressing the need for traditional and religious leaders among others to intervene so as to avert a looming strike.\n\n\u201cThough education is an inalienable right of every Nigerian child, we are aware that due to the flagrant neglect and frustration of Nigerian public universities, government functionaries are deliberately denying the poor Nigerian children access to university education as their children are secured in private universities all over the world.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, call on the general public and concerned citizens to save public universities by compelling the government to honour its agreements,\u201d said Jonathan.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has assured Nigerians and the international community of free and fair elections when citizens go to the polls to elect a new leader in 2023.\n\nHe gave the assurance on Friday at a Virtual Summit for Democracy organised by President Joe Biden of the United States, saying necessary mechanisms would be strengthened to ensure Nigeria witnesses another peaceful transfer of power.\n\n\u201cAs we countdown to our next general elections in 2023, we remain committed to putting in place and strengthening all necessary mechanisms to ensure that Nigeria will not only record another peaceful transfer of power to an elected democratic government but will also ensure that the elections are conducted in a free, fair and transparent manner,\u201d the President was quoted as saying in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina.\n\n\u201cYour Excellencies, Nigeria will continue to actively support the democratisation processes in our region West Africa and the African continent at large. But regrettably, our democratic gains of the past decades are under threats of unconstitutional takeover of power.\n\n\u201cThis unwholesome trend, sometimes in reaction to unilateral amendments of constitutions by some leaders, must not be tolerated by the international community. Nigeria fully supports the efforts by ECOWAS to address this growing challenge and appreciates the support of both the African Union and the United Nations.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: FG Begins Administration Of COVID-19 Booster Shots\n\nPresident Buhari lamented that Nigeria has continued to face security challenges that pose a threat to democracy, and called on global partners to support the government\u2019s efforts in tackling insurgency and terrorism.\n\nThe country, he said, has had over two decades of uninterrupted democratic governance and has unequivocally remained committed to upholding the core values and principles of democracy.\n\n\u201cSince assuming office in 2015, we have been able to introduce mechanisms to ensure free, fair, and credible elections,\u201d he told the summit. \u201cWe have strengthened our key anti-corruption agencies in collaboration with international partners and have undertaken several anti-corruption measures and initiatives.\u201d\n\nSafeguarding Democratic Values\n\nThe President thanked his American counterpart, as well as the government and people of the United States for hosting the summit.\n\nNoting that democracy has remained the most popular and universally recognised way of governance, he believes it is the only system of governance that guarantees freedom of speech, rule of law, respect for human rights, and inclusiveness in governance.\n\nDemocracy, he added, also promotes social justice, economic and social development, and national and global peace.\n\n\u201cHowever, in spite of these laudable qualities, more is required from us as members of democratic societies, particularly in ensuring that democratic institutions and processes are strengthened, particularly during this period of a global pandemic which has threatened social cohesion in most democracies.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, must remain resolute and enhance cooperation, so that together, we build back better democratic institutions and sustainable democratic values,\u201d President Buhari stated.\n\nAccording to him, the summit is taking place at a time when democratic institutions around the world were facing several challenges.\n\nThe President was hopeful that the event would help promote a positive agenda for democratic renewal by focusing on some of the major challenges faced by democracies in recent times.\n\nThrough collective action, he is confident that countries can safeguard democratic values and principles.\n\nPresident Buhari also decried the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic which made it impossible to convene a physical meeting, saying it has taken a heavy toll on economies, health, and democratic processes around the world.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, we have witnessed the resilience of democratic institutions in many countries that have held free, fair, and transparent democratic elections under very challenging conditions,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s billionaire magnate and chair of Geregu Power Plc Femi Otedola has acquired a further interest in FBN Holdings Plc, the parent company of Nigeria\u2019s oldest lender First Bank, an affirmation that the heated battle for the soul of the financial services group among its principal shareholders is not yet over.\n\nMr Otedola acquired at least 2.5 per cent additional interest in the company, bringing his total stake to 7.57 per cent. Mr Otedola previously made piecemeal acquisitions summing up to 5.07 per cent.\n\nThe purchase will formally consolidate his position as the single biggest shareholder of FBN Holdings, placing him well ahead of his closest rival Tunde Hassan-Odukale, FirstBank\u2019s chairman, whom he has come in contention with since the news of his share acquisitions broke into the open late October.\n\nMr Otedola\u2019s earlier move spurred Mr Hassan-Odukale to swiftly lay claim to 5.36 per cent shareholding in the holdco in what he called \u201ccumulative equity stake\u201d drawn from a combination of his direct, indirect and related party shareholding in the group.\n\nDays after, the board of FBN Holdings issued a letter seen by PREMIUM TIMES to the Corporate Affairs Commission, notifying Hassan-Odukale\u2019s \u201c5.36 per cent\u201d cumulative stake and other related details.\n\nBut the controversial aspect of his declaration, particularly his claim to 1.05 per cent stake held by Leadway Pensure PFA, a company owned by Mr Hassan-Odukale, attracted disapproval from the NGX and the National Pension Commission.\n\nThe wrangle around the claim lies in how an equity investment from a pool of employees\u2019 pension contributions could qualify as a single individual\u2019s investment.\n\nWhile the NGX queried FBN Holdings in October, asking it to explain what it meant by \u201ccumulative equity stake\u201d and Mr Hassan-Odukale\u2019s claim to investment by Leadway Pensure PFA, the pension office late affirmed that shares of FBN Holdings Plc belong to Retirement Savings Account holders, and not a third party as FBN Holdings had claimed.\n\nThat technically puts Hassan-Odukale\u2019s interest in the entity at 4.31 per cent after deducting the controversial stake.",

He eventually pleaded not guilty to six counts of felony disorderly conduct.\n\nThe two brothers, Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo, testified that Smollett paid them to participate in a hoax and instructed them how to attack him. During the trial, the actor took the stand and disputed their accounts.\n\nAn attorney for the Osundairo brothers, Gloria Rodriguez, told reporters after the verdict that for Smollett the verdict meant it was \u201ctime to cut the act, time to come clean.\u201d\n\nLegal experts said Smollett would probably not spend significant time behind bars.\n\n\u201cWhile it\u2019s certainly possible that he could receive a sentence involving prison time, the much more likely scenario is that he would receive probation with some amount of community service,\u201d former Cook County Prosecutor Eryk Wachnik told Reuters.\n\nCook County Judge James Linn did not set a date for sentencing, but scheduled a presentencing hearing for Jan. 27.\n\nSmollett\u2019s acting career declined after the incident. He lost his role as a singer-songwriter in the final season of \u201cEmpire,\u201d a Fox television hip-hop drama that ended a five-year run in 2020.\n\nHis case took an unexpected turn in spring 2019 when the Cook County state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office dropped a 16-count indictment against him in exchange for Smollett forfeiting his $10,000 bond without admitting wrongdoing.\n\nThe dismissal drew criticism from then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel and the city\u2019s police superintendent, who called the reversal a miscarriage of justice.\n\nIn 2019, Webb recommended charging Smollett again and a grand jury returned an indictment.",

          "text": "In a move signalling reciprocity of action, Nigeria\u2019s government, on Thursday reduced Emirates flights to the country, both Lagos and Abuja, from daily to once weekly which would be only on Thursdays.\n\nThe action followed the decision of the government of the United Arabs Emirates (UAE) to cut Nigeria\u2019s Air Peace flight operations to Sharjah to once a week.\n\nThe Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) announced the decision of the government in a letter titled: \u201cWithdrawal of Ministerial Approval of Emirates Airlines Winter Schedule, dated December 9, 2021 and addressed to the Country Manager, Emirates Airlines Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe letter signed by the Director General of NCAA, Captain Musa Nuhu read: \u201cI wish to inform you of the withdrawal of the approval granted to Emirates Airlines winter schedule. This approval was conveyed via a letter with reference number FMA/ATMD/501/C.104/XV/536 dated 1st December 2021 at 2300Z.\n\n\u201cPlease, kindly note, henceforth Emirates Airlines is granted approval to operate only one weekly passenger frequency to Abuja on Thursdays. Please be guided accordingly.\u201d\n\nEmirates, last Sunday, operated flights to the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos and the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, to kick off its return to daily flights to the two Nigerian cities.\n\nOn the other hand, a letter seen by THISDAY that was addressed to Air Peace on the matter stated: \u201cGreetings from Sharjah Airport. This has reference to your earlier request that we have received from your side to resume scheduled operations into Sharjah Airport for the winter season W21/22.\n\n\u201cKindly note that the proposed timings were coordinated with the various stakeholders at Sharjah Airport, despite the terminal congestion and various challenges that will be faced, and with the best intentions we kept in mind our long business relationship we enjoy with Air Peace.\n\n\u201cAs such we are pleased to propose the following timings: Once weekly flight every Thursday (day 4) with arrival time at Sharjah to be STA 01:00 UTC, and departure time from Sharjah will be STD 05:00 UTC.\n\n\u201cWe will be looking closely in the near future for any potential opportunities for Air Peace for the upcoming summer season S22.\u201d\n\nBefore its flights were suspended in February this year by the federal government, Emirates was operating two flights to Lagos daily and one flight a day to Abuja, which made it 21 weekly flights to Nigeria.\n\nIn order to enable Emirates Airlines have monopoly of direct flight from Nigeria to Dubai, UAE has refused to allow the Nigerian carrier operate to the Middle East country.\n\nInvestigations carried out by THISDAY revealed that before the federal government banned Emirates from operation to Nigeria then, the UAE wanted to use Rapid Antigen Test to stop Air Peace from operating to Dubai.\n\nUAE in several media statements had insisted that other airlines would not airlift Nigerians to Dubai and gave other stringent measures, including that Nigerian passengers must have to spend 14 days in another country after leaving Nigeria before they would be due to travel to Dubai if lifted by other airlines.\n\nAir Peace then stopped flying to the city when it became clear that its passengers would be made to conduct about three COVID-19 tests on arrival in the UAE at their own expense, thus making the flights very expensive for its passengers.\n\nThe federal government had resisted that and insisted that it did not have infrastructure for the Rapid Antigen Test and also insisted that airlines flying to Nigeria must abide by its own COVID-19 protocols.\n\nAfter UAE removed the Rapid Antigen Test for Nigerian travellers, the federal government lifted the ban on the airline, but informed source from NCAA hinted that UAE might not want Air Peace to operate to Dubai, while Emirates had already scheduled to resume flights to Nigeria on December 5.\n\nNCAA source disclosed that the Director General of NCAA had withdrawn from the first meeting that was to be held between Nigeria and UAE over the resumption of flights to both countries, when he learnt that Air Peace was not invited for that meeting and it was rescheduled and the Nigerian carrier was in attendance.\n\nInformed source also disclosed to THISDAY that in tandem with the policy of reciprocity of the federal government, the NCAA had resisted all attempts to marginalise the Nigerian carrier by denying it slot to operate to UAE, a policy that was lacking in the past, which led to the shortchanging of Nigerian carriers.\n\nMinister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika, had explained how the federal government resisted UAE attempt to allow only Emirates to operate to Nigeria, using stringent COVID-19 protocol, which the minister described as discriminatory and ensured that Nigeria resisted it.\n\n\u201cGovernment should be applauded for standing its ground before this absolute impunity by UAE.

Muhammadu Buhari, as he then was, the presidential candidate of the party at the time, promised to pick Bola Tinubu as his running mate in the 2015 election.\n\nChronicling the events that led to the eventual selection of Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, Akande, in his autobiography, \u201cMy Participations\u201d, published by Gaskia Media Limited, disclosed how Buhari who was then under pressure to drop the former Lagos governor, later reneged on the agreement.\n\nIn the book which was launched in Lagos, the octogenarian also took a swipe at the trio of Ayo Adebanjo, Olu Falae and Sir Olaniwun Ajayi, coming short of accusing them of selecting themselves to represent the Yoruba people during Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s National Conference because of what he termed \u201cgenerous allowances.\u201d\n\nAkande stressed that despite the pledge to make Tinubu his vice presidential candidate, Buhari later faltered, saying that he only said that he wanted the former Lagos governor to \u201cpartner with him.\u201d\n\nBut the politician admitted that at the time Buhari was under enormous pressure, especially from some northern governors who insisted that a Muslim-Muslim ticket arrangement was a no-go area.\n\nHe revealed that it would be the second time that Tinubu would be getting very close to becoming a vice presidential candidate, noting that the first time was when Atiku Abubakar, who was then contesting as president later chose Ben Obi.\n\nAkande confirmed that Tinubu was instrumental to the emergence of Osinbajo as running mate to Buhari after he was formally dropped and asked to submit three names from the South-west from which Buhari would pick one.\n\nAccording to the book, Buhari at a point during the formation of the APC started to admire Tinubu for his business acumen and his ability to organise people, key features that got then candidate Buhari close to the APC national leader.\n\n\u201cIn April 2014, I was in Abuja when Buhari called me and asked me to persuade Bola to run with him. Governor Masari was the one who came to call me. When I followed him into Buhari\u2019s private lobby, Bola Tinubu was already seated there.\n\n\u201cSo, when Buhari tabled the matter, I cautioned them that this must not get out beyond the four of us. \u2018How could he be talking of a running mate when he had not secured the ticket?\u201d I mused.\n\n\u201cI thought such information, if leaked to the general public, might affect the conduct of the party\u2019s congress at the presidential primaries, if not its choice of candidate. I thanked Buhari for thinking so highly of our friend.\n\n\u201cBola later told me that Buhari\u2019s emissaries had been coming to him, but he tried to dodge the gesture and not to show interest. We agreed that we would reopen the matter when Buhari had secured the ticket,\u201d he explained.\n\nHowever, he expressed surprise that thereafter, when Buhari became the party\u2019s candidate, things changed, with former APC chair, Odigie Oyegun, who was supported by Tinubu to become chairman of the party, asking for names from the geopolitical zones from where Buhari will pick his running mate.\n\n\u201cHe said it was from this list that Buhari would choose a running mate. I objected. I turned to Buhari. \u2018General, where are you choosing your running mate from?\u2019 He answered, \u2018The South-west.\u2019 \u2018Oh! I didn\u2019t know,\u2019Oyegun said. He apologised.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know why Oyegun made that proposition and at whose behest. As the chairman of the party, maybe some people pushed him to do that,\u201d he noted.\n\nAkande continued: \u201cThen, I called Buhari aside. \u2018Is our arrangement still standing?\u2019 I referred him to our discussion in April. He said yes! \u201c\n\nAccording to him some members of the party eventually agreed that a committee should be set up to search for Buhari\u2019s running mate , a move himself and former Governor of Edo state, Adams Oshiohmhole, opposed.\n\n\u201cAdams Oshiohmhole , then Governor of Edo State, stood up and said we were being dishonest. He said he was a serving governor and many of those in the Elders Committee had been governors.\n\n\u2018\u2019Did we set up a committee to give us our running mates?\u2019 He asked. \u2018It is not fair!\u2019 He further said what we were pushing was a dangerous act and that we should allow Buhari to choose his running mate. So, we left,\u201d he narrated.\n\nAkande stated that he later came to know that some people constituted themselves into a group, called the Northern Interest Group, and they prevailed on Buhari not to allow a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\nAccording to him, it was the following day after the Elders\u2019 Committee meeting which was deadlocked, that Buhari phoned Tinubu to give him three names from which he would pick a running mate.\n\n\u201cWe were all in Abuja and Tinubu rushed to me with this information. He wanted to know whether the understanding we reached with Buhari had changed. I called Buhari and he told me he now needed three names from us. I was angry with him.\n\n\u2018\u2018General, this was not what we agreed upon,\u2019 I said in annoyance. \u2018You are changing our agreement?\u2019 He knew I was getting angry. He said he was under pressure from some governors from the north, including those who were Muslims. I told him the slot belonged to the South-West and among the Yoruba, religion is not a factor in leadership,\u201d he said.\n\nAkande added: \u201cOshiomhole was surprised about the narration. \u2018If indeed you promised to make Asiwaju your running mate, it would not be fair to renege,\u2019 he said. Buhari now said he never meant it that way. What he meant originally was that Tinubu should partner with him.\u201d\n\nThe former Osun governor explained that he didn\u2019t know what that meant because before they discussed the issue of Tinubu as the partner or vice-president\u2019s ticket, a merger had been accomplished and they had already partnered.\n\n\u201cWe were registered in July 2013, and he called me to prevail on Tinubu to be his running mate in April 2014. Buhari knew I was upset but we tried to manage the situation. Perhaps he was overwhelmed by all those pressures. We decided to let him go,\u201d Akande said.\n\nHe insisted that once it became apparent that Buhari would be the presidential candidate, he was interested in making Tinubu his running mate.\n\n\u201cIn our years of interactions and engagements, he seemed to have come to know and admire Tinubu.\n\n\u201cHe constantly seemed to admire Tinubu\u2019s business acumen; his courage in politics, his large heart, his native intelligence, his readiness to forgive those who have betrayed him but who now show remorse, his empathy for the under-privileged, his capacity as a tactician, and a strategist of the highest hue, his loyalty to the ideas of Nigerian unity and good governance, and his steadfastness to his friends,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to him, without Tinubu, the \u201cAPC miracle\u201d would have been more difficult if not impossible. \u201cAll these made Buhari to admire and respect him,\u201d he said.\n\nHe narrated that what prompted the push for a Tinubu as vice president for the first time under Atiku was that anytime they said they needed money, Atiku would say \u201cBola please help us\u201d.\n\n\u201cBola (Tinubu) was the only one spending the money among us. The rest of us were poor. Tinubu also put all his energy and resources into the formation of the AC and we felt he deserved a spot on the ticket,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHe also wrote about Tinubu\u2019s frustration with the entire rigmarole, eventually opting to leave Abuja for Lagos.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be part of whatever you are discussing now, \u2018he said. \u2018I don\u2019t trust Buhari anymore! Even if we give him names, he may decide to go outside the list. So, let him choose on his own. He was unhappy with Buhari.\n\n\u201cI told him that was not the attitude to adopt. We were trying to toy with some names and I wanted him to participate in the discussion. After some time, Amosun, Aregbesola and I were considering some names. Then I decided to call Tinubu again.\n\n\u2018We negotiated with Buhari in 2011 and gave him a name to choose instead of Pastor Bakare,\u2019 I spoke to Tinubu on phone. \u2018Who was that person?\u2019 l asked.\n\n\u2018It was Yemi Osinbajo,\u2019 Tinubu declared. I asked Aregbesola to find out where Osinbajo was. He called him on the phone. \u2018Yemi, where are you?\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t you know your case is coming up tomorrow?\u2019 \u2018l am in Abuja to argue your case.\u2019 Osinbajo answered at the other end. \u2018Which hotel are you staying?\u201d Osinbajo told him.\n\n\u201cI got a blank sheet of paper and wrote Yemi Osinbajo on it. I instructed Amosun and Aregbesola to deliver that note to Buhari immediately. It was almost midnight. Then the two of them left.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cI was waiting for Buhari to call me after he must have received my message. He did not. It was Tinubu who came to me at the wee hours of the morning. He was not in a good mood and was worried that Buhari might visit our efforts with bad faith.\n\n\u201cLet us go back to Lagos\u201d, he said. Why? I asked. \u201cMaybe Buhari has his own agenda,\u201d he said. Even if we give him a name , he might not use the person. Maybe he just wants to use us for whatever his agenda might be.\u201d\n\n\u201cI reassured him that Buhari will not disappoint us and that he would agree with our choice as the vice presidential candidate of our party,\u201d Akande said.\n\nTaking a swipe at the trio of Adebanjo, Ajayi and Falae, Akande said it was surprising that the elders could not find any younger Yoruba to send to the conference to represent the interest of the ethnic group.\n\n\u201c They believed, even in their old age, that they were the only people who could have gone there. Sir Ajayi, who was close to 90 at the time of the conference, has since joined his ancestors. Chief Adebanjo celebrated his 90th birthday in 2018. Chief Falae is in his 80s. Note that Jonathan paid the conference delegates generous allowances.\n\n\u201cChief Olu Falae, a trained civil servant, who after retirement became decorated into leadership by his former military bosses, has since been trying to blindly straddle Nigeria\u2019s complicated politics,\u201d he opined.\n\nHe characterised Adebanjo as a blank politically-minded leader who recognises readily and always that he never has what it takes to aspire for high political positions.\n\n\u201cHe constantly harbours lumps of yellow hate-bile in his heart for any co-political leader with brighter chances for any major public office within or outside his political party,\u201d he posited.\n\nAkande further noted in the autobiography that the APC did not have \u2018restructuring\u2019 in its manifesto for the 2015 elections but promised to support devolution of powers from the centre to the States.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore mischievous to place the responsibility for effecting restructuring on the APC or its presidency and not to appreciate that it would require deft negotiations among such members from different ethnic nationalities and constituencies or zonal and religious background before any political party or any ethnic nationality could successfully issue any fiat on the National Assembly to make laws on power devolution or on restructuring, whatever it might connote,\u201d he argued.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",
