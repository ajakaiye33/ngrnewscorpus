          "title": "Fuel scarcity: Private depots hike rates, more filling stations may sell above N180/litre",
          "text": "The cost of Premium Motor Spirit, popularly called petrol, may hit or exceed N180/litre in most filling stations in coming weeks if nothing is done about a recent hike in its ex-depot price by private depot owners.\n\nIt was gathered that most private depot owners recently raised the cost of petrol from the approved N142-N145/litre price to between N162-N170/litre.\n\nThis, oil marketers said, had already made some filling stations owned by independent marketers to start dispensing petrol at N180/litre, above the approved and regulated pump price of N165/litre.\n\nBut the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited, Nigeria\u2019s sole importer of petrol, said it was not aware of the hike in price by private depot owners.\n\nAlso, the regulator of the sector, Nigeria Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority demanded independent marketers to make a formal complaint, while the oil dealers argued that they had already informed the agency.\n\nThe National Public Relations Officer, Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria, Chief Ukadike Chinedu, told our correspondent that although the number of filling stations in Lagos and Abuja that sold petrol above the regulated rate were few, many outlets in other states currently dispense the product at N170-N180/litre.\n\nHe said, \u201cPetrol is being sold in private tank farms (depots) at N167 to N170/litre. In fact, a friend contacted me to say that some tank farm owners were selling at N180/litre in Port Harcourt.\n\n\u201cSo I want to tell you that fuel will be available but it will be expensive in many more areas in the coming weeks if they (depot owners) continue like this.\u201d\n\nHe explained that the non-supply of the products by the NNPC to the oil company\u2019s inland depots had warranted the high cost of products at private tank farms.\n\n\u201cWhat is required is that the NNPC should supply these products to their inland depots to ensure that facilities such as Warri and Port Harcourt refineries and some depots have products so that marketers can take fuel at the approved N142-N145/litre price,\u201d Ukadike said.\n\nHe added, \u201cThe National President of IPMAN, Debo Ahmed, has directed that all marketers should run 24 hours service and he appealed to security agencies to provide adequate security.\n\n\u201cSo that is what we need now and I also want to let you know that the price of petrol in some filling stations is above N165/litre as approved by the government. And this is because they are not getting the product at the approved NNPC price.\u201d\n\nWhen told that the commodity was still dispensed at the approved rate of N165/litre in parts of Abuja and Lagos, the IPMAN spokesperson replied, \u201cIf you watch closely, it is mainly the major marketers and some mega filling stations.\n\n\u201cAnd this is because these major marketers, who are far less in number than independent marketers, particularly in other states outside the two areas you mentioned, source their products from the NNPC.\n\n\u201cBut independent marketers source their products mostly from private tank farm owners and a few from the NNPC. But right now these private tank farm owners sell at about N170/litre.\u201d\n\nOn why the private depots were selling above the regulated price, Ukadike stated that this was what the government should address.\n\n\u201cAnd when an independent marketer locks his filling station, they will say there is a product but independent marketers are refusing to buy so as to cause scarcity by hoarding products\u201d he stated.\n\nThe oil marketer added, \u201cIf we buy PMS at N170litre, how much are we going to sell it in our filling stations? And tomorrow the authorities will come and lock up our stations and use police to arrest our pump attendants.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, these things happen while the facts are there for all to see.\u201d\n\nIt was gathered on Sunday that petrol sold for N250 per litre in some filling stations in Rivers State last week mainly because independent marketers purchased the commodity above the official depot price.\n\nAlso in Jos, Plateau State, it was learnt that the PMS price increased to between N175 and N200 per litre in some filling stations operated by independent marketers.\n\nReports from Bayelsa further confirmed the price increase, as it was gathered that a litre of fuel was sold for N170, N185, N195, N200, N215 and N250 at various filling stations operated by independent marketers.\n\nUkadike said the situation would persist unless the government called private depot owners to order.\n\nHe stressed that independent marketers would definitely run at a loss if they dispensed petrol at the official N165/litre rate after purchasing it at about N170/litre.\n\nThe manager of a filling station in Kubwa, a suburb in Abuja, confirmed that some private depots were dispensing above the rate approved by the government.\n\n\u201cPrivate depots are selling above the approved rate of N145/litre and if this continues, very soon petrol price will go above N180 even in Abuja because it is already like that in many states,\u201d the independent marketer, who pleaded not to be named for fear of being victimised, stated.\n\nThe NNPC is the sole supplier of petrol into Nigeria for about four years running and it supplies the product to tank farms or depot owners, from where filling stations come to make purchases.\n\nBut when told the complaints of independent marketers against depot owners, the Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division, NNPC, Garba-Deen Muhammad, stated that he was unaware of the development.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not aware of that honestly,\u201d Muhammad stated, as he maintained that the oil company had been bringing in products to ensure enough supply and that queues for petrol across the country were adequately cleared.\n\nThe NNPC recently stated that it was working hard to address the queues caused by the imports of adulterated petrol. It had announced that over 2.3 billion litres of PMS would arrive in the country before the end of February 2022.\n\nThis, it said, would restore sufficiency level above the national target of 30 days\n\nIt also stated that the oil firm had over one billion litres of petrol in stock, and the PMS being dispensed currently at various filling stations across the country was safe.\n\nAlso, when the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority was contacted on the concerns of independent marketers about the hike in PMS price by private depots, its spokesperson, Kimchi Apollo, said filling station owners should lodge their complaints formally with the NMDPRA.\n\nHe said, \u201cIf that was true they should escalate it to us. They should let us know. They should make it known to the authority. Ask them to escalate it to the authority so that we will know that such an issue is going on and then correct it.\u201d\n\nThe NMDPRA is the regulatory agency for the downstream and midstream oil sector. It has the power to sanction erring depots and filling stations that dispense petrol above the approved rates.\n\nBut when told the response of the NMDPRA and asked if independent marketers had tabled their concern to the authority, the IPMAN PRO replied in the affirmative.\n\nUkadike said, \u201cWe have. This is because we have made it public that we are no longer buying this product at a government-stipulated rate. Rather we are buying it at between N162 and N170 per litre from private depots.\n\n\u201cIs it not for the authority to carry out its investigations and find out whether the issue we\u2019ve raised is true or not? This is because if this is allowed to fester, the pump price of petrol will get to or above N180/litre.\n\n\u201cDo we need to carry placards or embark on strike? No! We want to remain peaceful in business and we don\u2019t want Nigerians to suffer. If we say we are not going to buy, there will be fuel scarcity.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cFuel scarcity, of course, will hit hard on the masses. Also, we have our facilities and tickets lying down, we need to buy products, sell and pay workers\u2019 salaries. We need to maintain our facilities, pay rent both to government and others.\u201d\n\nThe IPMAN PRO emphasised that the hike in depot price for PMS was the major reason why the commodity was being dispensed above the official N165/litre price in many fillings stations belonging to independent marketers in states.\n\n\u201cThat is why you see different rates higher than the official price in filling stations in many states because there is no way you can buy at between N165 and N170/litre and the government will expect you to sell at N165/litre,\u201d he stated.\n\nUkadike added, \u201cWho will now bear the loss? This is why we are advocating that the government through the NNPC should send their products to their inland depots because there is no way the inland depots can inflate the price. But private tank farm owners will inflate the price.\u201d\n\nAsked what could be the reason why the NNPC often supply PMS to private tank farm owners, the IPMAN official said, \u201cWhen you ask them that question, they will say it is because of pipeline vandalism.\n\n\u201cBut who\u2019s responsibility is it to protect these pipelines? Is it not for them to strengthen their systems? Why are they choosing to send their products to private tank farm owners rather than their own depots? Most of their inland depots have no product.\u201d\n\nAn official at the NNPC said some private tank farms were easily accessible for smaller vessels to discharge PMS, but noted that it was the regulator\u2019s duty to ensure that these depots complied with the approved ex-depot price to forestall a widespread hike in the pump price of petrol.\n\nWhen contacted, the Executive Secretary, Depot and Petroleum Products Marketers Association of Nigeria, Olufemi Adewole, did not respond. A text message sent to him on the matter had yet to be replied to up till when this report was filed in.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "FG admits inspection failure caused dirty fuel imports, prices soar in states",
          "text": "The scarcity of Premium Motor Spirit, popularly called petrol, which has lingered for about two weeks, is not due to the absence of products but inspection failure, the Federal Government stated on Sunday.\n\nIt disclosed this as queues by motorists persisted in various filling stations in Abuja and neighbouring states of Nasarawa and Niger, as well as in other locations across the country.\n\nThis came as the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, expressed regrets over the importation of adulterated petrol into Nigeria and its attendant adverse impact nationwide.\n\nIn a statement issued in Abuja by his Senior Adviser, Media and Communications, Horatius Egua, the minister said inspection failure caused the scarcity of petrol in Nigeria, as he sympathised with Nigerians on behalf of the Federal Government.\n\nHe said, \u201cIn the last weeks, Nigerians have grappled with fuel scarcity, not because of the absence of supply of products but due to inspection failure, which allowed adulterated products into the country.\n\n\u201cThis is regrettable, and the Federal Government sympathises with the citizenry over the unforeseen hardship, occasioned by the inevitable scarcity.\n\n\u201cLet me once again appeal to Nigerians to be patient with the government in finding lasting solutions to the crisis.\u201d\n\nSylva appreciated the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited for showing concern to the plight of Nigerians by coming forward with an apology.\n\n\u201cThis is unprecedented and shows that we on the government side are not afraid to take responsibility,\u201d he stated. He further noted that the Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority had been out on the streets to ensure that the situation normalised quickly, adding that the government was beginning to see the fruits of these efforts.\n\nSylva said, \u201cThis is a time that calls for collective action to save a situation that was not foreseen. It is not a time to trade blames as is customary in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore not a time to query anyone but a time to come together to salvage the plight of the average Nigerian.\n\n\u201cAfter the storm settles there will be time enough to investigate and get to the bottom, so that this does not repeat itself.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Coalition of Concerned Northern Forum has asked the Federal Government to sack the top management staff of the NNPC over the lingering fuel scarcity within 72 hours\n\nThe group said this in a statement jointly signed by the Chairman, Mallam Ibrahim Bature; and the spokesperson, Abdulsalam Kazeem, in Kaduna on Sunday.\n\nThe group warned that the failure of the government to act would lead to mass protest.\n\nMeanwhile, transport fares, prices of foodstuff and other commodities have risen by over 60 per cent as Premium Motor Spirit, popularly known as petrol, is being sold above N300 in many filling stations in Anambra State.\n\nOur correspondent, who went around the state on Sunday, observed that transporters had increased their fares. A journey from Oba junction to Upper Iweka in Onitsha, which used to be N200 as of last week, went for N400, while a journey from Onitsha to Awka, which was formerly N500 went for as high as N800.\n\nThe development affected all the major cities of the state like Nnewi, Onitsha, Oba, Idemili, Nkwelle and some parts of Awka, where tricycle operators also increased their fares significantly on all routes.\n\nFoodstuffs and other commodities sold in the markets were not left out as prices of foodstuffs also increased.\n\nThe situation led to hot exchanges between sellers and buyers in some markets.\n\nIn Bayelsa State, the fuel scarcity persisted as more filling stations operated by the independent petroleum marketers remained shut for business within Yenagoa and its environs.\n\nThe PUNCH gathered on Sunday that a few of the petrol stations that opened for business at the weekend around the Isaac Boro Expressway were selling a litre of the petroleum product for N250 and N300.\n\nIt was learnt that only the NNPC mega filling station along the Sani Abacha Expressway and another NNPC-affiliated facility at the Akenfa suburb of the state capital dispensed fuel at N162 per litre.\n\nThis had resulted in a long queue of vehicles at both stations even as consumers with different sizes of jerrycans scrambled to buy the product.\n\nAs tension persisted over fuel scarcity in Kwara State, the state government has redoubled its effort to ensure that the hardship encountered by motorists is ameliorated.\n\nOn Sunday, the state government continued the monitoring of distribution and sale of petroleum products, especially within the Ilorin metropolis.\n\nThe Commissioner for Business, Innovation and Technology, Hajia Arinola Lawal, who led the monitoring team through Taiwo, Adewole and Geri Alimi areas of the state capital, expressed displeasure over the alleged sharp practices of some dealers.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Obaship: Ifa rejects MC Oluomo (2)",
          "text": "When the British-American documentary film producer, Theroux, flew into Lagos from the US in 2010, looking for the hotbed of gangsterism in Nigeria, Oshodi stood naked in the sun.\n\nTheroux\u2019 choice of Oshodi as the General Headquarters (GHQ) of disorder wasn\u2019t a product of fate, fancy or accident. His choice was informed by the crippling fear, curdling blood and nasty death the NURTW had unleashed on the fiefdom called Oshodi. As the epicentre of violence, Oshodi symbolises the missing teeth in the dentition of a motor park tout, plucked out with a hammer or blow or kick.\n\nAs the Chairman, Lagos NURTW, Alhaji Tajudeen Agbede, lived in Agege when MC Oluomo was the state treasurer of the union in 2010. While shooting his 2010 investigative documentary, Law and Disorder in Lagos, Theroux didn\u2019t head for the Agege residence of Agbede, it was to the Oshodi residence of Oluomo he headed because he clearly knows Oshodi is the headquarters of NURTW violence and killings in Nigeria.\n\nOn one of his visits to the highly guarded Oshodi residence of MC, Theroux peruses some of the portraits in one of his sitting rooms. A particular portrait catches his fancy, and he asks Mamock \u2013 Oluomo\u2019s henchman \u2013 \u201cWho\u2019s is this one?\u201d Mamock replies, \u201c(The portrait) is on his coronation as the Oluomo of Oshodi-Isolo. It was presented by Happy Sisters\u2019 Club.\u201d\n\nThe surprised journalist asks, \u201cOh, he was crowned the Oluomo? Is it for his whole life? There can be no other (Oluomo)? Mamock replies twice with relish, \u201cThere can be no other.\u201d\n\nIn a recent interview by an online medium, Gbefila TV, MC Oluomo, mistaking the Oshodi traditional crown for a snatchable motor park, introduced himself as \u201cAlhaji Dr KING Musiliu Ayinde Akinsanya, state chairman, NURTW, Lagos State,\u201d boasting in Yoruba, \u201cLagos is ours, not theirs.\u201d Were MC Oluomo capable of distilling his thoughts in paltry English, he would\u2019ve said, \u201cNa we put Lagos for pocket.\u201d\n\nAs a dropout, who cannot read and write, Oluomo isn\u2019t likely to know Yoruba history. As an agbero, he isn\u2019t likely to know Yoruba culture and tradition. But he\u2019s a multi-billionaire and a huge factor in determining who becomes the senator, House of Representatives members, state House of Assembly members, chairmen and councillors in the Oshodi-Isolo constituency \u2013 in a country where vice chancellors don\u2019t earn N1 million monthly salary.\n\nThe husband of Alhaja Madinat, Alhaja Temitope and Alhaja Aisha, among many mistresses, needs to be educated that in Yoruba tradition and culture, a prince can\u2019t be a chief, except only in Ibadanland, with its unique kingship system, where the 11 rotational high chiefs that make up the Olubadan-in-Council were second class traditional rulers, apart from the Olubadan, under the Western Nigerian Law, which also placed them as traditional heads of the 11 LGAs of Ibadan.\n\nMC Oluomo probably doesn\u2019t know this because he\u2019s not royalty. He needs to be told that Oluomo is a chieftaincy title not bestowed on princes. The Oluomo title is also not a backdoor, pickaxe or gun to snatch the traditional crown of Oshodi.\n\nAccording to some news stories and articles, MC Oluomo\u2019s octogenarian mother, Alhaja Abebi Zinat, who passed on in April 2020, hailed from Abeokuta while his father, Baba Akinsanya, who died when he was in primary school, was from Ejigbo in Lagos State. Therefore, in both his patriarchal and matriarchal lineages, MC Oluomo isn\u2019t qualified to be Oshodi king because, according to historic accounts on the founding of Oshodi, neither his Awori-Ejigbo nor Abeokuta ancestries have links with the Oshodi traditional palace.\n\nGiving an insight into the ancestry and kingship of Oshodi, a Professor of History, Osun State University, Osogbo, Siyan Oyeweso, said, \u201cOshodi Tapa was a Nupe prince in Nupeland, but a slave in the court of the King of Eko, Oba Eshinlokun. Through hard work, loyalty and warfare skills, he rose to become balogun.\n\n\u201cThe descendants of Balogun Oshodi Tapa occupy two far-flung geographical territories in Lagos State, Epetedo on Lagos Island, and the popular Oshodi where Oshodi market is situated. The original name of the contemporary Oshodi was Oshodi-Oko.\n\n\u201cThe geographical delineation of towns we have today doesn\u2019t exist in those days. It was the Onigbesa of Igbesa, who freely gave the land (Oshodi Oko) to Oshodi Tapa in appreciation of the long-time friendship between the two, and in recognition of past services rendered to the Onigbesa. Igbesa is in Ogun State today.\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, Epetedo, now occupied by followers and descendants of Oshodi Tapa, was originally owned by Chief Aromire of one of the highly revered chieftaincy institutions in Lagos \u2013 the Idejo land-owning class of Lagos. The land was gifted to Oshodi Tapa by Chief Aromire at the instance of the colonial governor, Hawley Glover.\n\n\u201cOshodi Tapa died on July 2, 1868, about six years after his return from exile in Epe, leaving 46 surviving children.\n\n\u201cThe song, \u2018Iran Oshodi lo l\u2019Epetedo, oba lo ni Ereko\u2026,\u2019 by King Sunny Ade, is not totally true because the area now referred to as Epetedo originally belonged to Aromire.\u201d\n\nIn an inaugural address entitled, \u201cThe Undertakers, The Python\u2019s Eye and the Footsteps of the Ant: The Historian\u2019s Burden,\u201d delivered in 2006, Oyeweso argued that, \u201cThe ancestor of the (Oshodi) dynasty, Oshodi Tapa (Landunji), was Nupe from the Niger area. He was an ex-slave of Oba Eshinlokun who later distinguished himself as a valiant warrior and a generalissimo in Oba Kosoko\u2019s various wars. Kosoko was Eshinlokun\u2019s son.\n\n\u201cOshodi Tapa was the hero of Ogun Olomiro of June 1845 and Ogun Agidingbi, or Ogun Ahoyaya of December 1851 \u2013 the \u2018Booming\u2019 or \u2018Boiling Battle\u2019. On the military submission of Kosoko\u2019s party to the British Navy, Oshodi Tapa led about 1,500 pro-Kosoko warriors and faithfuls to Epe where they established effective rulership and dominance.\n\n\u201cThe Kosoko\u2019s years in Epe lasted between 1852 and 1862. It is apt to note that all the negotiations for Kosoko\u2019s eventual return to Lagos were handled by Oshodi Tapa. The Lagos area where Kosoko\u2019s followers were settled is now known as Epetedo while an Iga Oshodi has also been instituted. A section of the Oshodi Tapa family is now known as Oshodi\u2013Glover on account of the latter\u2019s association with an ex-colonial chieftain. In Oshodi-Oko, a former farmstead of Oshodi Tapa, an elaborate traditional political structure has also been established.\u201d\n\nOyeweso\u2019s postulations go to show that only the descendants of Oshodi Tapa can lay claim to the Oshodi stool because historically, it was their progenitor, Oshodi Tapa, that founded \u2018an elaborate traditional political structure\u2019 on the land freely given to their father, and not any Awori from Ejigbo. Therefore, Chief MC Oluomo needs to explain his link with Oshodi Tapa, if Sanwo-Olu would be fair in choosing a ruler for Oshodi, which has never had an oba, but baale.\n\nThere\u2019s no gainsaying the fact that so much blood has been shed in Oshodi within the MC Oluomo-led NURTW. The Lagos State Council of Obas doesn\u2019t need violence and bloodshed. It\u2019s instructive to recall that Oluomo himself was stabbed several times in January 2019 when an intra-NURTW gun battle broke out during the inaugural campaign of the APC governorship candidate, Sanwo-Olu.\n\nOluomo, rumoured to have died from the attack, was promptly flown abroad for medical treatment. Three journalists, Group Political Editor, The Nation newspapers, Emmanuel Oladesu; New Telegraph correspondent, Temitope Ogunbanke, and Ibile Television cameraman, Abiodun Yusuf, were hit by stray bullets during the gun duel witnessed by Sanwo-Olu, Governor Akinwunmi Ambode, among others APC leaders at the 2019 campaign.\n\nIn December 2021, a leader of the Lagos NURTW, Kunle Ajibade, was killed in the Ijeshatedo area of the state. Ajibade, 28, was stabbed in his house multiple times by assailants and was rushed to a hospital. His assailants trailed him to the hospital and shot him dead.\n\nWhile gangsterism is the preoccupation of Theroux in his audacious documentary, Oyeweso explores the concept of organic citizenship as a vehicle for societal integration, peace and development.\n\nTo be concluded.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

One hundred per local government because we have 33 local governments in Oyo State.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe significance of this training is the empowerment so that the youths can be able to take up the challenges of Agribusiness. After production what next? The value chain and what they have learned in Nasarawa as they have been well equipped for the work ahead.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe state government under the leadership of Governor Seyi Makinde has directed the various local governments to provide land for these youths which is one of the basic things they need.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe financial aspect has been guaranteed by the state government so that as the last batch arrived today the next step is do them to be set up.\u201d Akande said.\n\nHe assured that the state government will commence implementation of the next phase as soon as possible, saying that all participants have been captured through biometric means.\n\nAkande added that the farmlands which will be provided for agribusiness purpose will be given to the youths grouped into clusters for effective monitoring on their developmental process.\n\nSome of the YEAP beneficiaries who spoke with journalists expressed their satisfaction towards the way and manner their welfare were being taken care of throughout the training programme, noting that the training was all agribusiness inclusive.\n\nOne of the beneficiaries, Adeyinka Okanlawon from Saki West Local Government Area of Oke-Ogun zone, expressed his appreciation to Makinde for the privilege to participate in what he described as very laudable and expository programme, saying that the training has exposed him to various opportunities in agribusiness.\n\nAnother beneficiary, Olajire Aduragbemi Kehinde from Ido Local Government Area of Ibadan, said she learnt many things she never knew from the training saying: \u201cI really learnt alot from the training programme from the greenhouses to agrophonix the six ways of cultivating cassava without weeding as well as how to add value to farm produce keying into the agribusiness value chain.\u201d\n\nNiyi Oluwabunmi Esther from Ogbomoso North Local Government Area said going to Nasarawa has changed her perception about many things including keying into the agribusiness value chain to earn a decent living and being financially independent.\n\nExcited Kolade Kehinde from Oyo East Local Government said: \u201cactually we spent two weeks but that two weeks felt like years because when you go to certain places to learn and you return home having achieved your target then you\u2019re ready to go.\u201d\n\nAnother beneficiary, Oribamise Temitope, said she is ready to go into fish farming, describing Makinde as amiable and quintessential leader.\n\nShe commended the governor for initiating the programme for the youths saying, Makinde has thought the youths how to fish from the river.\n\n\u201cKudos to you sir for working assiduously to turn things around for the best for us in Oyo State.

          "text": "There are indications that the Trade Union Congress (TUC) may soon direct its members to boycott work if the challenge of fuel scarcity across the country persists for the next few days.\n\nThose the TUC intends to pass the directive across in the coming days are workers in statutory corporations and government-owned institutions.\n\nThe Congress also are not also comfortable with the presidency, which they have demanded that President Muhammadu Buhari be more proactive in identifying and punishing those who are behind the scarcity that has brought untold hardship upon Nigerians.\n\nNational Treasurer of TUC, Mohammad Yunusa, gave the threat during an interview with Labour Correspondents in Abuja at weekend during the delegate conference of Senior Staff Association of Statutory Corporations and Government-Owned Companies (SSASCGOC).\n\nYunusa, who was also immediate past President-General of SSASCGOC, explained that members of his association have already been directed to stay at their respective homes pending when there will be a regular supply of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) popularly called Petrol.\n\nHe said, \u201dThe union\u2019s position is very clear. Those who caused this scarcity should be identified and punished very well. The position of SSASCGOC also is that, you know we are affiliated to TUC, and we have made it known to TUC that let the workers stop going to work until there is enough fuel to take them to work.\n\n\u201dThis is the way to do it. We are waiting for our centre to respond to our position but our position in SSASCGOC is that there is no need to go to work. Hang around in your house.

          "text": "By Yusuf Alli and Jide Orintinsin, Abuja\n\nParley to set agenda for tomorrow\u2019s talks with Buhari\n\nCongresses to hold in zones\n\nWith the caretaker committee foot-dragging on plans for the party\u2019s convention slated for Saturday, All Progressives Congress (APC) governors will meet today on the fate of the exercise.\n\nThe caretaker committee has not taken the needed steps to make the convention possible aside from notifying the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\n\u201cNo other steps necessary to show preparation for the convention has been taken by the caretaker committee, hence, the necessity for today\u2019s meeting by the governors,\u201d a source close to the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF), said at the weekend.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIt was learnt that today\u2019s meeting will prepare grounds for tomorrow\u2019s meeting of the governors and members of the Mai Mala-Buni led Caretaker Committee with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa.\n\nThe meeting was shifted last week to enable the President to travel to Belgium for the European Union-Africa Union (EU-AU) Summit in Brussels.\n\nThe President returned on Saturday.\n\nA source said the caretaker committee is planning to ask for a long shift of the convention, but some governors are believed to be angry about this.\n\nThey are said to be interested in a two-week shift from February 26 to March 12.\n\nPart of the argument for the shift of date being proposed by the caretaker committee, it was learnt, is the need to hold the zonal congresses to elect the zonal vice chairmen before the election of the members of the National Working Committee (NWC).\n\nAnother argument is that the February 26 date coincides with by-elections in eight APC states.\n\nThe Saturday date is shaky because the caretaker committee has failed to unveil pre-convention activities, including zoning, sale of nomination forms, the inauguration of sub-committees and submission of forms.\n\nAlready, APC has ward, council and state executive committees in place.\n\nThe party\u2019s Directorate of Organisation had been directed to prepare a schedule of activities and budget for zonal congresses.\n\nThe date for the zonal congress, however, will be released after the party leadership has secured the nod of President Buhari on zoning and micro-zoning.\n\nIt was gathered that apart from employing the zonal congress to buy more time, the arrangement was put in place by the caretaker committee to perfect the consensus mode of electing new party leaders and flag-bearers for the 2023 general elections.\n\nA source, who pleaded anonymity, said the Caretaker Committee and some governors perfected the zonal congress arrangement while President Buhari was in Belgium and intend to sell the idea to him, with the support of some influential members of the Federal Executive Council.\n\nThe source said: \u201cHaving conducted congresses from the ward to the state level, the line of argument of the caretaker committee was that it will be proper to have zonal leaders of the party determined at their various geo-political zones for proper inclusiveness of party members.\n\n\u201cHence, they (CECPC) will be proposing to Mr President the need for zonal congress before the national convention.\u201d\n\nAPC governors\u2019 meeting became imperative, following alleged foot-dragging by the caretaker committee.\n\nThe meeting may decide whether or not to go ahead with the convention scheduled for February 26.\n\nBut most APC governors were angry that the Buni-led Caretaker Committee has kept them in the dark over the convention.\n\nIt was learnt that some governors have sent an emissary to President Buhari to feel his pulse on whether or not to postpone the convention.\n\nSpeculations about a likely revolt against Buni have made some governors to threaten a boycott of today\u2019s session in Abuja.\n\nThe consensus among governors was still on the ceding of the office of the national chairman to the Northcentral.\n\nThe fresh proposal to anoint a former Speaker of the House of Representatives Yakubu Dogara as chairman received \u201clittle backing\u201d last night.\n\nAccording to a source, who spoke in confidence, most APC governors were unhappy with the Caretaker Committee for its ding-dong attitude to the convention.\n\nThe source said the governors could not fathom why the caretaker committee was yet to raise sub-committees for the exercise.\n\nThe source claimed that the split of the PGF into pro and anti-convention groups has deepened the cracks in the association.\n\nThe source said: \u201cAll is not well among APC governors over the convention because the Caretaker Committee is unwilling to stick to the agreed February 26 timeline. The committee wants to have its cake and eat it.\n\n\u201cApart from funding, the Caretaker Committee has come up with an excuse that some off-season elections will hold on the convention date. It is contemplating a shift to March 12.\n\n\u201cMost governors are, however, insisting on February 26 having got wind of a plot to drag the convention till July or August when presidential and other primaries will be conducted. The CECPC members wanted a two-in-one convention.\n\n\u201cThere are fears that the shift in convention date was being designed to either favour some members of the CECPC or their cronies for elective offices, including presidential and governorship seats in 2023.\n\n\u201cAll these factors have made today\u2019s meeting compelling.\u201d\n\nA governor, who spoke in confidence, said: \u201cIt is going to be a make or mar meeting to break the jinx on this convention. We will decide either on going ahead with the convention or a slight postponement which may be the last of such.\n\n\u201cWe heard rumours of a new convention date of March 12 but the CECPC has not made recommendations to the PGF. Governors are being turned into ball boys.\n\n\u201cWe now have pro and anti-convention governors simply because we can\u2019t keep to an agreement on the date we chose because of 2023 ambitions.\n\n\u201cLeft to some of us, we have had enough of CECPC unless the President decides otherwise. This is why there is tension among us.\u201d\n\nIt was gathered that some governors were threatening to boycott today\u2019s meeting which they suspected might \u201cput Buni on the spot.\u201d\n\nAnother source, who spoke on the intrigues, said: \u201cThose planning to boycott the meeting have become desperate and trying to ensure that the PGF does not have the quorum at today\u2019s meeting.\n\n\u201cThey are afraid that governors may join issues with Buni and CECPC at the meeting.\n\n\u201cSome governors sent an emissary to the President last night on the need to intervene and give a definite direction.\n\n\u201cThe way we are going, APC is closer to the crisis which made it to lose elections in Zamfara State in 2019.\n\n\u201cThere are some forces pulling the strings to create a permanent crisis in APC.\u201d\n\nMany governors have insisted on an APC chairmanship slot for the Northcentral instead of the retention of the office by the Northeast.\n\nIt was learnt that the same anti-convention forces came up with the choice of ex-Speaker Yakubu Dogara to \u201cprop up a new issue which could cause fresh confusion in the party.\u201d\n\nAnother governor said: \u201cDogara is a good leader but his candidature is not flying because those behind it are mischievous.\n\n\u201cWe had got to a point where some governors who didn\u2019t know how APC was formed are trying to foist crisis on the party. They can\u2019t eat their cake and have it.\u201d",

          "text": "From Desmond Mgboh, Kano\n\nAmbassador Aminu Wali is Nigeria\u2019s former minister of Foreign Affairs and a founding father of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nIn this chat with Sunday Sun in his home in Kano, he speaks about the challenges and fortunes of his party, the PDP.\n\nNigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\nSpecifically, he talked about the party\u2019s Northwest congress, which has been shifted twice as a result of disruption in the first instance and recently, as a result of an injunction against a rather popular candidate in the race, Bello Hayaitu Gwarzo.\n\nHe also lamented over the negative impacts of the Kwankwasiyya Movement \u2013 a Movement led by Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso \u2013 on the party, the overarching pressure brought by strong governors on the PDP, the moves to lure Jonathan to APC as well as the dilemma of the PDP regarding which zone, North or South, should produce its 2023 presidential candidate. Excerpts:\n\nLet\u2019s start the interview with the efforts of your party to hold a congress in the Northwest zone. What is your impression of what has happened so far, with two postponement of the congress already?\n\nIt is unfortunate about what has happened, that has led to the postponement of the scheduled congress. I think luckily, what we have in place today in terms of the national leadership of our party is a leadership that looks at things fairly, that is fair to everybody. It is unfortunate that some people went and got an injunction against one of the candidates, for which they know that they cannot expel or they cannot suspend him. Legally, they don\u2019t have the authority under the Constitution of the party to suspend or expel a member of the BOT. The constitution is very clear. Even the National Executive Committee of the party cannot suspend or expel a member of the BOT of the party.\n\nAre you referring to Bello Hayaitu Gwarzo, the candidate that was barred by their injunction?\n\nYes, Bello Hayaitu Gwarzo. As you know, Gwarzo is a member of the BOT and the Constitution of the PDP is very clear and by the end of the day, it is only the convention that can expel or suspend him or the BOT itself that can suspend him. And if it is expulsion, it is the convention that can expel him. So, this is a Kangaroo thing that was done. But then, when a court gave an injunction to stop Gwarzo from contesting, the party felt that the premise upon which the injunction was secured may not have taken into consideration the Constitution of the party and the party said well, to be fair to everybody, the congress is postponed, so that the legal issues would be sorted out and thereafter, we can go back to have a zonal congress. That is what happened.\n\nWhat I worry here is time. Does your party have all the time?\n\nWell, yes! Don\u2019t forget that there is already a caretaker executive in place at the zone, which has been handling all the issues. But of course, that is not satisfactory. We certainly want an elected body to do it, but since the current leadership is very much aware of the legal implications, it decided to say okay we cannot just go and support what we know is not legal \u2013 that is to support one of the candidates. But since the court has made a pronouncement, we have to obey the court. But for that purpose, they said okay, let\u2019s just suspend the zonal congress so that everybody would be given a fair and level playing ground.\n\nStill on the aborted Northwest zonal congress of your party, there are two candidates from Kano State vying for the deputy chairman. Why is it that almost all of you, the major stakeholders of the party in the zone are opposed the Kwankwassiya candidate?\n\nDon\u2019t forget that I am one of the founding fathers of this party. I was the first deputy national chairman of the PDP. Solomon Lar was chairman and I was his deputy. For me, it is the party that I know. Any other identification within the party, to me, is unacceptable. Our loyalties should be to the party. So, you can see, even without me giving any explanation, you can see why we are running at parallel lines with that movement you just mentioned. I don\u2019t belong to any movement. I belong to the PDP. And any other body that identifies with me, it is not me as a person, It is the party that he identifies. So, somehow, somehow, there is a movement that sprang up around a particular personality, but they still claim to be a part of the PDP.\n\nSir, from your rich experiences in party politics, what is your take on movements loyal to a particular individual emerging within parties? I mean a movement like Kwankwasiyya Movement, whose loyalty is first to a particular personality?\n\nWell, you see once we have the right leadership leading any political party, this kind of thing would not happen or would not be allowed to happen. This is because there would be limit, a red line which every member of the party cannot cross. But unfortunately, we have not been that cohesive at the national level of the party for some time now. But thank God, for the first time since the departure of Solomon Lar, this current leadership of the PDP, the national leader of the party, happens to be one of the founding fathers of the party. And so, he knows the principles and the basic philosophy of the party and also what really brought people together to form the PDP. At least, he has a perception of what the PDP should be. And I don\u2019t think he would tolerate this movement stuff, I don\u2019t think he would tolerate anything meddling into the administration of the party- like having a different movement whose loyalty is not to the party leadership. For us, the national party leader is our sole leader. No more, no less! Nobody who is not elected within the hierarchy of the party can be a leader to me. Whatever movement it is, regardless, should not arrogate itself the authority that can compete or disregard the party national leadership- because this is what is happening.\n\nYou don\u2019t like talking about the Kwankwasiyya Movement, but it is real. How would you access their impact on the PDP in Kano State and beyond? Have they added value to the party or have been a cross for the party to bear?\n\nI think that, initially, when they started, some people took them in good faith. They saw them as members of the party. And felt innocently that it was not really built around a particular individual. They saw it like another brand to bring people into the PDP and they were somehow okay with it, but unfortunately as it turned out, it turned out like a cult within the PDP. And that has not augured well for the PDP in the state and beyond. Initially when it was looked at as nothing harmless, yes, it added value. Kids, one way or the other, wanted to be identified with the PDP if they wear one thing or the other. But as it is, it seems that it is now built around a particular individual as opposed to around the party. If it is around the party, by now everybody who is a member of the PDP would be wearing or would be identified with the colours. But no! It got to a point where it is operating like worshipping the leader of the movement. Number two, it contradicts every democratic norm, all the democratic norms of running, not even a party, but any society of people. If there is democracy, then everybody will and should have a voice. At whatever level, there cannot be only one person that can determine everything. So, that is the difference. So, for Kano today, if things go the way it is going, I will be very, very sorry for our young people that are now coming up. The political culture that is being nurtured in the party would not augur well in the future because number one, discipline is broken down. I have been a victim. I am sure you know what happened to me. In a society, no matter what, respect for elders is always inculcated in the youth. And they have always respected that. That is how our society was and any society in Nigeria is built around that culture. But eventually that culture of respect in Kano is being eroded arising from the emergence of this sort of movements.\n\nThere is a new PDP national leadership today. Do you see this team of leadership as the type that can fight APC and their incumbency to a standstill by 2023?\n\nAbsolutely, absolutely. Like I said earlier, the spirit of the founding fathers of the PDP is now brought to the fore. The founding fathers of the party fought the military and succeeded, let alone fighting a rival democratic institution like the APC and its incumbency. We were there before and we know how the game is played. The current leadership was part and parcel of the first PDP government. Iyorchia Ayu was a minister in that government. So, he knows the values and the programmes and the achievements of the PDP within that 16 years of governance and today, he is at the helm of affairs of the party. And I believe that very soon, we would start seeing a lot of people, a lot of Nigerians trooping back to the PDP because a lot of people have a lot of confidence in Ayu\u2019s emergence. Like I said, I have absolute confidence in Ayu- because we worked with him in the national secretariat, he was a member of the 34, he was first Chairman\u2019s Political Adviser when I was Deputy Chairman to Solomon Lar. He was his Principle Political Adviser. And most of the political thinking of that era owe itself to Ayu\u2019s input. So he is very much conversant, in fact, he is the most qualified person within the PDP to really drive the new vision of the party. The previous leadership of the PDP led by Secondus.\n\nThey are still around, they are still agitating and they still feel that they should not have been removed they way they were removed. Don\u2019t you see them as a threat to all these goals and new vision?\n\nWhether we like it or not, I was party to the emergence of that administration. Secondus was at my house where he was interviewed by all the stakeholders of my zone (Northwest zone) before we agreed to go along with him. At that time, we all believed that things would work out well. But I think that somehow, along the way, there was a derailment. PDP is people\u2019s democratic party. It is not owned by any individual or organization. It is our own, all of us, all Nigerians, and whoever wants to identify with the PDP, owns a piece of the party. And there is a constitution which was carefully crafted by people who are well qualified and with amendments here and there as we go on. For the PDP to succeed, we have to adhere strictly to the constitution of the party. But unfortunately, the last administration vied away from the basic principles of the constitution of the party. In fact, if they had adhered strictly to the constitution of the party, then, movements like Kwankwasiyya could not been tolerated. The constitution does not provide for any movement within the party. But somehow, it was tolerated and encouraged. When Kwankwassiyya movement came out from the APC to the PDP in Kano State, they came in as Kwankwassiyya Movement. That would not have happened under the current leadership. If you come in, you come in as a member of the PDP and your movement is something that is totally outside the party structure. So, my vision of the current leadership or my confidence in the current leadership is to the effect that I know that the driver is a good driver and would take us safely to our destination. My only appeal is to those aspirants for political offices, particularly aspirants to the number one position to please tread carefully, for the party to come up with the right kind of person that is generally accepted, both within the party and across the country.\n\nThere is the assumption that the PDP is now under the control of some strong governors, strong governors like Wike and his friend in Sokoto, Tambuwal, and that these governors dictate the tune and not the elected leadership. May we have your view on this?\n\nThis is a very sad situation. But it evolved over the years. It would be unfair to blame the last administration alone. PDP started stumbling within the first administration. If I could remember, a lot of the provisions within the constitution and the way that the PDP was being run were taken from the former parties, particularly the NPN of which I was part of. The party, from what I know of the NPN, the party is supreme. Whether you are the governor or the president, you have to go with what the party dictates, when I say the party, I mean everybody, not a certain group of individuals sitting down to decide. But unfortunately, over the years \u2013 maybe it is as a result of lack of resources or the party was unable to create ways of raising its own resources and it was depending on the largesse that was coming from the governors and even from the presidency as it was when we were in power. Eventually, through the process, the party began to lose its grips. Because when we came into office in 1999, as a member of the national caucus, we used to meet every week when we first started, every week with the president and his ministers and his nominees, BOT, every week and get reports of what the government was doing. It eventually went to bi-weekly and then somehow along the line, it just fizzled out. That is where I think the party lost track. It didn\u2019t lose track now as in today or yesterday. This problem took time to evolve to what it is today.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nWhat is the solution?\n\nThe solution is strong leadership.\n\nAnd what is your appeal?\n\nLet us now learn to be fair to one another, whether you are the governor or the chairman of the PDP or whatever. Let us be fair to the party and the only way to be fair to each other is to allow the party and constitution to be referee to all the players. They must give the party the chance to be the referee. Just like in a football game, the referee is the sole authority in the game. And the party should be given the authority to make sure that there is fairness in whatever that is being done. And at the same time, the party should think of how to independently generate funds \u2013 I think Ayu has started. I saw him going to visit the national secretariat that we started building some years ago. When that structure in the center of Abuja is completed, I think the party would depend less on any individual for funds.\n\nOnly recently, the PDP national chairman paid a visit to Obasanjo to canvas his blessings and invite him to the party, but I think the signal in the media was that Obasanjo turned down the offer to return to the PDP. How do you see this?\n\nNo! He did not turn down the offer, it was not a question of turning down. Obasanjo has already made his position clear a long time ago, that he is no longer, I mean, he is now a statesman, not only in Nigeria but in Africa, in fact, in the world. And I worked very closely with Obasanjo when I was in the United Nations and I know the kind of respect that the man commanded at the international level. So, I think that he had realized that at his age, he should not be drawn into party politics and all these things. But deep down, he still cannot acquit himself of his preference. If we sit down , me and him sit down, talking, I still can see the flicker of his preference to PDP than any other party in Nigeria! But for him to now come out and say that I am going to be partisan, some of the assignments and some of the activities that he is undertaking at the moment cannot continue. He has had recognition in Africa, recognition internationally. So, I think he is trying to protect what he has going for him now. His position as a statesman may not be accommodated by the narrowness of a particular political party, but deep inside him, his thinking is definitely PDP.\n\nThe PDP appears to be in a dilemma in terms of whose region should produce its presidential candidate, North or South, for the 2023 elections. What is your position?\n\nWell, you see for me, my antecedents are very clear. When we went to the party\u2019s convention in Jos, I was an Ekwueme\u2019s man. I supported him to the end and up to the time the man died, I still maintained that relationship with him. For me, my solution for the Nigeria\u2019s problem at that time was to get an Igbo man to become the president after the civil war, to get an Igbo man to take over the country. My belief was and is still is that if Ekwueme had become the president of Nigeria, all these Biafra stuff would have been long forgotten. All these things would have been put to rest, if only we had allowed an Igbo presidency at that time. If we had Ekwueme then as president, nobody would come and agitate for Biafra today. Yes, maybe the Yourba was shortchanged when Abiola was not sworn in, but that is one thing you and me cannot be accused of. But today what we need, from my point of view, what I believe is that we need a change of government in Nigeria, we need the PDP back to power to take us back to eight years ago, where the APC took over because things have really gone bad, things have become so bad in this country in every aspect.\n\nWe are talking about that we need\u2026?\n\nYes, we need to win 2023 general elections and for me, I don\u2019t care where the person comes from so long as the person is capable and can win elections for our party. It should be somebody that can break the barriers of all the zones in this country to be able to emerge as a presidential candidate. There is demand for Igbo president, Yoruba president or a Northern president or whatever president. Yes it is a legitimate right for everybody to voice out his preference, but I hope that within the PDP, we are going to come back to our senses and really look at the aspirants, sit down to look at them and in the same spirit that we were able to produce the chairman of the party, that same spirit should guide us to produce a winner candidate for the presidency of this country, regardless of where the person comes from.\n\nIf I get you right now, the emphasis is how to get a winner kind of candidate?\n\nExactly, because we we have to do something to get rid of where we are today and then we can now return back to our zoning. I want a winnable candidate from whichever part of the country. Let us accept the candidate so that we can go ahead and win the elections and once we win the elections, then we can now sit down within the PDP and within the larger society also to see how do we now satisfy the aspiration of every Nigerian from every part of the country, maybe come up with a new formula like the initial thinking .Yes the initial thinking was to move rotation to all the six zones and after that , there should be no more rotation. But unfortunately, Obasanjo finished and Yar\u2019dua died. That was what brought about the complications. The people are crying that the North has ruled. Yes, it has ruled. But they had APC and we have PDP. We have ruled for 16 years as PDP, but those 16 years were not from the North. I am trying to justify anything , no ! For now, forget about where the candidate would come from , let us get a winnable candidate.\n\nThere is a suggestion that to ease this form of challenge, let\u2019s cut down the tenure to one \u2013tenure stuff, so that the presidency can go easily round to the zones. What is your view on this?\n\nThis is something that can be visited and be accepted. Because you see this two term business, once somebody gets to the Villa, he does not want to hear anything that would curtail his tenure. We would now have to have a national consensus across all parties that it should be one term presidency. I am totally in agreement with that. Maybe we make one term \u2013 five-year presidency, so that another zone will come and take charge so that this question of \u201cwe have been left out\u201d would be over. After that, it is going to be purely on merit. We really have to learn to be Nigerians and to be our brother\u2019s keepers regardless of from whichever part anybody comes from. Like I was saying, I never regretted supporting Ekwueme. I remember Obasanjo came to this house to seek my support and I told him Sir, I have known you before EKwueme, but Ekwueme has been my political soul mate.\n\nThere is still this speculation that somehow former President Goodluck Jonathan is still being lured back to the political field and APC may field him as their presidential candidate.\n\nJonathan is my boss and I served as his minister and I respect him and Jonathan is his own man, his own person. No matter how close we are with him, at the end of the day, that decision is his, not mine , not that of anybody. But as far as I know, he is still a member of the PDP. Yes, he has not been happy, apparently, from the way things were going and that is why he has not been too much involved in the affairs of the PDP. And maybe secondly, he\u2019s got an alternative by being engaged in a lot of these African affairs, moving all over Africa, trying to sort out democratic issues\u2026You want my opinion on what?\n\nShould he move on with the offer or should he not?\n\nI doubt it very much, knowing the man and what he is. I doubt if he would take that offer. I doubt it because I think he is already enjoying tremendous amount of respect, nationally and internationally, that going back, trying to go and start fighting against his own party that brought him up, that I think would be a tall order. I don\u2019t think so, and in particular, for him to go and contest in the APC. For me, I will never forget the vitriolic attacks that we got from the APC, particular on him as a person. They even termed him the sponsor of Boko Haram. Some of us were vilified in our won states. They said that we have recanted our religion because we were supporting Jonathan. My house nearly got burnt at a time. So, he knows all these things that happened and it was not anybody\u2019s doing at that time, but the APC\u2019s doing. So, I don\u2019t think that he would succumb to any pressure from the APC. That is number one. This is all rumour! It is rumour!! But how about the stalwarts of the All Progressives Congress that are gunning for that same position? Are they going to sit down and say okay we accept somebody from outside to come and take it? Does it make sense to you that those gunning for the presidency in APC would come and say okay we are settled for an outsider to come and take over?\n\nIt is not your party, but what is your take about the current struggle between Vice President Osinbajo and Bola Tinubu for their party\u2019s presidential ticket?\n\nThe truth is that I know less or little about these people, to be honest with you. To some extent, yes I know Bola Tinubu, but Osinbajo, I have never met him since he became the vice president. Even since he became the vice president, I have never met him officially, not even once. So, I am not too much attached to the politics of the Southwest and most of the people that I am attached to in the region are not from the APC and even though some of them had moved to the APC from the PDP, when they move, they cut off automatically.\n\nSeven years down the line, how would access President Buhari\u2019s leadership bearing in mind the three major promises that he made to Nigerians when he was canvassing votes?\n\nThis administration took over from us and I know how far we went\u2026 all those projects that they are now claiming that they have done. Yes, we initiated them. Even the institution fighting corruption, it is our making. On security, what will I say? Let you or any other Nigerian compare between then and now. I don\u2019t have to comment. This is something which is known to all Nigerians. Today, no part of Nigeria is spared. At least in our days, maybe we can say that it was limited to the Northeast But today, no part of Nigeria as far as security is related is secured. People dare not travel by road today to any part of Nigeria. Talking about security, I don\u2019t want to comment. In those days, we all travel by road. But today the roads have all gone bad and secondly you dare not because the roads are not safe. So, what security are you talking about?",

Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\nBy Adewale Sanyaolu\n\nThe recent importation of adulterated Premium Motor Spirit(PMS) popularly called petrol said to be high in methanol content has continued to spark outrage across the country over its attendant socio-economic effect on the citizenry.\n\nThe development has led to acute shortage of petrol with the majority of depots and filling stations running out of stock.\n\nMotorists now have to keep vigil at filling stations as the price of a litre of petrol has skyrocked to N200 and N400 respectively in Lagos and Abuja.\n\nCommeneting on the development, the Independent Petroleum Marketers\n\nAssociation of Nigeria (IPMAN)\n\ndisclosed that no inland depot has received clean petrol that would boost supply to filling stations.\n\nIPMAN Public Relations Officer, Chinedu Ukadike, said the Federal Government was yet to improve supply, warning that it would take another two\n\nweeks for supply to normalize.\n\nIn Abuja, there was no sign of let-up in the shortage of petrol as fewer stations were opened to motorists with black marketers selling at N400 per litre.\n\nUkadike said that the challenges facing the downstream sector were\n\nenormously, urging the government to begin the process of compensating marketers who have lost a lot of money during the period.\n\nHe explained: \u201cNothing much has changed in the last few days, the issue is that up till now we have not seen the intervention of the NNPC based on evacuating these products (bad fuel) from some of our stations. Some marketers are trying to see if they can get new products and blend it to see if they can move.\n\n\u201cMarketers\u2019 capitals have been tied down and the bad product is also occupying their storage tank and that is why you are seeing some skeletal services. Some also have their tanks quarantined, so it is not easy.\n\n\u201cWe have been expecting products in the inland depots like the Port Harcourt Refinery depot but up till now, no product has been received. These things happen. Once there is a break in the supply chain it will take some time to fix. Forget what people are saying, it will take one-two to three weeks to fill in the gaps. It is talking about evacuating and replacing, it is not just about the shortage, it is also about evacuating and replacing.\u201d\n\nHe noted that while Port Harcourt where he is based has not witnessed the acute shortage being experienced in many parts of the country, he said most of the marketers who have placed orders have not received the supply.\n\nWhile urging consumers to be patient, he observed that many motorists have engaged in racketeering where they \u201cfill up their tanks, go to sell to black marketers and return to the queues. I want to advise our people to stop patronizing black marketers, this will help also in solving the problem\u201d, he added.\n\nHowever, the claim of IPMAN contradicted the position of NNPC which said that it has over one billion litres of certified petrol stock that is safe for use in vehicles and machinery.\n\nThe NNPC in a statement released on Tuesday equally said that it has commenced 24-hour operations in NNPC depots and retails outlets to restore normal supply and distribution of petrol across the country.\n\nBut, a Twitter user, Anthony Unegbu, while responding to the NNPC statement said that the reality on ground does not support the content of the press statement.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u2018\u2018Why did NNPC depot at Aba not sell even one litre of petrol yesterday (February 15, 2022)? People have payments made since over two months and the tickets have not been released. Prove me wrong by showing pictures,\u2019\u2019 he queried.\n\nThere have equally been widespread reported cases of damage to vehicle engines occasioned by the adulterated fuel.\n\nAn online video which surfaced recently shows a petrol attendant complaining about how the adulterated petrol dispensed at the station damaged cars and motorcycle engines.\n\nWhile pointing at some of the grounded vehicles, he said many motorists have reported the matter to the police.\n\nSome of the motorists who spoke to Sunday Sun in separate interviews said, if not urgently addressed, the situation was capable of further pushing more Nigerians below the poverty net.\n\n\u2018\u2018Should my vehicle be damaged as a result of this contaminated fuel, who will bail me out? How do I feed my family and other family members that depend on me for survival,\u201d Mufu Akande, a transporter who plies CMS to Ajah queried.\n\nIn a telephone interview with Sunday Sun, Executive Vice Chairman/Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC), Mr. Babatunde Irukera, while sympatising with those whose vehicles may have been damaged due to the adulterated petrol said that the FCCPC was already in talks with NMDPRA, NNPC, Standards Organisation of Nigeria(SON) on the way forward.\n\nHe said that FCCPC will collate data on those affected and develop a methodology on how best to resolve the issue.\n\nHe admitted that the issue remained a complicated one, but that the FCCPC will not rest on its oars in order to ensure that consumers are not left in the cold.\n\nThe adulterated petrol according to the regulator-Nigerian Midstream Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority(NMDPRA) has proved to be high in methanol concentration.\n\nUpon the discovery of the adulterated fuel, NMDPRA in conjunction with the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited commenced moves to recall the bad product in order to save Nigerians, especially motorists untold hardship.\n\nBut prior to its recall, the adulterated fuel had already found its way into the Nigerian petroleum retail products market.\n\nThe outcome of the penetration of the bad product into the Nigerian market was a monumental damage to motor vehicle engines, generators and other mechanical devices that use petrol as its source of energy.\n\nAddressing the media on the adulterated imported petrol, Chief Executive Officer(CEO) of NNPC Limited, Mr Mele Kyari, made a shocking revelation when he admitted that a subsidiary of NNPC, Duke Oil Limited and three other private Nigerian company operating in the downstream sector imported four PMS cargoes which contained methanol.\n\nHe listed the three other companies to include; MRS, Emadeb/Hyde/AY Maikifi/Brittania-U Consortium and Oando.\n\nHe said that NNPC investigation revealed the presence of Methanol in four PMS cargoes imported by MRS, Emadeb/Hyde/AY Maikifi/Brittania-U Consortium, Oando, and Duke Oil.\n\nKyari added that the adulterated fuel was imported into the country from Antwerp in Belgium with quality inspectors failing to detect the high level of Methanol contained in it, first at the point of import in Belgium and later at the point of arrival in Nigeria.\n\nThe NNPC boss who did not give the date of import, however, disclosed that the NNPC found out about the situation late in January following a report received from their quality inspector on the presence of emulsion particles in PMS cargoes shipped to Nigeria from Antwerp-Belgium.\n\nMRS used the vessel, MT Bow Pioneer; Emadeb/Hyde/AY Maikifi/Brittania-U Consortium imported the product via the vessel MT Tom Hilde; Oando used the vessel MT Elka Apollon, while Duke Oil imported its PMS using MT Nord Gainer.\n\nKyari explained that the PMS contained methanol was not detected by checks because the quality checks do not include checks for Methanol percentage, adding that cargoes quality certificates issued at load port (Antwerp-Belgium) by AmSpec Belgium indicated that the gasoline complied with Nigerian specification.\n\nHe also said that the NNPC quality inspectors, including GMO, SGS, GeoChem and G&G as well as inspection agents appointed by the Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority certified that the cargoes met Nigerian specification.",

          "text": "\u2022Minister cries foul, Adeoti heads to court\n\n\u2022Buhari, APC govs to decide new date for national convention\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja and Yinka Kolawole in Osogbo\n\nGovernor Gboyega Oyetola of Osun State yesterday won the governorship primary of the All Progressives Congress (APC) held in the state.\n\nOyetola was backed by the National Leader of the APC, Senator Bola Tinubu.\n\nThis is coming as President Muhammadu Buhari and the governors elected on the platform of the APC will decide a new date for the party\u2019s National Convention following the clash of the February 26 proposed date for the exercise with some off-season elections earlier scheduled by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nOyetola also defeated his main challenger for the APC governorship ticket, Alhaji Moshood Adeoti, at Ifofin Ward 8 of the Minister of Interior, Mr. Rauf Aregbesola, in Ilesa East Local Government Area of the state.\n\nThe Osun State governor won in Aregbesola\u2019s ward with 309 votes against 146 recorded for Adeoti, the aspirant anointed by Aregbesola.\n\nThe two aspirants, who contested with Oyetola were former Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Lasun Yusuff and a former Secretary to the State Government, Adeoti.\n\nAnnouncing the result in the early hours of today, at the state\u2019s APC secretariat in Osogbo, the Chairman of Osun APC Primary Election Committee and Kwara State Governor, Mr. AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, said accredited voters were 247,207 while the total number of votes cast was 235,550.\n\nOyetola polled 222,169 votes to beat Aregbesola\u2019s candidate, Adeoti, who scored 12,921, while Lasun came a distant third with 460 votes.\n\nBefore the primary election, Aregbesola had attacked Oyetola\u2019s main backer and his estranged godfather, Tinubu, telling him that the same treatment meted out to a former Lagos State governor, Mr. Akinwunmi Ambode, which foreclosed his re-election bid in 2019, would be administered on his brother, Oyetola.\n\nHowever, Aregbesola was absent from the primary election and was said to have left Ilesa for Abuja yesterday morning for unspecified official duty.\n\nWhile the minister has threatened to explore legal means to obtain justice, alleging that the results of the primary election were \u201cfarcically counted in favour of the governor,\u201d Adeoti has vowed to seek Oyetola\u2019s disqualification in court.\n\nReacting to the election in a statement issued in Osogbo, the state capital yesterday, Adeoti vowed to head to court to challenge what he referred to as \u201cpyrrhic victory\u201d won by Oyetola.\n\nHe accused the governor of rigging the election with the apparent backing of the National Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the party.\n\nAdeoti said the ugly development in Osun APC has sent a wrong signal as to whether the APC has a future in the state.\n\nHe also accused Oyetola of using intimidation and violence to ensure that the primary election was not free and fair.\n\n\u201dThere was violence in Olorunda Local Government where the Ward 3 Chairman of the Rasaq Salinsile-led APC in Olorunda Local government, Mr. Sala Ademola and his secretary, Mr. Ajisefini were kidnapped. Our supporters were also disenfranchised in all the wards in Ife East by not being accredited and being intimidated with thugs wielding dangerous weapons.\u201d\n\nHe also accused a top chieftain of APC of taking over the electioneering process in Ife and halting the accreditation process, sending out his supporter using thugs, while allowing and counting party members from the governor\u2019s group.\n\nThe APC governorship aspirant also alleged that the Osun State government procured the services of armed policemen who aided the well-choreographed rigging of the election.\n\n\u201dThere was also a massive influx of unregistered members of the party who voted with the connivance of the heavily-compromised National Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, of which Oyetola is a member. Overall, there was a massive disenfranchisement of registered APC members in all my strongholds during the so-called primary election.\u201d\n\nHe insisted that there was no way any primary election conducted in the state would be fair if Oyetola remains a member of the CECPC.\n\n\u201cGovernor Oyetola\u2019s membership of the NCECPC is against the democratic norms. We dare say that this is capable of causing disquiet, more than we are facing in Osun APC now, if allowed to pass us by.\n\n\u201cWe are reliably informed that Governor Oyetola is the one who hand-picked the Chairman and members of the primary election committee. It is within human reasonability not to trust such handpicked committee by an interested party member. Such committee would never be fair to other contenders.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, express absolute opposition to the outcome of the election because they were chosen by Governor Oyetola. There can only be point of convergence for us if Governor Oyetola could resign his membership and the process of conducting the primary begins afresh,\u201d Adeoti explained.\n\nAdeoti argued that Oyetola\u2019s participation in the election was a violation of the provision of Article 31(iii) of the APC Constitution (2014) as amended which says: \u201cAny party office holder interested in contesting for an elective office (whether party office or office in a general election) shall resign and leave office 30 days prior to the date of nomination or party primary for office he or she is seeking to contest\u201d.\n\nHe said the process had been orchestrated from the beginning to manipulate the outcome in favour of Oyetola, which was why the date of the primary was changed from March 5 to February 19.\n\n\u201cWe have it on good authority that the NCECPC was influenced by Oyetola to reverse the date to have the primary before the National Convention scheduled to hold on February 26, 2022. It is believed that Oyetola is afraid of contesting a free and fair primary election to be conducted by an objective committee after a neutral leadership of the party would have emerged,\u201d Adeoti alleged.\n\nHe however appealed to his supporters to be calm, vowing to seek a legal redress.\n\nAlso reacting in a statement by his media\u2019s aide, Mr. Sola Fasure, the interior minister and Adeoti\u2019s main backer alleged that the results of the governorship primary were \u201cfarcically counted in favour of the governor.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have received and continue to receive the reports of the shenanigans of the officials who conducted the sham of an election.\n\n\u201cWe have been inundated with reports state-wide of how your names were expunged from the party\u2019s voters\u2019 register, which was not made available until this morning, contrary to the convention of making the list available to the candidates before the election.\n\n\u201cWe have heard of how party registration cards were being hawked this morning to the supporters of the state governor.\n\n\u201cYou are urged not to take laws into your hands. Please leave the rest to the Almighty God and let us explore all peaceful and legal means for addressing the matter in order to obtain justice,\u201d Aregbesola explained.\n\nThe Publicity Secretary of the Aregbesola-backed faction of the party in the state, Mr. Abiodun Agboola, in a statement issued, said: \u201cWe strongly condemned the conduct of the primary election because it is nothing but a sham with a fraudulent process to favour Governor Adegboyega Oyetola\u201d.\n\nHe alleged that there were no records and result sheets in any of the 332 wards of the state.\n\nThe Chairman of the anti-Oyetola faction of the party in the state, Mr. Rasaq Salinsile, who is from Ward 04, Isale-Oba in Iwo Local Government Area also told THISDAY that the election was fraudulent.\n\nOyetola had expressed confidence that he would emerge victorious in the primary election.\n\nThe governor, who applauded the members of the party for turning out in large number said, \u201closing was not an option for a man commissioned by God for an assignment.\u201d\n\nOyetola spoke shortly after he cast his vote at Ward 1, Boripe Local Government Area, Iragbiji.\n\nHe lauded Osun people for conducting themselves peacefully, saying the peaceful conduct of the election has testified to the fact that Osun remains the most peaceful state in the country.\n\nThe governor noted that news of violence making the rounds were mere speculations.\n\n\u201cI just want to appeal to all our people across the state to maintain peace. Election process should not be a battlefield or a do-or-die affair. Let everyone exercise his/her right to choose in determining who represents them at the party level and ultimately at the general election,\u201d Oyetola added.\n\nAlso commenting on the election, the Chairman of Osun APC Governorship Primary and Kwara State Governor, AbdulRazak, also hailed the peaceful conduct of the exercise.\n\nHe applauded APC members for the huge turnout and their peaceful conduct.\n\nHe spoke with journalists after monitoring the election in Iragbiji, the hometown of Governor Oyetola.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf you open the pages of newspapers today, what was painted was a picture of the war in Osun. But the primaries election has been peaceful. I congratulate the people of Osun and all the aspirants. They have all done well.\u201d\n\nBuhari, APC Govs to Decide New Date for National Convention\n\nMeanwhile, President Buhari and the governors elected on the platform of the APC will decide a new date for the party\u2019s National Convention.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that this development followed the clash of the February 26 proposed date for the exercise with some off-season elections earlier scheduled by the INEC.\n\nA source close to the APC National Caretaker Committee told THISDAY at the weekend that the clash of the proposed convention with the national elections was brought to the attention of the party after it had written to notify INEC of its intention to hold the national convention.\n\n\u201cElections are national issues that cut across political parties and therefore, it is not expected that party affairs should overshadow national elections. The stakeholders will meet and come up with a new date not beyond two to three weeks,\u201d the source explained\n\nOn whether INEC has been notified, the source said that the electoral body would be notified after the proposed meeting between Buhari, the APC governors and the members of the caretaker committee.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "* Electoral Bill 2022 still inchoate, commission clarifies\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has stated that the 2023 general election is not encumbered and will hold as planned, beginning with the presidential poll scheduled for February 18, 2023.\n\nResponding to speculations that it might postpone the scheduled conduct of the 2023 general election if President Muhammadu Buhari signs the Electoral Bill after February 22, 2022, INEC\u2019s National Commissioner in charge of Publicity and Chairman of Voter Education, Mr Festus Okoye told THISDAY that the commission was not in any form of dilemma relating to the exercise of its constitutional and legal powers.\n\nOkoye stated that the commission was focused and working proactively to deliver on its mandate.\n\nAccording to Section 28 (1) of the Electoral Bill 2022, INEC is required to issue a notice of election not later than 360 days before the day appointed for an election.\n\nThe Executive Director of Yiaga Africa, Mr Samson Itodo, had reportedly stated that in line with the Electoral Bill 2022, the deadline for the commission to issue the notice of election for the 2023 general election will be February 22, 2022, \u201cthe reasons being that the total number of days from February 22, 2022, to February 17, 2023, is 360 days.\u201d\n\nBut Okoye told THISDAY that the speculations and anxiety relating to the shifting of the date of the 2023 elections were based on the Electoral Bill 2022 which, according to him, is still inchoate.\n\nAccording to him, the existing and extant electoral legal framework for the conduct of elections remains the Constitution and the Electoral Act.\n\nHe insisted that the electoral body was in synch with the constitutional provisions relating to the period for the holding of elections, adding that the provisions are sacrosanct and cast in stone.\n\n\u201cThe commission is only permitted to orbit around the constitutional timelines in fixing the date for the holding of elections.\n\n\u201cThe commission is a regulatory body guided by the provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as altered), the Electoral Act, 2010 (as amended) and its Rules, Regulations and Guidelines.\n\n\u201cAs of today, the existing and extant electoral legal framework for the conduct of elections remains the Constitution and the Electoral Act and the commission will continue to rely on its provisions for electoral continuity, pending any amendment to the said law.\n\n\u201cBy the commission\u2019s Regulations and Guidelines made pursuant to the powers conferred on it by the Constitution and the Electoral Act, the 2023 general election will hold on the 18th of February 2023,\u201d Okoye explained.\n\nHe argued that the scheduled date is in consonance and in conformity with sections 132(1) and 178(1) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria that gives the commission the exclusive right and power to appoint the date for the holding of Executive and Legislative Elections subject to the timelines and schedule circumscribed in Sections 132(2) and 178(2) of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cBy the said sections, election to executive positions shall hold not earlier than December 30, 2022, and not later than April 29, 2023, while legislative elections shall hold not earlier than 10th January 2023 and not later than May 10, 2023.\n\n\u201cBy Section 30 of the existing and current Electoral Act, the commission shall give notice of the holding of the elections not later than 90 days to the said election and this remains the law and the commission is in good standing relating to its timelines and schedules,\u201d Okoye added.\n\nThe INEC commissioner said that the speculations and anxiety relating to the shifting of the date of the 2023 elections were based on the Electoral Bill 2022 which is still inchoate.\n\nAccording to him, Section 28 of the said Bill requires the commission to give notice of election not later than 360 days to the said election, stressing that the said 360 days will elapse in the next few days.\n\nHe said that the commission was also aware that Section 58 of the Constitution gives the President 30 days to assent to the Bill or withhold his assent.\n\n\u201cThe commission is aware that the Bill was transmitted to the President on January 31, 2022. The members of the National Assembly and the Executive are aware of these timelines in the Bill and the implications of the timelines if the Bill is assented to and these are issues that can be adjusted and streamlined.\n\n\u201cThe commission desires an expeditious resolution of the issues surrounding the new electoral legal framework as there are creative and innovative issues and provisions in the Bill that will enhance and advance the electoral process and our democracy.\n\n\u201cThe commission is focused and will continue with its preparations for the conduct of the 2023 general election. If there are challenges with timelines, the commission will meet, assess those challenges and remain within the constitutional and legal confines in sections 132(2) and 178(2) of the Constitution that requires that elections to executive positions to hold not earlier than December 30, 2022, and not later than April 29, 2023, while legislative elections shall hold not earlier than January 10, 2023, and not later than May 10, 2023,\u201d he explained.\n\nSome civil society groups had declared February 22, 2022, National Day of Protest on the Electoral Bill\n\nThe groups said they were aware that the National Assembly transmitted the Bill to the President on January 2022.\n\nThey said that they were also aware the Bill allows for electronic transmission of results, strengthens INEC\u2019s financial independence and empowers the commission to reject falsified election results.\n\n\u201cThe bill, when signed, requires INEC to issue Notice of Election not later than 360 days before the day appointed for an election. Therefore, the President has to give assent to the bill on or before 22nd February 2022 if the dates announced for the 2023 elections are to be maintained.\n\nAccordingly, they said that they have resolved to declare Tuesday, February 22, 2022, as the National Day of Protest to demand immediate assent to the bill.\n\n\u201cWe urge citizens across the nation to call on President Muhammadu Buhari to act on this matter of urgent national importance\u201d.\n\nThe CSOs that signed the statement include Nigeria Civil Society Situation Room, Yiaga Africa, Partners for Electoral Reform (PER), International Press Centre Institute for Media and Society, Nigerian Women Trust Fund, The Albino Foundation, Centre for Citizens with Disability, Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism (PTCIJ), Labour Civil Society Coalition (LASCO), Transition Monitoring Group, CLEEN Foundation, and Civil Society, Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC).\n\nOthers include: Women Advocates Research and Documentation Centre (WARDC), Nigeria Network of Non-Governmental Organisations (NNNGO), Inclusive Friends Association (IFA), Enough is Enough (EIE), The Electoral Hub, Centre for Liberty, Take Back Nigeria Movement, International Peace and Civil Responsibility Centre (IPCRC),100 Women Lobby Group, Women in Politics Forum, Raising New Voices, Millennials Active Citizenship Advocacy Africa and Ready to Lead Africa.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Everyone, who played whatever role will be established\u201d, another source explained.\n\nThe NMDPRA had alerted Nigerians over its discovery of petrol imported into the country that contained methanol above Nigeria\u2019s specification.\n\nThe methanol-blended petrol, which is not made for Nigeria, made its way into the country.\n\nThe quantity was said to be within the range of 200 million litres.\n\nThe NNPC handles all the imports through its \u2018Crude-for-fuel\u2019 contracts, also known as Direct Sale, Direct Purchase (DSDP).\n\nThe agency conducted the business through a consortium of local and foreign oil firms.\n\nEach consortium is said to have received about 20,000 barrels per day of crude oil in exchange for products, making the combined total of about 320,000bpd of Nigeria\u2019s output.\n\nThe consortium, according to NNPC, includes MRS, Oando, EMADEB/Hyde/AY Maikifi/Brittania and Duke Oil.\n\nThe NNPC, consequently, accused the four petroleum suppliers it engaged in the swap-crude-for-petrol of culpability.\n\nMinister of State for Petroleum Resources, Mr Timipre Sylva, later promised that government would compensate those whose car engines were affected by the toxic fuel.\n\nBut the contractors denied responsibility.\n\nDespite NNPC\u2019s Efforts, Petrol Queues Persist in Abuja, Lagos\n\nMeanwhile, many filling stations were still under lock and key in Abuja and Lagos yesterday while the few that were selling petrol had long queues, despite the desperate efforts by the NNPC Limited to bring the situation under control in the last one week.\n\nMajority of the dispensing centres visited by THISDAY in the two major cities did not have the product while those that were selling, including the NNPC, had long queues of buyers lined up.\n\nRecently, the national oil company had taken a multi-pronged approach to halt the pains encountered by Nigerians as a result of the nationwide fuel shortage.\n\nAmong other measures, the NNPC had announced that between last week and the end of February, it was expecting at least 2.3 billion litres of the product to berth in Nigeria.\n\nAlthough in the last few days, there had been considerable movement of trucks within Lagos and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), many of the streets had remained clogged by traffic due to the prevailing condition.\n\nIn addition, the NNPC stated that in collaboration with other stakeholders, it was embarking on a 24-hour service, noting that Nigerians could buy the product round the clock in filling stations.\n\nBesides, it announced that at the moment, the nation has over one billion litres of petrol in stock, adding that all the fuel in circulation in the country is now certified safe after successfully withdrawing the bad fuel that disrupted supply.\n\nBut THISDAY observed that many filling stations were still not selling the product yesterday, despite all the measures put in place by the sole supplier.\n\nIn both Lagos Island and the mainland, long queues of vehicles were seen at the few filling stations selling petrol.\n\nIt was also a brisk business for the \u2018black market\u2019 operators, who were selling one litre of the product for N300 \u2013 N500, depending on the location.\n\nAt Oando in Mabushi, near the Ministry of Works in Abuja, the gates were still locked while there was no petrol at Total filling station on Sultan Abubakar way, Zone 1, although cars were in the queues.\n\nThere were also no sales at the Enyo filling station, near GSM Village, and the Total Filling Station on Herbert Macaulay Street.\n\nBut at the NNPC mega station on Olusegun Obasanjo Way, sales were ongoing, but a long queue of almost one kilometre was observed.\n\nHowever, unlike in the past two weeks when motorists blocked the road, some level of sanity has returned.\n\nIn the outskirts of Abuja, motorists and commuters were still largely stranded due to their inability to access petrol to get to their destinations.\n\nMany commuters were forced to abandon their vehicles on the road in frustration.\n\nAt the Karshi, Orozo, Jikwoyi axis of the FCT, motorists spent hours in queues waiting to be served in the few filling stations that had the product to sell.\n\nLong queues were also on both sides of the Karshi-Nyanya expressway, causing gridlock that stretched down the roads for kilometres.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",
          "summary": "The importation and circulation of adulterated petrol had resulted in damage to vehicle engines across many parts of the country.\nIt also affected the supply chain, causing long queues in Lagos and Abuja as filling stations shut down to clean up their tanks.\n\u201cSecurity agencies have commenced detailed investigation into circumstances that led to the importation of toxic fuel into the country.\nIn both Lagos Island and the mainland, long queues of vehicles were seen at the few filling stations selling petrol.\nLong queues were also on both sides of the Karshi-Nyanya expressway, causing gridlock that stretched down the roads for kilometres.",

          "text": "* Says inflows from Eurobond, SDR will boost forex supply\n\nFestus Akanbi\n\nAmid a spate of measures being put in place by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to reduce pressure on the nation\u2019s foreign exchange market, analysts from Coudros Securities have expressed confidence in the capacity of the apex bank to meet the forex demand with inflows from the recently issued Eurobond and the IMF\u2019s Special Drawing Rights (SDR).\n\nIn its Weekly economic and market update titled: \u2018Overview of markets in the week ended 18 February 2022,\u2019 the securities company also stressed the need to attract more foreign portfolio investments to sustain liquidity inflow to the economy.\n\nThe analysts argued that the current low level of crude oil production has weakened foreign reserves accretion, a development which they said necessitated the implementation of policies that would encourage the inflow of foreign portfolio investments.\n\nAccording to the report, \u201cthe CBN has enough supply to support the FX market over the short term, given inflows from the recently issued Eurobond and the IMF\u2019s SDR.\n\n\u201cHowever, foreign inflows are paramount for sustained FX liquidity over the medium term, in line with our expectation that accretion to the reserves will be weak given that crude oil production levels remain pretty low.\u201d\n\nThe report called for additional measures to attract FPIs, insisting that: \u201cThus, FPIs which have historically supported supply levels in the IEW (53.8% of FX inflows to the IEW in 2019FY) will be needed to sustain FX liquidity levels. Hence, we think (1) further adjustments in the NGN/USD peg closer to its fair value and (2) flexibility in the exchange rate would significantly attract foreign inflows back to the market.\u201d\n\nAs of last week, Nigeria\u2019s foreign reserves was $40.7 billion almost at the $42 billion thresholds set by the apex bank for mid-2022.\n\nLast year, Nigeria was able to raise $4 billion through Eurobonds, which financial analysts described as a reflection of investors\u2019 confidence in the economy.\n\nThe Debt Management Office (DMO) had in a statement explained that the Order Book peaked at $12.2 billion, which enabled the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) to raise $1 billion more than the $3 billion it initially announced.\n\nThe Eurobonds were issued in three tranches, details, namely seven years \u2013,$1.25 billion at 6.125 per cent per annum; 12 years -$1.5 billion at 7.375 per cent per annum as well as 30 years -$1.25 billion at 8.25 per annum.\n\nAlso last year, the board of governors of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had approved the allocation of $3.35 billion to Nigeria as part of a historic general allocation of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) of the International Multilateral Institution.\n\nSDRs are international reserve assets created by the IMF and allocated to members to supplement existing official reserves. Holdings of SDRs by an IMF member are recorded as an asset, while the allocation of SDRs is recorded as the incurrence of liability of the member receiving them.\n\nEarlier this year, the CBN announced a new scheme to improve dollar supply, known as Bankers\u2019 Committee \u201cRT200 FX Programme\u201d, which stands for the \u201cRace to $200 billion in FX Repatriation.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Governor of CBN, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, \u201cthe RT200 FX Programme is a set of policies, plans and programmes for non-oil exports that will enable us to attain our lofty yet attainable goal of $200 billion in FX repatriation, exclusively from non-oil exports, over the next 3-5 years.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The Oba of Benin in Edo State, Oba Ewuare II, is currently enmeshed in modern-day slavery scandal and an alleged violation of human rights of one of his palace aides, Nelson Oghogho \u2013 a 20-year-old who was detained by the police for months and remanded in prison over an allegation of stealing.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that Oghogho, who joined the palace in 2016 as a 15-year-old boy, was also denied bail by the police who were reportedly acting on \u201cpalace instructions.\u201d\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the palace detained Oghogho and another palace aide, identified only as Bright, from May to August 2021 when they were taken to court and the two had been in prison ever since.\n\n\u201cSo everyone is scared of the big name and the family of this boy is really helpless now; He was detained since May 31, 2021. The strange part is that they even denied his bail even when it was a case of someone being accused of stealing,\u201d a source said.\n\n\"It may also interest you to know that these people are doing everything possible to sweep this issue under the carpet so people don\u2019t know about it and they constantly give the impression that Nelson must serve some time for this outrageous allegation.\n\n\"Some time ago, Nelson tried to run away from the palace because of the maltreatment and hardship he had endured. You should also know that his poor parents who are farmers have not been spared by this cruel monarch as their few hard-earned landed properties have been seized and they are constantly at risk.\n\n\n\n\"They have done all they can to beg and are still begging and saying he (Oba of Benin) should have their properties in exchange for their son\u2019s freedom but to no avail. In my opinion, this is a pure case of modern slavery and this should not be tolerated.\n\n\"They are just using influence to keep the poor guy in prison, he was supposed to have been granted bail but they denied the bail, the state council opposed it and they are all trying to please the king.\"\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that Oghogho and the other were accused of stealing N200 million cash from the palace.\n\nHe was charged with stealing and conspiracy\n\nSpeaking with SaharaReporters, a top source revealed that the allegation of stealing N200 million cash from the palace was both frivolous and inhumane.\n\n\u201cHow is it humanly possible for a 20-year-old boy to steal the sum of N200 million in cash from the palace with all the security and pageantry without being noticed and traced? Even a bullion van will hardly hold that much money. It may also interest you to know that these people are doing everything possible to sweep this issue under the carpet.\n\n\"Initially, he (Oba of Benin) said it was $20,000, then, he said N10 million, when he saw that he wasn\u2019t getting as much solidarity. He started increasing it till now it\u2019s currently N200,000,000, which he is accusing Nelson of stealing.\n\n\u201cThe state council gave some flimsy excuses that Nelson will run off if granted bail while his lawyer sat there and said nothing. Seemingly they\u2019ve all been bought over. His lawyer later suggested that we should go for an appeal for the bail and charge an outrageous sum of N1 million,\u201d he said.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that the palace aide now 20 years old (to turn 21 this year), wrote some notes while in remand, detailing how his ordeal at the Oba of Benin\u2019s palace started.\n\nHe is being remanded in Oko correctional centre in Benin City.\n\n\n\nIn the notes written by the accused while in prison, and obtained by SaharaReporters on Friday, Nelson said, \u201cBefore reading this book, things you need to know; one, I have been serving the King (Oba Ewuare II) for five years plus. I have been serving without off day, break or relaxation time. I work 365 or 366 days a year.\n\n\u201cI am not on any payroll, I don\u2019t receive any salary. My family don\u2019t get any benefit or compensation. They haven\u2019t received anything from the palace. My education got tampered with since I got to the palace because the school is not functioning well and no proper equipment or lab. I was over-laboured.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have fixed working hours. Sometimes I do work from morning (6am) till midnight (12am); sometimes till dawn. I don\u2019t have time for myself because I was occupied. I was being maltreated. I have photo proof. I was always beaten and threatened every day. I was just waiting for the whole issue to die so I can leave because it was becoming more unbearable. I called my parents and I explained everything to them; I even told my friends. They all advised me to just bear that maybe everything will soon be over.\n\n\u201cIt all started when an issue arose on May 15, 2021, about some missing cash in the King (Oba Ewuare\u2019s) inner chamber. I happen to be one of the close aides to him. So one of my colleagues, Bright, was detained on that same day; May 15 for questioning.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile I was still doing my daily routine without knowing how the whole matter was going. I was beaten and threatened to confess about my colleague (Bright) that I saw him taking the money. But I refused to do so because I never saw him taking the money. Truth be told, it wasn\u2019t very easy; I couldn\u2019t run because they would falsely accuse me. Though I kept on complaining to the person that brought me (Rowland), he kept telling me to keep calm that I can run when everything is over. He told me everyone will conclude I am the one who took the money if I run.\n\n\u201cOn May 31, Rowland told me that I was going to the State Criminal Investigation Department to write a statement that Bright mentioned my name in his statement ad I was really confused because I don\u2019t even know what he was talking about. So I walked up to his car and entered there. I heard a lot of rumour that police can torture you and you will start confessing what you didn\u2019t do. I was really scared.\n\n\u201cThen I asked Rowland if I could go home from the police station because all I wanted in my life was freedom. So I told Rowland I was going to confess that I saw Bright and Igwe coming out from the inner chamber with brown envelope but I don\u2019t know what was inside; that they gave me some cash later that day not to tell anyone I saw them.\n\n\u201cThe story was made up, no incident like that ever occurred. I wanted to get myself involved so I will be chased from the palace and I see that as the only way to freedom. So Rowland drove me to the State CID with two bouncers who they were going to detain too. We met the Commander, anti-cultist unit and I wrote my statement in his office. I was surprised that after writing the statement, Rowland left me there and I was detained on May 31, 2021. At first, I thought Rowland was going to inform the king so that I would be sent home as we both agreed. But I never heard from him for more than a week. I waited for weeks but he never showed up but kept giving excuses when called.\n\n\u201cI was detained for two months, a week and a day. (May 31 to August 8, 2021); my parents never visited nor called to check up on me. It was my girlfriend that kept on bringing food to me. It wasn\u2019t really easy though.\n\n\u201cNote that my parents\u2019 property; a house on 100 by 100 and extra land were seized by the palace even before investigations started. The properties have not been returned yet.\n\n\u201cSo after being detained again on October 25, 2021, we were charged to court. We were taken to a High Court for a stealing case. We were remanded in Oko Prison on October 26, 2021, as awaiting trial persons.\n\n\u201cSo on a fateful day, we were called for a visit by some prison wardens that there were some visitors from the palace. On getting there, we saw Dennis Osaretin, Oyaniyen and one other palace functionary who I assume the palace sent to check to see if we were really suffering.\n\n\u201cTomorrow is Christmas and I am still in prison; worst Christmas ever not for me though because I always celebrate it without going out or having fun but it\u2019s actually the worst Christmas for my family. How are they going to celebrate Christmas knowing their son, brother is in prison? Don\u2019t really know how they feel now but I still give thanks to GOD.\u201d\n\nFrank Irabor, Secretary of Benin Traditional Council, told SaharaReporters that the monarch is too big to respond to such allegations, especially as the matter is in court.\n\n\"I don't understand the case you are talking about, the case is in court, do you want Omo n'Oba (Oba of Benin) to react to that?\n\n\"If someone is detained, even for one year, that is at the discretion of the judge or the agency handling the case. They will want to continue to remand the person, maybe to conclude their investigation.\n\n\"They should not drag Omo n'Oba into it at all; he is too big for that. So there is no need to say the palace or the secretary should react. Let the court handle it. Please, he is too big for that,\" Irabor said.\n\nOba of Benin in Modern Slavery Scandal, Uses Influence to Detain Palace Aide Who Served Him From Age 15 in... by Sahara Reporters on Scribd",

          "text": "The Oba of Benin in Edo State, Oba Ewuare II, is currently enmeshed in modern-day slavery scandal and an alleged violation of human rights of one of his palace aides, Nelson Oghogho \u2013 a 20-year-old who was detained by the police for months and remanded in prison over an allegation of stealing.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that Oghogho, who joined the palace in 2016 as a 15-year-old boy, was also denied bail by the police who were reportedly acting on \u201cpalace instructions.\u201d\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the palace detained Oghogho and another palace aide, identified only as Bright, from May to August 2021 when they were taken to court and the two had been in prison ever since.\n\n\u201cSo everyone is scared of the big name and the family of this boy is really helpless now; He was detained since May 31, 2021. The strange part is that they even denied his bail even when it was a case of someone being accused of stealing,\u201d a source said.\n\n\"It may also interest you to know that these people are doing everything possible to sweep this issue under the carpet so people don\u2019t know about it and they constantly give the impression that Nelson must serve some time for this outrageous allegation.\n\n\"Some time ago, Nelson tried to run away from the palace because of the maltreatment and hardship he had endured. You should also know that his poor parents who are farmers have not been spared by this cruel monarch as their few hard-earned landed properties have been seized and they are constantly at risk.\n\n\n\n\"They have done all they can to beg and are still begging and saying he (Oba of Benin) should have their properties in exchange for their son\u2019s freedom but to no avail. In my opinion, this is a pure case of modern slavery and this should not be tolerated.\n\n\"They are just using influence to keep the poor guy in prison, he was supposed to have been granted bail but they denied the bail, the state council opposed it and they are all trying to please the king.\"\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that Oghogho and the other were accused of stealing N200 million cash from the palace.\n\nHe was charged with stealing and conspiracy\n\nSpeaking with SaharaReporters, a top source revealed that the allegation of stealing N200 million cash from the palace was both frivolous and inhumane.\n\n\u201cHow is it humanly possible for a 20-year-old boy to steal the sum of N200 million in cash from the palace with all the security and pageantry without being noticed and traced? Even a bullion van will hardly hold that much money. It may also interest you to know that these people are doing everything possible to sweep this issue under the carpet.\n\n\"Initially, he (Oba of Benin) said it was $20,000, then, he said N10 million, when he saw that he wasn\u2019t getting as much solidarity. He started increasing it till now it\u2019s currently N200,000,000, which he is accusing Nelson of stealing.\n\n\u201cThe state council gave some flimsy excuses that Nelson will run off if granted bail while his lawyer sat there and said nothing.

          "text": "Pan-African fintech firm Flutterwave on Friday announced a rebrand of its logo and dashboard as well as the addition of small business lending, fintech-as-a-service (FaaS), and more to its suite of offerings.\n\nThe announcement comes 2 days after Flutterwave confirmed it had raised $250 million in a Series D round that tripled the company\u2019s valuation to over $3 billion. Led by founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, the company facilitates cross-border payments transactions of small-to-large businesses in Africa via one API.\n\nIn a virtual event themed \u201cFlutterwave 3.0\u201d, Africa\u2019s most valuable startup and payments giant rolled out a series of products and services including FaaS services for embedded finance, SME loans for its users, card issuance for a wide array of clients while announcing the addition of Apple Pay and Google Pay to its payment options.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFlutterwave Capital, the new SME loans product, is offered in partnership with the company\u2019s lending partners\u2014CashConnect Microfinance Bank, MoneyWise Microfinance Bank, Wema Bank, Zenith Bank, Stanbic IBTC Bank, and Sterling Bank.\n\nThe new product will enable businesses \u201ceasily access loans without collateral, cumbersome documentation, and other stringent terms and conditions,\u201d a blog post on Flutterwave\u2019s website reads, adding that eligible applicants can access the funds they need in less than 2 business days.\n\n\u201cWith Flutterwave Capital, we\u2019re making it easier for business owners to access the funds they require to grow their businesses. Business owners can expand, increase inventory, hire more labour, pay bills, run marketing campaigns, and ultimately grow revenue with these funds,\u201d the company said.\n\nCurrently, only Flutterwave businesses in Nigeria can access loans but the company says it is working to make it available to its businesses in South Africa, Kenya, and other markets where it operates.\n\nAs regards the fintech-as-a-service solution, Flutterwave is opening up its infrastructure to allow other companies to use its APIs to embed financial capabilities into their existing applications, products, and services.\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s FaaS service provides a unified tech stack that includes KYC, account opening, debit card issuance, payments, and real-time transfers through a single endpoint, account servicing, and compliance.\n\nThe solution helps companies bypass the often gruelling work of building the infrastructure, integrating multiple, disparate financial systems, licensing, and compliance required in building and offering consumers digital financial services.\n\nFlutterwave also helps businesses outside Africa expand their operations on the continent with an international clientele that includes Booking.com, Flywire, and Uber.\n\nThe new set of offerings and features is in line with Flutterwave\u2019s ambitious product expansion drive. Last year, the company launched Flutterwave Market for merchants to sell their goods via an online marketplace and, most recently, Send, a remittance service that empowers customers to seamlessly send money to recipients to and from Africa.\n\nIn March 2021, the San Francisco-headquartered and Lagos-based startup raised $170 million in a Series C round at a valuation of $1 billion. The latest financing thus brings its total investments secured since launched in 2016 to $475 million (plus a $35 million Series B in 2020 and a $20 million Series A in 2018).\n\nThe $3 billion valuation sees Flutterwave surpass the $2 billion mark set by SoftBank-backed fintech OPay and FTX-backed cross-border payments platform Chipper Cash last year.\n\nCurrently, Flutterwave has an infrastructure reach across 34 countries on the continent and processes 200 million transactions worth more than $16 billion. More than 900,000 businesses globally use its solution to process payments in 150 currencies and across different payment modes: local and international cards, mobile wallets, bank transfers, and its consumer product Barter, which now allows for multicurrency wallets.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Crypto crime grows to $14 billion as crypto popularity increases",
          "text": "In 2021, crypto criminals made a killing, as illicit crypto transactions hit $14 billion, a 79% jump from the $7.8 billion recorded in 2020, according to a report by US-based blockchain analytics company, Chainalysis.\n\nThe growth in illicit crypto transactions is attributed to a 567% jump in overall transaction volume in 2021. Given that overall crypto transactions grew to $15.8 trillion in 2021, it is not surprising that cybercriminals are increasingly using crypto. Despite the increase in the total volume of illicit transactions, illicit transactions represented just 0.15% of the total cryptocurrency transaction volume in 2021\u2014its lowest ever. What this means is that legitimate crypto transactions far outstrip illegal transactions.\n\nScams and theft ranked as the highest source of crypto crime and decentralised finance (DeFi) contributed most part of the funds stolen, the report shows. Scamming revenue jumped 82% to $7.8 billion worth of cryptocurrency stolen from victims. Over $2.8 billion of this total were stolen through a new type of scam called \u201crug pull\u201d. A rug pull is a type of scam where developers disappear with the money invested in crypto projects or exchanges that appear legitimate.\n\nCryptocurrency theft also jumped 516% to roughly $3.2 billion worth of cryptocurrency stolen in 2021. With 72% or 2.2 billion of those funds stolen from DeFi protocols.\n\nDeFi is a term for a financial ecosystem of tools and applications running on any blockchain that allows an individual to pay, lend, borrow, or store funds without intermediaries such as traditional financial banks.\n\nDeFi saw the biggest year-on-year growth\u20141,964%\u2014for laundering activities, while mining comes second place at less than 500% growth. The Chainalysis report attributed this growth to the hype around the DeFi space: incredible returns on decentralised tokens like Shiba Inu, which encourages people to speculate on DeFi tokens, and the ease of creating DeFi tokens\u2014all of which caused its transaction volume to grow by 912% in 2021.\n\nWhile Chainalysis acknowledges the huge opportunities DeFi presents to crypto users and entrepreneurs, it believes widespread theft and scamming will not allow it to realise its full potential. It suggested that the public and private sectors should engage in communication to teach investors how to avoid dubious projects. Although it noted that, as a long term strategy, the industry may need to prevent \u201ctokens associated with potentially fraudulent or unsafe projects from being listed on major exchanges\u201d.\n\nApart from crypto-based transactions or revenue, the Chainalysis report also shows that the volume of cryptocurrency owned by addresses on the blockchain that it has traced to criminal actors has increased from $3 to $11 billion. This data is important, Chainalysis noted, because it represents how much can be theoretically retrieved by law enforcement agencies. Stolen funds accounted for 93% of such criminal balances, at $9.8 billion; followed by Darknet market funds at $448 million; scams at $192 million; fraud shops at $66 million; and ransomware at $30 million.\n\nIn a separate analysis by Chainalysis, in the same report, 4,068 criminal whales hold over $25 billion worth of cryptocurrency. Chainalysis describes a criminal crypto whale as any private wallet holding $1 million or more worth of cryptocurrency that has received more than 10% of its funds from illicit addresses. It is important to note that the above figure of criminal whale balance won\u2019t align with the overall criminal balance because it calculates all the holdings in the private wallet (both legal and illegal) while the overall criminal balance calculates only holdings of addresses tagged as illicit. Criminal whales represent just 3.7% of all cryptocurrency whales\u2014private wallets holding over $1 million worth of cryptocurrency.\n\nDespite the massive increase in crypto crime, a positive development is the growing ability of law enforcement agencies to seize illicit cryptocurrency from criminals. For example, America\u2019s Internal Revenue Service criminal investigation (IRS-CI) seized, over the course of 2021, over $3.5 billion worth of cryptocurrency. Also in the US, the Department of Justice (DOJ) also seized $2.3 million worth of cryptocurrency from the operators of DarkSide ransomware, responsible for the attack on Colonial Pipeline. London\u2019s Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) seized \u00a3180 million worth of cryptocurrency from a suspected money launderer.\n\nEarlier this month, the United States arrested and charged a couple, Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan, for allegedly conspiring to launder stolen cryptocurrency worth 119,754 bitcoin, which is now worth an estimated $4.5 billion. The couple had allegedly laundered the bitcoin stolen in the 2016 hack of cryptocurrency exchange, Bitfinex, but the stolen bitcoin were worth $74 million at the time, a tiny fraction of their current value. The US Justice Department was able to recover more than $3.6 billion of the laundered $4.5 billion worth of bitcoin, despite the couple\u2019s sophisticated laundering technique that saw them shuffle the funds using crypto tools and techniques like unhosted wallets, a darknet marketplace, chain hooping, peel chain, and privacy coin. The agency has labelled the operation its largest financial seizure ever.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Inside Ckrowd\u2019s plan to help African creators monetise their content",
          "text": "The term \u201ccreator economy\u201d became popular throughout 2021 when venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, and independent creators not only threw the phrase around but also invested heavily in the content industry\u2014an industry that would leapfrog into becoming a $100 billion industry.\n\nContent creators\u2014writers, artists, social media influencers, videographers, gamers, podcasters\u2014are raking in millions of dollars annually by monetising their craft. But only a tiny fraction of these creators are Africans. This means African creators are still struggling to earn much from their craft, compared to their global counterparts.\n\nTwo things may have caused this: one is, global payment networks like Paypal that should connect African creators with the rest of the world have shut Africans out of their network; secondly, lack or shortage of efficient local creator platforms that connect the rest of the world directly to African creators.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nWhile there are some companies already building to solve the first problem, Ckrowd, a content streaming platform and marketplace, is solving the second problem at scale.\n\nCkrowd is positioning itself as the platform that bridges the gap between African content creators or suppliers and their global content consumers by providing creators with the opportunity to earn income while giving \u201cunique, exclusive, and engaging content experiences to their consumers\u201d.\n\nCkrowd was founded out of a will to do more\n\nCkrowd was founded by Olukayode Adebayo in November 2020. But before then, Adebayo, who was freshly back to Nigeria after a stint with the Nigerian embassy in China, had founded a real estate company that morphed into a hospitality business. He then started a media outfit in September 2016, called KAM Africa.\n\nAt KAM Africa, Adebayo started an initiative that would help creative professionals like musicians and actors understand the business part of their craft. But as he continued with the initiative, he realised that there was a need to bring all these promising enterprises together. Nobody builds in isolation, especially in the entertainment scene. So KAM Africa started Amfest, a festival-like event that brings together African creative businesses.\n\nAdebayo\u2019s cross-continental experience helped Amfest to quickly scale out of its founding country Nigeria into Ghana, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, and even Dubai.\n\n\u201cWe started building business partnerships with other platforms and scaled very fast. It was in the process of supporting the sector that we found out that many of these talents that are now enterprises had a problem with anything that doesn\u2019t involve physical human interaction,\u201d Adebayo told TechCabal. \u201cAt the point of this discovery, COVID-19 happened and it became even clearer as most of them were left without income. So, there was a need to bring them online.\u201d\n\nThe next thing to build became apparent; Ckrowd\u2014the solution to these persistent problems. After doing a lot of research and consultations throughout 2020, Adebayo launched the beta version of Ckrowd early last year and then launched publicly in August.\n\nHow Ckrowd works\n\nThe platform is a direct-to-consumer platform where original and exclusive African content in education, information, and entertainment is distributed directly to local and global consumers in short videos and live stream format. Think of a marriage between OnlyFans, Patreon, and YouTube\u2014in fact, a combination of all the streaming platforms out there\u2014but now for African content.\n\nLast year in December, uduX, a Nigerian streaming platform, partnered with telecoms giant MTN to live stream Wizkid\u2019s \u201cMade in Lagos\u201d concert from London\u2019s 02 Arena to over 238,000 Africans. But the event was quickly moved to YouTube after the day one of the three-days concert. Regardless of what might have caused the relocation, it\u2019s, however, an indication that Africa needs more efficient indigenous platforms that can aggregate content and put more money in the pocket of local creators while providing a seamless experience for local and global consumers.\n\nFor Adebayo, Ckrowd is taking an all-encompassing approach to building for the African creator economy, one that\u2019s a win-win for all the stakeholders.\n\nTo better understand CKrowd\u2019s advantage, let\u2019s look at how existing streaming platforms work: On YouTube, for instance, creators make money according to their view numbers and sometimes from ads. This means, if YouTube pays $0.0001 per view, you\u2019ll need 10,000 views to make $10. In the case of Netflix, let\u2019s say you subscribe at $10 per month, what happens if you are too busy for Netflix that month? Will you be refunded? No!\n\nFrom the creator\u2019s end, 10,000 views for $10 is not sustainable. How many African creators hit hundreds of thousands of views or millions? A small number. For consumers, the subscription model is not good if you can\u2019t flip unused subscriptions.\n\nOn Ckrowd, creators can livestream their content like uduX live and upload on-demand contents like on Netflix. Creators also control their spaces and how they want to be paid\u2014per view or by subscription. Unlike on social media platforms where creators, after creating content and amassing views and followers, would have to go outside the platform to market their views and followers to brands, Ckrowd lets creators set their prices and make their money as they go. It also allows viewers to select how they wish to pay for content\u2014all inside the platform.\n\n\u201cOur mission is to deliver economic value to African creators. The platform pays 70% of total income on content to creators, which we believe is the highest pay-out on digital content to African creators,\u201d said Adebayo.\n\nCkrowd is not only for music and film content; educational, culinary, sports, and other forms of content are allowed on the platform.\n\n\u201cThe Ckrowd platform is similar to a large arena in the cloud where you can broadcast live & short on-demand video content and charge access fees on behalf of the creators of that content. This allows the platform to uniquely function as an edtech, mediatech and adtech hybrid,\u201d said Adebayo.\n\nGrowth and traction\n\nCkrowd, from 4 users at its beta launch, has grown to have over 2,000 users on its platform. Last year in October, it raised $160,000 in pre-seed funding; $60,000 of equity funding, and $100,000 export grant investment from an international angel investor group, as well as backing from the Export Expansion Facility Programme from Nigerian Energy Support Programme (NESP).\n\nCkrowd plans to use the new capital to expand with new innovative technologies and strategies to get more customers, accelerate growth and promote intra-African creative industries. In addition to that, the company plans to hire more talent, especially in product, Research and Development (R&D) and engineering.\n\nAccording to Adebayo, the startup has already made headway in some of these plans. It acquired a marketing agency last year to power the ads sector of its business. The company said the agency\u2019s channels had access to about 50 million people across Africa, which means Ckrowd can now reach these people through email, SMS, and other channels available. This sounds like a transfer of data without the consent of the owners; however, if these people opted in with the marketing agency, which has now been acquired, then, by extension, they have opted in with Ckrowd.\n\nThe startup also recently announced the appointment of the founder and director of Music Works International Katherine McVicker and co-founder of Cultural Connections of Africa (CCA) Adeleye Fabusoro as executive members to its advisory board. Adebayo also said the company has built its own production studio and is currently partnering with other media houses across the continent, He hinted that they [Ckrowd] will soon start rolling out the results of the partnerships.\n\nCkrowd is taking on big players like Netflix, Spotify, YouTube, ShowMax, uduX and even cable television channel who\u2019ve got their claws deep in the streaming market. Will it curve, niche down, or dominate? This is not an easy one to predict but from Adebayo\u2019s confidence in the product and their pan-African play, there\u2019s something to root for in Ckrowd.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

Please, leave your thoughts in the comment section.\n\nWell, today, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nSolving critical bankend freight industry challenges\n\nEarnipay\u2019s plans to reach 200,000 employees\n\nSolving critical backend freight industry challenges\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe all know Africa lags in terms of modern technology adoption. For example, some freight companies in Africa still manage their shipments using outdated methods like spreadsheets, phone calls, and emails.\n\nFor most of them, multiple software platforms are used to complete various tasks. However, some platforms combine these software to make their work easier, faster, and more effective.\n\nOne of such companies is Freterium, a Moroccan startup that offers a single software that serves multiple functions. And this company has announced $4 million in seed funding to expand across the country and into neighbouring regions.\n\nPartech, a San Francisco-based investor, led the round. CDG Invest, Y Combinator, Flexport, Swiss Founders Fund, Outlierz Ventures, and a few angel investors from the United States, Europe, Asia, and Africa were among those who took part.\n\nFounded in 2020 by Mehdi Cherif Alami (CEO) and Omar El Kouhene (CPO), the company creates a comprehensive approach to addressing critical backend challenges in the freight industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Alami, Freterium onboarded more than 20 enterprise customers in its first full year of operation, growing 35% month over month. Over 3,000 people also use its software.\n\nHe also said that the funds would be used to invest in the company\u2019s research & development activities, hire more talent to double the current size of its team within the next 12 months, market its software, and expand across Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE.\n\nEarnipay\u2019s plans to reach 200,000 employees\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarnipay, a fintech solution startup that provides income-earners with flexible and on-demand salary access, has raised $4 million in a seed round to provide on-demand salaries to African employees.\n\nThe round was led by VC, Canaan. It also saw participation from XYZ Ventures, Village Global, Musha Ventures, Ventures Platform, Voltron Capital, and Paystack CEO Shola Akinlade.\n\nNonso Onwuzulike officially launched the company in January 2022 to improve employees\u2019 financial well-being. It accomplishes this by utilising technology to allow employees to deposit their paychecks into their accounts in a flexible, real-time, and interest-free manner.\n\nEarnipay collaborates with employers and integrates seamlessly with their payroll systems to provide its services to employees, who can then track and withdraw their accrued salaries via the app.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the company will use the seed funding to speed up the development of its platform to serve large enterprise employers. It will also provide employees with the tools to make better financial decisions and improve their quality of life.\n\nBy the end of 2022, the company plans to offer its on-demand salary solution to 200,000 employees.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nMost people with EUPD/BPD aren\u2019t manipulative \u2013 but often those around us can be.

But Meta says it has to process data across continents because it is crucial for ad targeting.\n\nAd targeting or not, the European leaders are very adamant about the new rule. Germany\u2019s new economy minister Robert Habeck said, \u201cAfter I was hacked, I have lived without Facebook and Twitter for four years, and life has been fantastic.\u201d\n\nMeta could be on the receiving end of its threat to the EU as it closed with a market cap below $600 billion on February 8, 2022, losing daily active users for the first time in its 18 year existence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, we\u2019re discussing:\n\nWhy female founders should learn the venture capital game\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s $3bn valuation\n\nCrowdForce\u2019s $3.6m pre-Series A\n\nWomen should play the VC game\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2021, women got less than 1% of startup funding. Sadly, the statistics have been quite similar in previous years.\n\nWhy is it this way? \u201cGetting funded is a bit of a game.\u201d \u2014 the words of Sarah Dusek, Managing General Partner at Enygma Ventures.\n\nAccording to her, women need to learn the rules of the VC game and know what works and what doesn\u2019t.\n\nEnygma Ventures has spent two years teaching women what venture funding requires. Dusek started the firm when she realised how difficult it was for women to access capital.\n\nIn her chat with Chimgozirim, she detailed the rules and tactics that could mean better odds for women in winning the venture capital game. Read all about it here: Female founders need to learn how to play the venture capital game\u2013 Sarah Dusek\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s $3bn valuation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlutterwave has come a long way since it was founded in 2016. The San Francisco-headquartered fintech startup broke into unicorn status last year after a $170 million raise led by New York-based private investment firm Avenir Growth Capital and US hedge fund and investment firm Tiger Global.\n\nIn just 12 months, Flutterwave has tripled that valuation after a $250 million Series D raise announced yesterday, February 16, 2022. The raise was led by global investment firm, B Capital. Leader of its $170 million Series C. Avenir Growth also participated in the round.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTripling its valuation isn\u2019t the only thing the fintech company has achieved since attaining unicorn status 12 months ago. Businesses using its platform have increased by 610,000 \u2014 290,000 to 900,000.\n\nIts total transaction, valued at $9 billion last year, has grown to $16 billion with 200 million transactions processed.\n\nAlthough Flutterwave started out as an enterprise payment fintech startup, it has detoured into creating fintech products for small and medium businesses and remittance products over the years.\n\nIn 2020 we saw the launch of Flutterwave Store revamped to Flutterwave Market in 2021. The platform now boasts 30,000 merchants according to TechCrunch. Flutterwave\u2019s remittance service, Send, also launched recently to help customers send money within and outside Africa.\n\nAway from fintech: Flutterwave also displayed interest in the creator economy with the acquisition of Disha, a platform that allows creators to curate content and receive payment. However, the payments feature still falls within Flutterwave\u2019s court.\n\nIPO insight? If you\u2019re planning on investing in Flutterwave via stocks the CEO and Co-Founder, Olugbenga Agboola, told TechCrunch that the startup has no plan to IPO anytime soon. The funding will be geared towards its ambitious expansion plans and rapid customer acquisition.\n\nIf you want to go down memory lane before Flutterwave became a mammoth in the African tech space, you can start with the story of Agboola\u2019s first day as CEO.\n\nPlease read here: In conversation with Olugbenga Agboola on his first day as Flutterwave CEO\n\nCrowdForce\u2019s $3.6m pre-Series A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolutions to financial inclusion most times comes in two ways online or offline. However, some people, like Twitter user, Mudia, are of the opinion that the former isn\u2019t true financial inclusion. Mudia sums up his opinion up in a tweet that reads,\n\n\u201cBanking the un-banked, but your solution na app wey dey work from Android 11 upwards.\u201d\n\nMost people with a similar stance believe a solution to financial inclusion that requires a smartphone isn\u2019t practical as most smartphone users are already banked. According to Dataphyte, a media research and data analytics organisation, 38 million Nigerians were financially excluded in 2020.\n\nFintech startups like OPay and TeamApt are tackling the problem with agent banking, taking physical banking services to hard-to-reach locations.\n\nHowever, these agents still need banks to get cash, and that\u2019s where CrowdForce, which announced its $3.6 million pre-Series A yesterday comes in.\n\nThe startup offers agency banking services like OPay and TeamApt, but agents do not need to visit banks to get cash. It solves this problem by partnering with cash-heavy small businesses like fuel stations, converts them to mobile bank branches and stores their cash on PayForce digital wallet, its flagship product.\n\nCrowdForce has partnered with 19,000 fuel stations to broaden its network. It plans to grow its 7,000 agent network by three times a year.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nScientists Created a Cyborg Fish Powered by Beating Human Heart Cells.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA cursory look at the venture capital landscape in Africa will reveal an impressive number of deals and the triumph of innovation over regulation. Yet, a closer look at the numbers will show a wide gulf between the amount of money raised by men and women.\n\nWhile funding for female founders globally is minimal, African women have seen significantly less money than their male counterparts, receiving less than 1% of startup funding in 2021. One reason for this is that most female-led businesses in Sub-Saharan Africa are small businesses with little capacity for scale.\n\nAccording to Sarah Dusek, Managing General Partner at Enygma Ventures, who spoke to Techpoint Africa on Zoom, a second reason is that most women don\u2019t know how to play the venture capital game.\n\n\u201cI think one of the biggest components that we\u2019ve been working on for the last couple of years has been not knowing how you play this game, and getting funded is a bit of a game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere are very specific rules to it; there are specific metrics that people like me are looking for. There are specific types of businesses that work and those that don\u2019t, particularly with this type of funding. Women are more familiar with taking debt and grants, and I think there are a lot of unfamiliarities in the space that disadvantages women.\u201d\n\nDue to this, Dusek, an entrepreneur, revealed that a huge part of Enygma Ventures\u2019 work in the last two years has been teaching women what venture funding requires. She also added that the presence of a few role models makes it harder for women to raise money.\n\nWith venture capital a novel concept in Africa, not too many people, regardless of gender, understand how it works. Therefore, the lack of knowledge plays a role in how women access funding. \u201cIf you know, you can build it,\u201d she said.\n\nHelping women build scalable businesses\n\nBuilding a business is a daunting task for anyone, but it can often seem like an impossible task when you\u2019re a woman. Centuries of restricting the participation of women in the economy to the informal sector have led to a small number of women in the workforce. Dusek knows this all too well, having built and sold Under Canvas, an American hospitality company.\n\nAfter selling Under Canvas, Dusek, who started her career working with non-governmental organisations in Africa, decided to invest in female founders. That decision birthed Enygma Ventures, a sector-agnostic firm providing women with the capital required to scale and grow their businesses.\n\n\u201cMy experience of being a female founder made me realise how hard it is for women founders to get access to capital, and so it\u2019s a natural progression from being an entrepreneur to being a guide to helping other women do the same thing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Dusek, Managing General Partner, Enygma Ventures\n\nEnygma Ventures invests in early-stage women-led or women-founded startups across the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and East Africa. The ticket sizes for startups the firm invests in vary from $100,000 to as much as $1 million. While the firm is sector-agnostic in its approach to investment, Dusek disclosed that it would not invest in startups that cannot scale.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we look at is the size of the addressable market. So how big is the problem you\u2019re trying to address, and how big could you be?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe quality of the team is another factor that Enygma Ventures considers, with Dusek revealing that they like to see proof that founders have created value. Since opening its doors in 2019, the firm has invested in over 12 women-led startups, including Adbot, Koa Academy, Candor, Premier Credit, Play Sense, and Lupiya.\n\nBiggest mistakes entrepreneurs make\n\nAn entrepreneur\u2019s path is filled with uncertainty. Many of the problems they face are unanticipated or not taught in schools. Consequently, they are likely to make quite a few mistakes. Dusek shared a few that she has seen in her time.\n\nBuilding a venture-backed business means working to meet certain milestones, and Dusek revealed that many early-stage founders are not clear on what these milestones should be.\n\n\u201cThe biggest challenge with early-stage founders is recognising what your major milestones are. We talk a lot about the valley of death, which is this early-stage era in a startup\u2019s life where it\u2019s very easy for startups to crash and burn and die, or they make it to the next level.\n\n\u201cThe big challenge for startups is how to manage their available cash and get to the next level because if you\u2019re a company that\u2019s taking on venture capital in the early stages, the likelihood is that you\u2019re going to raise more capital to keep growing,\u201d she noted.\n\nThe next frontiers in Africa\n\nWhile there are quite a few factors responsible for the low level of funding that women get, my conversations with various founders and investors suggest that one major factor is that there are not enough women building scalable businesses. Venture capital is, in many ways, a numbers game, and the more women there are building companies that investors like, the higher the chances of women receiving investments.\n\nSo, what industries does Dusek want to see more women play in? Pretty much every industry that can drive economic development in Africa.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see more women building any kind of business. I think we\u2019ve got a few frontiers to move the continent forward, and I\u2019d love to see more women pioneering. I think we have huge opportunities in education, healthcare, financial services, and almost anything where we are trying to raise the standard of living for millions.\u201d\n\nIn the early 2000s, the growth of the African middle class and mobile phone penetration, amongst other developments, gave birth to the term \u201cAfrica rising.\u201d Yet, most African countries have failed to live up to the hype. However, a few people still hold out hope that the new crop of entrepreneurs can spearhead the development of Africa.\n\nDusek believes that African economies have a distinct advantage as they do not have to make bite-sized changes but could leapfrog certain developments.\n\n\u201cI am super passionate about Africa\u2019s ability to lead. I feel like so often, we wait for the world to allow us to come to their party, and Africa is at this moment where she has to lead and build her own future, and that\u2019s exciting.\u201d\n\nVenture capital can be complicated, but Enygma Ventures wants to demystify it. Prospective founders can head over to the website, where an eligibility quiz helps both parties to determine if they\u2019re a good fit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "title": "2023: Can Iyorchia Ayu return PDP to power?",
          "text": "Iyorchia Ayu, the national chairman of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), has, since assumption of office toward the end of last year, been championing the return to power of the erstwhile ruling party.\n\nIn fact, that was the grain of his inaugural speech as he asked the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to start preparing its handover note, saying Nigerians who were allegedly fed up with the \u201cmaladministration\u201d of the APC were yearning for the return of PDP.\n\n\u201cA PDP administration will change the narrative. We will unite the people. We will deepen the content of our democracy. We will rebuild our collapsed economy. We will make Nigerians the focus of development.\n\n\u201cWe will expand our international vision beyond Niger Republic. We will check the rampaging insecurity. We will restore Nigeria\u2019s lost glory. And we will reclaim our dignity, destiny and pride as the Giant of Africa.\n\n\u201cTo the APC, we, once again, renew our quit notice on you. Begin to prepare your handover notes,\u201d Ayu had said.\n\nSpeaking recently at a function in Rivers State, he expressed confidence that the party would produce the next president of the country.\n\nHe said the APC-led Federal Government, which, according to him, has pulled the country backwards economically, has to be changed.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, a very poor leadership has presented Nigeria at home and abroad as an extremely divided country.\n\n\u201cWe must change this narrative and the only way to change this narrative and harness not just the culture, but the environment and the richness therein, is to back the People\u2019s Democratic Party, which is determined to produce a new leadership for this country,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Ayu, \u201cThe PDP will definitely produce the next president and take the country back to the days when we were in power, when we cleared all foreign debts, when we were developing this country at reasonable speed, and when we became the richest country on the African continent.\u201d\n\nIn the last few months, the PDP has experienced a fresh breath of air after a turbulent period where internal crisis had crippled the smooth running of the party nationally and in several states.\n\nThe crisis had degenerated resulting in the removal of former national chairman Uche Secondus from office, while several chieftains and governors defected to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nThus, observers felt that Ayu\u2019s coming was a sign of better days ahead; they expressed optimism that he was up to the task judging by his rich credentials and political experience.\n\nUpon assumption of office, observers had tasked Ayu to urgently reposition the party for victory in the 2023 general election and beyond. This they said can be done by urgently embarking on a rebuilding exercise to try and bring together all the state chapters polarised by internal crisis.\n\nMore so, pundits had predicted that perhaps, the ability of the Ayu-led leadership to navigate the seemingly intricate issues may determine the future of PDP.\n\nHowever, in the last few weeks, the inability of the party to resolve the lingering debates on where the party would zone the 2023 presidency have heightened tension within the PDP circles across the country. Particularly worrisome is the issue of the South East geo-political zone, which is the strong base of the PDP, but had not produced a president since the party was given birth to in 1999.\n\nIn the last few years, leaders of the region had insisted that they must produce the next president after the expiration of the two terms of incumbent Muhammadu Buhari next May.\n\nThere are concerns in some quarters, and questions are being asked as to how far the party has gone in resolving some of the internal crises, which affected several state chapters so that it would not serve as a stumbling block.\n\nHowever, some party members have allayed such fears, saying that the party was on track and must naturally encourage all stakeholders, party faithful and the generality of the country by giving them hope of a new and better Nigeria.\n\nThey said Ayu was on course to reposition PDP and get it on the winning ways alongside his other executive members, with the support of the governors and all other critical stakeholders.\n\nAdelaja Adeoye, a former national publicity secretary of ADP and now a chieftain of the PDP in Lagos, said: \u201cI have no doubt that PDP will win massively in 2023 because of the fact that APC has suffered Nigerians; inflation is nothing to talk about or the tag that Nigeria is now the epicentre of poverty in the world.\n\n\u201cWhen PDP was in power things were never this bad for 16 years, but in a span of less than eight years, Nigerians are in pain.\n\n\u201cSo, it is in line for the national chairman, Iyorchia Ayu to boldly say that PDP will return back to power in 2023, because Nigerians themselves have experienced both APC and PDP and they know which is better for them.\u201d\n\nAdelaja, however, added that \u201cThe issue of zoning is a very delicate matter that the chairman cannot decide on it all alone. It is an issue that must be handled with care. Stakeholders from the South, especially the South East of the party have been clamouring that the ticket be zoned to them, which has made our former Vice Presidential Candidate, Peter Obi, to show interest should the party decide that it is going South.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, the party is looking at the easiest way to return to power in terms of voting demography, which tends to favour the North; that is why some aspirants from the North have been showing interest, however, to immediately put the issue to rest, the party has said it has not zoned to any region in the country.\n\n\u201cBut like I have posited previously, we must look beyond issues of ethnicity or religion when making decisions for who will be the President of Nigeria in 2023.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cOur focus must be someone with the required clout, connections, competence, capacity and character with practical experience in leadership and governance because the work to be done to refix Nigeria from the present ruin done by the APC\u2019s led government is huge.\u201d\n\n\u2018For victory, PDP must zone to South\u2019\n\nThe Ayu gospel of returning PDP power is also challenged by the party\u2019s silence on the zoning of the office of the Presidency in the face of the agitation for power shift to the South and Eastern part of the country particularly.\n\nThere are fears that the party may zone the Presidency to the North, considering the large number of aspirants for the office from the zone, including former Vice President Atiku Abubakar; former Senate President, Bukola Saraki; Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal; Bauchi State Governor; Bala Mohammed and former Kano State Governor, Rabiu Kwankwaso.\n\nHowever, the PDP Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Abdullahi Ibrahim said the party was still consulting on its zoning arrangement.\n\nIbrahim said in a recent media inquiry that: \u201cPeople are in a haste to see us declare our position on zoning. There are processes of consultations and engagements, which are still ongoing.\n\n\u201cWe just have in place an NWC which is barely two months in office. What it is doing now is to aggregate all the contending forces and interests and all the divergent views and come up with an informed decision as to where the presidency will be zoned accordingly.\u201d\n\nFor Sam Onikoyi, a Nigerian researcher in Brussels, Belgium, Ayu and the party will gain respect if they tackle the most critical issues in the 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cThere are clamours for power to shift to the South in 2023 and PDP is not firm on the shift, Atiku is still nursing ambition to rule. Sadly, the ruling party is thinking South and is likely going to have 2023 because any party that fields a Southern presidential candidate will win. So, Ayu should bear this in mind,\u201d he noted.\n\nHe insisted that if Ayu wants to return PDP to power in 2023, he must insist on a Southern presidential candidate or APC will beat them to it again.\n\n\u201cThere is a game of hide-and-seek going on. We all know that, but the reality is that power must shift to the South and PDP should know this better. It is not about the voting numbers, but power shift, else some zones will boycott the 2023 election and a bigger problem will emerge afterwards,\u201d he warned.\n\nOn his part, Yohanna Pam, a Plateau State-born politician, noted that if Samuel Ortom, the governor of Benue State, is the PDP leader, he can command the kind of influence that would unite aggrieved party members, including governors that defected to other parties, but Ayu may not command such influence now.\n\nOrtom is even challenging Atiku and sees no reason he should contest as Buhari is from the north and an Atiku means power to the north again after eight years, which the south will not support. Way forward for PDP is to insist on southern candidates or Ayu will fail woefully,\u201d the Abuja-based politician declared.\n\nOn a general note, observers noted that no matter the level of reconciliation and even if all the former PDP governors and party bigwigs who defeated to APC return, if the party fails to insist on power shift or fail to field presidential candidate from the Southern part of the country, PDP will die a natural death after 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cHow can the north rule for eight years and another northerner is planning to rule for another eight years? That is a grand scheme by the north and the south should stop it or abandon PDP. If Atiku wants to rule, let him run as vice to any southern presidential candidate under PDP. Yes!\u201d an aggrieved party member said.\n\nThey fear that the Gboko, Benue State-born politician, may not be able to control the bigwigs whose actions and inactions have been the reasons for the many cracks in the party since losing election in 2015.\n\nThough Ayu is an experienced politician, having served in various ministerial positions in the cabinet of President Olusegun Obasanjo between 1999 and 2007, the herculean task of reconciling aggrieved party members and fostering unity ahead of the 2023 general election, may likely overwhelm him, some political analysts noted.\n\nChijioke Umelahi, a lawyer and former Abia lawmaker, believes that returning PDP to power in 2023 is an almost impossible task.\n\nThe lawyer observed that the PDP has not shown enough courage as an opposition party, the way the All Progressives Congress (APC) did for years before eventually unseating them (PDP) in 2015.\n\nRead also: PDP will restore Nigeria\u2019s past economic status \u2013 Udom\n\nThat lack of sustained opposition from the PDP, according to him, puts whoever is leading the party in a precarious position as most Nigerians are tired of both PDP and the APC, which they see as same with the incessant cross-carpeting of members, betrayal of supporters\u2019 trust and anger at the selfish interest of party bigwigs at the detriment of the supporters and the masses at large.\n\nUmelahi said: \u201cWe are happy for Ayu, but who can he control, can he bring the defected governors back; can he take decisions on critical issues and they are obeyed by the bigwigs?\u201d\n\nAPC says PDP return threat empty\n\nWhile the former President of the Senate continued to beat the drums of change, there are those who believe that the Ayu\u2019s PDP has nothing to offer Nigerians.\n\nIn fact, he was immediately countered by Saliu Mustapha, an aspirant for the APC National Chairman who said the PDP still has nothing to offer Nigerians in spite of its change of leadership.\n\nMustapha described the inaugural speech of Ayu as a bare-faced attempt by the party to hoodwink Nigerians to return it to power in 2023.\n\n\u201cLike many stakeholders in the ruling party, I find it shocking that the new PDP chairman used his inaugural speech to rehash the lies and innuendos of the previous leadership of the opposition party.\n\n\u201cBut contrary to Ayu\u2019s attempt to revise history, President Buhari inherited a country that was virtually on life support with no fewer than 27 states unable to pay salaries and pension in spite of a historic oil proceeds in the preceding years,\u201d he said.",
          "summary": "Iyorchia Ayu, the national chairman of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), has, since assumption of office toward the end of last year, been championing the return to power of the erstwhile ruling party.\n\u201cThere are clamours for power to shift to the South in 2023 and PDP is not firm on the shift, Atiku is still nursing ambition to rule.\nHe insisted that if Ayu wants to return PDP to power in 2023, he must insist on a Southern presidential candidate or APC will beat them to it again.\nChijioke Umelahi, a lawyer and former Abia lawmaker, believes that returning PDP to power in 2023 is an almost impossible task.\nMustapha described the inaugural speech of Ayu as a bare-faced attempt by the party to hoodwink Nigerians to return it to power in 2023.",

          "text": "The choice of who becomes the National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) is becoming clearer with leaders of the party endorsing the candidature of three aspirants.\n\nSo far, 12 persons are jostling for the position among who are former governors, a serving minister, as well as serving and former members of the National Assembly.\n\nAt a well-attended meeting of key stakeholders of the APC held in the Abuja residence of one of the North-West governors at the weekend, the leaders, it was learnt that the slot was zoned to the North Central. They also narrowed the choice of preferred candidates to three aspirants, namely, Tanko Al\u2019Makura (Nasarawa State), George Akume (Benue State) and Abubakar Bawa Bwari (Niger State) in that order. This is however subject to the approval of the party at the February 25 National Convention.\n\nThe meeting also agreed to zone the office of National Secretary to the South-South; Deputy National Chairman (South) to the South West; Deputy National Chairman (North) North-West; National Treasurer (South East) and National Financial Secretary (North East).\n\nA source at the meeting told BusinessDay that the choice of the three aspirants was done after careful study of their character, qualifications, pedigree, service to the nation and loyalty to the party.\n\n\u201cTop on our priority in the choice of a national chairman that is loyalty to the party, with pedigree and patriotic to the country. We don\u2019t want to repeat the mistakes of the past in our choice of our leaders, and I can tell you that these three aspirants met the criteria,\u201d the source said.\n\nHe said the party leaders took the pre-emptive action to avoid anybody or group hijacking the party leadership, a situation he said could lead to \u201ccrisis\u201d and \u201cdivision\u201d among the various groups that make up the party structure.\n\nAPC is divided into six power blocks. Notable among them are; the legacy parties that coalesced to form APC in 2013, the APC Governor\u2019s Forum, the National Assembly Caucus of the party, former Governors, former federal lawmakers and the regional groups.\n\nMeanwhile, all the groups are involved in the game of suspense, intrigues and horse-trading on a convention that promises to be the most intricate in the party\u2019s history\n\nThe party is currently being administered by a 13-man Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) led by Governor Mai Bala Buni of Yobe State, which was inaugurated in June 2021, following the removal of former National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, about two years to the end of his tenure.\n\nAlthough February 26, 2022, has been fixed for the elective National Convention, there are still doubts about it holding on that day with calls from some quarters for the convention to be postponed.\n\nAside from the three aspirants mentioned, the remaining nine national chairmanship aspirants are; former deputy national chairman of the defunct Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), Saliu Mustapha; a former governor of Borno State, Ali Modu Sheriff, and senator representing Niger East District, Mohammed Sani-Musa.\n\nOthers are former governors of Zamfara State, Abdulaziz Yari; Bauchi State, Isa Yuguda; Borno State, Kashim Shettima; Gombe State, Danjuma Goje; Sunny Moniedafe and Mohammed Saidu-Etsu\n\nProfile of the 3 key aspirants\n\nUmaru Tanko Al-Makura:\n\nHe was born November 15, 1952, in Lafia, Nasarawa State, as a member of the Gwandara ethnic group.

          "text": "Only the Algerian Dinar, down 1.22 percent, has lost more value than the Nigerian naira among the currencies of countries in the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) this year.\n\nThe Central Bank\u2019s official naira/dollar exchange rate is down 1.10 percent this year (from N411.95 on January 1, 2022 to N416.5 on February 17). That compares with a 0.9 percent average gain for the currencies of OPEC members, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nIt gets worse for the naira when the unofficial rate- which is the more accessible rate- is considered. The naira weakened this week to N577 per USD in the unofficial market, a 3 percent decline compared to the N560 level it was at the beginning of the year.\n\nThe currency of Africa\u2019s top oil producer is declining against the US dollar when currencies of the majority of OPEC members are appreciating on the back of the rally in oil prices, worsening the pain of millions of individuals and businesses who need dollars to pay tuition and import raw materials.\n\nTraders expect the naira to come under even more pressure as Nigeria struggles with dwindling dollar inflows even when oil prices are at the highest since 2014.\n\nNigeria\u2019s low oil production and the small matter of a growing petrol subsidy bill have wiped out the gains of the oil rally while other oil exporting countries are benefitting.\n\nRead also: High remittances fail to curb naira pressure, boost reserves\n\nA senior banking source who did not want to be named said the government is considering issuing a Eurobond before the end of February to shore up the CBN\u2019s ailing foreign reserves.\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t many options on the table in terms of how we can get dollars in the short-term, so it\u2019s no surprise a Eurobond issuance is coming to the fore,\u201d the source said.\n\nNigeria was pumping about 1.5 million barrels per day in January according to OPEC data. That\u2019s lower than the country\u2019s OPEC+ quota, which covers only crude oil and not condensates, of around 1.614 million barrels per day.\n\nNigeria\u2019s petrol subsidy bill is also growing and eating into the government\u2019s already thin dollar earnings. After backtracking on plans to ditch the subsidy regime in June, the government will spend N3 trillion subsidising petrol this year, pushing its budget deficit to nearly N9 trillion and 4 percent of GDP.\n\nThe subsidy burden and low oil production means there has been no external reserve accretion for Nigeria despite high oil prices. The external reserves have dipped below $40 billion and now sit at a three-month low.\n\nAlso, low capital inflow into Nigeria has not helped. With investors\u2019 weak confidence in Nigeria\u2019s macroeconomy, it is not surprising that they have reduced funds flow into the real sector as well as the capital market. Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) puts total capital inflow into Nigeria as at the first nine months of 2021 at USD4.51 billion, down 47.6 percent.\n\nThe last time the external reserve got a major boost was after inflows from the last Eurobond proceeds and the Special Drawing Rights (SDR) allocation by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) last year.\n\nNigeria seems to be shifting its attention to non-oil exports to boost its dollar earnings. Currently, non-oil exports are relatively low and account for less than 20 percent of total export earnings.\n\nA non-oil fx programme (RT200) was announced by Godwin Emefiele, Governor of Nigeria\u2019s central bank after the conclusion of February\u2019s bankers\u2019 meeting.\n\nThe programme, according to the governor, is targeted at raising USD200bn from non-oil exports over the next 3 to 5 years.\n\nThe \u201cRT200 FX Programme\u201d stands for \u201cRace to USD200 billion in FX Repatriation\u201d\n\nWith oil receipts \u2013 the major source of Nigeria\u2019s fx earnings \u2013 under pressure due to evacuation challenges in Nigeria\u2019s oil sector, the governor sees the RT200 as a major route to raising non-oil fx earnings.\n\n\u201cNigeria needs to boost exports and open up other avenues for dollar inflows if we want the naira to strengthen sustainably,\u201d said Wakeel Ishola, a professor of economics at the University of Lagos.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t add value to the raw materials we export, we need a shift in mindset to be a production-based economy, rather than purely consumption-driven,\u201d Ishola told BusinessDay.",

The effective implementation is highly commended.\u201d\n\nReacting to the award Her Excellency Betsy Obaseki said \u201cI am actually receiving this on behalf of all Governors Wives because we are in this together. At the time that we started this fight in June 2020, we had just about 14 States that had domesticated the VAPP Law. A year and half later, as we speak today we have about 32 States that have come to the point of domestication, some waiting for assent.\n\n\u201cThis was all as a result of one attempt at cooperating to fight a common enemy. And this has changed the whole space of GBV in the country. It attests to the fact that once we resolve as a group to come together to tackle a problem, there is no limit to how successful we can become \u201c.\n\nEarlier, the Country Representative of WFD, Mr Adebowale Olorunmola in his goodwill message encouraged the Edo First Lady and everyone present at the Zoom meeting to use the Policy Brief \u201cin such a way that our girls and our women can be sure that they have a community where their rights and their person is protected against all forms of violence\u201d.\n\nThose who attended the Zoom meeting include the Deputy Governor of Edo State, His Excellency Rt.

This election process should not be a battle field. It should not be a do or die affair. There should be no violence. Let everybody have the opportunity of participating. I think that\u2019s the process and I think it has gone very well contrary to the speculation\u201d\n\nThe governor who is optimistic of winning the election said members of the party have witnessed tremendous achievements recorded in his first term and would present him for second term to allow continuity of the good work he has started.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll win by the grace of God. I want to appeal to all of us to see this issue as a family affair. It\u2019s APC all through. We should brace up for the challenge ahead. We are going to face another party in this campaign we don\u2019t know yet.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, the deputy governor, Mr. Benedict Alabi said the exercise so far was peaceful, devoid of rancour and well organised.\n\n\u201cPeople have assembled since 8am. Everybody here seems to be agog. I am happy we are having a peaceful, free and fair election. The fact is that there is only one candidate that is contesting the primary in Osun and that\u2019s the incumbent governor.\n\n\u201cWe have the other faction with other two aspirants. They are not even visible in this community.\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, the state Commissioner for Finance, Hon.

Will the access to digital banks change the mindset of Nigerians in rural areas of the country and be enough to drive the transition from cash to cashless society?\u201d she questioned.\n\nProffering the way forward, Mracajac stressed the need to provide financial literacy through content that speaks to an average Nigerian in unserved rural areas of the country, stating that financial inclusion is a process, not just a point in time and space that we want to reach.\n\nShe added that, developing content that speaks only to the already banked and mirroring the digital financial habits of those who are fully included and heavily banked, will not help to keep the newly on-boarded in the system long-term.\n\nShe stated: \u201cWhile creating and delivering the content for financial inclusion, we need to have in mind the needs of its beneficiaries, the targeted end-users of the financial services who are currently underserved and the only sustainable way is that we join our forces and create the content \u2013 apps and services that will address the specific needs of a farmer in Benue, market women in Onitsha, trader in Kano, fisherman in Delta, and the woman selling ofada rice in Ogun State.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, she noted that, to drive the offline individuals and MSMEs from cash to cashless, from analog to digital and from informal to formal, content creators need to focus on two major goals; one, to deliver relevant and on-point digital financial literacy content, educating people about the principles, ways, modules, and benefits of banking. The second one, she stated, is needed for sustainable Financial inclusion: delivery of digital banking services that are a reflection of the lifestyle of the currently unbanked and underserved population.\n\nShe called on all stakeholders within the financial ecosystem, including content creators to work collectively to develop and implement a digital content strategy for the unbanked to move the financial inclusion needle and ultimately advance the economy, society and improve life of every Nigerian.\n\nIn his own keynote address, titled \u201cDisruptive Innovation: Production and Distribution of Creative Content, the Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Professor Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami, who was represented by the Chief Executive Officer, Nigerian Communications Satellite Limited (NIGCOMSAT), Dr. Abimbola Alale remarked that the quality of creatives and start-ups that Nigeria has produced is a testament to the potential of the ecosystem, and as such the ministry will continue to support the tech and creative entrepreneurs to play their part in developing Nigeria\u2019s digital economy.\n\nThe Tech Summit Ogun is an annual convergence of Tech disruptors, innovators, startups, organizations and technology enthusiast in Ogun State, aimed at spurring technological innovation towards the digital transformation and technological advancement of Ogun State. This year, the summit attracted over 2000 participants, mainly the youths and start-ups.",

          "text": "Fiebai Mbelegber, a former All Progressives Congress (APC) Chieftain, has stated that his greatest regret is the ten years he spent as an APC member in Bayelsa State with nothing to show for it.\n\nHe said that after selling his car and other assets to run for an Assembly seat, he and others were ignored by the party\u2019s leadership and were never paid.\n\nMbelegberi lambasted the leadership of his previous party for missing internal democratic processes within the party in an exclusive interview with DAILY POST on Sunday in Yenagoa, after defecting from the APC to the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state.\n\nHe claimed that the people of Bayelsa State\u2019s Nembe Local Government Area have vowed never to vote for any APC candidate in the upcoming election because of how the party\u2019s leadership treated them despite the fact that the area contributed 90% of the votes that produced current Assembly members in the previous election.\n\nHis words \u201cOur anger with the party is against the leaders of the party in the state and we have taken our decision that we will never vote for any candidate of the APC in the next elections. We don\u2019t care if the party Chairman is from our LGA, what we are after are the results, what are the tangible things they have done for the people? What are the projects attracted from the FG to the LGA? Then look at the people we didn\u2019t even vote for, they are the ones doing projects in our communities. That shows that the man has respect for us, and we have promised to give all elective positions to PDP. we will stand by our decision and it can not be altered\u201d\n\n\u201dI just recently defected from the All Progressive Congress (APC), to the People Democratic Party (PDP). I was a former Secretary of the defunct Action Congress (AC), I attained the position of Vice President, Ex-Councillors forum, before my defection I was the Asst. Acting Organising Secretary of the APC.\n\n\u201dSome circumstances that led to me leaving was that the party does not have internal democracy, the leadership does not have any vision for its followers.\n\n\u201dIn 2015, APC was not on ground but people like me who were foot soldiers galvanised and gave strength to the party, at the end of the day there was no reward. No one was carried along, we did everything and once they attained the positions we were all abandoned. No right-thinking youth is a beneficiary of empowerment in the party, we are rather impoverished.\n\n\u201dWe decided to move to our original party because it all appears the PDP has plans for the people, with the infrastructure development and human capacity building carried out by the Diri administration. On this premise, we defected, and we were given a rousing reception, what I have witnessed already is better than the 10 years I spent in APC.\n\n\u201dOne thing about Nembe people is that once we stand by you, our integrity must be put to test. It is a privilege for us to return back to our party, a party where we all grew up, I became an elected councillor under the PDP, whatever position I have attained in life is through the PDP, and coming back will add more value to me. I am glad to return.\n\n\u201dI never enjoyed any tangible thing all my years in APC, I had to sell my car so as to raise money to contest the House of Assembly, but I didn\u2019t make it through and none of us was compensated.\n\n\u201dGovernor Diri is trying his best, if I have to score him it will be 60% and he knows Bayelsans are expecting more. He has achieved a lot in his 2 years in office, even when I was in the APC when he does things I use to commend him despite party differences, I am not just a card-carrying member but a core member, but from all indications because of the highhandedness of the leadership, not regarding other stakeholders, a lot of people are aggrieved and have moved. In a possible short period, there will be a mass exodus of defectors from the APC to the PDP.",

Hushpuppi, is being investigated by the FBI on allegations of Business Email Compromise (BEC) and money laundering.\n\nThe FBI requested that Nigeria send up Kyari in August 2021.\n\nThe National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) arrested Kyari and others on Monday for alleged ties to an international narcotics syndicate.\n\nThe Police Service Commission (PSC) suspended the policemen charged with links to an international narcotics syndicate on Thursday.\n\n\u201cDCP Abba Kyari, who was under suspension previous to this allegation, shall stay on suspension,\u201d the PSC wrote.\n\nThe statements Kyari made to undercover officers probing the cocaine seizure were previously published by the anti-narcotics agency.\n\nOhanaeze, in a statement given to DAILY POST on Sunday by its Secretary-General, Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro, reacted to the situation by advising the FG not to allow Kyari to remain in Nigeria following his recent arrest by the NDLEA.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cOhanaeze Ndigbo worldwide has warned that the suspended head of IRT, DCP Abba Kyari should never be allowed to remain in Nigeria with his recent arrest by NDLEA, with overwhelming evidence of complicity in drugs-related cases.\n\n\u201cRather than keeping him here in Nigeria, he should be extradited to the United States to face the allegations from FBI over the hushpuppi scandal and criminal activities.\n\n\u201cDCP Abba Kyari should be allowed to face his crimes in the United States. This will serve as a deterrent to others; this will bolster the fight against corruption.\n\n\u201cThe activities of suspended DCP Abba Kyari in Imo State and the Southeast was dubious and controversial based on the fact that those who were allegedly killed by Abba Kyari, should have been allowed to face the consequences of their actions in any competent court of jurisdiction.\n\n\u201cThe overflow of corpses of Igbo youths at the FMC Owerri and other places in the South-East was the alleged handiwork of IRT team, led by Kyari; no wonder that nemesis caught up with Abba Kyari so quickly. His appetite for the looting of his suspect\u2019s belongings and cash is second to none; that\u2019s why he was obsessed with covetousness and greed to the point of being unaware of the video recording that was used by the NDLEA against him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence that IPOB was after Abba Kyari. Nemesis is hunting Kyari. Nigerians want a thorough investigation of the alleged criminal indictment of Abba Kyari and subsequent extradition to the United States.\u201d",

Gen. Mohammed Buba Marwa (retired) directed that both the cash and the suspect in custody be transferred to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) for further investigation.\n\nMeanwhile, a nursing mother, Mrs. Rashidat Adebayo, has again been arrested in Offa, Kwara State with assorted drugs such as Tramadol, Swinol, Diazepam, and Pentazocine injection ampules.\n\nThis is coming barely three weeks after NDLEA operatives granted the 38-year-old mother administrative bail following her arrest for dealing in illicit drugs.\n\nSimilarly, in Adamawa State, two drug dealers \u2013 Sani Isa (aka Bilaz) and Bala Yerima \u2013 were nabbed in Hong with 239 blocks of Cannabis Sativa weighing 209kg, just as operatives of the Bauchi state Command have intercepted a truck marked FFF 422 XB coming from Lagos to Maiduguri, at Azare, Bauchi.\n\nA total of 164.8kg of Cannabis Sativa concealed in peak milk cartons was recovered from the truck.\n\nReacting to the arrest, Marwa hailed the officers and men of the FCT Command for their vigilance and preventing counterfeit $4.7 million from going into the streets.\n\nHe equally admonished them and their counterparts in Adamawa, Kwara, Bauchi, and others across the country not to rest on their oars.",

Both sides denied doing anything to disturb the peace or to illegally influence the outcome of the poll.\n\nNotwithstanding the disagreement, the minister asked members of the party in the state loyal to him to conduct themselves in a peaceful matter throughout the exercise.\n\nWhile the primary was in progress, the faction of the APC loyal to the minister condemned it.\n\nIn a statement by its spokesman, Abiodun Agboola, the faction alleged widespread irregularities in the exercise conducted by the Osun APC Primary Election Committee led by Governor Abdulrasaq of Kwara State.\n\n\u201cThe Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrasaq led Osun APC Primary Election Committee should know that the primary lacks credibility and fairness,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cIt is necessary and important to inform the general public and Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrasaq led Osun APC Primary Election Committee of the ongoing irregularities in the conduct of the primary election of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the State of Osun.\n\n\u201cWe strongly condemn the conduct of the primary election because it is nothing but a sham with a fraudulent process to favour Governor Adegboyega Oyetola.

          "text": "Russia\u2019s strategic nuclear forces held exercises overseen by President Vladimir Putin on Saturday, and Washington accused Russian troops massed near Ukraine\u2019s border of advancing and being \u201cpoised to strike\u201d.\n\nWith Western fears of war rising, the White House said U.S President Joe Biden\u2019s national security team told him they still believed Russia could launch an attack in Ukraine \u201cat any time\u201d and he planned to convene his top advisers on Sunday to discuss the crisis.\n\nForeign ministers from the G7 group of rich nations said they had seen no evidence Russia is reducing its military activity in the area and remained \u201cgravely concerned\u201d about the situation.\n\nAfter Kyiv and Moscow traded accusations over new shelling near the border, France and Germany urged all or some of their citizens in Ukraine to leave. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Russian forces were beginning to \u201cuncoil and move closer\u201d to the border.\n\n\u201cWe hope he (Putin) steps back from the brink of conflict,\u201d Austin told a news conference in Lithuania, saying an invasion of Ukraine was not inevitable.\n\nRussia ordered the military build-up while demanding NATO prevent Ukraine from ever joining the alliance but says Western warnings that it is planning to invade Ukraine are hysterical and dangerous. Moscow says it is pulling back, but Washington and allies say the build-up is mounting.\n\nWashington and NATO say Moscow\u2019s main demands are non-starters, but in Ukraine fears are growing over Putin\u2019s plans.\n\nVenting his frustration at a security conference in Munich, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the global security architecture was \u201calmost broken\u201d. He urged the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, Germany and Turkey to meet to draw up new security guarantees for his country.\n\n\u201cThe rules that the world agreed on decades ago no longer work,\u201d Zelenskiy said. \u201cThey do not keep up with new threats \u2026 This is a cough syrup when you need a coronavirus vaccine.\u201d\n\nWorld Bank President David Malpass told Zelenskiy on Saturday the bank was readying funding to Ukraine of up to $350 million.\n\nThe Kremlin said Russia successfully test-launched hypersonic and cruise missiles at sea during the nuclear forces drills. Putin observed the exercises on screens with Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko from a \u201csituation centre\u201d.\n\nIn his most pointed prediction so far, Biden said on Friday he was convinced that Putin has made the decision to invade Ukraine in the coming days, and Austin said on Saturday the nuclear forces exercises were stoking concerns around the world.\n\n\u201cPresident Biden continues to monitor the evolving situation in Ukraine, and is being updated regularly about events on the ground by his national security team,\u201d White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement. \u201cThey reaffirmed that Russia could launch an attack against Ukraine at any time.\u201d\n\nG7 foreign ministers called on Russia to choose the path of diplomacy. \u201cAs a first step, we expect Russia to implement the announced reduction of its military activities along Ukraine\u2019s borders. We have seen no evidence of this reduction,\u201d they said in a statement.\n\nZelenskiy said he had an \u201curgent\u201d phone conversation with French President Emmanuel Macron and discussed possible ways of immediate de-escalation and political-diplomatic settlement. Macron is due to speak with Putin on Sunday.\n\nThe nuclear drills follow manoeuvres by Russia\u2019s armed forces in the past four months that have included a build-up of troops \u2014 estimated by the West to number 150,000 or more \u2014 to the north, east and south of Ukraine.\n\nNew helicopters and a battle group deployment of tanks, armoured personnel carriers and support equipment have been moved to sites in Russia near the border, according to U.S.-based Maxar Technologies, which tracks developments with satellite imagery.\n\nMoscow-based analysts said Saturday\u2019s exercises were aimed at sending a message to take Russia\u2019s demands seriously.\n\n\u201cIgnoring Russia\u2019s legitimate rights in this area adversely affects the stability not only on the European continent, but also in the world,\u201d Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was quoted by his ministry as telling his French counterpart by phone.\n\nA NATO official said the alliance relocated staff from Kyiv to the western city of Lviv and to Brussels for safety reasons. The United States and other countries have moved diplomats to Lviv.\n\nSHELLING ALLEGATIONS\n\nRussian-backed rebels seized a swathe of eastern Ukraine and Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Kyiv says more than 14,000 people have been killed in the conflict in the east.\n\nSeparatist leaders in eastern Ukraine have declared a full military mobilisation after ordering women and children to evacuate to Russia, citing the threat of an imminent attack by Ukrainian forces, which Kyiv denied.\n\nKyiv and Western leaders say the mobilisation, evacuation and increased shelling are part of a Russian plan to create a pretext for an invasion.\n\nRussia\u2019s FSB security service said two shells landed on Russian territory near the border, Russia\u2019s Tass news agency reported.\n\nUkraine\u2019s military accused Russia of faking pictures of shells to make out they were Ukrainian, and said mercenaries had arrived in separatist-held eastern Ukraine to stage provocations in collaboration with Russian special forces.\n\nUkraine\u2019s foreign minister demanded an independent international investigation of the alleged incidents and the military said two soldiers had been killed in shelling by pro-Russian separatists in east Ukraine.\n\nThe two Russian-backed, self-proclaimed republics in Ukraine\u2019s Donetsk and Luhansk regions were hit by more than 1,400 explosions on Friday, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said. And almost 2,000 ceasefire violations were registered in the area by OSCE monitors on Saturday, a diplomatic source told Reuters. read more\n\nMultiple explosions were heard overnight into Sunday in the centre of the separatist-controlled city of Donetsk, a Reuters reporter said. The blasts\u2019 origin was not clear. There was no immediate comment from separatist authorities or Kyiv.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really scary. I\u2019ve taken everything I could carry,\u201d said Tatyana, 30, who was boarding a bus with her 4-year-old daughter.\n\nRussian news agencies said 10,000 evacuees had arrived in Russia.

          "title": "Ukraine\u2019s Zelenskyy Calls on Putin to Meet as Tensions Soar",
          "text": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, facing a sharp spike in violence in and around territory held by Russia-backed rebels and increasingly dire warnings that Russia plans to invade, on Saturday called for Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet him and seek resolution to the crisis.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the president of the Russian Federation wants, so I am proposing a meeting,\u201d Zelenskyy said at the Munich Security Conference, where he also met with U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris. Zelenskyy said Russia could pick the location for the talks.\n\n\u201cUkraine will continue to follow only the diplomatic path for the sake of a peaceful settlement.\u201d\n\nThere was no immediate response from the Kremlin.\n\nZelenskyy spoke hours after separatist leaders in eastern Ukraine ordered a full military mobilization on Saturday while Western leaders made increasingly dire warnings that a Russian invasion of its neighbor appeared imminent.\n\nIn new signs of fears that a war could start within days, Germany and Austria told their citizens to leave Ukraine. German air carrier Lufthansa canceled flights to the capital, Kyiv, and to Odessa, a Black Sea port that could be a key target in an invasion.NATO\u2019s liaison office in Kyiv said it was relocating staff to Brussels and to the western Ukraine city of Lviv. Meanwhile, top Ukrainian military officials came under a shelling attack during a tour of the front of the nearly eight-year separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe officials fled to a bomb shelter before hustling from the area, according to an Associated Press journalist who was on the tour.Violence in eastern Ukraine has spiked in recent days as Ukraine and the two regions held by the rebels each accused the other of escalation. Russia on Saturday said at least two shells fired from a government-held part of eastern Ukraine landed across the border, but Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba dismissed that claim as \u201ca fake statement.\u201dSporadic violence has broken out for years along the line separating Ukrainian forces from the Russia-backed rebels, but the recent shelling and bombing spike could set off a full-scale war.The United States and many European countries have alleged for months that Russia, which has moved about 150,000 troops near the Ukrainian border, is trying to create pretexts to invade.\u201cThey are uncoiling and are now poised to strike,\u201d U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Saturday during a visit to Lithuania.Harris opened her meeting with Zelenskyy by saying the world was at \u201ca decisive moment in history.\u201dEarlier Saturday, Denis Pushilin, the head of the pro-Russia separatist government in Ukraine\u2019s Donetsk region, cited an \u201cimmediate threat of aggression\u201d from Ukrainian forces in his announcement. Ukrainian officials vehemently denied having plans to take rebel-controlled areas by force.\u201cI appeal to all the men in the republic who can hold weapons to defend their families, their children, wives, mothers,\u201d Pushilin said. \u201dTogether we will achieve the coveted victory that we all need.\u201dA similar statement followed from his counterpart in the Luhansk region. On Friday, the rebels began evacuating civilians to Russia with an announcement that appeared to be part of their and Moscow\u2019s efforts to paint Ukraine as the aggressor.German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the evacuation orders could be a tactic to provide the spark for a broader attack.\u201cTo say it very clearly, Ukraine did not give any grounds for the evacuation that was ordered yesterday,\u201d she said. \u201cThose are the facts on the ground. We must not allow supposed reasons for war to be constructed out of hot air.\u201dU.S. President Joe Biden said late Friday that based on the latest American intelligence, he was now \u201cconvinced\u201d that Russian President Vladimir Putin has decided to invade Ukraine and assault the capital.\u201cAs of this moment, I\u2019m convinced he\u2019s made the decision,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe have reason to believe that.\u201d He reiterated that the assault could occur in the \u201ccoming days.\u201dBiden was briefed on Harris\u2019 meetings in Munich and has been getting regular updates on the Ukraine situation, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement Saturday. Biden will discuss Ukraine during a meeting with his National Security Council on Sunday, she said.Meanwhile, Russia conducted massive nuclear drills on Saturday. The Kremlin said Putin, who pledged to protect Russia\u2019s national interests against what it sees as encroaching Western threats, was watching the drills together with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko from the situation room.Notably, the planned exercise involves the Crimea-based Black Sea Fleet. Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula after seizing it from Ukraine in 2014. .Underscoring the West\u2019s concerns of an imminent invasion, a U.S. defense official said an estimated 40% to 50% of the ground forces deployed in the vicinity of the Ukrainian border have moved into attack positions closer to the border.The shift has been underway for about a week, other officials have said, and does not necessarily mean Putin has decided to begin an invasion. The defense official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal U.S. military assessments.The official also said the number of Russian ground units known as battalion tactical groups in the border area had grown to as many as 125, up from 83 two weeks ago. Each group has 750 to 1,000 soldiers.Lines of communication between Moscow and the West remain open: the American and Russian defense chiefs spoke Friday. French President Emmanuel Macron scheduled a phone call with Putin on Sunday. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov agreed to meet next week.Immediate worries focused on eastern Ukraine, where Ukrainian forces have been fighting the pro-Russia rebels since 2014 in a conflict that has killed some 14,000 people. Violations of a 2015 ceasefire agreement, including shelling and shooting along the line of contact, have been common.A car bomb exploded in the center of the rebel-controlled city of Donetsk on Friday. Adding to the tensions, two explosions shook the rebel-controlled city of Luhansk early Saturday. No injuries were reported in the incidents.Ukraine\u2019s military said two of its soldiers died in firing from the rebel side on Saturday.By Saturday morning, the separatists in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions, which form Ukraine\u2019s industrial heartland known as the Donbas, said that thousands of residents of the rebel-controlled areas had been evacuated to Russia.Russia has issued about 700,000 passports to residents of the rebel-held territories. Claims that Russian citizens are being endangered might be used as justification for military action.Pushilin, the head of the Donetsk rebel government, alleged in a video statement that Ukraine was going to order an imminent offensive in the area.Metadata from two videos posted by the separatists announcing the evacuation show that the files were created two days ago, the AP confirmed. U.S. authorities have alleged that the Kremlin\u2019s effort to come up with an invasion pretext could include staged, prerecorded videos.Authorities in Russia\u2019s Rostov region, which borders eastern Ukraine, declared a state of emergency because of the influx of evacuees. Media reports on Saturday described chaos at some of the camps assigned to accommodate the people from eastern Ukraine. The reports said there were long lines of buses and hundreds of people waiting in the cold for hours on end to be housed without access to food or bathroom facilities.Putin ordered the Russian government to offer 10,000 rubles (about $130) to each evacuee, an amount equivalent to about half of an average monthly salary in eastern Ukraine.___",
