          "title": "APC screens Al-Makura, Yari, Adamu, others today, aspirants dump consensus",
          "text": "The All Progressives Congress will today screen aspirants vying for the position of its national chairman and others at its national headquarters in Abuja.\n\nThe aspirants visited the party headquarters on Friday to submit their nomination forms. They also stated that no one had told them about any arrangement for a consensus candidate and so they would all be testing their strengths at the Eagle Square next Saturday.\n\nThe Senator representing Niger East Senatorial District, Sani Musa, confirmed that he remained in the race because no one, including the party\u2019s leadership, notified him of any consensus arrangement.\n\nThe lawmaker disclosed this while fielding questions from journalists at the party\u2019s national secretariat in Abuja shortly after he submitted his nomination form ahead of the March 26 national convention.\n\nSaturday PUNCH observed that Musa was not the only aspirant who visited Buhari House. Other national chairmanship aspirants who returned their nomination forms include a former governor of Nasarawa State, Tanko Al-Makura, former governor of Benue State, George Akume, another former governor of Nasarawa State, Abdullahi Adamu, Saliu Mustapha and Mohammed Etsu.\n\nTwo aspirants vying for the office of National Deputy Chairman (North), Sunny Moniedafe and Abubakar Girer as well as a Women Leader hopeful, Mary Eta, also returned their forms.\n\nOthers who have purchased forms include former Governor Abdullahi Adamu of Nasarawa State and a former Governor of Zamfara State, Abdul\u2019Aziz Yari.\n\nAsked why he was in the race despite earlier reports that the party would adopt consensus to choose a new chairman, Musa said, \u201cWhy did the party sell forms to us? You (APC) sold forms to us. And as far as I\u2019m concerned, there\u2019s never been anybody that officially contacted me or any other aspirants. Nobody! And the spokesperson for Mr President, Femi Adesina, had said that there is no endorsement.\n\n\u201cSo, we want a vibrant leadership. We want leadership that will change the status quo. I want the endorsement of 43 million APC members. That is what I need. The APC needs a leader that will be able to build concessions between all dividing organs.\n\n\u201cThat is what I\u2019m bringing to APC. And APC will not be dependent on anybody to fund it. With the number of 43 million members, we have no business going cap in hand to beg anybody for money. That is what I\u2019m bringing to APC.\u201d\n\nAl-Makura who stormed the party\u2019s national secretariat in a boisterous procession comprising women and several People with Disabilities noted that he would ensure full representation in the party. He also noted that though 70, he remains a youth at heart.\n\nHe said \u201cMy motivation is for national unity and cohesion. What I am going to do is to fast track or preside over this process, because there\u2019ll be no government if there is no party, a formidable party.\u201d\n\nOn consensus, the chairmanship hopeful said \u201cThe best option is that which allows franchise and permission for everyone to participate in the exercise. I will support an open-door policy, internal party democracy with the full participation of members so that they will have a sense of belonging and determine the fate and direction of the party.\u201d\n\nMoniedafe told journalists that he is in the race to \u201cbalance\u201d the equation of the party in terms of religious representation.\n\nHe noted that \u201cI am coming as Deputy National chairman to balance the religious agenda because all over Nigeria, people see the APC as a Muslim party. I am a Christian, a pastor in my church. I stepped down, obeyed my party and came to balance the equation of Muslims and Christians in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve planned for this thing, I have what it takes and I\u2019m confident that when we get there, we\u2019ll start things working right. This party deserves more than we\u2019re getting right now, with due respect.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Saliu Mustapha said his chairmanship would ensure the actualisation of the global sustainability goals, especially inclusion.\n\n\u201cThis is not about title, but it is about coming to add value, serving the party and moving the party forward and to meet up with the millennium and global challenges of advanced politics. That is why for us in this team, we want to come and do Progressive and smart politics and proactive politics. We want to add value in many areas.\u201d\n\nIn a related development, a group of APC youths Friday in Abuja purchased a nomination form for the party\u2019s spokesperson, Ismaeel Ahmed, who is vying for the office of National Organising Secretary.\n\nThe gesture came as a birthday gift to the aspirant who has served as a youth representative in the Buni-led Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee.\n\nThe CECPC chairman had on Thursday endorsed the arrangement that zoned the office of National Organising Secretary to the North-West where Ahmed comes from.\n\nMeanwhile, a former Director-General of the Progressive Governors Forum, Salihu Lukman, has decried a plot to foist leaders from the defunct Congress for Progressive Change on the party.\n\nThis is as he warned that such a move could spell doom for the governing party.\n\nIn a statement he signed on Friday in Abuja, titled \u2018Consensus vs Open Contest in APC\u2019, Lukman cautioned political associates against undermining the authority of the President who is the leader of the party.\n\nHe said part of the sentiment deployed by the London lobby team of Abubakar Malami, Hadi Sirika, Adamu Adamu and Farouk Aliyu was to ensure that the old Congress for Progressives Change leaders \u201cis not \u2018marginalised\u2019 in the new APC leadership to emerge from the March 26 National Convention.\u201d\n\nLukman accused the group of desperately \u201cpushing the President to anoint people like Aliyu as consensus candidates, these \u2018CPC lobbyists\u2019 have inadvertently created situations whereby there is the strong likelihood for an open contest in APC during the March 26 National Convention.\n\nOmisore picks national secretary form\n\nMeanwhile, a former Deputy Governor of Osun State, Senator Iyiola Omisore, has indicated interest to contest for the post of the National Secretary of the party.\n\nConfirming the development in a chat with Saturday PUNCH, Commissioner for Political Affairs and Intergovernmental Relations, Taiwo Akeju, said Governor Adegboyega Oyetola and other stakeholders of the ruling party in Osun state were in support of Omisore\u2019s ambition.\n\nA statement titled \u2018New era, as Senator Iyiola Omisore submits his nomination form for the national secretary of All Progressives Congress,\u2019 personally signed by Omisore, obtained in Osogbo, said the ex-federal parliamentarian would ensure transparent and inclusive party administration if elected.\n\nCommenting further, Akeju, who is an associate of Omisore said the two-term Senator who represented Osun East in the Senate had picked a form to contest for the post.\n\nHe said, \u201cGovernor Oyetola is supporting him (Omisore) and other party stakeholders are also in support of this project. He has picked the form.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Bianca Ojukwu\n\nBy David Royal\n\n\n\nBianca Ojukwu, wife of Odumegwu-Ojukwu has narrated her own side of the incident that transpired between her and the former First Lady of Anambra State, Ebele Obiano on Thursday during the inauguration ceremoney of Charles Soludo as the governor of the state.\n\nNarrating the story in a statement on Friday, the former beauty queen, Bianca stated that she was stunned by the stench of whisky in Ebele\u2019s breath which showed that she was \u201cclearly intoxicated\u201d, drunk when she verbally attacked her.\n\nBianca said \u201cShe arrived some one-and-a-half hours later while the ceremony was on. I didn\u2019t pay any particular attention to her arrival. Surprisingly, she then walked towards me and I thought she was coming to greet me. Instead, when she got to where I was seated, she verbally attacked me with her voiced raised, taunting me and asking me what I was there to do and using unprintable vile language.\n\n\u201cShe asked if I had come to celebrate their last day in office. But I ignored her completely. Then, she kept aggressively putting her hands on my shoulders and shouting. While I ignored her verbal onslaught, as advised by those sitting around me, I requested twice that she refrained from touching me with her hands.\n\n\u201cShe proceeded to do so yet again and went further to grab at my headtie, which she attempted unsuccessfully to remove. This very act is considered a sacrilege to a titled matriarch such as myself in Igbo culture. It was at this point that I stood up to defend myself and gave her a dirty slap to stop her from attacking me. As she made towards me, I then pulled away her wig.\n\n\u201cShe held on to her wig with her two hands and tried to take the wig away from me. The former APGA chairman, Umeh, told her to leave me and told engaged APGA members that had gathered at the spot to lead her away , which they did and took her to the seat next to her husband Chief Willie Obiano who sat through the entire episode completely speechless.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, Bianca said what struck her through the whole episode was the fact that Obiano\u2019s wife was clearly intoxicated and she was stunned by the stench of whisky in her breath at such an early hour of the day.\n\n\u201cHow could a first lady be so drunk and proceeded to turn up in that state at an Inauguration ceremony that began at 9 am? It is unfortunate that she threw all caution to the wind and imported this kind of melodrama to a state ceremony.\n\n\u201cThis was highly embarrassing to the Governor who left the venue almost immediately, taking her along with him. Luckily, this did not disrupt the proceedings and I stayed back to witness the ceremony to the end after which we were treated to a sumptuous reception at the Government House.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "\u2026Express solidarity with Ukraine\n\nEmma Ujah, Abuja Bureau Chief\n\nThe Heads of International Financial Institutions, yesterday, said that the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has led to killings of innocent civilians, destruction of civilian infrastructure, displacement of millions of people, with negative impacts on global economy, was horrifying, while declaring solidarity with Ukraine.\n\nTheir position was contained in a statement by Odile Renaud-Basso, President of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), Werner Hoyer, President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), Carlo Monticelli, Governor of the Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB), Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and David Malpass, President of the World Bank Group (WBG).\n\nThey said, \u201cWe, the heads of the EBRD, EIB, CEB, IMF, and WBG, met today to discuss impacts on the global economy of the ongoing war in Ukraine and our respective and collective response to this crisis.\n\n\u201cWe are horrified and deeply concerned about the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing crisis. The attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure are causing tremendous suffering, creating massive population displacements, threatening international peace and security, and endangering basic social and economic needs for people around the world.\n\n\u201cIn addition to the devastating human catastrophe unfolding in Ukraine, the war is disrupting livelihoods throughout the region and beyond. The impacts will be extensive\u2014from reduced energy and food supplies, to increases in prices and poverty and a massive undertaking of Ukraine\u2019s reconstruction, all of which will hamper the post-pandemic recovery around the world.\n\n\u201cThe entire global economy will feel the effects of the crisis through slower growth, trade disruptions, and steeper inflation, harming especially the poorest and most vulnerable.\n\n\u201cHigher prices for commodities like food and energy will push inflation up further. Countries, particularly those neighboring Ukraine will suffer disruptions in trade, supply chains and remittances as well as surges in refugee flows. Reduced confidence and higher investor uncertainty will impact asset prices, tighten financial conditions, and could even generate capital outflows from emerging markets.\n\n\u201cOur institutions have responded with emergency support to Ukraine and its neighbors.\n\n\u201cThe EBRD has approved a \u201cWar on Ukraine \u2013 EBRD Resilience Package\u201d, initially sized at EUR 2 billion, to respond to the immediate needs of the people affected by the war and \u2013 when conditions permit \u2013 support the substantial reconstruction of Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThe EIB has prepared an emergency solidarity package for Ukraine of EUR 2 billion, including the provision of EUR 668 million in immediate liquidity assistance to the Ukrainian authorities.\n\n\u201cThe CEB, according to its membership and special social mandate, has provided emergency grants to Ukraine\u2019s neighboring countries to cover immediate needs of refugees, including transportation and orientation. The CEB stands ready to also provide flexible, fast-disbursing loans to address the significant financial needs of neighboring and other countries hosting large inflow of refugees, while remaining focused on the social sector.\n\n\u201c\u201cThe IMF disbursed emergency assistance of US$1.4 billion to Ukraine on March 9 under the Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) to help meet urgent financing needs including to mitigate the economic impact of the war. The Fund stands ready to support neighboring and other countries affected by the spillovers of the war through all its relevant instruments.\n\n\u201cThe World Bank Group has already mobilized more than US$925 million for Ukraine, including fast-disbursing budget support to help the government provide critical services to Ukrainian people, of which US$350 million has been disbursed.\n\n\u201cThis financing is part of a US$3 billion package of support planned for Ukraine in the coming months\n\n\u201cWe acknowledge the importance of working together to coordinate our respective responses to support Ukraine and neighbors on the financing and policy fronts and maximize impact on the ground. We are committed to strengthening international cooperation and solidarity in the face of this enormous challenge.\u201d",

Willie Obiano, Ebelechukwu and Mrs Bianca Ojukwu engaged in a physical combat during the event.\n\nDAILY POST gathered that dignitaries including Obiano were seated when Mrs Obiano stepped in and moved to the front row where Bianca was seated before the fight began, and video footage shows the Ojukwu\u2019s widow slapping the ex-Governor\u2019s wife.\n\nThe action drew the attention of security agents and some personalities who pulled Mrs Obiano off the hold of Bianca who was visibly shocked at the action.\n\nReacting to the drama, Reno Omokri recalled that Ojukwu had once slapped Umaru Dikko, during Sani Abacha Constitutional Conference in 1995.\n\n\u201cNigerians have a short memory.

          "text": "Wife of late Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, Bianca, has explained why she slapped immediate past Anambra First Lady, Ebele Obiano on Thursday afternoon in Awka, the Anambra State capital.\n\nThe two women had engaged in a public fight at the inauguration ceremony of Governor Charles Soludo, an incident that momentarily disrupted the swearing-in ceremony.\n\nSetting the records straight on Friday, Mrs. Ojukwu said she slapped Ebele Obiano to defend herself after the wife of the former Governor attempted to remove her headgear in public.\n\nThe former Ambassador to Spain explained that she ignored several provocative verbal and physical assaults from the former first lady who she alleged was intoxicated by alcohol.\n\nMrs Ojukwu, who\u2019s also a member of Board of Trustees (BOT), All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) wrote: \u201cAs the inaugural ceremonies for Prof Charles Soludo and his deputy began and all guests were seated, the Former First Lady of Anambra State, Mrs Ebele Obiano, was noticeably absent. She then arrived some one-and-a-half hours later while the ceremony was on. I didn\u2019t pay any particular attention to her arrival.\n\n\u201cSurprisingly, she then walked towards me and I thought she was coming to greet me. Instead, when she got to where I was seated, she verbally attacked me with her voice raised, taunting me and asking me what I was there to do and using unprintable vile language.\n\n\u201cShe asked if I had come to celebrate their last day in office. But I ignored her completely. Then, she kept aggressively putting her hands on my shoulders and shouting. While I ignored her verbal onslaught, as advised by those sitting around me, I requested twice that she refrained from touching me with her hands.\n\n\u201cShe proceeded to do so yet again and went further to grab at my headtie, which she attempted unsuccessfully to remove. This very act is considered a sacrilege to a titled matriarch such as myself in Igbo culture.\n\n\u201cIt was at this point that I stood up to defend myself and gave her a dirty slap to stop her from attacking me. As she made towards me, I then pulled away her wig. She held on to her wig with her two hands and tried to take the wig away from me.\n\n\u201cThe former APGA chairman, Umeh (Chief Victor Umeh), told her to leave me and told engaged APGA members that had gathered at the spot to lead her away, which they did and took her to the seat next to her husband Chief Willie Obiano who sat through the entire episode completely speechless.\n\n\u201cWhat struck me through the whole episode was the fact that she was clearly intoxicated. I was stunned by the stench of whisky in her breath at such an early hour of the day. How could a first lady be so drunk and proceeded to turn up in that state at an Inauguration ceremony that began at 9 am?\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that she threw all caution to the wind and imported this kind of melodrama to a state ceremony. This was highly embarrassing to the Governor who left the venue almost immediately, taking her along with him.\n\n\u201cLuckily, this did not disrupt the proceedings and I stayed back to witness the ceremony to the end after which we were treated to a sumptuous reception at the Government House.\u201d",

          "text": "*Obiano\u2019s wife\u2019s conduct shameful, says Obi of Awka\n\n*Monarch gives former first lady seven days to publicly apologise to entire Igbo people or face serious consequences\n\nFormer Nigerian Ambassador to Spain, Ambassador Bianca Odimegwu- Ojukwu, has given her own account of the fight between her and the wife of immediate past governor of Anambra, Ebere Obiano, at the inauguration of Professor Chukwuma Soludo as governor.\n\nThe two women had engaged in a fight at the venue of Soludo\u2019s inauguration as governor in Awka on Thursday when Mrs Obiano walked up to Mrs Ojukwu where she was seated. Mrs Ojukwu, wife of the late Igbo leader, Chief Emeka Odimegwu-Ojukwu, was later seen in a trending video slapping her before they were separated by guests at the venue.\n\nThe incident which disrupted the inauguration ceremony for some few minutes attracted reactions from Nigerians, including the Obi of Awka Ancient Kingdom, the Eze Uzu III of Awka, Dr Austin Ndigwe, who described Obiano\u2019s wife\u2019s conduct as shameful.\n\nGiving her own account of the incident, in a statement sent to THISDAY, Mrs Ojukwu said she had initially ignored Mrs Obiano\u2019s verbal onslaught but later gave the former Anambra first lady \u201ca dirty slap\u201d in self defence when she attempted to remove her head-tie, an action she said was considered \u201ca sacrilege to a titled matriarch such as myself in Igbo culture.\u201d\n\nMrs Ojukwu insinuated that Mrs Obiano\u2019s may have acted under the influence of alcohol, saying \u201cWhat struck me through the whole episode was the fact that she was clearly intoxicated. I was stunned by the stench of whisky in her breath at such an early hour of the day. How could a first lady be so drunk and proceeded to turn up in that state at an Inauguration ceremony that began at 9am?\u201dIn the statement, Mrs Ojukwu said:\n\n\u201cAs the inaugural ceremonies for Prof Charles Soludo and his deputy began and all guests were seated, the Former First Lady of Anambra State, Mrs Ebele Obiano, was noticeably absent. She then arrived some one-and-a-half hours later while the ceremony was on. I didn\u2019t pay any particular attention to her arrival.\n\n\u201cSurprisingly, she then walked towards me and I thought she was coming to greet me. Instead, when she got to where I was seated, she verbally attacked me with her voiced raised, taunting me and asking me what I was there to do and using unprintable vile language.\n\n\u201cShe asked if I had come to celebrate their last day in office. But I ignored her completely. Then, she kept aggressively putting her hands on my shoulders and shouting. While I ignored her verbal onslaught, as advised by those sitting around me, I requested twice that she refrained from touching me with her hands. She proceeded to do so yet again and went further to grab at my head-tie, which she attempted unsuccessfully to remove. This very act is considered a sacrilege to a titled matriarch such as myself in Igbo culture. It was at this point that I stood up to defend myself and gave her a dirty slap to stop her from attacking me.\n\n\u201cAs she made towards me, I then pulled away her wig. She held on to her wig with her two hands and tried to take the wig away from me. The former APGA chairman, Umeh, told her to leave me and told APGA members that had gathered at the spot to lead her away, which they did and took her to the seat next to her husband Chief Willie Obiano who sat through the entire episode completely speechless.\n\n\u201cWhat struck me through the whole episode was the fact that she was clearly intoxicated. I was stunned by the stench of whisky in her breath at such an early hour of the day. How could a first lady be so drunk and proceeded to turn up in that state at an Inauguration ceremony that began at 9am?\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that she threw all caution to the wind and imported this kind of melodrama to a state ceremony. This was highly embarrassing to the Governor who left the venue almost immediately, taking her along with him. Luckily, this did not disrupt the proceedings and I stayed back to witness the ceremony to the end after which we were treated to a sumptuous reception at the Government House.\u201d\n\nReacting to the incident, the Obi of Awka Ancient Kingdom, Dr Austin Ndigwe, described Obiano\u2019s wife conduct at the inauguration as shameful. He consequently gave her seven days to apologise to the entire Igbo people or face serious consequences \u201cover her sacriligious action against the symbol of Igbo unity, Bianca Odumegwu- Ojukwu.\u201d\n\nThe monarch also said Mrs Obiano should tender unreserved apology to the Governor Soludo for her disgraceful conduct during his inauguration, and to the chief judge of the state who was conducting the swearing in \u201cwhen she descended so low like a mad dog.\u201d\n\nThe Obi of Awka\u2019s statement read:\n\n\u201cBianca told me after the incident that what angered her was that Ebere called her unprintable names including prostitute and queried her presence at the swearing in ceremony.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, this grave sin was committed in the land of Awka which is known for peace and unity. Therefore, as the traditional ruler of the people and chief custodian of our culture I am under obligation to perform some sacrifices to cleanse our land of this filth and pollution and to appease the gods.\n\n\u201cA study of the scenario as the incident occurred showed that her action was deliberate because as it were she came very much prepared to disrupt the swearing in ceremony . And It is troubling that she began her ignoble actions when the chief judge stood up to swear in the new governor as she came and sat on his seat, a clear show of shame and lack of respect.\n\n\u201cEven when she was informed that the seat was for the chief judge, she refused to vacate the seat, only for her to stand up and move towards the direction of Bianca Ojukwu to start pouring venom on her.\n\n\u201cIt must be pointed out that Bianca was not at that ceremony as Bianca but there as a direct representative of our late father and leader , Chief Odumegwu Ojukwu, her late husband who pioneered the All progressives Grand Alliance, APGA and the shining symbol of Igbo unity and solidarity. Ojukwu sacrificed all he had for the Igbos to survive, so wherever Bianca goes , she represents and carries the aspirations and personage of the entire Igbo race. Therefore, Ebere\u2019s action of casting aspersion on her is an affront on the entire Igbo people. It was indeed on Odumegwu Ojukwu and not on Bianca as a person. This is an insult on Igbo and it must not go unpunished.\n\n\u201cEbere should realize that this same APGA on whose platform she and her husband have benefitted immensely throughout these eight years was floated when they were not even in the country and they never contributed to its formation.\n\n\u201cIt is on record that I took Obiano and his wife, Ebere to Bianca Ojukwu where they knelt down while seeking the party\u2019s governorship ticket. Bianca endorsed Obiano and called on all APGA members including then Governor Peter Obi to support him.\n\n\u201cIt is the same Bianca that Ebere has now publicly insulted. This is a taboo against the tradition of the Awka people and the entire Igbo race who are known for respect and peaceful coexistence.\n\n\u201cIt should be noted that Mrs Obiano and the husband Willie Obiano who used the name and pictures of Ojukwu in their campaign T shirts to win election via the endorsement of his wife Bianca never met Ojukwu or discussed with him while he was alive.\n\n\u201cThe same ungrateful attitude was what Obiano and Ebere metted out to Prince Arthur Eze who financed the registration and establishment of APGA as a political party.\n\n\u201cThroughout their eight year tenure, Obiano never showed respect to Prince Eze. This is an indication that Obiano and his wife are pathological ingrates.\n\n\u201cThis time they have gone too far. Igbos are angry. Enough Is enough, this is the last time that this kind of disgraceful and shameful act against Binaca Ojukwu would even be imagined or tolerated from anybody, no matter how highly placed.\n\n\u201cIgbos and non Igbos from various parts of the country and beyond have been calling to express their shock and anger over the incident and as the custodian of our people\u2019s tradition it is incumbent on me to uphold the customs of our land. Ojukwu\u2019s personage as represented by Bianca can never be denigrated!\n\n\u201cIt is shameful that someone who has been first lady of a state can descend so low. Her conduct shows that she lacks proper training and it shows that she has no respect for constituted authority and even her husband, Former Governor Obiano. \u201cMrs Ebere Obiano has only 7 days to apologise as demanded and directed or face serous consequences.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*Insists he transferred power to Niger governor to act in his stead\n\n*El Rufai: I\u2019m done with this charade unless concrete, honest steps are taken to implement agreed plans\n\n*Akpanudoedehe absent at Yobe gov\u2019s first meeting since return\n\nAdedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nChairman, Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of All Progressives Congress (APC) and governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, has denied the alleged disbandment of the convention sub-committees inaugurated by the governor of Niger State, Abubakar Bello, while acting as the chairman of the party.\n\n\n\nInstead, Buni said he would take responsibility for all the actions taken on his behalf. He noted, for the record, that he properly transferred power to his Niger State counterpart to act in his stead while he was away on medical grounds.\n\n\n\nHowever, in a shocking turn of events, Kaduna State Governor, Malam Nasir El-Rufai, yesterday, described what was going on in the governing APC as a charade and said he was done with the party. El-Rufai added that, with the situation of things, unity was impossible in APC.\n\n\n\nDespite boasting that he remained the secretary of CECPC, Senator John Akpanudoedehe was yesterday absent at a meeting convened by Buni with Bello\u2019s team. The meeting, held at the lodge of the Yobe State governor in Abuja, was his first since his return to the country.\n\n\n\nThe national secretary of the party, Akpanudoedehe, had in a statement earlier yesterday, claimed that Buni had approved the dissolution of the sub-convention committees put in place by Bello and reinstated the ones he set up before embarking on a medical trip to Dubai.\n\n\n\nThe statement read, \u201cThe Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) under the chairmanship of Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State, makes this press release to clarify the events of last week and reassure the membership and stakeholders of the party, as well as the Nigerian people, in general, that the governing party is crisis-free, strong and remains united in giving the country the transformative leadership and good governance, which she promised.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs approved by the chairman, HE. (Gov.) Mai Mala Buni, please, find below the list of chairmen, deputy chairmen and secretaries of the various sub-committees for the 2022 APC National Convention (as earlier published).\u201d\n\nBut Buni, in a rebuttal issued hours later, noted that the report about the alleged dissolution of the committees was not true.\n\n\n\nBuni\u2019s stated, \u201cThis is to bring to the notice of all stakeholders and members of the party that the purported suspension of some activities initiated and executed by the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee under the acting chairman and Niger State Governor, H.E. Muhammed Sani Bello, is not true.\u201d\n\nWhile insisting that all activities carried out in his absence remained valid and binding, Buni added, \u201cAll party stakeholders and members are hereby advised to disregard the previous statement discarding the activities of the committee under the leadership of the acting chairman.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Yobe governor recalled that he duly transmitted power to Bello to enable him undergo medical attention.\n\nBuni said regarding Bello, \u201cTherefore, all actions and measures taken by the committee under his leadership as acting chairman, remain effective. The party calls for support and understanding to move the party forward to a successful convention slated for March 26th, 2022.\u201d\n\nIt looked very probable that Akpanudoedehe might have lost his job as CECPC secretary, following the latest developments.\n\n\n\nIn a leaked notice dated March 8, 2022 and signed by a majority of the members of the caretaker committee, a vote of no confidence was passed on Akpanudoedehe .\n\nTitled \u201cMotion of no confidence on the Secretary of the Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee,\u201d the notice was signed by Senator Ken Nnamani, Governor Abubakar Bello, Senator Yusuf Abubakar Yusuf, Prof Tahir Mammah, Senator Abba Alli, Mr. David Lyon, Hon. Akinremi Ol\u00e0ide, Mrs Stella Okotete, Mr. Ismaeel Ahmad, and Dr James Lalu.\n\n\n\nMembers of the committee cited Article 17 Sub-section 5 of the APC constitution, which allowed a majority of any constituted ad-hoc committee of the party to pass a vote of no confidence on any member found wanting.\n\nThe notice read, \u201cWe, the members of the CECPC of the All Progressives Congress, duly constituted on the 25th of June, 2020 by the National Executive Committee of our great party, and sitting in our regular meeting on the 8th Day of March 2022, hereby unanimously resolve and adopt a motion of no confidence on the secretary of the Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the All Progressives Congress, and direct that from today henceforth, he steps aside as the secretary of the committee and stop forthwith all activities and duties associated with the office.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe majority of the caretaker committee members had pulled the rug off Akpanudoedehe\u2019s feet, though this was still subject to ratification by the National Convention or Congress.\n\nAccording to the party\u2019s constitution, where a vote of \u201cNo Confidence\u201d has been passed on an officer, the relevant party organ shall appoint another person to act in his place pending ratification by the National Convention or Congress.\n\n\n\nCorroborating Buni\u2019s position, spokesperson of the Bello leadershi Akpanudoedehe , and National Youth Leader, Mr. Ismaeel Ahmed, maintained that the final list of convention planning sub-committees signed by the Director of Organisation following the directive of the caretaker committee remained the final and authentic list.\n\nResponding to news making the rounds about the old list, Ahmed said the CECPC never approved the list and in fact, has no record of such list.\n\n\n\nAhmed, who has been briefing the media since the leadership crisis started, urged party members and the media to ignore the falsehood being spread by Akpanudoedehe.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe approved final list was the outcome of extensive consultations with all the stakeholders and follow-up at ensuring a decent list that is representative and inclusive, is put together and the same has since been issued.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe laughable action of sacked Senator Akpanudoedehe, is, therefore, considered an affront on the committee, which was duly constituted in line with provisions of the party\u2019s constitution and NEC of the party.\n\n\u201cSeeing the unpopular actions of Senator Akpanudoedehe, it is now obvious that he might be surreptitiously working to derail the party, cause internal friction capable of causing further crisis, but the committee against all his antics is determined to forge ahead and ensure the national convention holds as scheduled and approved devoid of any untoward actions.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn a curious development, El-Rufai, yesterday, expressed frustration with the wrangling in the ruling party. He told his colleague governors that he was done with the party, saying unity may be difficult to foster in APC as things currently stood.\n\nEl-Rufai, who addressed other APC governors in what seemed like a WhatsApp message in a group, alluded to betrayal, corruption, greed and other vices in the party, indicating they are the reason he opted out.\n\n\n\nThe messaged read, as shared, \u201cYour Excellences, unity is impossible to attain when leaders that are in office, because we consented to it, are consistently erratic, capricious, corrupt and deceitful.\n\n\u201cLoyalty begets loyalty.\n\n\u201cDeception begets mistrust.\n\n\u201cBetrayal begets revolt.\n\n\u201cIneptness, greed and selfishness threaten to destroy what has been built over nearly a decade, by those who didn\u2019t even know how this party was put together.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s restate that I am done with this charade, unless concrete, honest and transparent steps are taken to implement our agreed plans under a leadership we trusted.\n\n\u201cThank you. Nasir El-Rufai.\u201d\n\n\n\nNotwithstanding the developments, Akpanudoedehe reacted earlier today to his purported sack, saying he remains the secretary of the party. The secretary, in a brief chat with journalists, said, President Buhari\u2019s letter superseded everything.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s letter supersedes everything. I remain the secretary of the party,\u201d he maintained.\n\nEven at that, Akpanudoedehe was absent at a meeting at the instance of Buni with the Bello-led committee, who stood in while he was away, yesterday.\n\nThe meeting, which took place at Yobe State Governors\u2019 Lodge in Asokoro, had all members of the caretaker committee in attendance, except Akpanudoedehe.\n\n\n\nIt was gathered the Yobe State governor met with the chairman of the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF) and Governor of Kebbi State, Abubakar Atiku Bagudu, where he was briefed on the outcome of the forum\u2019s meeting on Wednesday night.\n\n\n\nSources close to CECPC said the Bello team met at the Niger State Governor\u2019s Lodge, which is a stone throw from Yobe\u2019s before proceeding to Yobe\u2019s Lodge with other members of the committee.\n\nSpeaking to journalists at his lodge, Buni applauded CECPC members on the level of preparations towards the national convention.\n\n\n\nHe stated, \u201cYou know that since I travelled, the party has not stopped. His Excellency (Governor of Niger State, H.E. Abubakar Sani Bello) has done very well in managing the affairs of the party. We are here to discuss the issues going forward.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are now at the finishing line in the preparations for our national convention, which is at hand, on March 26. We are putting heads together to achieve this task ahead. I want to emphasise that the March 26 national convention is sacrosanct.\u201d\n\n\n\nBuni further clarified that the visit was not a formal meeting of the CECPC, adding, \u201cYou know that this is not a formal meeting of the committee. These members of CECPC just came to welcome me back to the country and wish me well after returning from a medical trip outside the country.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn his part, Bello said, \u201cFor the past one week, I have been acting as the chairman of CECPC and what I can tell you is that we made lots of progress towards our national convention like we saw in the inauguration of the State Chairmen, adoption of some of the zoning formula, and some of the decisions of the CECPC taken before he (Governor Buni) left the country. I can tell you for free that in the last one week, we have ensured that we are good to go for the national convention.\u201d\n\nIn his intervention to the party crisis, a deputy national chairmanship aspirant, Mr. Sunny Monidafe, urged the members of the caretaker committee to resolve whatever differences they had for the sake of the party.\n\nMonidafe, who made the call after obtaining his form yesterday, said, \u201cI will want to appeal to both sides to keep calm. Whatever has happened, I don\u2019t want to know, I want to come in and reconcile party members.\u201d\n\nMonidafe boasted that he was the most qualified for the position of the national chairman, but had to abide by the zoning arrangement of the party.\n\nIn the same vein, a group under the auspices of Progressives Youth Movement, declared that the purported sack of the secretary would not stand.\n\nChairman of the group, Mr. Mustapha Audu, said there was no need to fight each other at this stage, saying all that is needed is to support the party and chairman to hold the convention.\n\nAudu stated, \u201cWe are here because there have been various media reports regarding the purported sack of the secretary of the party, Senator James John Akpanudoedehe. We are here to say the purported sack cannot stand.\n\n\u201cNine days to the national convention of the party, all hands should be on deck. We saw the letter this morning by our National Youth Leader, Barrister Ismaeel Ahmed. We believe we should be working hand-in-hand to deliver for the party and the convention.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*Declares anyone playing politics with security riding on a tiger\n\n*Bianca, ex-first lady went physical at ceremony, slaps Obiano\u2019s wife\n\n*EFCC arrests former gov at Lagos airport\n\nKingsley Nwezeh in Abuja and David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka\n\nFormer governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, yesterday, talked tough at his inauguration as the sixth elected governor of Anambra State, saying his administration would do everything humanly possible to end every form of criminality in the state.\n\n\n\nThe new Anambra governor, who read riot act to politicians, whose stock in trade was to play politics with security, however, warned that with the coming in of his administration, they would be riding a tiger doing so, especially on account of the increasing killings in the state.\n\n\n\nSoludo, who identified security as a major challenge to tackle head-on in his inaugural speech, drove into the arena to the awe of the people and guests, as he and his deputy, Gilbert Ibezim, arrived in vehicles made by local manufacturer, Innoson Vehicle Manufacturing (IVM).\n\n\n\nHe did not stop at that, he also walked his talk by appearing in his locally made Akwete dress, and a pair of shoes made in Ogbunike, Oyi Local Government area, in addition to ensuring that local foods were served as refreshments, including palmwine, abacha, ukwa and other native delicacies, as well as locally produced beers and malt drinks.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, what was to be a moment to cherish by the new governor soon evoked regrets after fight broke out between the immediate past first lady, Mrs Ebelechukwu Obiano, and wife of the late Dim Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, the eternal leader of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Ambassador Bianca Ojukwu.\n\nMrs. Obiano got up from her seat, walked up to Bianca and after a brief altercation muttered in hushed tones, resulting in slaps from the former beauty queen, fight ensued. It took security aides a while to restore order.\n\n\n\nEven more, the day did not end on a pleasant note for the immediate past governor of the state, Chief Willie Obiano, who was arrested last night at the Lagos airport by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), as he was about to jet out of the country.\n\nSoludo was sworn in by the Chief Judge of the state, Justice Onochie Anyachebelu at the Government House, Awka, in a low key ceremony.\n\n\n\nThe professor of econometrics, had opted for a low key function for his swearing in, while also rejecting plan by his predecessor to hold the event at the spacious newly completed International Convention Centre, Awka.\n\nSupporting his action, Soludo in his inaugural speech said, \u201cThe Anambra State Government will only patronise Made-in-Anambra products and services unless such goods or services are not currently made in Anambra, then made in Nigeria, Africa, etc, in that sequence.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen you see me in Innoson vehicles or in my Akwete dress with a pair of shoes made in Ogbunike/Nkwelle Ezunaka and Onitsha, we are making a statement.\n\n\u201cToday, the light refreshment to be served after this brief event is abacha from Umunze, ukwa from Isuofia, Anambra rice with ofe akwu, nkwu enu from Awgbu, ngwo from Awa and Oba, and malt and bottled water from Onitsha.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs part of our Made-in-Anambra, cultural renaissance and healthy living agenda, when you come to the Governor\u2019s Lodge or attend any state government\u2019s function, be sure to be served only Made-in- Anambra.\n\n\u201cWe want to go back to where M.I. Okpara stopped with the palm revolution and plant millions of palm trees. In some years, we will seek not only to export palm produce but also fresh palm wine from Anambra State.\u201d\n\nSpeaking after his swearing-in ceremony, Soludo said, \u201cMy heart bleeds to see and hear about our youth dying in senseless circumstances. Every criminal gang \u2013 kidnappers, wicked murderers, arsonists, rapists, thieves \u2013 all now claim to be freedom fighters. Criminality cannot be sugar-coated. This must stop.\n\n\n\n\u201cAll the stakeholders must now review both the narrative and the action plan. For starters, I endorse the recent statement (March 7, 2022) by the Joint Body of South East Council of Traditional Rulers and Bishops/Archbishops on Peace and Conflict Resolution, requesting for a tripartite discussion between them, the Presidency, and south-east governors to deal with the conflicts in the south-east especially, in relation to Nnamdi Kanu and the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and the Eastern Security Network (ESN).\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is no conflict that dialogue, in good faith, cannot resolve. Our government is determined to urgently restore peace and security in Anambra, and we will seek the active cooperation and collaboration of all stakeholders.\u201d\n\nSoludo told members of IPOB/ESN, the Movement for the Actualisation of Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB), and other armed groups to interrogate both the purpose and means of their campaign, and warned politicians playing politics with insecurity, that they were riding a tiger.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe current trajectory is a road to desolation. Let us get around the table and talk. Let the elite in the closet come out, and let\u2019s debate our future and forge a consensus. The conspiracy of silence by the elite and some community leaders must end.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you see something, say or do something. Securing Igboland and Nigeria must be our collective responsibility. Let those in the forests come out, surrender their guns and let\u2019s work together to rehabilitate and empower you to contribute positively to the peace and prosperity of our homeland,\u201d Soludo said.\n\n\n\nOn why his inauguration was a low key event, Soludo said, \u201cToday is my first day at work. I just reported for duty and will work for at least eight hours. We had more than a month since the election to celebrate our historic victory. Now is the time to work, and there is no minute or kobo to waste in fanfare.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn a few minutes, I will announce some of the principal officers of the administration, and commence with serious meetings of the Anambra State Security Council, followed by a meeting with the permanent secretaries, a meeting on Okpoko, and with my Strategy, Execution and Evaluation (SEE) team.\n\n\n\n\u201cWithin the next one week, the list of Commissioners will be laid before the House of Assembly. Tomorrow, we will head to Okpoko in Ogbaru Local Government Area and parts of Onitsha and Idemili as we signpost our commitment to fundamental urban regeneration, beginning with the greater Onitsha metropolis.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe former CBN governor said, \u201cI insisted that this event must not cost the government of Anambra one kobo. I would rather use such resources to lay the foundation stone for a public hospital at Okpoko or elsewhere or empower our security agents to fight criminality.\n\n\u201cYes, there will be a time to celebrate. We will celebrate when security of life and property is guaranteed and law and order restored; every child of schooling age is in school; every school child is receiving the 21st century education for the digital age.\u201d\n\nBianca, Ex-First Lady Went Physical at Event, Slaps Obiano\u2019s Wife\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Mrs Obiano engaged in a fight with Bianca Ojukwu at the venue and subdued the poise of the inauguration with their filthy fisticuffs.\n\n\n\nThe former first lady, who seemed to have come set for a fight had approached Mrs Ojukwu at the front row of the event, where she was seated close to Chief Willie Obiano, allegedly warning her about coming to an APGA function, after she had attacked the party during the November election.\n\n\n\nMrs Obiano had said something things to Mrs Ojukwu, including touching, a situation the latter warned repeatedly against, causing Mrs. Ojukwu to smack her on the cheeks, while the former first lady attempted to fight back, before security operatives separated them.\n\nEarlier, THISDAY witnessed the arrival of Mrs Obiano as she was stopped at the gate, when her convoy attempted to use the main gate.\n\n\n\nShe had come late for the event, while her husband had arrived much earlier, and had already inspected the guard of honour, and the swearing-in ritual for the new governor was ongoing.\n\nA barricade at the expressway leading into the Government House was locked with keys, while Mrs Obiano was advised by security men to drive down to a far away junction and turn into a smaller gate that led to the Government House.\n\n\n\nBut Mrs Obiano refused and later trekked from the express to the main gate, where she also caused a stir, before the gate was opened for her, while she trekked into the Government House, where the function held, abandoning her convoy.\n\nMrs Obiano and her husband however left the ceremony immediately after Soludo was sworn in.\n\nThe former CBN governor, in a statement by his media aide, Mr Joe Anatune, said the fight was caused by a breach of protocol.\n\nThe statement stated: \u201cProf. Soludo hereby apologises to all Anambra people, friends and guests, who attended his inauguration this morning as the Anambra State governor for the breach of protocol.\n\n\u201cThe breach was caused by improper communication, which itself arose from a personal issue between the two parties involved in the breach. Steps are being taken to resolve the misunderstanding and restore the parties to their previous relationship.\n\n\u201cAnambra State has over the years been known for a huge stock of social harmony, and the stock will increase substantially in the years ahead as part of the concerted effort to accelerate the state\u2019s development.\u201d\n\nEFCC Arrests Former Governor at Lagos Airport\n\n\n\nIn another development, Obiano, who had been on the EFCC watchlist for months, was arrested at about 8.30pm, while on his way out of the country to Houston, Texas in the United States.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the EFCC had requested the Nigeria Immigration Service to inform it anytime the former governor was travelling out of the country from any of the international airports, as well as other points of entry and exit.\n\nAlthough THISDAY could not ascertain why EFCC placed Obiano on a watchlist and subsequently arrested him, sources, however, claimed the move was a clear indication that the agency had been quietly looking into his activities and might have gleaned intelligence that he was planning to escape after handing over power.\n\nObi Expresses Optimism New Governor Will Do Well\n\n\n\nBut, political differences notwithstanding, a former governor of the state, Mr. Peter Obi, has said despite being from a different party from Soludo and even campaigning against him during the elections, his ultimate desire was to see a better Anambra State that ensures the well-being of the people.\n\nObi, who stated that politics, for him, was about building a better society, especially, for the less privileged, because government or governance, was all about caring for the people, however, expressed optimism Soludo would do well.\n\nAddressing journalists at the inauguration ceremony, Obi argued that, considering Soludo\u2019s background, he was confident that he would commit to the critical areas of development, which he listed to include education, health and poverty alleviation, even as he expressed hope that the new governor would fulfill his campaign promises.\n\n\u201cI will continue to remember our new governor and other leaders in my prayers, so that they can continue to make the right decisions for the good of our dear nation, Nigeria,\u201d Obi concluded.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The siamese twins, India and Pakistan, have virtually been at each other\u2019s throats since the 1947 surgical operation by quack British doctors that separated them.\n\nTheir last dogfight in the skies was in 2019. However, on March 9, 2022, Pakistan with 165 nuclear warheads and India with 156, we\u2019re almost at war. What nearly resulted in conflict was not their fierce differences over Kashmir or any difference for that matter.\n\nWhat happened was that India fired a BrahMos Medium range missile into Pakistan\u2019s Punjab Province damaging property. But luckily, no aircraft were flying around and there were no casualties.\n\nThe baffled Pakistanis who traced the missile launch were not sure what to make of it as it was an unarmed supersonic missile. They waited for the direct hotline between the two military chiefs to ring and get an explanation.\n\nBut it remained silent. As the Pakistanis prepared for a possible conflict, they made a complaint to India. That was when two days later, the explanation came with profuse apologies; the Indian Air Force was checking its systems when due to a technical malfunction, the missile went off.\n\nPakistan\u2019s National Security Adviser, Moeed Yusuf said: \u201cThis missile travelled close to the path of international and domestic commercial airlines and threatened the safety of civilians\u2026It is also highly irresponsible of Indian authorities not to have informed Pakistan immediately that an inadvertent launch of a cruise missile had taken place.\u201d\n\nWith the world saturated by missiles and nuclear arms, it is not impossible that any can be fired due to technical or human errors; in other words, humans can simply sleepwalk into a universal disaster. I often hear an exclamation like: \u2018The Devil is a liar\u2019; but in reality, the Devil is a realist; the best way to avoid a nuclear disaster is to rid the world of nuclear weapons. Africans say, you do not go about sniffing what you forbid; if we do not want a biological or nuclear war, why do we go about producing them?\n\nThe United Nations in Article I of its Convention on the Prohibition of Bacteriological and Toxin Weapons, states that: \u201cEach State Party to this Convention undertakes never in any circumstances to develop, produce, stockpile or otherwise acquire or retain microbial or other biological agents, or toxins whatever their origin or method of production, of types and in quantities\u2026\u201d But the issue of biological weapons production is the basis of the current claims and counterclaims in the ongoing Ukrainian war in which Russia on March 6, 2022, announced it had uncovered and captured a number of laboratories where Ukraine, with the aid of the United States, was engaged in the development of biological weapons.\n\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova announced they had discovered that: \u201cComponents of biological weapons were being developed in Ukrainian laboratories in direct proximity to Russian territory\u2026During the special military operation in Ukraine, the Kyiv regime was found to have been concealing traces of a military biological programme implemented with funding from the United States Department of Defence\u201d. She also claimed that Russia found messages directing Ukrainian bio-laboratory staff to eradicate \u201chazardous pathogens of plague, anthrax, rabbit-fever, cholera and other lethal diseases(from) stored reserves of highly hazardous pathogens\u201d.\n\nThe US which before the United Nations vehemently denied the accusations, however, did not accuse the Russians of planting the laboratories nor that American instructions to the Ukrainians to eradicate the hazardous pathogens rather than let them fall into Russian hands are fake.\n\nThe American position was made more problematic when its embassy in Ukraine issued a statement titled: \u2018Biological Threat Reduction Program\u2019. In reference to the Russian discoveries, the US Embassy said America \u201ccollaborates with partner countries to counter the threat of outbreaks (deliberate, accidental, or natural) of the world\u2019s most dangerous infectious diseases\u201d. The American statement went on to state that: \u201cThe Biological Threat Reduction Program\u2019s priorities in Ukraine are to consolidate and secure pathogens and toxins of security concern\u2026\u201d\n\nWhen the matter came up in the American Senate, the US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland admitted: \u201cUkraine has biological-research facilities, which, in fact, we are now quite concerned Russian forces may be seeking to gain control of. So we are working with the Ukrainians on how they can prevent any of those research materials from falling into the hands of Russian forces, should they approach.\u201d\n\nMy concerns are not whether or not the Ukrainian laboratory experiments are for defensive purposes -whatever that means -but that, as it happened in the Indian missile case, there can be accidental discharge or leakage, and before you know it, the world might be battling new pandemics.\n\nThis is also my concern on whether the war in Ukraine might involve the eventual use of nuclear weapons by either Russia or the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, NATO. It may not be deliberate, but human errors like that that happened in the case of Indians can occur. Famous scientist Albert Einstein who initially thought the atomic bomb was a good idea, changed his mind, famously saying: \u201cMankind invented the atomic bomb, but no mouse would ever construct a mousetrap.\u201d His conclusion was that: \u201cTo have security against atomic bombs and against the other biological weapons, we have to prevent war, for if we cannot prevent war every nation will use every means that is at their disposal; and in spite of all promises they make, they will do it.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter the atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, humanity swore it must never be repeated. That was in 1945. But nuclear weapons increased to 3,000 in 1955 and to over 37,000 by 1965 (US, 31,000 and the Soviet Union 6,000). At this point, there were demands that nuclear weapons should first be drastically reduced, then eliminated.\n\nThis was one of the hopes in the negotiations of the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty, SALT I signed in 1972. But rather than reduce, there was further proliferation to the extent that they rose to 47,000 by 1975 (US, 27,000 and Soviet Union 20,000) then to 70,300 active weapons in 1986.\n\nThe figures have reduced significantly, but remain very high, with Russia in 2022 having 6,255 nuclear warheads; the US: 5,550; China with 350; France: 290 and United Kingdom: 225 nuclear warheads. Other known nuclear countries are Israel and North Korea. There are others in the queue.\n\nDespite threats, I am not sure nuclear-proliferating countries can stop others from joining the race; so there is a balance of terror. Yet, humanity and nuclear weapons cannot co-exist; one will have to give way to the other. The way out is decommissioning all nuclear weapons; but will the powerful agree to give up their lethal weapons? I doubt it.\n\n",

          "title": "Digital Nomads: The Nigerians escaping Ukraine\u2019s war",
          "text": "Kemi\n\n\u201cAt first, we were laughing. Isn\u2019t that the Nigerian thing to do? Use humour to mask fear?\u201d\n\nWhen we speak to Kemi*, a fourth-year medical student from Nigeria, she is in an apartment in Hungary with her friends, all of whom had spent 5 days fleeing Ukraine.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny because, a few years ago, I was on the other side of the border.\u201d\n\nAs an international student, Kemi\u2019s journey to Europe started in 2015 when she landed in Russia to start medical school. Before Russia, she was one of the medical students at the Houdegbe North American University (HNAUB) in Benin Republic who spent years under the deceit of an unaccredited faculty.\n\n\u201cI was in my fourth year when we realised HNAUB was duping people. I was called back home and my mother had already handled the transition process to Russia.\u201d Although she had to start all over again in Russia, Kemi found the schooling environment better than what she\u2019d experienced in Benin. \u201cWe had cadavers to work on, and most of it was practical. In Benin, they just lectured us, and we never got any real experience, even when we got to higher classes.\u201d\n\nBy her third year, Kemi and other international students in Russia were told they would have to learn Russian because the remainder of their course would be taught entirely in Russian. \u201cIt was impossible,\u201d she says. \u201cWe were learning by speaking, by repeating what our lecturers said to us. To learn a new language, coupled with our course, was impossible. To make it worse, they said we couldn\u2019t transfer to another school abroad while in Russia.\u201d\n\nThe alternative given to them was to leave Russia and apply for new student visas from their home countries. Fortunately, someone was able to help them process admissions into a university in Kyiv, and that\u2019s how Kemi found herself in Ukraine in 2018.\n\n\u201cUkraine was different from Russia,\u201d Kemi says. \u201cThe schools weren\u2019t as hands-on as Russian schools were, but they were just as good. The environment also came with an added advantage: the opportunity to do business.\u201d\n\nUkraine is one of many countries where intakes with student visas aren\u2019t allowed to work formally without work permits. It\u2019s difficult to get employers to hire English-speaking students for everyday jobs. \u201cIt\u2019s not like America where you can get jobs flipping burgers at McDonald\u2019s; there are no jobs like that here,\u201d Kemi says. Students, all of whom are given temporary residence permits, can work unofficially or do small businesses by registering as private entrepreneurs.\n\nUkraine is home to 76,000 international students, and about 19,000 are of African descent. This number keeps growing by the year for a number of reasons. Life in Ukraine is quite cheap, with most students able to survive on less than $200 per month or $2,500 per year, a 300% difference from the US where most international students would require an average of $10,000 per year to live. University acceptance rates are also higher, and students find it easier to transfer from Ukraine to other western countries.\n\nAccording to Kemi, who owns a catering business, she used to make as much as $1,000 a month with a hectic schedule. It was enough for her to pay her off-campus rent, afford other necessities, and still have some change left for flexing.\n\nBut with the onset of the war, she lost everything.\n\nThey first heard the sirens at 3 AM on the 24th. When they went outside, Kemi and her friends found the streets of Kyiv full of people who were rushing in and out of department stores stocking up on supplies.\n\n\u201cWe bought whatever we could,\u201dKemi says. On the second night, they tried to stay in a bunker close to home but returned home when the bunker turned out to be chilly. \u201cOn the third morning, the tremors woke us up. Everything rattled and the whole building shook. We didn\u2019t even think twice, we packed our documents, a few other things, and left.\u201d\n\nWith her friends, Kemi went to the train station where they met hundreds of people waiting for the trains to come. Armed soldiers announced to the crowd that only women and children would be allowed in\u2014no men. \u201cWhat we didn\u2019t know was that by \u2018women and children\u2019 they meant European women and children\u2019. We had to fight to get to the trains, and even when we got on, we were pushed off them.\u201d\n\nThat first day passed and Kemi and her friends couldn\u2019t get on any of the 2 trains that stopped in Kyiv. They tried to opt for road transport, but the cab drivers were charging $1,600 for trips that would normally cost $50. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t afford that, so we went back, and on the second day, we were finally able to get on a train leaving Kyiv.\u201d There was no space to sit or squat on the train, so they stood for 7 hours near the door, from where they were blasted with minus-0\u00b0 winds.\n\nImage source: Al Jazeera\n\n\u201cThe second train station at Lviv was no better. At least in Kyiv, we could see that the trains were full. At Lviv, there were spaces on the trains, and they only let Ukrainian women and men on. We had to fight again till we were able to get another train to Uzhhorod where we stayed for 2 nights before we left for Hungary.\u201d\n\nWhile they found Uzhhorod quiet and peaceful compared to Kyiv, their stay was cut short when Ukrainian soldiers burst into their hotel room on the second night, questioned them, and searched through their phones for photos of Ukrainian soldiers.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to stay there but it was obvious we weren\u2019t welcome,\u201d Kemi says.\n\nThey left for the Hungarian border where they were asked if they would apply for refugee status or for temporary residence permits. \u201cRefugees status means going back to Nigeria, and no one wants that. The authorities would take our passports, too, and the only pro is the free accommodation and feeding.\u201d\n\nThey opted for the 30-day residence permit instead and they\u2019ve been fending for themselves since then.\n\nAkam\n\nAkam, a Nigerian aerospace engineer living in Ukraine, was woken by bomb blasts around 5 AM and he felt his building vibrating. He looked out through the window to see what was happening and saw hundreds of people trying to escape the bombings that were occurring simultaneously.\n\nAkan recalls that he could only pack the belongings that he could carry and get to the next available shelter even though he didn\u2019t know which building could be hit next.\n\nWhen we speak with Akam, he\u2019s fled to Slovakia, leaving behind a flourishing life and career in Ukraine.\n\nDespite the difficulty he faced in moving away from the war by train\u2014a relatively safer means of transportation\u2014he was able to get to Bratislava, the capital city of Slovakia.\n\nThe train station was crowded with families trying to board a train from Kharkiv to Lviv, a Ukrainian city that is just 50 miles from the border of Poland\u2014the safest place, to be at the time\u2014as it allowed citizens to move to Poland, a NATO country; and attacks on it due to its proximity to the Polish border carries serious repercussions for Russia.\n\nSince the war started, Akam has been in constant communication via phone lines and WhatsApp with his family, but he shields them from any graphic or controversial information about the war to prevent them from being more worried than they already are. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell them that they\u2019re dropping bombs in front of you.\u201d I filter what I share with them.\u201d\n\nWhile Akam wasn\u2019t able to get to Lviv, he was fortunate enough to get a train to Uzhhorod, a city 2 kilometres away from Slovakia. But, due to the crowds on the roads, he had to walk for 30 minutes. Upon getting to Uzhhorod, it took him 12 hours to finally cross the border into Slovakia.\n\nAkam arrived in Ukraine as a student empty-handed, but with bags of dreams and heightened hopes for his future, and when he started acquiring properties in this foreign land, he felt fulfilled. Over the years, he got a good-paying job, attained job security and peace of mind that allowed him to comfortably take care of himself and support his family back in Nigeria.\n\nDigital Nomads: A Nigerian engineer\u2019s journey from Ukraine to Malaysia, and now to helping businesses scale in Thailand Digital Nomads: A Nigerian engineer\u2019s journey from Ukraine to Malaysia, and now to helping businesses scale in Thailand\n\nDevastated and filled with hurtful memories, Akam does not go into the details of how much he has lost. \u201cYou wake up one morning to find that all the things you have spent years acquiring are gone.\u201d\n\nFortune\n\nFor Fortune, Russia\u2019s invasion wasn\u2019t cause for alarm; he\u2019d had some experience with the Ukrainian crisis. In 2014, during Russia\u2019s first invasion to recover Crimea, Fortune\u2019s brother was living in Luhansk, the heart of the war in Donbas, which claimed over 13,000 lives, 3,000 civilians included.\n\n\u201cWhen my mom asked if he wanted to return home, my brother said yes,\u201d Fortune says. \u201cHe was able to buy a ticket and get on the next flight home as his city was being bombed.\u201d\n\nA year later, in 2015, Fortune packed up his bags and left Nigeria for Ukraine. Before the war, there were about 19,000 international students of African descent studying medicine in the east European country, and while some, like Kemi, think highly of Ukraine\u2019s educational system, Fortune\u2019s stethoscope hears something different.\n\n\u201cTo be fair, I haven\u2019t gone to any other universities, but the one in Ternopil isn\u2019t that great.\u201d According to Fortune, the lecturers are flaky, and if students really want to succeed, they can\u2019t depend solely on lecturers or their lectures. \u201cBut I\u2019m done now,\u201d Fortune says. \u201cI finished last year, and I was going to leave Ukraine this year. This war just speeds things up.\u201d\n\nWhile Fortune\u2019s brother was able to leave Luhansk easily, Fortune\u2019s own journey out of Ternopil took 2 weeks of careful planning and deliberation. \u201cThe situation is different from 2014. You can\u2019t get out that easily.\u201d\n\nA day after Russia\u2019s invasion, Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy instituted martial law and grounded commercial flights. The reason isn\u2019t so far-fetched. In 2014, a Russian missile shot into a commercial flight passing through Ukrainian airspace, killing 283 passengers on board. Ukraine doesn\u2019t want a repeat on its land, so people like Fortune who want to go home have to find other means.\n\n\u201cI waited,\u201d Fortune says. \u201cOn the first day, everything was a bit calm. People were running around in the streets buying provisions, and my friends, and I joined them. But when the warning sirens came the second day, and we started to feel tremors, people panicked and started to leave in droves.\u201d\n\nBut Fortune declined to join his friends when they left. \u201cIt didn\u2019t make sense at the time,\u201d he says. His patience paid off when some of his friends returned from the Polish border days after.\n\n\u201cI know people who were at the border for days, freezing their asses off trying to get out. I know some who were beaten and pushed,\u201d Fortune recalls.

          "title": "Big Cabal Media raises $2.3m to expand its compelling line of digital products",
          "text": "Over decades, the news media landscape has changed dramatically. Checking for news online\u2014whether through Google, social network sites, major newspapers, or local media websites\u2014has become ubiquitous. The widespread use of smartphones also means the latest developments around the world are delivered to people instantaneously.\n\nWhile digital media has connected people in ways never before possible, enabling users to remain informed and maintain relationships across time and distance, companies in the space have attracted a paltry amount of funding. In 2021, venture capital invested $115 million in digital media globally, a tenth of the $1.1billion it funded in 2015, but not much came to Africa. Digital newsrooms in Africa are more likely to receive story grants than business funding, with a few exceptions.\n\nToday, one of such exceptions, Big Cabal Media (BCM), a leading African digital media company, has announced a $2.3 million Seed funding round, emphasising its commitment to keep building exciting and authoritative media products and brands. The new investment round saw participation from existing investors: Unicorn Capital Partners and Future Africa. New investors such as Mac Venture Capital and Luminate Capital Partners participated.\n\nPrior to this funding, with just over $600,000 raised in funding, BCM has grown to become one of the most exciting media and tech businesses in Africa. Its two major publications, TechCabal and Zikoko, reach over 30 million people monthly across platforms, with over 170,000 newsletter subscribers, and a 225% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2018 and 2021.\n\nFounded in 2013 by Bankole Oluwafemi, TechCabal started as a deliberate effort to cover the burgeoning Nigerian tech ecosystem. While the publication started out focusing just on the Nigerian startup space, it soon expanded its coverage to all of Africa. The publication covers startup fundraises, product launches, expansions, regulatory tussles, and stories of various players in the digital economy.\n\nA year after TechCabal launched Seyi Taylor joined the company as co-founder and CEO, while Oluwafemi continued in his role as Editor-in-Chief. They continued to expand TechCabal\u2019s coverage and scale up its operations. In 2016, the duo decided to try something different with the launch of Zikoko, a publication many likened to Buzzfeed at the time of its birth. Zikoko has grown from mostly publishing listicles and quizzes to sharing important stories on every aspect of Nigerians\u2019 lives, earning it \u201cNigeria\u2019s most viral publisher\u201d tagline.\n\nTwo years after the launch of Zikoko, Tomiwa Aladekomo joined the company, taking over as CEO. Aladekomo is an experienced media and marketing professional, who has worked in a range of businesses across different sectors in both North America and Africa.\n\nOver the next four years, Aladekomo focused on diversifying the company\u2019s revenue streams. BCM had derived its income mostly through native advertising, but Aladekomo oversaw the build-out of an extensive suite of advertising products across publications. The company built out a substantial events business; launched the Cabal Creative content studio, which has served multiple Fortune 500 clients ranging from Google to Coca-Cola; and launched TC Insights, a digital economy consultancy business.\n\nUnder Aladekomo\u2019s leadership, BCM has also embarked on ambitious projects like Jollof Road, an 80-day adventurous road trip across all mainland countries in West Africa; and Tech Women Lagos, a multi-sensory exhibition of 50 women in the Lagos technology ecosystem from different backgrounds.\n\n\u201cI joined BCM in 2018, brought on some really talented people, and we immediately kickstarted a period of experimentation,\u201d Aladekomo said. \u201cOur experiments encompassed editorial content and approaches, monetisation and even company culture.\u201d\n\nTomiwa Aladekomo, CEO of Big Cabal Media\n\nNine years after its launch, BCM which started as a tech blog has morphed into a media powerhouse. Its two publications, TechCabal and Zikoko are experts at creating content that hits the cultural nerve. They go beyond covering the scenes to creating agenda-setting editorial content, projects, and events. Cabal Creative and TC Insights are also supporting hundreds of companies within Africa.\n\nThe company also boasts of a laudable alumni network, which includes Odunayo Eweniyi, CEO and co-founder of Fintech startup Piggyvest and First Check, a female-led, female-focused, angel fund and investor community; Osarumen Osamuyi, Partner Manager at Meta; Jola Ayeye, scriptwriter and co-host of the I Said What I Said (ISWIS) podcast\u2014one of the most listened to podcasts in Africa\u2014and a host of others. An indication of its investment in its employees.\n\n\u201cFrom documented reports and experience, too, very few people who work for media organisations are offered a competitive salary and we\u2019d like to be the exception to the norm,\u201d Aladekomo said. \u201cThe BCM model has been tested and proven. In 2021, we quadrupled our 2020 revenue, and over the last 4 years our CAGR is 225%.\u201d\n\nWith this new funding, BCM plans to develop its product serving, staff, and audience. \u201cWe are expanding our video production by exploring docuseries and short films,\u201d Aladekomo said. \u201cWe will be transforming our studio into a community hub for creatives, and introducing 3 new tech products, including the Zikoko app and Zikoko Memes 2.0, which first launched in 2020. We will also be building out new audiences while offering competitive wages.\u201d\n\nIn the past 5 years, some notable fundraises by African digital media companies include Nigerian media company Stears Business\u2019 $600,000 seed round in 2020 and Ghana\u2019s OMG Digital $1.1m seed funding in 2017. BCM\u2019s progress over the years and recent fundraise is a noteworthy example of the possibilities and opportunities in Africa\u2019s digital media sector.\n\nOf the reported $4.3\u2013$5 billion raised by African startups in 2021 whereby fintech received 53\u201363% of the volume, digital media companies are one of many sectors that have traditionally been overlooked in the conversation of tangible ventures.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re proud to enter this chapter with Big Cabal Media, as we fully believe in its massive potential for further success, scale and global impact,\u201d said Marlon Nichols, co-Founder and Managing General Partner at MaC Venture Capital. \u201cInvesting in Africa\u2019s booming digital media sector aligns perfectly with MaC\u2019s mission of supporting exceptional entrepreneurs building valuable technology companies that leverage shifts in cultural trends and behaviours. I have no doubt that BCM will seize this unique opportunity to continue leading conversations in culture and helping digital consumers access the information that matters most to them.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How much did African startups raise in 2021?",
          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal is set to launch a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

The streaming giant says it will begin testing ways to make users sharing an account pay for the additional members.\n\nThis means that sharing your Netflix password with someone else may soon become expensive, as account sharing will incur an additional fee.\n\nWhy? According to the company, improper account sharing outside the household has hampered Netflix\u2019s \u201cability to invest in great new TV and films for our members.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, per the company\u2019s terms of service, an account \u201cmay not be shared with individuals outside your household.\u201d A rule that many subscribers break.\n\nConsequently, Netflix will roll out and test two new features \u2013 Add an Extra Member and Transfer Profile to a New Account \u2013 for members in Chile, Costa Rica, and Peru over the next few weeks.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nDream VC\u2019s pipeline plan\n\nBig Cabal Media\u2019s seed funding\n\nDream VC\u2019s pipeline plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNowadays, it appears that many people want to work in technology companies. However, only a small percentage are familiar with the Venture Capital (VC) industry.\n\nIn exchange for an equity stake, VCs invest in companies with high growth potential. This could include funding new ventures or assisting small businesses that want to grow but lack access to equity markets.\n\nBesides, venture capital fuels startups, but these VCs require talent. Interestingly, venture capital funding only became common in the last decade, leaving a considerable talent gap, which Dream VC was founded to fill.\n\nDream VC is an investor accelerator and community-driven educational platform that offers rigorous remote venture capital programs across Africa\u2019s startup ecosystems.\n\nThe company intends to demystify the VC space and build a pipeline for African VC talent. How?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can find out here: Inside Dream VC\u2019s plan to build a pipeline for African VC talent\n\nMovies Nigerians saw at the cinemas during the weekend of March 11 \u2013 13, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you go to see a movie at the cinemas last weekend?

Did you know that Zikoko and TechCabal are owned by the same parent company, Big Cabal Media (BCM)?\n\nI became aware of this last year, and I was impressed that the parent company is developing two fantastic products. I believe that BCM has a product for everyone because even if you\u2019re not interested in tech news, you should be interested in the content Zikoko covers because it focuses on African youth.\n\nSo, what happened? The Nigeria-based media company, BCM, announced yesterday that it had raised $2.3 million in seed funding to expand its audience and build new verticals.\n\nMaC Venture Capital led the round, and VC firms Luminate, Unicorn Group, Future Africa, and other angel investors participated.\n\nRecall that BCM previously raised $620,000 in angel and pre-seed funding between 2016 and 2020, bringing its total financing disclosed to more than $2.9 million.\n\nBCM was launched in 2013 by Seyi Taylor and Bankole Oluwafemi. And in 2018, Tomiwa Aladekomo, the company\u2019s CEO, took over from Taylor.\n\nTechCabal, a publication that covers technology news, was founded in 2014. The platform has newsletters such as The Next Wave and TC Events, an events arm that organises sought-after gatherings of operators and investors.\n\nMeanwhile, Zikoko\u2019s target audience is different. The publication, debuted in 2016, creates and curates content centred on African youth culture for Gen Zs and Millennials within and outside Africa.\n\nAccording to Aladekomo, the new fund will allow BCM to invest significantly in its technology and optimise the websites of its publications. It also intends to expand Zikoko Memes, a Giphy-like product focusing on African memes, gifs, and images that the company launched in 2020.\n\nFinally, the investment will be used to expand its audience, make new hires across the board, and solidify its position as one of Africa\u2019s most influential media and technology brands.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nAnimal vs. Plant Protein \u2014 What\u2019s the Difference?\n\nI See Dead People: Dreams and Visions of the Dying.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA few years ago, a discussion among prospective university graduates in Nigeria would have involved exchanging ideas on what companies they were applying to.\n\nTypically, this would have had them cycling between jobs in the banking sector, oil industry, and placements in hospitals for medical students. Very few would have considered a tech career.\n\nFast forward a few years, and tech is probably the first option for many job seekers. However, very few understand or are even aware of the venture capital space, but Mark Kleyner and Cindy Ai want to demystify the space with Dream VC.\n\nThe daughter of first-generation Chinese immigrants, Ai\u2019s experience in the startup space has come through roles in marketing, consulting, growth, community building, and building a business herself. Kleyner, on the other hand, has worked with startups and VCs across Africa, Europe, the United States, and South East Asia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2020, Kleyner teamed up with Ai to start MZZ Africa, providing pro-bono support services to African startups. Working with 18 startups, they helped them figure out their business models, create product and marketing strategies, and fundraise. According to Kleyner, 12 of these startups raised money from VCs in 2021.\n\nActivity picked up in the African startup space, and Andela was founded in 2014 to provide a pipeline of technical talent for startups. Other startups also sprung up to fill the need, including Decagon and Gebeya.\n\nVenture capital provides the fuel for startups to run; however, these VCs need talent. Interestingly, VC funding only became common in the past decade, and so there is a gaping talent hole, which Dream VC was launched to fill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDream VC founders Cindy Ai and Mark Kleyner.\n\nExplaining the decision to start Dream VC, Ai said, \u201cOne of the reasons why Dream VC became a focal point for me was because I was someone who could never have broken into venture capital without a sort of fellowship programme or someone reaching out and democratising access for me.\n\n\u201cNone of my family understands what VC is; I don\u2019t have high-net-worth individuals in my family or direct network, so I resonate with people who want to create impact but don\u2019t have the resources.\u201d\n\nKleyner added, \u201cDream VC is a realisation that the problems we see are not the problems that most people are solving. You might hear in the investment space that there is limited funding for African startups, that funding is going to limited ecosystems or that there is gender disparity in the ecosystem.\n\n\u201cMost people don\u2019t talk about the structural reasons these things happen. For instance, most people who have the means to invest don\u2019t know how to start doing that. If you look at angel groups, most of them are using US vehicles or Singapore vehicles, so many of them are forcing rules from the US on someone that wants to invest in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nBuilding a pipeline for VC talent\n\nIn June 2021, Dream VC launched its flagship programme with 30 fellows from a pool of 1,000 applicants. The fellows went through a remote programme covering various subjects, including deal sourcing, due diligence, portfolio management, and adding value to portfolio companies. There were also meetups and sessions with active VCs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe had a programme that ran for upwards of 300 hours of content and over 160 hours of direct contact between each fellow and our teams. They were taken through the venture capital space and various skills they will need in VC roles. The goal was to help them break into the VC space,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDream VC Co-founder Cindy Ai with some of the fellows.\n\nAfter the programme, some of the fellows got jobs with VCs, including Ajim Capital, LoftyInc Capital, Oui Capital, Lateral Capital, with some launching their syndicates. Having tested their hypothesis, Dream VC would be launching two programmes: the Launch into VC Program and the Investor Accelerator Program.\n\nLaunch into VC is a fully remote 13-week programme targeted at early-stage professionals looking to break into the VC space.\n\nAi revealed that \u201cthe concept of Launch into VC is similar to a lot of fellowship programmes that already exist in the US and Europe, and the reason these programmes came about was that these VCs realised that they needed to train people in the skills they needed for entry-level roles.\n\n\u201cThe reason many consider it inaccessible is that it is very network-driven, and it\u2019s one where they don\u2019t have any sort of training for when you join.\u201d\n\nFor Dream VC, the idea is to build a pipeline for local VCs who need to hire local talent. On the other hand, they provide a comprehensive resource list and network for people looking to break into VC. While it may seem that there is only a handful of VCs on the continent, Kleyner argues that many foreign VCs cannot launch African offices due to their inability to hire local talent.\n\nAdmission into the programme costs $1,000, which covers the cost of access to databases that VCs use in their jobs. However, the co-founders admit that the fee is still out of reach for most Africans and plan to subsidise it.\n\nInvestor Accelerator targets experienced professionals and entrepreneurs with at least five years of professional experience. For 20 weeks, the fellows will be taken through courses covering deal sourcing, angel investing, and fundraising, among others. Admission into the programme also requires a $5,000 fee. Scholarships are available for exceptional applicants who cannot foot the bills.\n\nWhile both programmes are intensive, fellows can combine the fellowship with their full-time roles. Ai adds that the Investor Accelerator Program is not a fund accelerator and does not connect fellows to limited partners (LPs) or help them build out a fund structure.\n\nApplications are open to both programmes, which will launch in June 2022 and will be reviewed on a rolling basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

Even after improved earnings in Q4 2021, its stocks didn\u2019t perform well.\n\nHowever, when we look at players like TradeDepot and Omnibiz, we see a different story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, Wasoko, previously Sokowatch, an African eCommerce platform, is also changing the eCommerce story with its $125 million Series B, one of the largest funding rounds by a non-fintech startup. The round was led by Tiger Global and Avenir Growth, with participation from VNV Global, 4DX Ventures, and JAM Fund.\n\nWith the $125 million fundraise comes an expansion beyond East Africa to West African countries \u2014 C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Senegal. The eCommerce startup also got a makeover, changing its name from Sokowatch to Wasoko, meaning people of the market.\n\nSince its launch in 2016, Wasokso has fulfilled 2.5 million orders to over 50,000 informal retailers across Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Uganda, and other African countries where it is present.\n\nThe B2B model: Like TradeDepot, Alerzo and other eCommerce startups that have raised funds from 2021, B2B is the dominant model. Wasoko delivers goods directly to retailers who sell to the final consumer.\n\nWhile B2B looks like a working model for eCommerce in Africa, most retailers are informal and unregistered. This, along with a 26% Internet penetration rate, is still crucial to the survival of eCommerce in Africa.\n\nTo tackle this problem, Wasoko has created an offline solution for its retailers through SMS. As B2B continues to be the go-to model for eCommerce in Africa, only time will tell how sustainable it is.\n\nInside gist: We had an exciting conversation about eCommerce on the Techpoint Africa podcast. Get ready for an insightful listen today.\n\n4G Capital\u2019s $18m funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKenyan fintech startup, 4G Capital, has raised $18 million in a Series C round led by Lightrock.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat does 4G Capital do? Per TechCrunch, the startup provides credit to small businesses.\n\nFounded in 2013 by British Army veteran, Wayne Hennessy-Barrett, 4G Capital provides credit to informal businesses that do not have access to formal credit facilities.\n\nHowever, the startup wants to begin lending to bigger businesses with this new funding. It will also increase its credit limit beyond $1,000 and extend its repayment period.\n\nA touch of eCommerce: 4G Capital plans to roll out new products, including an app, later this year. It will enable their clients to sell on digital marketplaces and create access to other digital providers like delivery services.\n\nOffline mode: While 4G Capital is accessible online, it has physical branches that help it connect better with its customers.\n\nAccording to Hennessy-Barrett, \u201cI always felt it was important, particularly dealing with people who can be quite vulnerable, to have a personal interaction touch point, which is then augmented by technology.\u201d\n\nThe startup plans to build new loan products and lend to businesses in the agri-value chain.\n\nOnyeka Akumah\u2019s Farmcrowdy exit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnyeka Akumah (Founder & former CEO, Farmcrowdy\n\nOnyeka Akumah, CEO and Founder of Nigerian mobility startup, Treepz, has stepped down as the Chairman of his previous startup Farmcrowdy.\n\nAkumah founded Farmcrowdy with Akindele Phillips, Temitope Omotolani, Christopher Abiodun, and Ifeanyi Anazodo in 2016 to finance small scale farmers across Nigeria.\n\nSo why\u2019s he exiting? According to a statement by the company, Akumah\u2019s five-year tenure as Chairman had come to an end.\n\nDuring Akumah\u2019s time as CEO, the startup raised a combined $2.4 million in grants, pre-seed, and seed investments and raised $15 million for 25,000 farmers.\n\nFor a refresher on Farmcrowdy\u2019s early days with Akumah, please read this: Inside the agritech conglomerate Farmcrowdy is building\n\nIn June 2021, Akumah announced his exit as the startup\u2019s CEO to focus on Treepz, formerly Plentywaka. After Akumah\u2019s exit as CEO, Akinlade Philips took the role. This new exit means Akumah no longer has ties with Farmcrowdy going forward.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nThe Task That Must Be Done.

          "text": "As Nigerians felicitated with one another on January 1, 2022, and celebrated the new year, each person owed N191,889.55 as their share of the country\u2019s debt. It is the most each Nigerian would owe as a function of debt per capita (or debt per person) in 10 years.\n\nFrom N45,173 owed by each Nigerian when January 2013 started, to N159,675 at the beginning of last year (2021), it became N191,889 when this year (2022) started, BusinessDay analysis of data on Nigeria\u2019s debt shows.\n\nData released yesterday by the Debt Management Office (DMO), has shown that Nigeria\u2019s total debt as at December 31, 2021, was N39.55 trillion. When this is divided by an estimated population of 206 million according to World Bank data, it gives N191,889.55 (earlier referenced), as a representation of what the debt per head, or debt per capita translates into. When non-Nigerians who are part of the population estimate are removed, the debt owed by every Nigerian would increase, at least theoretically.\n\nCompared over a 10 year period (using data from 2012 to 2021), as the debt stock increases, so does what every Nigerian owes when all of the country\u2019s debts (Federal, State and FCT) are divided per person. Debt per capita for a year is calculated as what was owed at the end of the previous year, which would be the opening debt stock for that year.\n\nFor instance, what each person owed at the beginning of 2022, is derived by dividing the complete debt stock at the end of 2021 (the previous) and the population estimate for that year.\n\nAt the end of (December) 2012, Nigeria\u2019s total debt was N7.5 trillion, and with a World Bank population estimate of 167 million people, each Nigerian owed N45,173 as they started 2013 (in January).\n\nAt the beginning of 2014, Nigeria\u2019s total debt stock had increased to N10 trillion, and with a World Bank population estimate of 171 million people, each Nigerian owed N58,486 at the beginning of that year.\n\nWhen 2015 started, Nigeria was owing N11.2 trillion, and with a population estimate of 176 million people, each Nigerian was equally owing N63,734.\n\nRead also: Nigeria\u2019s debt hits N39trn, says DMO\n\nWhen the year 2016 kicked off, Nigeria was owing N12.6 trillion, out of which each Nigerian owed N69,580 based on a population of 181 million.\n\nBy the beginning of 2017, the debt stock had its first major jump to N17.3 trillion, and by that year, each Nigerian\u2019s debt became N93,353, with a population estimate of 185 million people.\n\nThe debt stock quickened by the beginning of 2018, reaching N21.7 trillion and by that year, each Nigerian\u2019s debt crossed six digits to become N113,823 based on a population of 190 million people.\n\nWhen 2019 began, the debt had increased to N24.3 trillion, and each Nigerian owed N124,503. The population estimate was 195 million people.\n\nAt the beginning of 2020, the pandemic year, Nigeria was owing N27.4 trillion, and with a population estimate of 200 million, each Nigerian owed N136,349.\n\nBy the beginning of 2021, Nigeria\u2019s debt had increased (yet again) to N32.9 trillion. This implies that at the start of last year, each Nigerian owed N159,675 based on a population of 206 million people.\n\nThe same population estimate of 206 million (the last available estimate from the World Bank at the time of this report), was also used to calculate the debt stock at the end of 2021, which then gives the value for when 2022 began.\n\nThe country\u2019s ballooning debt stock has been a source of concern in recent years, with several commentators warning of a potential debt trap, which future generations may be saddled with and arguable benefits to be seen from the rapidly increasing borrowing.",

          "text": "The worsening blackout in Nigeria following the collapse of the national grid twice this week has put the reform efforts of the Federal Government under the spotlight, with industry experts raising concerns over the state of the power sector.\n\nNigerians are facing persistent power outages, a situation that is affecting households and reducing the productivity of businesses, many of whom are struggling to pour capital into backup generators instead of investing in staff or equipment.\n\nThe sector was privatised in November 2013 but power generated and made available on the national grid, which was around 3,500MW and 3,834MW then, currently hovers at 4,000-4,500 MW on the average, eight years after.\n\nTotal power generation in the country stood at 3,051MW as of 6am on Thursday, according to data from the Nigeria Electricity System Operator.\n\nIn 2020, the World Bank announced a plan to invest $750 million in Nigeria\u2019s power sector, to improve the reliability of electricity supply, achieve financial and fiscal sustainability, and ensure at least 4,500 megawatts-hour/hour of electricity is supplied to the distribution grid from 2022.\n\n\u201cThe objective of this operation is to help turn around the power sector and set it on a fiscally sustainable path,\u201d Shubham Chaudhuri, World Bank country director for Nigeria said on June 23, 2020.\n\nBusinessDay gathered that only about $94.6 million out of the $750 intervention fund had been disbursed so far.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2018, Barack Obama\u2019s Power Africa Initiative said it injected about $1 billion to revive Nigeria\u2019s power sector.\n\nSince 2013, the Nigerian government, through the Central Bank of Nigeria, has provided intervention funding for the power sector up to the tune of N1.6 trillion.\n\nThe CBN\u2019s interventions in the power sector include Power and Aviation Intervention Fund (N300 billion) and the Nigerian Electricity Market Stabilisation Facility (N213 billion).\n\n\u201cNigeria has some of the most brilliant ideas or templates on how to fix the power sector; the major problem is implementation,\u201d Ayodele Oni, energy lawyer at Bloomfield Law Practice, told BusinessDay.\n\nAccording to him, there are lots of deep-seated and multi-faceted problems facing the value chain of Nigeria\u2019s electricity sector which money alone cannot solve.\n\nNigeria\u2019s grid with a transmission wheeling capacity of 8,100MW cannot move more than 5,000MW without the entire system cranking up. This year alone, the grid has collapsed three times.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2019, Nigerian electricity consumers have had to contend with 206 power grid collapses, nine of which occurred in 2019, according to data from the system operator, a section of the Transmission Company of Nigeria.\n\nA breakdown of the data showed that Nigeria witnessed 146 total collapses of the national grid and 73 partial collapses between the periods.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge challenge and we have to rethink and reimagine how to deliver electricity reliability to Nigeria,\u201d Eyo Ekpo Eyo, former commissioner at the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), said.\n\nNigeria is now banking on the support of multilateral organisations like the World Bank\u2019s $750 million credit and a deal with German electricity company Siemens to increase generation and raise distribution capacity three-fold to 11,000MW by 2023 at the cost of over $3 billion.\n\n\u201cAfter years of neglect, Nigeria needs to stop expecting miracles. A lot of the current investment will take time before we noticed any improvement in the national grid,\u201d Oni said.\n\nIn its newly released report, Wood Mackenzie, an intelligence provider that empowers decision-makers with unique insights, said, \u201cThe average Nigerian consumes less than a third of the electricity used every year by a moderately efficient American refrigerator.\u201d\n\nAccording to the World Bank, 85 million Nigerians, representing 43 percent of the country\u2019s population, don\u2019t have access to grid electricity, making Nigeria the country with the largest energy access deficit in the world.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of gaps on the grid, especially the distribution arm which the operators seem to be ignoring,\u201d Oni said.\n\nThe World Bank had on February 5 2021 approved another $500 million support fund to help boost electricity access by improving the performance of the electricity distribution companies through a large-scale metering programme.\n\nResponding to questions from BusinessDay concerning the scheme, Chaudhuri said, \u201cWe can\u2019t begin disbursement or even move with it until the National Assembly approves it\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have to keep running at full speed even though we see a wall, in this case, the wall we see is the National Assembly approval,\u201d Chaudhuri said on November 30.\n\nOn Wednesday, efforts to get the National Assembly\u2019s response to this statement proved abortive as the Senate spokesperson, Basiru Ajibola, and his House of Representatives counterpart, Benjamin Kalu, did not pick their calls or respond to text messages sent to their mobile numbers.\n\nThe chairman, House Committee on Power, Aliyu Magaji Dau was also not available to respond to questions from BusinessDay about the discussion.\n\nNERC, on Wednesday, confirmed the federal government\u2019s removal of electricity subsidies, adding that the commission will review tariff rates every six months.\n\nSanusi Garba, NERC chairman, said electricity subsidy had been reduced over the last four to five years due to its unsustainable nature in terms of investor return on investment.\n\nEXPLAINER: Why does the national power grid collapse frequently?\n\nNigerians are experiencing escalating power outages after the national electricity grid suffered two major failures on Monday and Tuesday, cutting off power supply to homes in the midst of scorching weather and a surge in fuel and diesel prices.\n\nThis, in turn, is having a significant impact on businesses as it threatens their survival and has raised further concerns about the country\u2019s power sector\u2019s trajectory.\n\nRead also: Rising energy cost: What is your experience as a tenant living in serviced apartment?\n\nNigeria has the capacity to generate 13,000 megawatts of power, but its aging grid provides only about 5,000MW of power to its 200 million citizens \u2014 roughly the same as the city of Edinburgh provides for its 500,000 residents.\n\nThe grid, managed by the government-owned Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN), has continued to suffer system collapse over the years amid a lack of spinning reserve that is meant to forestall such occurrences.\n\nPower grid\n\nA power grid is a network of electrical transmission lines that connects several generating stations to loads spread across a large area.\n\nGenerator stations, transmission lines and towers, and individual consumer distribution lines comprise the power grid.\n\nIt is intended to operate within certain limits, known as stability limits, in accordance with voltage, current, and frequency.\n\nAs a result, whenever these limits are outside of the stability range, the grid\u2019s operation becomes unstable and may collapse.\n\nConsequences of national grid collapse\n\nAccording to the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), the grid collapse is divided into two basically; which include the total grid collapse and the partial grid collapse.\n\nThe total system collapse according to NERC means a total blackout nationwide while the partial system collapse is a failure of the section of the grid.\n\nThe end product of both system failures is that it leads to erratic power supply. NERC says the power grid will remain vulnerable without adequate spinning reserves.\n\nWhat is a spinning reserve?\n\nA spinning reserve is the generation capacity that is online but unloaded and that can respond within 10 minutes to compensate for generation or transmission outages.\n\nPower stations that supply the grid ought to have a spinning reserve, when not available, collapse becomes certain. The grid also fails when there\u2019s also too much generation that it is incapable of wheeling it across the country.\n\nFrequent fluctuations and distortions are other technical issues that affect the integrity of the grid.\n\nNERC says that adequate technology and infrastructural investment including smart grids could make a difference.\n\nAccording to TCN data, the national grid has collapsed 108 times since the power sector was privatised.\n\nNigeria experienced 146 total national grid collapses and 73 partial collapses between the periods, since 2010.",

The 46-lane highway corridor will connect Lagos, Cotonou, Lome, Accra, and Abidjan,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt will support 75 percent of the trade in the West African region. The project will impact the lives of over 500 million people. It would reduce transport costs by 48 percent. It would increase intra-regional trade volume by 15 to 25 percent. It would connect land-locked cities to port countries.\u201d\n\nThe AfDB president added that the Affirmative Finance Action for Women in Africa (AFAWA) has been critical in supporting women\u2019s businesses.\n\nHe explained that in 2021, the AfDB provided $450 million in support of women\u2019s businesses in Africa, and in 2022, the Bank expects to provide $500 million in support of women-owned businesses.\n\n\u201cThe AfDB will also be establishing a $1m AFAWA women advisory facility to support women with advisory services,\u201d he added",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nOsun Debt Management Office (DMO) has cautioned the immediate past Commissioner for Finance in the state, Dr Wale Bolorunduro against misleading the public with wrong narratives as regards the state\u2019s debt portfolio.\n\nThe DMO said Dr Bolorunduro should be reminded that he served as Commissioner for Finance for only three years in an administration which completed two terms of eight years, hence lacks full knowledge of what really transpired under the administration.\n\nThis is contained in a statement by the Director General, Osun DMO, Dr Tunde Adejumo, in response to a write up by Bolorunduro which was published in a weekly local newspaper \u201cThe Osun Defender\u201d last week.\n\nThe DG, Osun DMO, stressed that there was no need for the state\u2019s total debt stock to become a subject of argument when there is a federal repository of debts stocks in the country, explaining that the country\u2019s Debt Management Office (DMO) keeps records of all borrowings by both the federal and states\u2019 governments in the country.\n\n\u201cOn the issue of the State\u2019s monthly loan repayments, and monthly loan deductions from the Statutory receipts, these are verifiable details from both the offices of Accountant-General (AG) of the Federation and Federal Ministry of Finance (FMoF). Therefore, the unending narratives on Osun State\u2019s Debt Stock and loan repayments from the former Commissioner of finance, in our view are mischievous and needless,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cConcerning the State\u2019s total debt portfolio which Dr. Bolorunduro think is secretive (as it was during his time in the State\u2019s ministry of finance), as usual, our office actually has nothing to hide. According to our records, the State\u2019s total debt portfolio inherited by the current administration was truly well over =N=200billion.\n\n\u201cOn the issue of deductions from the State\u2019s monthly statutory accounts, and fund applied so far for loan repayments by the current administration, as at November 2018, monthly direct deductions for repayment of the State\u2019s loan was =N=2.61billion.\n\n\u201cThis excludes other deductions from the State\u2019s IGR for internal loans\u2019 repayments. This amounted to over =N= 130million. Following the full repayments of the State\u2019s =N=30billion Bond and =N=11.4billion Sukuk in 2019 and 2020 respectively however, direct deductions from the State\u2019s monthly revenue had reduced to =N=1.8billion, while indirect deductions (from the State\u2019s IGR) for loan repayments subsists.\n\n\u201cTotal deductions from the State\u2019s statutory revenue for the month of January 2022, appropriated recently was =N=1,836,968,138.03 (One billion, eight hundred and thirty six million, nine hundred and sixty eight thousand, one hundred and thirty eight Naira, three kobo) only, against a Gross statutory allocation of =N=1.46billion. This can be verified officially from the appropriate agency of the FGN as earlier indicated. I hope our egg-head Doctor could now see that the State government\u2019s claim of negative statutory receipt from the Federation account for the referenced month actually adds up contrary to his insinuation.\n\n\u201cFor avoidance of doubts, we wish to add that till date, the current administration has applied over =N=70billion for the State\u2019s loan repayment. This excludes amount applied for part payment of the Domestic non-borrowing debts such as Pension and gratuity, contractors\u2019 arrears etc inherited from the immediate past administration.\n\n\u201cWhile claiming full knowledge of the State\u2019s financial affairs inclusive of the State\u2019s level of exposure during the preceding administration, Dr. Bolorunduro perhaps needs to be reminded that he served as the State Commissioner of finance under the last administration for only a period of three years ending in November 2014. One therefore wonders why he keeps claiming to be a Registry of all the financial transactions during the whole 8 year tenor of the immediate past administration. Whereas, we are not unaware of his usual clandestine moves and antics in breaking through the State\u2019s firewalls, it will be advisable for him to be sure of his figures at least. It would be recalled that our office had earlier raised concern on his usual contentious statistics and tenuous narratives about the financial affairs of the current government in the State.\n\n\u201cIn his referenced publication, the former commissioner, also made an assertion that monthly loan repayment ordinarily should be met from the State\u2019s Internally Generated Revenue (IGR). As fiscally logical as this argument sounds, it is quite astonishing that this was not the case when the self-acclaimed Financial Guru was in charge of the State\u2019s finance. As a matter of fact, the State\u2019s IGR was at best, only about 25% of the State\u2019s loan repayment throughout his 3 year tenor as Finance commissioner in the State,\u201d the DG, DMO noted.",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nThe Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Eniitan Ogunwusi, Ojaja 11, on Wednesday said Africans, particularly, the Yoruba race, were the architect of glass technology and had started same before the \u2018colonial masters took it from us.\u2019\n\nThe monarch who spoke at the official unveiling the Igbo Olokun Heritage Site at Ile-Ife in Osun State also said efforts were being Intensified to retrieve all the Yoruba artifacts taken away by the foreigners.\n\nHe said the community is making history in the world through culture and anthropological artwork, showcasing cultural heritage.\n\nAccording to the monarch, arts and culture are significant to every black man living on the surface of the earth because it\u2019s been proven globally that civilization indeed started from the black.\n\nAccording to him, the cradle of civilization has come to stay in Ife as the young generation will come to learn from the history of their forefathers through exhibition of Art work.\n\nHis words: \u201cYoung people go to institutions to learn about physics, chemistry and other sciences, but the main practical sciences have been well established here in Ife over 4,000 years ago and our ancestors have actually come up with initiatives of material science. So basically, we can call them material scientists.\n\n\u201cIt has now been established that technology is behind the glass. We can see today now that we can\u2019t even do without glass technology,\u201d he stated\n\n\u201cThe way we drive our cars, that\u2019s the windscreen that is making us to have visualization but they would probably think that the technology didn\u2019t start from us (we the black people). It has now been proven that we are the first to do it in the world, so, it calls for celebration, not only for, Ife but also for the entire black race, because truly speaking, this is the cradle of civilization and the western world have been trying to dig deep to find out how this whole thing started.\n\n\u201cThey came and told us that they were the ones that discovered River Niger in the early 16th century, the Portuguese. River Niger has been there for many centuries, thanks to our ancestors. But during the research, they went to a market in Kartungua of the old Oyo Empire and they saw some very special objects in the early 18th century, specifically, Richard Ladnah put it in his journal which is all over the museums globally now, that he saw something in Katangua, old Oyo empire and every body said that you can only find it where all of us came from which is the city of Ife. He traced it back here in 1830 and was marvelled to see a very broad-based industry rolling out glass technology in millions and it is being spread across the world.\n\n\u201cThey started doing that research further. Another set came in, Germans came in the early 19th century, Leo Fibohnior came in 1910 and they kept digging and that was when they saw the symbol of Yoruba people which is the Ori Olokun. Some of the first sets were taken from Wumonije compound all the way to British museum, but this was freshly discovered here and it is actually linked to bronze technology, Iron technology which is the Iron and Bronze age, all the way to using Aluminum as a technology, using Copper, using Gold.\n\n\u201cThe Malian empire, the Songai empire headed by Mansa Munsa, we have all seen them coming here to see the way and manner our ancestors were material scientists. So, it calls for celebration for the entire continent of Africa.\n\n\u201cThey will tell us that they are the ones that discovered chemistry, physics, but all that is not true because there is evident here now. So, we in Ife on behalf of the entire Yourba people and on behalf of the entire black people, it has actually been established today and nobody can prove otherwise that we were the first material scientists as far as physics and chemistry are concerned.\n\n\u201cWe have seen glass crucibles here dated over 4,000 years and our ancestors were passing it down from generation to generation and we can see it evidently. What we are using as a symbol for the Yoruba people was first of all dug here.\u201d",

          "text": "What\u2019s a Conversation?\n\nThe dictionary describes a conversation as an informal talk between two or more people in which information and ideas are exchanged.\n\nA good conversationalist who knows what we say and how we say it can make the difference between clarifying a point or confusing it, and giving comfort or offence.\n\nBeing a good conversationalist requires you to be able to \u201clisten\u201d and also \u201cthink before you speak\u201d, so I am going to be sharing the three tiers of a conversation. This will enable you to determine if a conversation is safe or unsafe.\n\nTier 1: Small Talk\n\nMovies, sports, the weather, food, pop culture and music are all usually safe topics anywhere and with anybody. Learn about these topics so that at any given time you can hold a good conversation on any of them.\n\nTier 2: Controversial Topics\n\nReligion, sex and politics are all very controversial topics. People tend to have strong and very different opinions about these topics, so they are to be approached very carefully, if at all.\n\nNever assume someone holds the same views as you do on any of these particular topics, even if you share other things in common.\n\nTier3: Personal Information\n\nFinancial matters, personal health, and family are very personal matters that people only share with people close to them, and the person these matters are shared with must show discretion and tact by treating these matters as such.\n\nWith these topics, it is best not to ask probing questions about others or offer too much information about your own circumstances.\n\nRemember, these topics are best reserved for private discussion with those you trust to respect your personal information.\n\nConversation Killers\n\n\u00b7 Why aren\u2019t you getting married or having kids?\n\n\u00b7 You look pale, are you ill?\n\n\u00b7 You have bags under your eyes, are you not able to sleep?\n\n\u00b7 When are you getting married?\n\n\u00b7 When are you due?\n\n\u00b7 You look great, have you lost weight?\n\n\u00b7 How much is your salary?",

          "text": "What is fulfilment without some sort of financial security? However little, money makes the world go round, and enables us live a good life and achieve our aims. There is no way of achieving all of this without hard work. With our busy schedules, we sometimes forget that staying healthy is a priority. After all, good health is the necessary wealth that is needed to navigate through life.\n\nThe hustle and bustle of life shifts our focus and when we get hungry, we grab the next available thing to eat, most of the time fast foods laden with trans-fat and other foods made with oils we cannot vouch for.\n\nWhen cooking, a lot of people do not pay attention to the nutritional value of the meals being prepared. The COVID-19 pandemic has made this even more difficult as many homes now operate on a shoestring budget. Cooking oil is often used and reused until they turn dark and putrid in a bid to save cost. Whether you\u2019re dependent on fast foods or economising food resources, trans-fat has slowly crept into the meals of everyday Nigerians regardless of their social class.\n\nThere are two types of hydrogenated oils \u2013 partially hydrogenated and fully hydrogenated oil. Partially hydrogenated oil increases the bad cholesterol and lowers the good cholesterol in the body which could lead to cardiovascular and other heart-related diseases, while a fully hydrogenated oil contains less trans-fat and is of less risk to the body.\n\nExperts warn and urge the world to pay attention to their diet. The World Health Organisation (WHO) in 2021 reported that cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of deaths globally.\n\nA year earlier, an estimated 17.9 million people died from CVDs, representing 32 percent of all global deaths. Of these deaths, 85 percent was due to heart attack and stroke. WHO estimates that there are 500,000 global deaths per year due to coronary heart diseases attributed to trans-fatty acids.\n\nHema Khanchandani, a director of advocacy with the Global Health Advocacy Incubator (GHAI), says Nigeria recorded about 3, 229 deaths attributed to trans-fat-related cardiovascular diseases in 2019. Foods responsible for such illnesses include chin-chin, bean cake, noodles, plantain chips, fried and baked foods, etc.\n\nRegardless of what our daily routine is, it is important to pay adequate attention to your food intake and diet. To avoid the accumulation of trans-fatty acids, caution must be applied when consuming foods with partially hydrogenated oil and fried foods. We must be careful with margarine, crackers, packaged and frozen foods and opt instead for fully hydrogenated oil which poses less risk.\n\nPalm oil, olive oil and avocado oil are considered safe to consume in moderation.\n\nYou could create a proper work and diet plan for yourself to help you live a fulfilled life. As it is almost impossible to identify foods that are prepared with trans-fat oil without proper labelling and regulations on limit of trans-fat in processed foods, consumption must be done with caution and in moderation.\n\nWith cardiovascular disease on the rise, it\u2019s important for NAFDAC and the health authorities to ensure that these regulations become laws so that Nigerians can be aware and have a reference point regarding their trans-fat consumption, and for industry players to properly monitor what is put in the market.\n\nIt is said that health is wealth.",

Two things first; there\u2019s a man for the season. Every season has a man that he chooses. Secondly, Nigeria is looking for a change. They are tired of the kind of old men we are talking about. They know them. They have held some political offices. And they have seen the amount of change or evolution or development brought and Nigeria is not ready for incremental improvement. They want a wholesome transformation of the nation. And I haven\u2019t seen any of them or Nigerians haven\u2019t seen any of these men who meet that expectation.\n\n\u201cSecondly, Nigerians want something new. They are looking forward to seeing new faces, new ideas, and new thoughts because they have seen the best of them, the likes and who can know how to yell and shout on the radio, on television, and in the streets.\n\n\u201cThe advantage I have is that I am on one side. All of them are on one side, but on my side we are very few. So, Nigerians and I believe they will not bring anything new because we have seen this recycling of the same political people. Many are good, but you know when better things come, good things give way. I think my coming presents that better thing. So, good things will give way because Nigeria wants a transformation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not worried or scared about the likes of Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, and others who want the PDP ticket. Atiku is a very wonderful politician, but his time has come and gone. That\u2019s my reading. There is a man for every season. My people say that the cock does not crow all night. The masquerade dances and leaves the stage for others. Nigerians are looking for something new, something fresh \u2013 somebody who can fix the economy; somebody who can unite the nation and a man that has courage.\u201d\n\nAlso, barring his mind on the performance of the President Muhammadu Buhari administration, especially as it relates to the economy, he said Nigerians were told by the president that the APC government was coming to do three things \u2013 economy, security, and fight corruption.\n\n\u201cGo and check our corruption perception index; have we improved? Check security; has security improved? The economy, the poverty level we were in 2015 is not the one we are now. The 53% unemployment youth population is not what it was in 2015.\n\n\u201cSo, how do we measure performance? It is to measure results. One day the president impressed me when he said \u2018when it comes to security we have done our best, but it looks like our best is not good enough.\u2019 So, use their performance to measure the result. President Buhari has tried, but\u2026\u201d (Read more on this on Page 5)",

          "title": "Abramovich Handed Chelsea Director Control of Firm on Day of Ukraine Unvasion",
          "text": "Russian businessman Roman Abramovich transferred a company he controlled with tens of millions of dollars of investments to a director of English soccer club Chelsea on the day Russia invaded Ukraine, UK corporate filings showed.\n\nIt was the second time Chelsea owner Abramovich moved assets to a close associate before Britain and the European Union imposed sanctions on him this month.\n\nAfter Britain was initially slower than the United States and the European Union in imposing sanctions following the Feb. 24 invasion, British lawmakers complained that the government was giving oligarchs time to move their assets out of the country before any curbs were announced.\n\nAbramovich did not respond to requests for comment left with Chelsea and his spokesperson. A British government spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAbramovich, 55, became one of Russia\u2019s most powerful entrepreneurs mostly from oil and aluminium during the chaotic aftermath of the 1991 break-up of the Soviet Union. Forbes last month put his net worth at more than $13 billion.\n\nBritain and the EU imposed sanctions such as asset freezes on Abramovich and hundreds of Russian individuals and entities, targeting people accused of propping up Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nAbramovich has denied having close links to Putin.\n\nA Reuters analysis of corporate filings in London and Amsterdam showed Abramovich was previously listed as the \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d of Cyprus-based Ervington Investments Limited. The company has made investments in at least eight firms, including in Russia\u2019s top search engine Yandex, the filings showed.\n\nOn Feb. 24, Eugene Tenenbaum, a director of Chelsea who is described on the club website as one of Abramovich\u2019s \u201cclosest associates\u201d, took full control of Ervington, according to a filing with the London Stock Exchange. Neither Britain, the EU nor the United States has placed sanctions on Tenenbaum.\n\nTenenbaum said in a statement to Reuters that his company purchased Ervington Investments from a trust in which Abramovich and his children were previously the beneficiaries. He said the purchase from the trust, called Norma Investments, was in compliance with laws and regulations. Tenenbaum declined to say how much he paid for the stake.\n\n\u201cErvington is a company that I have worked with for many years,\u201d he said. \u201cI know the company\u2019s investments and employees well, and buying Ervington provides me with an opportunity to continue to work with this business, under my control and for my, and the employees\u2019 benefit.\u201d\n\nASSET MOVEMENTS\n\nLondon-based lawyers said the move meant that the assets held by Ervington would not be subject to the freeze imposed on Abramovich\u2019s other assets.\n\nAbramovich has handed control of two companies to business associates since the war began, according to corporate filings.\n\nAlso on the first day of Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine, which Moscow calls a special operation, Abramovich moved Norma Investments to another associate, David Davidovich, UK corporate filings showed. The Norma transfer was first reported by the Wall Street Journal and has been confirmed in the filings.\n\nReuters was unable to reach Davidovich immediately for comment.\n\nBritain imposed sanctions on Abramovich on March 10, saying he had profited from transactions with the Russian government and special tax breaks.\n\nThe British government said Evraz, a steel company in which Abramovich is the largest shareholder, could contribute to the war against Ukraine and supply steel for Russian tanks. Evraz has denied this, saying it only supplies steel to the infrastructure and construction sectors.\n\nEvraz has not been sanctioned by the British government. Its London-listed shares were suspended by Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority after Abramovich was sanctioned. Tenenbaum was among 10 of Evraz\u2019s board members who quit on March 11 because of the Abramovich sanctions, the company said.\n\nAbramovich put reigning European champions Chelsea up for sale on March 2, but following the sanctions announcement, the club was made to operate under a special licence and is now effectively controlled by the British government.\n\nSeveral potential buyers of Chelsea have confirmed their interest and the deadline for the first round of bids is Friday. read more\n\nRELATIONSHIP ENDED\n\nTenenbaum, 57, was born in Ukraine when it was part of the Soviet Union and has been on Chelsea\u2019s board for 19 years. He was previously the head of corporate finance at Sibneft, an oil company sold in 2006 by Abramovich.\n\nTenenbaum said in his statement that he does not agree with the way Abramovich has been publicly characterised. The British government said when it sanctioned Abramovich that he had been a close ally of Putin for decades.\n\n\u201cIt is my hope that the unjust measures imposed on Mr Abramovich will be reassessed,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, as a British citizen and due to the new regulations, I am unable to continue to work with him personally.\u201d\n\nErvington has served as an investment vehicle for Abramovich for at least eight years. It was among investors who put $600 million into Yandex in 2020 and who put money into Via, a ride-sharing app.\n\nTenenbaum moved to Canada at a young age and previously worked for accounting firm KPMG in Toronto, Moscow and London, according to the Chelsea website.\n\nReuters",

          "text": "Bianca Ojukwu, a former Nigerian ambassador to Spain and widow of the late Chukwuemeka Odumegwu-Ojukwu, has recounted what transpired on Thursday at the inauguration of Anambra governor, Charles Soludo, where she was involved in altercation with Ebele Obiano, the wife of the immediate past governor of Anambra State, Willie Obiano.\n\nIn a statement titled \u2018My Story\u2019 which was exclusive to ARISE News, the former beauty queen explained that she was assaulted verbally without provocation, and was taunted repeatedly by the former First Lady, which prompted the reaction from her that has now gone viral on social media.\n\nRead her explanation below:\n\nMY STORY\n\nAs the inaugural ceremonies for Prof Charles Soludo and his deputy began and all guests were seated, the former First Lady of Anambra State, Mrs Ebele Obiano, was noticeably absent.\n\nShe then arrived some one-and-a-half hours later while the ceremony was on. I didn\u2019t pay any particular attention to her arrival.\n\nSurprisingly, she then walked towards me and I thought she was coming to greet me. Instead, when she got to where I was seated, she verbally attacked me with her voice raised, taunting me and asking me what I was there to do and using unprintable vile language.\n\nShe asked if I had come to celebrate their last day in office. But I ignored her completely.\n\nThen, she kept aggressively putting her hands on my shoulders and shouting. While I ignored her verbal onslaught, as advised by those sitting around me, I requested twice that she refrain from touching me with her hands.\n\nShe proceeded to do so yet again and went further to grab at my headtie, which she attempted unsuccessfully to remove .\n\nThis very act is considered a sacrilege to a titled matriarch such as myself in Igbo culture. It was at this point that I stood up to defend myself and gave her a dirty slap to stop her from attacking me.\n\nAs she made towards me, I then pulled away her wig. She held on to her wig with her two hands and tried to take the wig away from me.\n\nThe former APGA chairman, Umeh, told her to leave me and told engaged APGA members that had gathered at the spot to lead her away, which they did and took her to the seat next to her husband Chief Willie Obiano who sat through the entire episode completely speechless.\n\nWhat struck me through the whole episode was the fact that she was clearly intoxicated. I was stunned by the stench of whisky in her breath at such an early hour of the day.\n\nHow could a first lady be so drunk and proceeded to turn up in that state at an Inauguration ceremony that began at 9am?\n\nIt is unfortunate that she threw all caution to the wind and imported this kind of melodrama to a state ceremony.\n\nThis was highly embarrassing to the Governor who left the venue almost immediately, taking her along with him.\n\nLuckily, this did not disrupt the proceedings and I stayed back to witness the ceremony to the end after which we were treated to a sumptuous reception at the Government House.\n\n\u2013 Ambassador Bianca Odimegwu- Ojukwu, former Nigerian Ambassador to Spain and APGA BOT member.\n\nEditor",
