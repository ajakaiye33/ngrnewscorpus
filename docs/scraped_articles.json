          "text": "By Vincent Ujumadu, Awka\n\nNigerian Radiographers have identified poor leadership as the reason the Nigerian health sector is at its moribund state.\n\nReacting to a recent opposition of the Medical and Dental Consultants\u2019 Association of Nigeria (MDCAN) and the Association of Provosts of Colleges of Medicine in Nigeria (APCOM) to the proposed teaching hospitals board bill, the Radiographers said Nigerian physicians should realize that there are other professionals in the health sector whose expertise are required to move the health sector forward.\n\nThe president of the Association of Radiographers of Nigeria, Dr.Dlama Joseph and the secretary, Dr. Samuel Laushugno described the proposed bill as capable of reforming the Nigerian health sector starting from the apex hospitals; the university teaching hospitals.\n\nThey said: \u201cIt is time to do things the right way. It is time for real health administrators to be appointed to these offices in order to turn things around.\n\n.\u201dTo put the records straight, the best hospitals in the world are not necessarily managed by physicians, but by seasoned health administrators who have obtained higher degrees in management and administration with cognate experience, even if they have a background as part of any professions in the healthcare work force.\n\n\u201cPossession of a degree in any healthcare profession is only considered as an added advantage.\n\n\u201cIn an even more sinister write-up, APCOM alluded to notions that the position of the Chief Executive Officer is an exclusive preserve of medical physicians. This is obnoxious, derogatory and misleading.\n\n\u201cThe assertion is self-serving and unheard of in saner climes and should not be tolerated in a healthcare sector which APCOM itself has described as _\u2019frail and desperately sick.\n\n\u201cWe therefore, wish to clarify that other health professions, equally, if not on a much larger scale, are well grounded by their extensive training to manage hospitals and any other facilities.\n\n\u201cHealth professionals such as Radiographers, Pharmacists, Medical Laboratory Scientists, Nurses, Physiotherapists and Optometrists, among others have gone ahead to obtain requisite higher degrees in Hospital or HealthCare administration and management, thereby making them more eminently qualified to hold such positions in hospitals\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe commend the conscientious efforts of Hon Bamidele Salam who proposed the bill, and the national assembly for their assiduous efforts to uphold and bring transformation in the Nigerian health institutions.\n\n\u201cWe urge them to stick to the global best practices where hospital administrators are in charge of hospitals while all the different health professionals are hired to carry our their specific responsibilities as required by the facility.\n\n\u201cThis bill should therefore be given judicious and express passage as an elixir to the suffocating \u2018political patronage\u2019 that has become of hospital administration in our clime which has totally derailed efficient and quality professional services due to over-protectionism of professional colleagues among physicians\u201d.\n\nThey regretted that physicians have always usurped leadership and administration of tertiary hospitals with no recourse to quality administration and management, adding that the position of MDCAN which alludes to the opinion that only physicians can lead tertiary hospitals, is false.",

Asiwaju has the political capital to bring investment to this country\u201d, Adewale had said.\n\nBut Chief Essien while reacting on Friday in Uyo, said that such a campaign talk is only meant for the marines, insisting that the APC Presidential Candidate has no such magic wand to turn the Naira around to equate in value with the dollar.\n\nThe former member of the House of Representatives, on the platform of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) who described the claim as unrealistic recalled that Tinubu made similar statement in 2015 presidential campaign for Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nHis words: \u201cTinubu made this kind of statement in 2015, when he was campaigning for Muhammadu Buhari. Seven years along the line, he couldn\u2019t show the president how to appreciate the Naira, why then should anybody with knowledge of how the global economy works, believe him.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how it started in 2014, leading to the opposition against President Goodluck Jonathan on how the Naira will be at par with the US Dollar if Buhari is voted to power. That claim is unrealistic, given the fact that he may likely follow the economic path of Buhari if voted into power.\n\n\u201cWhy has Tinubu failed to assist President Buhari in arresting the steady fall of the Naira against other international currencies but waiting until he becomes President in 2023 before he miraculously intervene\u201d\n\nChief Essien expressed disappointment over the abysmal depreciation of the Naira from where this administration in which Tinubu is a co-traveller met it at the sum of N150 to present day value of N610 to a US dollar ($1).\n\n\u201cInternational currencies are not manipulated the way Bola Tinubu surreptitiously took the Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited Headquarters to Lagos away from its area of operations to the detriment of the Oil Producing Areas and has continued to sustain its maintenance there despite all the protestations from the rest of the country and in keeping with international best practice.\n\n\u201cTinubu cannot be trusted because as the leader of the All Progressive Congress, the party has failed the country in all its campaign promises, he has nothing new to offer the nation\u201d, He asserted.\n\nHe called on all Nigerians of voting age to make use of the extension given by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on registration for PVC, so as to be part of the leadership recruitment process.",

          "text": "By Bolaji Ogundele, Abuja and AbdulGafar Alabelewe, Kaduna\n\nPresident: last 12 years most challenging\n\nNigeria to sustain sub-regional security collaboration\n\nThe military got fresh marching orders yesterday from President Muhammadu Buhari: wipe out terrorists.\n\nHe said the last 12 years have been the most challenging due to insecurity.\n\nThe North has been reeling under serious terrorism and bandit attacks which have taken a turn for the worse.\n\nThere have been attacks on communities, kidnapping for ransom, insurgency and incessant farmer-herder clashes, among others.\n\nIn a renewed wave of terror, terrorists in March blew up rail tracks on the Abuja-Kaduna route.\n\nEight passengers were killed on the Kaduna-bound train; 41 people were injured, while many were abducted.\n\nOn July 5, terrorists attacked the Kuje Correctional Centre in Abuja, freeing all 64 Boko Haram commanders and men, as well over 400 inmates.\n\nFour inmates and an operative of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) were killed during the attack for which the Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) claimed responsibility.\n\nIn the Southeast, killings and arson have become almost a daily occurrence across the five states.\n\nBut the President said his administration and neighbouring countries will not relent in the war against terror.\n\nHe spoke at the graduation of 247 students of the Senior Course 44 of the Armed Forces Command and Staff College, Jaji, Kaduna State.\n\nThe Monday\u2019s sit-at-home declared by the Independent People of Biafra (IPOB) is taking a toll on the region\u2019s economy.\n\nThe President said: \u201cMost of the security challenges facing the world today are both asymmetric and trans-border in nature, involving mainly non-state actors in different regions and sub-regions of the world.\n\n\u201cThe West African sub-region and indeed our beloved continent of Africa are not immune to these threats.\n\n\u201cWe have witnessed recent terrorist attacks in Nigeria, bearing the hallmark of national and trans-border insurgents trying to cause havoc in Nigeria as well as in neighbouring countries.\n\n\u201cIt will be part of your duty to confront these terrorists and insurgents and wipe them off the face of the earth and bring peace to our countries.\u201d\n\nHe urged the graduates to apply their skills to the anti-terror war.\n\nThe President, who noted the sacrifices and successes of the Nigerian military in defending the country, said his government would continue to provide the needed support.\n\nHe described an aspect of their training, which focused on countering security threats, as very important.\n\n\u201cCombating these prevalent security threats effectively demands that African countries continue to work together at all levels; be it tactical, operational and strategic,\u201d he added.\n\nAppraising the collaboration of the Armed Forces of Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger Republic, Benin Republic and Chad in a multinational operation to combat the Boko Haram insurgency in the Lake Chad region, the President said it has been productive, commendable and successful.\n\n\u201cThe last 12 years have been very challenging for our nation, considering the different security threats that have besieged the country.\n\n\u201cOur government is poised to promote national security and development, as well as to remain committed to promoting a vision of a secure, safe, just, peaceful, prosperous and strong Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe shall be employing all elements of our national power in ensuring security, a just society, peaceful coexistence, national unity and sustainable development while promoting our good standing internationally,\u201d he said.\n\nLauding the Armed Forces for their sacrifices, the President said they had been working tirelessly to enhance their combat effectiveness, operational capability and training necessary to eliminate the threats, in synergy with other institutions and nations.\n\n\u201cThe response of the Armed Forces of Nigeria to the Boko Haram insurgency, banditry, militancy, kidnapping as well as the activities of separatists and armed militias, amongst others, have been commendable.\n\n\u201cThis government will continue to provide the required guidance and support to ensure that the desired results are achieved,\u201d he stressed.\n\nPresident Buhari felicitated the graduates and their families.\n\n\u201cTo the graduating students from Nigeria\u2019s ministries, departments and agencies, you have indeed justified the confidence reposed in you by your respective organisations. Congratulations!\n\n\u201cWe must specially commend the spouses of the graduands here for keeping the home front and without whose sacrifices there would have been no celebrations for many here today,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Buhari also commended the Commandant, Air Vice Marshall (AVM) Olurotimi Tuwase and his management team.\n\n\u201dYour efforts are maintaining the status of the College as a mid-level military training institution of repute.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, commend the College Board as well as the Commandant and staff for these remarkable achievements.\n\n\u201cThis government will continue to support the College in its developmental strides.\n\n\u201cMy administration will also continue to give priority to the training and welfare of officers and men of our Armed Forces.\n\n\u201cYou, the graduating students, should realise that the nation has made a lot of investment in your training up to this stage of your respective careers.\n\n\u201cI am confident that you have been sufficiently groomed in character and learning to take up the challenges you will be confronted with hereafter,\u201d he said.\n\nTuwase said 111 army officers, 69 naval officers, 42 air force officers, 10 students from paramilitary organisations and ministries, departments and agencies, as well as 15 international students, completed the 48 weeks of intensive training, leading to the award of Pass Staff Course (PSC).\n\nInternational students on the Senior Course 44 were from Burkina Faso, Cameroun, Chad, The Gambia, Ghana, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Togo and Zambia.\n\nPresident Buhari presented PSC certificates and awards to select graduands as well as the best graduating students.\n\nMajor Sunday Olayinka Atomode bagged three awards: Minister of Defence Award for highest overall score, Chief of Defence Staff Award for Department of Joint Studies and Chief of Army Staff Award for Department of Land Warfare.\n\nLt.-Cdr. Godwin Emeka Okutue won the Chief of Naval Staff Award for the Department of Marine Warfare; Squadron Leader Peter Chika Echeazu bagged the Chief of Air Staff Award for the Department of Air Warfare.\n\nThe Commandant\u2019s Award for the Best Non-Military Student was awarded to A.M.

The president also instructed that the security vehicles be handed over to the security agencies at the end of the forensic audit exercise and that is why we are doing this today.\n\n\u201cThe ceremony is very symbolic because it tells a very good story about the security agencies. They did their job successfully without hitches. The forensic exercise has helped the NDDC to show projects that were uncompleted.\n\n\u201cThe president graciously directed that upon completion of the job which they did, without any loss of human life, that the vehicles should be handed over to various security agencies as part of federal government\u2019s contribution in solving their logistics problems.\u201d\n\nReceiving the security vehicles on behalf of the security agencies, the representative of the Nigeria Navy on the Joint Security Committee, Rear Admiral Bamidele Oluwagbamila, thanked Buhari and the NDDC for supporting the efforts of the security agencies through the donation of the security vehicles.\n\nHe noted that the security agencies would not relent in their efforts to ensure the security of lives and property in the Niger Delta region.\n\nOluwagbamila remarked that: \u201cThis is a good day for us-the security agencies and the NDDC. The task the federal government gave us to support the forensic audit was successfully carried out. The audit was carried out without any ugly incident. We are grateful that the vehicles have been handed over to us for internal security activities.\u201d\n\nThe Director, Research, Planning and Statistics of the Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs, Mr. Alfred Abba, who represented the Permanent Secretary, thanked Buhari for supporting the forensic audit exercise, and commended the Joint Security Committee for ensuring that the exercise was carried out safely.",

          "text": "Dangote Oil Refinery, which is reputed to be Africa\u2019s biggest oil refinery, may soon run into a deep financial crisis as a result of a $7 billion debt burden \u2013 a situation which indicates a possible takeover of the project by the Assets Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON).\n\nDangote Refinery is an oil refinery owned by the Dangote Group that is under construction in Lekki, Nigeria.\n\nDangote Group is a Nigerian multinational industrial conglomerate, founded by Aliko Dangote, Africa's richest man.\n\nThe Group's interests span a range of sectors in Nigeria and across Africa.\n\nAccording to an analysis by the Money Management Series, Dangote Oil Refinery, a 650,000-barrel per day (BPD) integrated refinery project under construction in the Lekki Free Zone, Lagos, Nigeria, was expected to commence production in 2016 with $3.3 billion financing secured in 2013.\n\nWith the refinery now projected to commence operations in 2025, Dangote Group\u2019s indebtedness to financial institutions is estimated to hit $8.4 billion by 2025.\n\nPresently, this debt burden has risen to $7 billion with debt servicing of almost $700 million per annum.\n\nThe completion date of the refinery has been moved eight times.\n\nWhilst some might say this is not in the character for Dangote Industries and their numerous projects across different sectors, the problem is deeply rooted.\n\nA contractor at the delayed refinery project, speaking under the condition of anonymity, said that poor planning, underpayment of contractors, and a lack of proper project management with over 40 contractors on site have led to most of the delays. He also added that of the 40, none is willing to commission as there is no clear delegation of duty and over-decentralisation leading to absolute chaos.\n\nWith these incessant delays, some financing banks are already calling in their loans amid fears of liquidity crisis, while others are elated by the guarantee of huge interests to be recouped as soon as the refinery comes on stream.\n\nDangote has been able to restructure the facilities from various local and international banks twice so far, but most banks have totally refused to restructure for the third time with principal repayment also falling due as well as the annual interest payments.\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has made available $3.8 billion as part of federal government\u2019s 20% equity in the project, providing $1 billion cash, while the remaining $2.8 billion will be in crude supply.\n\nHowever, analysts have pointed out that NNPC\u2019s 20% equity at $3.8 billion makes the Dangote refinery overvalued at $19 billion.\n\nWhen Aliko Dangote unveiled early plans for the refinery in September 2013 and announced that he had secured about $3.3 billion in financing for the project, the refinery was estimated to cost about $9 billion, of which $3 billion would be invested by the Dangote Group and the remainder via commercial loans, and begin production in 2016.\n\nHowever, after a change in location to Lekki, construction of the refinery did not begin until 2016 with excavation and infrastructure preparation, and the planned completion was pushed back to late 2018.\n\nIn July 2017, major structural construction began, and Dangote estimated that the refinery would be mechanically complete in late 2019 and commissioned in early 2020. Experts, however, posit that the construction would likely take at least twice as long as Dangote publicly stated, with refining capability not likely to be achieved until 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, last week the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, reiterated that Federal Executive Council (FEC) approved the acquisition of 20 per cent minority stakes by the NNPC in the Dangote Petroleum and Petro-Chemical Refinery.\n\nSylva, while briefing State House correspondents after the virtual FEC meeting presided by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo last Wednesday at the Presidential Villa, said the acquisition was in the sum of $2.76 billion.\n\n\u201cThe Executive Council also approved the acquisition of 20 percent minority stakes by the NNPC in the Dangote Petroleum and Petro-Chemical Refineries in the sum of $2.76 billion,\u201d he said.\n\nThis development has been described by industry observers as strange because $2.76 billion falls short of 20 percent of the Dangote project valued by the sponsor at $16 billion. Using the $16 billion value, 20 percent should be $3.2 billion and analysts have expressed dissatisfaction at the disparity in the project\u2019s value and NNPC\u2019s funding.\n\nSpeaking with MMS Plus on the complexities with funding Dangote refinery, the Managing Director of Cowry Assets Management, Mr. Johnson Chukwu, argued that the banks wouldn\u2019t have any challenge from the financing because Dangote would have to pay the interests.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see the banks being unable to meet their liquidity because of the monies tied down in the Dangote refinery. Ultimately, if the investment is economically viable, when it starts operation it should be able to meet up the arrears. I believe the banks that went into this project understood some of these constraints and didn\u2019t break their balance-sheets in the move to finance Dangote refinery. I don\u2019t envisage any bank having a liquidity challenge as a result of investing in Dangote refinery. If there is any challenge it would come from Dangote, but it should be resolved when the project takes off,\u201d he said.\n\nCommenting on the possibility that NNPC over-valued or under-valued the project in its 20% equity, Chukwu opined that NNPC may be looking at an enterprise valuation while the other value could be the net value.\n\n\u201cThe enterprise value could be higher than the amount Dangote has invested in the project. However, I wasn\u2019t involved in determining that, so anything I say will be purely speculative,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite the massive support of the Nigerian government on the refinery project, things have got so bad for the billionaire that even income from his other businesses may not be enough to cover the interest rates, let alone the principal.\n\nThe $8.4 billion debt represents 75% of Dangote\u2019s net worth at $11.1 billion and Africa\u2019s richest man has to seek innovative ways to prop up his business now as the refinery project continues to be consistently delayed.",

          "summary": "Dangote Refinery is an oil refinery owned by the Dangote Group that is under construction in Lekki, Nigeria.\nHowever, analysts have pointed out that NNPC\u2019s 20% equity at $3.8 billion makes the Dangote refinery overvalued at $19 billion.\nUsing the $16 billion value, 20 percent should be $3.2 billion and analysts have expressed dissatisfaction at the disparity in the project\u2019s value and NNPC\u2019s funding.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see the banks being unable to meet their liquidity because of the monies tied down in the Dangote refinery.\nI don\u2019t envisage any bank having a liquidity challenge as a result of investing in Dangote refinery.",

          "title": "POS Agent Laments Loss Of Over N250,000 To Defective Payment Machine And Failure Of Company, PayForce To Rectify Issues",
          "text": "A point of sale (POS) agent identified as Oluwakorede Noah has raised the alarm over the refusal of Crowd Force, a distribution network, to address complaints of failed financial transactions for over a month.\n\n\n\nNoah told SaharaReporters that his POS business has recorded losses running into N250, 000 because of the company's refusal to contact the bank and trace unsuccessful transactions.\n\nAccording to Noah, he was introduced to the company's product, PayForce and had been an agent on the platform. However, he started observing malfunctions in the machine as customers\u2019 accounts get debited and his own wallet was not credited.\n\n\n\nHe said the machine complicates the issue by noting that the transaction had been approved which increases the impatience of the customer who had already been debited. However, Noah said he had only recorded losses as this amount does not get credited to his own account (wallet).\n\n\n\nHe said efforts made to ensure the company resolves the dispense error issues had proved abortive, adding that he only had about N9,000 left to run his business.\n\n\n\nHe said, \u201cI have been working with PayForce as a POS agent. We started noticing N1 dispense error on every transaction from them and we didn't notice it early enough until someone told us how to check it.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere was one transaction that happened N80,200; the whole money just disappeared. There was no money in our wallet and the customer had been debited. I reached out to them through several messages; they would ask me to input my username, sponsor, etc. but funnily enough, my sponsor (field agent) has not been reachable since January.\n\n\n\n\"If you call him, he'll tell you he's in the bank, etc. Now the guy is nowhere to be found, they have no office here in Lagos.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnother thing is the other contact they shared with us said he resigned from the company in February and they kept sending his number to us to call him. The guy said he had already left for another job and that he could send his resignation letter to me if I didn\u2019t mind, I informed the company about this, and then they said their regional manager would reach out to me.\n\n\n\n\u201cTill now, as I speak, the entire loss is in the range of N250, 000. They told me they would send N5,000 to one of my customers but I felt; how does that have anything to do with me?\n\n\n\n\u201cI am a graduate but ventured into POS business to take care of my family but now they want to swindle me, they asked me to go to the bank. How can I go to the bank for a transaction that had been done? They should be the ones to go to the bank.\n\n\n\n\"As I speak now, we don't have the cash to run the business because everything we have invested is gone. We have only N9,000. It's like there's someone at their bank end that is stealing from customers. They have refused to rectify the problem.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey keep telling us not to give customers money if we are not sure. How am I supposed to do that when the machine is defective? When you do a transaction, it's supposed to approve it. When it approves, it is supposed to credit the wallet. But now, it won't credit and approve, sometimes it won't show anything and the customer is desperate. When you tell them that they'll get a reversal, only a few of them understand.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat I'm asking Payforce to do is help us identify these people. There's a way they can approach the bank for such.\n\n\n\n\u201cI want the world to know that dispense error issues do not occur through the POS operator, it is a symptom of a failing or a faulty system. Hence with immediate effect, I hereby call on relevant regulatory agents of the government to help us look into this issue of systematic pilfering.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhen SaharaReporters contacted CrowdForce, the company's representative identified simply as Mariam confirmed that Noah had lodged a series of complaints about failed transactions.\n\n\n\nThe representative further explained that it is not the duty of the company on behalf of the agent except Noah can present evidence of the physical cash given.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe treat declined transactions within 24 to 48 hours; this is because when a transaction occurs, we don't get reports until the day after. What we always tell our agents is that whenever there's a failed transaction, they should hold on for 24 hours before we can get a resolution.\n\n\u201cIt is only until then that we can state if the transaction is settled to us, then we can go ahead to pay but in a case where there is a declined transaction and the money was not settled to PayForce by the customer's bank, there is no way we will be able to make payments.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn Mr Noah's case, he had a series of declined transactions, some of which were settled to us which he was funded for and then he had others which were not settled to us which he was not funded for and he complained about it.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe paid his customers by receiving the credit from our end, that was what caused the loss on his part. We usually tell our agents that in the event that PayForce is not settled for a transaction, it means the customer's bank did not remit the funds to us. Hence if there is a debit, the customer should go to their bank and fill a dispense error form to get a reversal but in this case, he went ahead to pay without speaking to the customer service representative to find out the status of the transaction.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf we are not settled for a transaction, we cannot lay claims to it. We have asked Mr Noah to tell his customers to go to the bank for a reversal. We cannot go to the bank to lodge a complaint on Mr Noah's behalf because for withdrawal transactions like this, we cannot tender proof of payment at the bank. It's just by word of mouth. He's telling us he made payment to these customers. We don't have physical evidence to tender to the bank.\"",

          "title": "The leading African tech moves from June 2022",
          "text": "We\u2019re halfway through the year, and quite a number of exciting things have happened in Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s $53.4 mobile money fraud lawsuit and Kune\u2019s shutdown in Kenya, to big acquisitions across North Africa, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves from June.\n\nIn June 2022, African startups made 36 fully disclosed* raises totalling $426,280,000 million. This amount is a 2.4% decrease from May 2022\u2019s $437,100,000.\n\nThis means that in the first half of 2022 (H1 2022), African startups raised a whopping $2,787,523,000, a 134.25% increase from the $1.19 billion raised in H1 2021.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors in June are fintech, energytech, and mobility/logistics. Fintech startups raised $305,430,000. (71.7%), energytech startups raised $35,700,000 (8.4%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $32,700,000 (7.7%).\n\nPer region, North Africa led with $173,300,000 of the funding, with fintech MNT-Halan\u2019s $150 million at the helm. South Africa came a close second with $127,500,000, while West and East Africa followed with $79,430,000 and $46,050,000 respectively.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals in June are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in June 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y Combinator.\n\nLess than 2 months after the launch of its mobile money payments service bank (MoMo PSB) in Nigeria, telco MTN in June reportedly took 18 Nigerian banks to court over a $53.7 million fraud allegation.\n\nAccording to the telco, the fraud was committed over a total of 700,000 transactions, over a one-month period, and the amount was transferred in error to 8,000 accounts.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest unicorn, Flutterwave, made some pretty important hires last month.\n\n\n\nFormer managing director at Goldman Sachs, Gurbhej Dhillon, joined the fintech startup as chief technical officer (CTO) while former vice president of American Express, Oneal Bhambani, also joined the company as chief financial officer (CFO).\n\nIt\u2019s no news that about 70% of startups fail at the pre-seed or seed stage, and Kenyan food delivery service Kune\u2019s shutdown came as little surprise to Kenyans.\n\nLess than a year after raising $1 million to solve a problem many Kenyans believe does not exist, Kune shut down in June after founder Robin Reecht announced on LinkedIn that they had run out of money.\n\nPiggyTech, parent company of Nigeria-based fintech PiggyVest, pocketed a mobile money (MOMO) license in June.\n\nPiggyTech also rebranded its payment app from Abeg to PocketApp. The licence will help the startup transition PocketApp from a payment app to a social commerce app that supports online merchants in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria may have lower mobile money usage compared to Kenya, Uganda or even Ghana, but that may soon change.\n\nIn more Nigerian mobile money news from June, telecom giant Airtel also launched its own payments service bank (PSB), SmartCash PSB. With its PSB license, Airtel can provide the 55% of Nigerians who don\u2019t have bank accounts access to SmartCash PSB.\n\nAbout 15,900 tech workers from startups across the globe were laid off in June 2022.\n\nIn Africa, Egypt- and Dubai-based healthtech startup, Vezeeta, laid off about 10% of its staff. Its LinkedIn profile says it has 500 staff, so about 50 workers must have been laid off.\n\nThis news comes a month after another Egypt- and Dubai-based startup, Swvl, laid off 32% of its workforce.\n\nIn big news about acquisitions, 3 happened in June 2022.\n\nFirst, MFS Africa announced plans to acquire US-based payments software company Global Technology Partners (GTP) in a $34 million deal.\n\nThen Apetito, a Cairo-based on-demand grocery retail business announced the acquisition of Lamma, a similar startup, to help its expansion to Morocco, Tunisia, and West Africa.\n\nFinally, Nigeria\u2019s Access Bank announced its second acquisition in Kenya. It\u2019s reportedly aiming to buy Sidian Bank for $36.7 million (Ksh 4.3 billion).\n\nIn June, Kenya\u2019s parliament passed the ICT Practitioners\u2019 Bill which requires all techies in Kenya to register and pay tax before they can work in the country.\n\nFortunately, President Uhuru Kenyatta rejected the bill stating that it was \u201cimpractical and counterproductive\u201d.\n\nIn more news about Kenyan legislations, the Kenyan government made another move to regulate its digital lending space.\n\nThe government announced plans to introduce a 20% excise tax on all fees charged by all digital lenders.\n\nOther than Flutterwave\u2019s, several other important hires were announced in June.\n\nMara, a pan\u2013African crypto exchange platform, appointed ex-Apple executive Susan Younis as its chief marketing officer (CMO).\n\nEloho Omame, co-founder and General Partner at FirstCheck Africa, joined TLcom Capital as a partner.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your network on Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Swvl Holdings Corp, a multinational mobility as a service provider, has announced an agreement to acquire Urbvan, a mobility platform that provides tech-enabled mobility services in Mexico. With this acquisition, the Egyptian-born startup will be expanding into Mexico, the second most populated country in Latin America.\n\nThe ongoing acquisition process, which is set to be completed in Q3 of 2021, will be one of the uncommon cases of acquisitions by African startups.\n\nThe move follows Swvl\u2019s decision to lay off 32% of its employees earlier in May 2022, citing their need to turn cash flow positive as the reason for the lay-offs.\n\nUrbvan provides tech-enabled mobility services that aim to ensure a safe, comfortable, and efficient commute for riders. Founded in 2016, Urbvan set out with the intent of using shared mobility as a catalyst to improve living conditions for Mexicans. The company operates in 18 cities across Mexico with solutions for urban routes, intercity routes, for private organisations and for private on-demand needs.\n\nSix years down the line, Swvl will be acquiring the company and leveraging Urbvan\u2019s networks to accelerate Swvl\u2019s mission to provide safer, faster, smarter, and more affordable mass transport for everyone, no matter where they live.\n\nIn a statement seen by TechCabal, Mostafa Kandil, Swvl founder and CEO, highlighted the similarities between the 2 companies, maintaining that Urbvan\u2019s footprints in Mexico will be beneficial and instrumental to Swvl\u2019s expansion in the region.\n\n\u201cUrbvan was founded on the same principles as Swvl: to address the inefficiencies found in traditional mass transit in many parts of the world. With a significant footprint in Mexico, an impressive suite of transport-as-a-service (TaaS) offerings, and strong relationships with local government players, this acquisition reinforces Swvl\u2019s position as a leading provider of safer and more reliable mobility solutions which are required for vulnerable people living in densely populated, challenging markets with vast geographies,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSwvl and Urbvan share a vision to remodel mass transit to be safer for everyone, no matter their gender or social class, in the most challenging and densely populated urban neighbourhoods in Latin America,\u201d Renato Picard, Urbvan co-Founder and co-CEO, said in the statement.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to partner with Swvl as we work to illustrate best practices for tech-optimised day-to-day travel in Mexico. This transaction positions Urbvan to leverage Swvl\u2019s global offerings to scale the platform both within the region and beyond. We look forward to using our combined capabilities to provide safe, efficient, and affordable shared mobility options across the world,\u201d he added.\n\nSwvl, which went public in 2021, was the first African startup to go public via a SPAC and is currently valued at $1.5 billion.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How Klasha is solving some of the biggest problems in African ecommerce?",
          "text": "Before now, Africans preferred to make payments with cash and physically go to retail shops to get their goods themselves. Many of them did not possess bank accounts or have debit or credit cards. Mobile phone ownership and internet access were also not commonplace. In fact, it took a lot of trust to get them to shop online. Businesses that wanted consumers to pay online struggled to make bank in African markets.\n\nBut this is fast changing as this historical infrastructure deficit gets corrected and COVID-19 pushes consumers to adopt online commerce.\n\nToday, there are an estimated 495 million (or 46%) of the continent\u2019s population owning a mobile phone and 303 million subscribed to mobile internet. These numbers are expected to grow to 615 million and 74 million by 2025 respectively, per GSMA data. According to reports, 86% of adults in Kenya, 48% in Nigeria, and 79% in South Africa have access to bank accounts. Africans are also getting comfortable with moving money on their mobile phones, with Africa accounting for $701.4 million (or 70%) of the world\u2019s $1 trillion worth in mobile money transactions.\n\nWhile online shopping is still nascent on the continent, African tech startups are jumping in to solve the hard problems of making ecommerce work in Africa. One of them is Nigerian ecommerce company Klasha which, since its launch in May last year, has raised a $4.5 million seed round, over 2 tranches last October and June, with investors such AMEX Ventures, Global Ventures, Greycroft, and Seedcamp participating.\n\nKlasha\u2019s success reflects the massive potential ecommerce has on the continent, especially the appetite of Africans to seek and pay for goods and services outside the continent. It is tapping into this huge potential by solving payment issues merchants and consumers face when they pay for products online via different payment methods across countries.\n\nKlasha has an ecosystem of consumer and business-facing solutions that are connected to one API and help facilitate cross-border commerce. Klasha\u2019s core product is the Klasha Checkout which allows ecommerce platforms, websites, apps and consumers to pay international online merchants in African currencies, while the merchants receive the payout in G20 currencies: dollar, euro, and pound. This incentivises these global merchants to expand their services to African consumers.\n\nKlasha Cart, an app, started out by allowing Nigerian customers to generate virtual dollar cards they can fund to send and receive money worldwide. It also allowed them to spend beyond the $20\u2013100 monthly limit imposed by the Central Bank of Nigeria on debit cards issued by deposit money banks. The app has evolved to allow African consumers to pay global retailers including fashion products on Asos, Zara, and H&M, and streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music.\n\nAnother of Klasha\u2019s products, KlashaWire, allows small businesses to make payments with their local currencies to their suppliers in other countries, who according to Klasha, will receive the payment within 3 working days.\n\nPayment Links allows merchants without an online storefront to receive payments from African customers by just generating a simple payment page they can share via social media or email.\n\nSince launching in May 2021, Klasha has signed up over 1,700 merchants, processed over 210,000 transactions, and is experiencing 15% MoM merchant growth.\n\nTechCabal caught up with Klasha CEO and co-founder Jessica Anuna on a video call to understand Klasha\u2019s progress in the past year. She explained that slow delivery of customer goods, the unreliability of payment methods, and the refusal of ecommerce platforms to allow African consumers to pay with their currency pushed her to build their ecommerce solutions in the first place, notably the checkout and logistics feature.\n\nBut Anuna doesn\u2019t believe that one company can tackle the big problems ecommerce is known for on the continent, which is why she encourages partnerships between ecommerce players and data analytics, logistics, storage, and warehouse service providers to solve some of the biggest problems in the space.\n\n\u201cThe core mission and vision for Klasha are to streamline cross-border payments, help African consumers frictionlessly reach the goods and services they want outside of the continent, and in turn merchants outside of Africa can access consumers in Africa who want to buy and access their goods and services,\u201d Anuna told TechCabal on the call.\n\nAnuna said that Africa\u2019s fast-growing population, a growing middle class, and consequential increase in consumer spending have created a huge market for merchants and a lucrative opportunity for venture capitalists to fund the tech startups that connect merchants to the continent.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of VC funds looking at Africa right now are able to see the route to scalability which, ultimately, is what VCs want to see. The market here in Africa is very nascent. Ecommerce is less than 10 years old. So that means there are a lot of opportunities to develop and scale the business. And we know that the fastest growth happens when there\u2019s a lack of development,\u201d Anuna added.\n\nKlasha is also choosing its investors wisely, and one of the ways it has done that is by receiving investment from AMEX, the investment arm of the American Express bank. AMEX\u2019s support will give Klasha access to the vast expertise and network of the giant bank, giving them a firsthand look at how it handles payment processing, scaling businesses across borders, and other challenges she is sure Klasha will soon face as the startup continues to grow.\n\nImage Source: Klasha\n\nKlashaCart, its consumer product, has an in-app store that allows consumers to purchase fashion and electronics products with naira and get them delivered at their doorsteps between 7\u201314 working days. Anuna said that the app is growing about 15% MoM, and has accumulated over 45,000 users since October.\n\nOn top of the Checkout and Cart is Klasha Logistics, which allows merchants\u2019 and retailers\u2019 goods and services to reach African buyers\u2019 doorstep within 7\u201314 days.\n\nAs Africa\u2019s middle class grows, consumer spending on ecommerce on the continent is expected to rise from $16 billion in 2016 to $75 billion by 2025, coupled with a solid 1.3 billion population poised to reach a quarter of the world\u2019s population by 2050 are all critical indicators for Klasha to build a suite of ecommerce products.\n\nKlasha\u2019s expansion strategy\n\nFlushed with funding, Klasha wants to deepen product penetration in the 6 African countries it currently operates: Nigeria, Zambia, Tanzania, Uganda, South Africa, and Kenya. It plans eventually to scale to other African countries and currencies. It wants to deepen its product by doubling down on consumer and merchant marketing to raise awareness about them. It intends to relaunch its consumer app, KlashaCarts, and expand to Kenya in the coming month.\n\nDue to the nascency of ecommerce in these countries, Anuna said Klasha has had to engage in education campaigns to effectively sell ecommerce as an alternative to commerce. Another thing Klasha has to worry about is localising payment methods, marketing and its overall messaging.\n\nKlasha\u2019s marketing strategy ranges from ensuring that its product is solving an actual problem for its new market and targeting the right customer segment.\n\nLast year, in an interview with TechCabal right in the middle of Klasha\u2019s launch, Anuna revealed that a key metric to measuring Klasha\u2019s growth will be the number of major online stores and marketplaces it has convinced to integrate Klasha Checkout. Klasha has made considerable progress on that end by landing integration with WooCommerce, OpenCart, Wix, and Squarespace.\n\nAnother metric, she said, would be its ability to acquire 5,000 merchants, and when TechCabal asked her how that was coming along, she said that Klasha\u2019s merchant acquisition is growing at about 20% month-on-month (MoM). She also revealed that Klasha has seen a 17.5% MoM growth in terms of transaction volume and has processed over 210,000 transactions.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "title": "Meet Burna Boy's monitor engineer, Precious Tawo as he takes us on his journey into sound engineering",
          "text": "Today\u2019s guest on Everyday People is someone whose magic you\u2019ve probably experienced at any Burna Boy, Wizkid, or Fireboy DML\u2019s concerts. Without further ado, let\u2019s meet Precious Tawo, freelance sound engineer and production manager. He has worked with firms like Google, IBM, and MultiChoice, and is a die-hard perfectionist, perhaps in recovery. He also runs Decibelz Production Limited, a one-stop-shop for all your audio rental needs.\n\nThere\u2019s this saying my sister made all of us get used to, which is still on my email address now:\n\nGood, better, best.\n\nI will never rest,\n\nUntil my good is better\n\nAnd my better best\n\nWe grew up singing that. We always lived by that mantra.\n\nSo I kept on putting my best into what I was doing. Everybody was interested in sitting on the console, but I was interested in knowing the whole craft.\n\nOn the 20th day [of the Calabar festival], we were doing a sound check in the stadium for the band, and my boss was not on the stage.\n\nSo he said, \u201cPrecious, please go to the console in front and mute the whole Front of House.\u201d\n\nFront of House is basically the mix the engineer mixes for the audience. So I ran there and quickly muted it. And he was shocked. Because he knew that at this point, he had not shown me anything that concerned the board.\n\n\u201cHow did you know how to mute the board?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been reading.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou this boy! You are a Puma!\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know how they say it in Yoruba, but he called me Puma because he says I jump. At the end of the festival, I became the first trainee to join the main crew in less than three weeks. I was paid \u20a6230,000 ($1,403)*, which was the highest [amount of] money I had ever received.\n\nPrecious Tawo\u2019s journey into sound engineering\n\nPrecious Tawo\n\nI didn\u2019t choose the path; the path chose me. So sometime after I finished secondary school, I wanted to study marine engineering real bad because I had friends in the marine space.\n\nI even had to wait one year at home for the entrance exam period. And I even went as far as Ibadan [Oyo State, Nigeria] to write for Polaris Marine Academy entrance exam. Then I went to the Maritime Academy in Oron to write the exam.\n\nFortunately, I got admission into the Maritime Academy, Oron, but before it came out, I was already working as a facility manager in a hotel in Calabar [Cross River State, Nigeria] because I just wanted to while away time.\n\nI\u2019m not an idle person. And then I\u2019ve always been someone that\u2019s been independent, and I wanted my little stipend. I got to work in a hotel thanks to my dad\u2019s South African friend \u2014 the manager \u2014 who gave me a job as one of the facility guys.\n\nBecause of how fast I was and everything, I was transferred from the hotel to the event centre, where I worked for over six months. And this was when I wrote the Polaris entrance exam. As at November, I knew full well that my time there was done because I know when it\u2019s time for me to leave somewhere.\n\nI don\u2019t need to pray about it; I feel it in my tummy that it\u2019s time to go, and I leave without a plan, but I always have something all worked out later on. So I felt it was time to leave.\n\nAnd in 2013, the Calabar Festival was very popular. This was something that we normally went to the stadium to watch every December and wish that we were on stage or part of the crew.\n\nAt this point, I had no audio background. The only knowledge I had about audio came in November [2013] when we had the Beer Festival in 520 [Hotel, Calabar], and they wanted to rent equipment worth about \u20a65,000,000 ($31,645)**.\n\nI made the company give me \u20a6700,000 ($4,430)** to buy some equipment, and I was like, \u201cI am gonna make this work.\u201d\n\nAnd I did DJ for the Beer Festival with Virtual DJ on my laptop and saved them over \u20a63,000,000 ($18,987)**. That\u2019s the only thing I knew about audio, which was basically from YouTube; plug this here, plug this there, turn this here, turn this there.\n\nWorking at The Voice in 2021\n\nSo on November 25, 2013, I resigned and told my dad that I would like to work with the crew for the Calabar Festival because he had his friend there.\n\nMy dad was an immigration officer in the Tourism Bureau, so he sorted out the passports for most foreigners working in Calabar. So he had relationships with these guys.\n\nThe production manager then was one of his friends, and he told him his son was interested in working with the guys for the December festival.\n\nI heard they were paying them \u20a6200,000 ($1,255)***. And how much was I earning at my place of work? It was just \u20a618,000 ($113)*** initially, then it went up to \u20a625,000 ($156)***. If I could make \u20a6200,000 a month, it\u2019d actually be better than what I was making in a year or close to what I made in a year if I stayed at the event centre.\n\nI planned to join them only for that month and then use the \u20a6200,000 to start school when results come out in January or February.\n\nOn the first day, I was told to go to the Governor\u2019s office for the interview. I dressed in my nicely starched shirt and trousers, and a nice pair of shoes.\n\nOnly for me to walk into the office and they were like, \u201cOh, you are the Precious. Okay, no problem. Hop into the Hilux; let\u2019s go to the warehouse and show you around.\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I going to change?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no. Just come.\u201d\n\nWhen I arrived, they were loading trucks to move the equipment to the studio. This was the 28th of November. And when I got there, I had this whole \u201cbig boy\u201d thingy going on, so seeing boys loading trucks, I was like, \u201cNah, that\u2019s not what I came for; I came for the cool stuff.\u201d\n\nSo they asked me what I wanted to do, and I said, \u201cThe sound department,\u201d because I really loved the whole sound thing. When you went to the Festival, you could hear the speakers pumping from miles away, and I really wanted to be a part of that.\n\nPlus, I had just finished the Beer Festival and wanted something higher than I\u2019d experienced. They introduced me to Aigbovosa Giwa-Osagie, my boss. They took me around and showed me speakers I\u2019d never seen before up close.\n\nThen they introduced me to another person who would be my head.\n\nI was like, \u201cOkay, cool. I\u2019ll resume tomorrow. Nice meeting you guys.\u201d\n\nNext thing, \u201cNo o!. You are resuming now and joining them to load that truck.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, no problem. Easy thing,\u201d I told him.\n\nLuckily, I had a singlet and a pair of jeans in my bag because I was supposed to go somewhere from there. Nice pair of jeans o!\n\nWizkid\u2019s concert\n\nSo, I started loading with the guys. The equipment was very heavy, and there I was, not used to carrying heavy things, seeing young people like me doing it, and told myself I could too.\n\nWe finished loading four trucks after almost four hours and headed to the venue for the Festival\u2019s first event. And I was told to jump into the back of the truck because the Hilux was full.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: senior crew sits in the Hilux, junior crew at the back, and trainees like me sit on the equipment inside the 40-foot truck like the one used to convey cows.\n\nAt first, I was like no way, especially since Calabar is such a small place, but I eventually jumped in. Part of the price you have to pay, you know. At this point, my jeans were gone, and my singlet was like rags.\n\nWe got there, and my boss walked up to me and asked me what audio background I had. And I told him I had none, but the only thing I knew was the entry stuff, but I was willing to learn.\n\nSo when we started setting up, he asked me to go and get the 10 mm ep5 cable. In my head, I was supposed to go and see a cable labelled 10mm ep5.\n\nHe pointed in a direction of over 65 open cases, so I went there straight, and for like 40 minutes, I was searching for the ep5 cable, and I didn\u2019t even know what I was looking for. And then I couldn\u2019t even ask because the way he said it, it was like I was supposed to know the cable.\n\nSo I did not ask, and I didn\u2019t want to look small. After 40 minutes, I went back to him.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t find the cable.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I see it, what should I do to you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you want to do, but I can\u2019t find the cable in the box.\u201d\n\nAnd then he asked another guy that had been there for like four years to get the cable for him and take me and show me the cable.\n\nThis guy just opened the case, stretched his hand, and picked up the cable.\n\nMixing in a studio.\n\nYo! It was super embarrassing. And I didn\u2019t like the way everyone was laughing and everything. So I told myself that I was going to know everything in the company, how it works, and I was going to know all their needs.\n\nSo that night, I started downloading the PDF files for the equipment manuals and spent another hour downloading more when I got home at 3:00 a.m. before I slept.\n\nThe next night, since I was just a trainee, I sat in one corner with all the loud music and was just reading stuff, checking stuff, and going behind the Front of House to peep and see what they were doing even though it looked like they were running a spaceship.\n\nAfter the Festival, my boss gave me the opportunity to go to an event in Lagos for IBM computers. Then I also did Love Like a Movie by Darey Art Alade in February 2014, the outdoor version with Kelly Rowland.\n\nLong story short, I kept on growing, going from event to event. I\u2019m a sucker for information, always trying to keep myself updated. People were recommending me because no matter how good you are, you need people to recommend you.\n\nOn February 20 [2014], my mom called me to tell me that the result for the Academy was out, and I passed. My name was announced on NTA [a state-owned broadcasting station]. But, I had no plans to go to school anymore.\n\nThat February, I was also offered a position with the company, but my boss advised me not to take it.\n\nHe said, \u201cEvery week and every day, experts fly in from South Africa and the United States or wherever to come and work in Nigeria. And if you are good at what you do, they\u2019ll fly you from whatever hole you are in to come and do an event.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve worked with different companies and been exposed to various equipment and clients.\n\nAnd I will not put this achievement on one company. If I was working with one company, I\u2019d be stuck with their clients and the kind of events they do. I learn from everybody, and I also like the way I\u2019m being treated like the golden egg.\n\nI love my job. I\u2019ve done stuff for Google, Amazon, IBM, Airtel, MTN, MultiChoice, and The Voice. Presently I\u2019m Burna Boy\u2019s monitor engineer and Fireboy\u2019s Front of House engineer. I\u2019ve mixed for Wizkid\u2019s December concerts, Cardi B, and Davido; any big artiste really.\n\nLearning from mistakes\n\nMixing at Burna Boy\u2019s Dakar concert in 2022\n\nSometime in 2015, we had an event in Eko Atlantic; it was supposed to be the launch for Majestic Voyage and ten minutes before the show, we did the sound check. Everything was sounding all right and I was mixing monitors.\n\nFive minutes to the show, I tapped my screen and it was frozen. I tried restarting the console, but nothing. That meant every artiste who climbed that stage was not going to hear jack!\n\nI felt like the ground should open for me to enter. We tried everything and eventually had to plug my monitors into my boss\u2019 equipment. By this time, the first artiste, Yemi Sax, was already on stage. I had already explained to him and everything but the first three minutes of the show were hell.\n\nI somehow survived the performance and my boss stabilised everything and that\u2019s how we ran the show. Another moment was when I was doing a show at Calabar Cultural Centre, and then we had power issues in the middle of the show and the console went off.\n\nThe show was cancelled and they had to fix another date. I spent four years trying to correct that mistake. I was hard on myself for four years. I\u2019m a perfectionist so I like to give 110%. Eventually, I had to accept that every engineer has bad days.\n\nGiving back\n\nIn line with what I\u2019ve learnt over the years, I decided to try and pass on this knowledge because I found out that, at the end of the day, we have to leave a legacy.\n\nIt\u2019s not just about money to me, my job is like my life right now. And I\u2019ve seen that many engineers have come and gone but there\u2019s nothing anybody can point to that they made. And so I started sharing knowledge at every opportunity I got. If I went to an event, I\u2019d teach the in-house engineer things I knew they would need if they asked politely, of course.\n\nI run a clinic for engineers, although I haven\u2019t done it since 2019. I also have some people I mentor, all so I can give back.\n\n*Average dollar to naira to rates in February 2014.\n\n**Dollar to naira rate in November 2013.\n\n***Average dollar to naira rates in 2013.",

          "title": "Nigerian celebrities switch from political endorsers to contenders",
          "text": "From giving politicians endorsements during elections, a number of Nigerian celebrities are now contesting for political offices.\n\nFunke Akindele, a Nollywood actor and producer of the most financially successful Nollywood film, \u2018Omo Ghetto the Saga,\u2019 was recently announced as the running mate to Olajide Adediran, the Peoples Democratic Party\u2019s (PDP) candidate for the 2023 Lagos State governorship election.\n\n\u201cI am not unaware of the cost of this assignment on my vibrant career, which I must now necessarily put on hold. My resolve is that no sacrifice is too much for the actualisation of the urgent mission to rescue our people and our dear state,\u201d Akindele said.\n\nShe described the development as an opportunity to help liberate and improve the welfare of the people of Lagos, especially the deprived youth, women, and girl child. She called on youths who are eligible to vote to use the numerical strength to their advantage.\n\nBankole Wellington, Afrobeats singer and actor, popularly known as Banky W, won the PDP primary ticket for the Eti-Osa constituency in the Federal House of Representatives ahead of the 2023 general election. Following the controversy with his challenger, Sam Aiboni, another primary was conducted two weeks after the first, and Wellington won again, polling 24 votes out of 29 votes cast by the delegates.\n\nTuoyo Ideh, former Big Brother Naija contestant, will be contesting for the position of member of the House of Representatives representing the Warri Federal Constituency on the platform of the All Progressive Grand Alliance.\n\nOther celebrities who have no intention to run for any office but have shown their support for a presidential candidate publicly include music duo Peter and Paul Okoye, together known as Psquare; Chidi Mokeme, a Nollywood actor and Okey Bakassi, a stand-up comedian.\n\nSome celebrities are sensitising the electorate, especially the youths, to the importance of being more involved in politics.\n\nA video was circulated online recently showing Instagram skit makers and former Big Brother Naija housemates, who are members of YouthsInPoliticsng, sensitising youths to get their Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs) for the 2023 elections.\n\nMicheal Obi Nwabufo, president of Youths In Politics NG, expressed the organisation\u2019s commitment to supporting a new government that will be accountable and carry the youths along in its decision-making.\n\nMusic has always been used as a tool to speak about bad governance as the singers use their craft to tell stories of oppression and the suffering of the people. Typical examples include late Afrobeat legend Fela Anikulapo-Kuti, whose protest music of the 70s is still relevant today; African China\u2019s \u2018Mr. President\u2019, Eedris AbdulKareem\u2019s \u2018Nigeria JagaJaga\u2019, Falz \u2018Moral Instruction\u2019 album and Burna Boy\u2019s \u2018Monster you Made\u2019.\n\nMusic and political campaigns have always been entwined and politicians have always added musicians to their campaign train to get the younger generation to listen to their political agendas.\n\nIn March this year, Timi Dakolo came under criticism on social media for singing and endorsing PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, during his political rally and declaration to run for the highest political office in the country. Dakolo responded to the criticisms, saying: \u201cI will sing and collect bread, my guy, if it pains you well well, go sing your own.\u201d\n\nIn the past, musician Olamide performed during Akinwunmi Ambode\u2019s governorship campaign while Davido threw his weight behind Muhammadu Buhari during his campaign in 2015.\n\nIn October 2020, young celebrities and other youths marched to the streets during the EndSARS protest to demonstrate against police brutality and poor leadership. Music was employed as a means of expression during the demonstration, which lasted for roughly two weeks, fostering a bond among the protesters.\n\nThese influencers and celebrities attracted crowds to the protest, thanks to their large followings on social media platforms like Twitter and Instagram, demonstrating the potency of social media in the world of politics.\n\nCelebrities planned the free \u201cYouth Vote Count\u201d concert in June 2022 to encourage young people to take part in their civic responsibilities.\n\nYoung Nigerians on the 11th of June defied the heavy downpour to sing and dance along with performing artists, celebrities, and influencers at Tafawa Balewa Square in Lagos for the \u2018Youth Vote Count\u2019 Mega Concert 2.0, with free gate passes to only people who had a PVC or a registration slip.\n\nOfficials of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) were also present at the venue to register people who did not have a voter\u2019s card and continued the exercise for five days.\n\nSponsored by the European Union, INEC, Development Alternatives Incorporated, and Yiaga Africa, the concert hosted singers like Omawumi, 2Baba, Kizz Daniel, M.I, Teni, Mayourkun Joe Boy, and Falz, as well as actors and influencers such as Toyin Abraham, Real Warri Pikin, Chioma Akpotha, Uti Nwachukwu, Lasisi Elenu, Mr. Macaroni, and Broda Shagi.\n\nYouths in Abuja were not left out as the Old Parade Ground hosted the same celebrities with an additional act featuring Ice Prince, Cobhams, and rapper Phyno on June 25.\n\nAfter the large turnout for registration in Abuja and Lagos, INEC extended voter registration indefinitely and created new centres for registration in 14 new locations in Abuja.",

          "text": "Cuba, an island of over 11 million in Latin America, was once at the base of basic healthcare measures before it worked out a strategy that spun it into an island of doctors, surplus enough to rake in export earnings from foreign medical missions.\n\nThe largest share of Cuba\u2019s export earnings accrues from incomes gained through a programme that ships about 50,000 health workers to more than 60 countries across the world.\n\nThe Caribbean government earns around $8 billion a year in revenues from deploying healthcare professionals to foreign governments, reports show.\n\nIt faced a challenge similar to the current woes of Nigeria\u2019s healthcare sector, with its doctors fleeing to the United States for higher pay, rejecting the idea of Fidel Castro\u2019s revolution.\n\nThe migration crashed Cuba\u2019s ratio of physicians to patients from 9.2 doctors per 10,000 people in 1958 to 5.4 by 1962, according to a study on \u2018Cuban Public Healthcare: A Model of Success for Developing Nations\u2019.\n\nThe Cuban infant mortality grew from 33.4 in 1958 to 46.7 in 1969 as nearly half of Cuba\u2019s 6,912 doctors left the island after the revolution.\n\nHowever, different from Nigeria\u2019s case where an indirect subsidy of medical training of health workers benefits richer countries to the detriment of its domestic needs, Cuba went back to the drawing board.\n\nOne of the first measures it took was to create a level-playing field that eased access for the poor class to gain admission into medical schools, with the government paying the bills for all of the costs associated with their training.\n\nCuba gradually built a fresh crop of doctors, which began to reflect on its health indicators. The physician-to-patient ratio improved to 36.1 doctors per 10,000 people in 1990 and by 2007, it had a better doctor-to-patient ratio than that of the US or Western Europe: 64 doctors per 10,000.\n\nCuba\u2019s ratio today is double the numbers found in many developed nations, with a doctor for every 150 people. Africa\u2019s most populous nation, Nigeria, has a ratio of 4 doctors per 10,000 people.\n\nBy the mid-1970s, Cuba had brought down its infant mortality rate to 28. It fell further to 15 by 1984.\n\nThe government ensured that doctors were available to both city dwellers and those in the hinterland through an urban-rural balance scheme that saw new constructions of health facilities rise in the rural areas.\n\nAnother step it took was to focus healthcare on consultation with patients and local communities, disease prevention, and directing scarce resources towards the groups most in need, especially expectant mothers, infants, children, and the infirm elderly.\n\nIn 1984, it began the implementation of a basic healthcare team of a doctor and a nurse approach, with each team unit caring for about 80 to 150 families.\n\nBy 2009 and 2011, Cuba could offer 5.1 beds per 1,000 people, a better rate than the 2.1 level in Latin America and the Caribbean, and even better than the 3.0 rate found in the USA.\n\nMany beds were left unused in the year 2000 as the bed occupancy rate was at 69.4 percent. With the healthcare system focused on prevention and the doctor, nurse, and public healthcare worker teams keeping in steady contact with their communities, the need for hospital beds is reduced.\n\nCuba, after settling the health needs of its people, began to champion medical missions to different countries. It had agreements with governments for a certain number of years to deploy doctors in areas of need. Doctors get paid by the Cuban government, while movement and hosting costs are often taken up by the receiving country.\n\nBy the mid-1980s, it was producing doctors specifically to staff its overseas deployments. The number of Cuban health professionals serving abroad rose from 5,000 in 2003 to 25,000 in 2005 and to over 40,000 by 2007.\n\nIn 2013, Brazil\u2019s President Dilma Rousseff brought in some 7,400 Cuban doctors to tend to people in poor regions, after her efforts to attract Brazilian physicians to serve in these zones failed to fill even a fraction of the needed postings.\n\nAnalysts say in addition to policies that attract private sector funds to healthcare including taxation and levies, Nigeria can toe Cuba\u2019s path to squeeze out gain from the brain drain going on and generate more earnings.\n\nOlamide Brown, founder of Flying Doctors Healthcare Investment Group, said Nigeria needs to be able to do more with less since it can afford budgets controlled by the countries luring away its doctors.\n\n\u201cWe have a huge brain drain problem. Why not change that into a brain gain opportunity by making trade deals with countries that need doctors in exchange for a fee. Countries like Cuba and the Philippines have done this and it is a source of income to them,\u201d Brown told BusinessDay.\n\n\u201cThe real wealth of Nigeria is not in the ground or from oil. It is actually from our people. We need to see how we can leverage the skills of our people to bring prosperity to the country.\u201d\n\nNigeria, home to over 82 million poor with health expenditure per person of $71, is offsetting the cost of healthcare delivery for countries such as the United States, a country capable of $10,921 in health spending per individual.\n\nThe United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia spends about $4,312 and $1,316 on each citizen, yet Nigeria keeps losing the health workers it needs because those countries have more advanced healthcare facilities and working provisions.\n\nInstead of a robust health workforce that is equipped enough to drive up doctors to patient ratio, raise life expectancy and flatten maternal and child mortality rates, the country keeps grappling with a lean structure that continues to bleed from workers\u2019 migration.\n\nData from the register of the Nursing and Midwifery Council of the UK show that the number of Nigeria-trained nurses rose year-on-year by 68.4 percent to 7,256 in March 2022 from 4,310 in the same month of last year.\n\nApart from the number being the highest, it also ranks third by country of training outside the European Union/European Economic Area.\n\nLosing skilled manpower without a sustainable plan for replacement is a stressor that analysts say is worrying.",
          "summary": "The largest share of Cuba\u2019s export earnings accrues from incomes gained through a programme that ships about 50,000 health workers to more than 60 countries across the world.\nAfrica\u2019s most populous nation, Nigeria, has a ratio of 4 doctors per 10,000 people.\nThe number of Cuban health professionals serving abroad rose from 5,000 in 2003 to 25,000 in 2005 and to over 40,000 by 2007.\nOlamide Brown, founder of Flying Doctors Healthcare Investment Group, said Nigeria needs to be able to do more with less since it can afford budgets controlled by the countries luring away its doctors.\nWhy not change that into a brain gain opportunity by making trade deals with countries that need doctors in exchange for a fee.",

          "text": "The federal government has recommended an effective implementation of the Petroleum Industry Act, PIA, 2021 which is expected to attract investment in the oil and gas sector\n\nThe recommendation was made in the nation\u2019s Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) for 2021 released on Thursday.\n\nThe DSA also recommend the enhancement and continued implementation of the Strategic Revenue Growth Initiatives to shore up government revenues, in order to reduce financing pressures, and expand the fiscal space.\n\nIt also recommended a sustained implementation of the National Development Plan, NDP, 2021-2025 to maintain the recovery in the economy, while rationalizing expenditure by focusing on priority spending on growth-enhancing sector of the economy.\n\nThe DSA identified real Gross Domestic Product, GDP, growth, real interest rate and exchange rate as key challenges that could push up total public debt up this year and in 2023.\n\nThe DSA posted on the DMO website indicated that Nigeria adopted Market Access Country-Debt Sustainability Analysis (MAC-DSA) framework to conduct its debt sustainability exercise in 2021.\n\nHowever, the Low-Income Countries Debt Sustainability Framework (LIC-DSF,) was used in 2020, due to larger share of concessional debt, which accounted for 59.92 per cent of the country\u2019s external debt stock.\n\nOn the challenges of growing public debt, the DSA identified \u201cStandard Macro-Fiscal shocks are Primary Balance, real GDP growth, real Interest Rate, real Exchange Rate and Combined Macro-Fiscal.\n\n\u201cUnder the real GDP growth shock in which the GDP is lowered than the baseline by one percentage point on the average in 2021 and 2022, the Total public debt-to-GDP ratio increased to 26.1 per cent in 2023, compared to 25.5 per cent in the baseline, but declined to 23.9 per cent in 2026, compared to 23.6 per cent in the baseline.\n\n\u201cThe primary balance shock showed a similar trend with an increase of total public debt-to-GDP ratio to 27.0 per cent in 2023, compared to 23.6 per cent in the baseline, reflecting the impact of increasing gross financing needs.\n\n\u201cThe primary balance is defined as the difference between government revenue and Non-interest Expenditure (i.e. Expenditure minus payment on Interest and Principal).\n\n\u201cThe real Interest rate shock with an increase in the interest rate by 200 basis points over the projection period will increase the debt service-to-Revenue ratio to 29.3 and 32.1 per cent in 2022 and 2023, respectively compared to 28.7 and 31.5 per cent in the baseline.\n\n\u201cThe real Exchange Rate Shock with depreciating the Naira Exchange rate to the US Dollar by 50 per cent, the maximum historical movement observed over the past ten years, will increase the Total Public Debt-to-GDP ratio to 30.9 and 30.5 percent in 2022 and 2023, respectively, compared to 26.1 and 25.8 per cent in the baseline,\u2019\u2019 the analysis read.\n\nAccording to the analysis, \u201c70.48 per cent of FGN\u2019s total public debt stock as at December 31, 2020 was market-based debt, which comprised domestic debt, with a share of 55.42 per cent and External Debt accounting for 15.06 per cent.\n\n\u201cOf the external debt portion, Eurobond accounted for 33.49 per cent in 2020. Furthermore, Nigeria increased its visibility in the International Capital Market, ICM, with the issuance of USD4.0 billion Eurobonds in three tranches of 6.25% USD1.25 Billion (7-year), 7.35% USD1.5 Billion (12-year) and 8.25% USD1.25 Billion (30-year) in 2021\n\n\u201cThese developments give further justifications for the adoption of MAC-DSA Framework.\u201d\n\nThe 2021 MAC DSA exercise was conducted by the Debt Management Office, DMO, from November 2-11, 2021, in conjunction with other stakeholders, namely: the Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning (FMFBNP), Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, Budget Office of the Federation, BOF, National Bureau of Statistics, NBS, and the Office of the Accountant-General of the Federation, OAGF.\n\nThe World Bank provided technical assistance, while baseline projections for the exercises was based on the macroeconomic assumptions outlined in the 2022 Appropriation Act and the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework, MTEF, 2022-2024 and Fiscal Strategy Paper, FSP, as well as Medium-Term National Development Plan, 2021-2025.\n\nMeanwhile, it showed that the federal government\u2019s borrowing was in line with the country\u2019s Debt Management Strategy (2020-2023), \u201cwhich is to borrow more from domestic sources using long-term instruments, while concessional and semi-concessional funding from multilateral and bilateral sources will be prioritized for external borrowing, as well as market financing.\u201d",

          "text": "Justice Oluwatoyin Taiwo of the Ikeja Domestic Violence and Sexual Offences Court has sentenced Nollywood actor and comedian, Olanrewaju James, popularly known as Baba Ijesha, to 16 years imprisonment over sexual assault.\n\nJustice Taiwo gave the judgment on Thursday, adding that the jail term will run concurrently which will be served out in 5 years and not the entire 16 years.\n\nBaba Ijesha is facing six counts of child defilement that include indecent treatment of a child, sexual assault, attempted sexual assault by penetration and sexual assault by penetration.\n\nThe Lagos State Directorate of Public Prosecutions, which proffered the charges against the actor, argued that the offences contravene Section 135, 137, 261, 202, 262 and 263 of the Lagos State Criminal Law 2015, which stipulates life imprisonment for offenders.\n\nBaba Ijesha pleaded not guilty to all the counts.\n\nDelivering the judgement, Justice Taiwo said that the prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty of all the charges against him.\n\nHowever, she found the defendant guilty of two of the six counts against him.\n\nThe defendant was arraigned on June 24, 2021. During the trial, six prosecution witnesses testified against him.\n\nThey were actress and comedienne, Princess, the 14-year-old minor, a child expert, Mrs Olabisi Ajayi-Kayode, and medical doctor, Dr Aniekan Makanjuola.\n\nOthers were the Investigating Police Officer, ASP Wahab Kareem and a policewoman, Insp. Abigail Omane.\n\nThe DPP closed its case against the defendant on Dec. 15, 2021 while Baba Ijesha called four witnesses and closed its defence on April 1.\n\nThe defence witnesses were Baba Ijesha (defendant) and Mr Lawrence Ayeni, an expert in video production and CCTV installation and maintenance.\n\nMr Olukayode Olugbemi, a clinical psychologist and Mr Olukayode Ogunbanjo, the defendant\u2019s friend and colleague also testified for the defence.\n\nJustice Oluwatoyin Taiwo, adjourned the case for judgment on 14 July after the prosecution and defence counsel had adopted their final written addresses.\n\nDefence counsel, Mr Dada Awosika (SAN), in adopting his final written address dated May 12 and filed on May 16, urged the court to dismiss the suit and discharge the defendant.\n\nAwosika argued that the footage of the Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) was illegally obtained.\n\nHe said: \u201d In the interest of justice, the exhibit A which was the CCTV footage that recalled the event was illegally obtained.\n\n\u201cThe exhibit was not tendered by the maker. It was tendered by Princess, the complainant.\n\nHe argued that the recording had been tampered with especially since the defendant did not go to the complainant\u2019s house uninvited.\n\nAwosika added that this was even more strange as he was accused of a crime seven years ago which was not reported to the police.\n\nHe further submitted that the alleged confessional statement of the defendant failed the provision of Section 9 (3 ) of the Administration of Criminal Justice Law (ACJL) of Lagos State 2021.\n\n\u201cThe Evidence Act allows legislation to guide the admissibility of document before the court. ACJL has stated that if a confessional statement is to be used, it must meet some certain degree by ACJL which is not applied in this case.\n\n\u201cWe urge the court to discredit the confessional statement. The defendant moved in a jiffy to participate in a short skit that put him in trouble. My Lord, my client was trapped.\n\n\u201cConcerning the age of the girl in question, Exhibits D and E are not saying the same thing.\n\n\u201cIt is our submission My Lord, that the court is bound to call the biological mother inside the box to tell us her real age or her birth certificate or scientific evidence is tendered to ascertain the age but none was done.\n\n\u201cThe prosecution agreed that the age of the minor must be established. However, it has also agreed that nothing has been done to provide the real age,\u201d Awosika said.\n\nThe Director of DPP, Dr Babajide Martins, in his final written address dated May 31, however, urged the court to convict Baba Ijesha as charged.\n\nHe argued that one of the defence witness, Mr Lawrence Ayeni told the court that the CCTV recording could not be manipulated.\n\n\u201cOn the issue of the CCTV recording My Lord, the first defence witness(Ayeni) told this honourable court during cross-examination that it cannot be manipulated and that the content of CCTV cannot be changed.\n\n\u201cMost importantly, he said he cannot say if the sexual assault did not happen. These are the testimonies from the defence witness My Lord.\n\n\u201cThe defendant admitted to have been with the girl in both the incident that happened seven years ago and the one that happened in 2021.\n\n\u201cHe also admitted to have sucked her fingers during the cross-examination.\n\n\u201cOn the issue of ACJL, the primary legislation supersedes the secondary legislation.\n\n\u201cOn the issue of medical certificate, the defendant said he did not have any issue with the medical doctor and had never met him when I cross-examined him.\n\n\u201cAs a result, he has no reason to mislead the court,\u201d Martins said.\n\nMartins further told the court that the definition of a child was anybody below the age of 18 years and that the prosecution had proven that the girl was below the age.\n\nHe added that the charge of defilement can be meted out irrespective of the age below 18.\n\nMartins said: \u201cSo far the age of the survivor is not up to 18, the charge is still defilement.My Lord, no amount of brilliant address can substitute for the evidence before the court.\n\n\u201cWe have a compelling evidence of six prosecution witnesses which I must say are not contradictory.\n\nThe DPP said the defendant also admitted during the trial that he never mentioned that he was acting a script when he was detained by the police at Sabo and Panti.\n\n\u201cOur position is that the prosecution has proven its case beyond reasonable doubts and we urge the court to please sentence the defendant as charged,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "A Federal High Court in Abuja Thursday struck out a suit seeking the disqualification of Osun state Governor Adegboyega Oyetola as the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate in Saturday\u2019s governorship election holding in the state.\n\nDelivering the judgment, Justice Inyang Ekwo, declared that the suit filed by an APC chieftain, Alhaji Moshood Olalekan Adeoti, against Oyetola was an abuse of court process.\n\nJustice Ekwo held that there was no iota of law supporting the plaintiff (Adeoti)\u2019s process filed before the court.\n\nThe judge also agreed with the APC (1st defendant) that the court could not assume jurisdiction on the matter on the grounds that there was no cause of action for filing the suit.\n\nEkwo also held that Adeoti, who was also an aspirant in the February 19 APC\u2019s primary poll, in his application, also admitted that he did not exhaust the party\u2019s internal mechanism before filing the suit.\n\nConsequently, the judge dismissed the suit in its entirety for being an abuse of court process.\n\nAdeoti, the plaintiff in the suit, filed the matter through his legal team, led by Chiesonu Okpoko, SAN.\n\nIn the suit, the plaintiff listed the APC, Oyetola and Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as 1st, 2nd and 3rd defendants respectively.\n\nAdeoti, who was an aspirant in the party\u2019s governorship primary in the originating summons dated February 22 and filed February 23, prayed the court to nullify Oyetola\u2019s candidacy on the grounds that he (Oyetola) contested in the poll as a member of the party\u2019s Caretaker Extraordinary and Convention Planning Committee (CECPC).\n\nAdeoti said the act contravened the provisions of Section 222 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as Amended) and Article 31(iii) of the APC (October 2014 as Amended).\n\nAccording to him, the 2nd defendant (Oyetola) ought to have resigned his membership of the 1st defendant (APC)\u2019s CECPC and leave office as an officer of the 1st defendant at least 30 days prior to the date of the 1st defendant\u2019s Osun state primary election to qualify for participation in the said 1st defendant\u2019s primary election.\n\nUpon resumption of the matter Wednesday, Adeoti\u2019s counsel, Mahmud Adesina, SAN, informed that the matter was adjourned for hearing and that he was ready to proceed on the case.\n\nAtiku urges Osun voters\n\nIn a another development, the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP) presidential candidate, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar has urged voters in Osun state to protect and curb the ruling party from stealing their votes again.\n\nAtiku spoke in Osogbo while canvassing votes for the PDP governorship candidate in the state, Senator Ademola Adeleke, at the party\u2019s mega rally held at the party secretariat.\n\n\u201cThis is a PDP state. Don\u2019t let them steal your votes this time. They have been rigging election here since 12 years ago. In 2010, they rigged through the court; in 2018 they rigged through the ballot.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t allow them steal this time around. Make sure you vote and defend your votes, if you allow them, you will go back to darkness,\u201d he said.\n\nINEC moves sensitive materials to LGAs\n\nAhead of the Saturday governorship election in Osun state, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) Thursday moved the sensitive materials to the 30 local government areas.\n\nThe Public Relations Officer of the INEC in Osun, Oluwaseun Osumosu, who confirmed the move to our correspondent, said the materials were moved between 7pm and 10pm.\n\nShe said the materials were moved under heavy security to all the 30 local governments.\n\nAccording to the PRO, the Resident Electoral Commissioner, Prof. Abdulganiy Raji, said the electoral officers would take the items to their councils where they would be sent to the polling units on Saturday morning.\n\nPoliticians spray money, hotels occupied\n\nAlso, ahead of Saturday\u2019s poll, some politicians have been spraying money to the generality of people of the state.\n\nThe concerned whose identities could not ascertained by Blueprint, sprayed N1, 000 notes to the people from Olaiya flyover while driving through the area.\n\nSimilarly, hotels in Osogbo, the state capital, had been occupied, Blueprint has gathered.\n\nChecks by one of Blueprint revealed that some expensive hotels in the town were occupied by politicians and international observers.\n\nThe price tag on some hotels visited by Blueprint ranged from N7, 000 to N50, 000.\n\nSome reporters, broadcast televisions and bloggers have stormed the state for the election and they have booked hotels ahead of their arrival.\n\nINEC Chairman Professor Mahmood Yakubu disclosed that 87 observer groups (79 domestic and 8 international) deploying a total of 7,790 field observers have been accredited for the election.\n\nHe said, \u201csimilarly, 94 media organisations (92 national and 2 international) deploying 624 journalists have been accredited to cover the election.\u201d\n\nHowever, some journalists were not captured by the data provided by INEC as the commission also did manual accreditation for those missing in the captured figure.\n\nSimilarly, queues have returned to some major petrol stations selling the official price of N165 per litre, while others sold between N180 and N195.\n\nPSC task police on conduct\n\nMeanwhile, the Police Service Commission (PSC) has tasked police officers deployed for the governorship election in Osun state to be of good conduct, and adhere to the rules of engagement.\n\nThis is as the commission deployed its staffers to monitor the conduct of police officers in 30 local government areas of the state to during the election.\n\nPSC Head Press and Public Relations Ikechukwu Ani said this in a statement Thursday in Abuja.\n\nAni said: \u201cThe Commission will also be at the Situation Room of the Civil Society Organisations and the Security Control Room at the Police State Command Headquarters in Osogbo, capital of Osun state.\n\n\u201cThe first batch of the Commission\u2019s delegation arrived Osun state on Tuesday, July 12, while the second batch are expected in the various Local Government Areas today Thursday July 14, 2022.\n\n\u201cCommission\u2019s Chairman, IGP Musiliu Smith (Retd), urged police officers involved in the security of the elections to beat the record set during the recently held Ekiti governorship election that was widely adjudged to be free and fair.\n\n\u201cAlhaji Smith called for greater commitment from the Police so that the Osun elections will signpost a bright future for election policing especially as the nation counts down to the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cHe advised the Staff of the Commission to strive to also maintain a high level of commitment adding that the Commission will not hesitate to punish any staff found wanting during the national assignment.\n\n\u201cThe police officers he admonished should work professionally and avoid all partisan tendencies during the elections.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe commission has already released dedicated telephone numbers for interested Nigerians to call to complain of any infraction or commend exemplary conduct of Police Officers during the election.

          "title": "Buhari to Armed Forces: Wipe out terrorists, return peace to Nigeria",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has ordered the Nigerian Armed Forces to confront terrorists, wipe them off the face of the earth and return peace and security to the country.\n\nThe president gave the order Thursday while addressing military officers at the graduation ceremony of 247 students of the Senior Course 44 of the Armed Forces Command and Staff College (AFCSC), at the Jaji Military Cantonment, Kaduna state. He said the last 12 years had been very challenging for Nigeria, considering the different security threats that besieged the country.\n\n\u201cMost of the security challenges facing the world today are both asymmetric and transborder in nature, involving mainly non-state actors in different regions and sub regions of the world. The West African sub region and indeed our beloved continent of Africa are not immune to these threats. We have witnessed recent terrorist attacks in Nigeria bearing the hallmark of national and transborder insurgents trying to cause havoc in Nigeria as well as in neighbouring countries.\n\n\u201cIt will be part of your duty to confront these terrorists and insurgents and wipe them off the face of the earth and bring peace to our countries. Combating these prevalent security threats effectively demands that African countries continue to work together at all levels; be it tactical, operational and strategic.\n\n\u201cTo this end, the ongoing collaboration of the Armed Forces of Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger Republic and Chad in a multinational operation to combat the Boko Haram insurgency in the Lake Chad region has been productive and particularly commendable and successful.\n\n\u201cThe synergy achieved in operating together must have been enhanced by an understanding of the doctrines of the cooperating forces. Our government is poised to promote national security and development, as well as to remain committed to promoting a vision of a secure, safe, just, peaceful, prosperous and strong Nigeria.\u201d\n\nCommendation for troops\n\nPresident Buhari also lauded the nation\u2019s military when he said: \u201cThe Armed Forces of Nigeria are working tirelessly to enhance their combat effectiveness, operational capability and training necessary to eliminate the threats, in synergy with other institutions and nations.\n\n\u201cThe response of the Armed Forces of Nigeria to the Boko Haram insurgency, banditry, militancy, kidnapping as well as the activities of separatists and armed militias amongst others have been commendable. This government will continue to provide the required guidance and support to ensure that the desired results are achieved.\u201d\n\nAddressing the graduating officers, among whom were officers from neighbouring African countries, the President said their participation on the 48 weeks\u2019 course is a further testimony of Nigeria\u2019s national security aspirations to promote international peace, friendship and cooperation.\n\n\u201cIt is particularly gratifying to note that amongst the graduating students are international officers from sister African countries. Gentlemen, I am confident that you have enjoyed our friendliness during your stay here. I am also sure you would have observed that despite our diversity and challenges, Nigeria is still one of the most hospitable and enjoyable countries to visit and stay.\n\n\u201cFor the Nigerian graduating students amongst you, the graduation today is a clarion call to duty in service to our country. Nigeria expects the very best from you in terms of loyalty, commitment to duty and service to your fatherland. You must endeavour to make honest and positive contributions in the discharge of the constitutional responsibilities of the Armed Forces of Nigeria, your strategic ministries, department and agencies and be good ambassadors of the Armed Forces Command and Staff College.\n\n\u201cYou should realise that the nation has made a lot of investment in your training up to this stage of your respective careers,\u201d Buhari said.\n\nTroops eliminate 42 terrorists, 3, 858 surrender\n\nIn a related development, the Defence Headquarters Thursday said the troops of Operation Hadin Kai (OPHK) have eliminated 42 Boko Haram insurgents in the past two weeks in the North-east.\n\nSimilarly, it said 3,858 terrorists including six top commanders and their families, surrendered to troops in the theatre of operation.\n\nDirector Defence Media Operations Major-General Bernard Onyeuko, said this in Abuja while reviewing the progress of the ongoing military campaign against insurgency.\n\nHe said that troops took the battle to Boko Haram terrorists/Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) enclaves with more coordinated operations.\n\nHe said the Air Component of OPHK July 11 conducted an air interdiction operation at Tumbum Jaki and Tumbum Murhu near Lake Chad in Borno state killing more than 21 terrorists.\n\nOnyeuko said the six terrorists\u2019 commanders surrendered to troops at Gwoza.\n\nHe listed the surrendered commanders to include Malam Mala Hassan (Wali), Ali Madagali (Munzur), Musa Bashir (Chief Anur), Buba Dahiru (Munzur), Jafar Hamma (Kaid) and Abbali Polisawa.\n\n\u201cAlso, about 3,858 Boko Haram terrorists and their families surrendered between July 1 and July 14, comprising 505 males, 1,042 females and 2,311 children,\u201d he said.\n\nThe DHQ also said the troops neutralised an unspecified number of terrorists in different encounters at Gamage village in Dikwa local government area, Dikwa \u2013 Gamborou-Ngala road, Pulka \u2013 Gwale road in Borno during the period.\n\nThe spokesperson said several terrorists\u2019 logistics suppliers/collaborators were arrested with different items at various locations within the theatre.\n\nHe said: \u201cAmong them were two women namely; Hauwa Gambo and Khadija Dirsa. Consequently, troops neutralised 42 terrorists, arrested 10, captured 17 AK47 rifles, one QTC rifle, 1 RPG bomb, one RPG tube, five hand grenades, 120 rounds of 5.5mm and 54 rounds of 7.62mm special ammunition.\u201d\n\nOnyeuko listed other items to include 151 rounds of 7.62mm NATO; 60 rounds of 12.7 108mm, two ammo links, five Dane guns, eight rounds of fabricated 7.62mm ammunition, one smoke grenade, two locally made explosives, 23 empty AK47 magazines, and five FN magazines.\n\nHe said the surrendered terrorists and their families were being profiled and documented while recovered items and apprehended suspected terrorists had been handed over to the appropriate authorities for further action.\n\nNigerians urged on skewed narratives\n\nMeanwhile, Nigerians have been enjoined to positively collaborate with the Nigerian Army and sister-agencies in the fight against terrorism, and sundry security challenges.\n\nThey were urged not to join in pulling them down through negative comments and assessments in the conventional and social media platforms.\n\nThe Africa Advocacy for Leadership and Good Governance (AALG), and Transparency Network Centre (two pro-human rights and pro-democracy groups) gave this counsel in a statement by its national coordinator, Mahmud Bello and Executive Secretary TNC Comrade Bashorun Adegbite.\n\nTheir reaction followed what they described as \u201cthe recent numerous media publications and headlines skewed and slanted to favour the insurgents against the Nigerian Army for some time now,\u201d following the Kuje jailbreak and the Daura convoy attack by terror elements.\n\nThe groups said: \u201cSince the proactive and patriotic Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen Faruk Yahaya, took over the mantle of leadership, the Nigerian Army has greatly reduced the ferocity of the Boko Haram insurgents/ISWAP; curtailed farmers/herdsmen clashes across the country and also nipped in the bud, various unpatriotic elements who are fanning the embers of war within the country.\n\n\u201cNigerians have never been so proud of the professional focus of the Army as regards the safeguarding of the territorial integrity of the nation and the high motivation esprit-de-corps of officers and men, including conforming to the best global practices as it relates to human rights and civility of the Nigerian Army in this democratic dispensation.\n\n\u201cOur Nigerian Army has remained the best in Africa and Sub-Sahara Africa, it has remained the best led, best trained and best equipped with patriotic soldiers who are focused on the onerous task ahead of protecting and safeguarding the territorial integrity of our nation.\n\n\u201cA realistic assessment of the security situation shows the insurgents are not winning the war, but have been degraded and demystified by the Nigerian Military, but are just grandstanding and using every propaganda tools and unpatriotic Nigerians including disgruntled politicians to fan the embers of divisiveness.\n\n\u201cWe urge our military to remain focused and undeterred in their on-going military operations across the country, the onslaught against ISWAP/Boko Haram insurgents and criminal elements across the country. They should not be distracted and discouraged by the antics of these fifth columnists and evil merchants who do not mean well for our nation.\u201d\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

They divorced 15 years later in 1992.\n\nThey had three children together \u2013 Donald Jr, Ivanka and Eric Trump.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, police are investigating the cause of death, which \u201cappeared to be accidental\u201d.\n\nThe pair were notable public figures in New York in the 1980s and 1990s, and their split was the subject of intense public interest.\n\nAfter their separation, Ms Trump went on to launch her own lines of beauty products, clothing and jewellery.\n\nShe took credit for bringing up their children in her 2017 memoir Raising Trump, saying she \u201cmade the decisions about their education, activities, travel, child care, and allowances\u201d until college.\n\nIn the book, she added that her relationship with Mr Trump had improved since their divorce, and said she spoke to him about once a week.\n\nThe Trump family lauded her in a statement as \u201ca force in business, a world-class athlete, a radiant beauty, and caring mother and friend\u201d.\n\n\u201cIvana Trump was a survivor.

Her first, Alfred Winklmayr, was an Austrian ski instructor and friend who she reportedly married in order to obtain Austrian citizenship.\n\nThat marriage allowed her to leave her communist home country \u2013 which was then Czechoslovakia \u2013 without defecting.\n\nA long-time skier, Ms Trump is said to have skied competitively in the country.\n\nBut Mr Trump\u2019s claims that she was an alternate on the 1972 Winter Olympics team were refuted in 1989 by a local Olympic official.\n\nWhile living in Canada in the 1970s, she worked as a ski instructor and model.\n\nOn a work trip to New York City in 1976, she met Mr Trump while with a group of models. They were married the following year and quickly became a tabloid fixture.\n\nOver the course of their marriage, Ms Trump held several roles within the Trump Organization, including as manager of the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan.\n\nBut Mr Trump reportedly locked her out of her office at the hotel in 1990 as they sparred over four pre-nuptial agreements.\n\nWhen the divorce settlement was finalised in 1992, Ms Trump had signed a non-disclosure agreement but also received $14m (\u00a311.8m) and a mansion in Connecticut among other things.\n\nShe was also married twice more: to Italian businessman Riccardo Mazzucchelli, from 1995-97; and to Italian actor Rossano Rubicondi, from 2008-09.\n\nFormer New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani wrote on Twitter that Ms Trump was \u201ca truly talented, creative and beautiful person\u201d, who had \u201ccontributed greatly\u201d to his city.\n\n\u201cShe lived the American Dream,\u201d said Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a top Trump ally.\n\nAnd media personality Piers Morgan described Ms Trump as \u201ca fabulously entertaining lady and great interviewee who remained fiercely loyal to her ex-husband\u201d.\n\nIn 2017, she told ABC\u2019s Good Morning America that she didn\u2019t want to make Mr Trump\u2019s current wife Melania jealous by calling him at the White House. \u201cI\u2019m basically first Trump wife. OK? I\u2019m first lady,\u201d she said.\n\nIt was one of many memorable quotes from the former model. In a cameo role in the 1996 movie The First Wives Club, she told disgruntled divorcees: \u201cLadies, you have to be strong and independent. And remember, don\u2019t get mad, get everything.\u201d\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

          "text": "By Onu Okorie\n\nIn Nigeria today, when agents of transformations in the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari are being counted, the Director General of Securities and Exchange Commission SEC, Mr. Lamido Yuguda will definitely standout, if the numerous reforms he has introduced is anything to go by.\n\nIn less than two years after assuming office the SEC management under Mr. Yuguda has not only set strategic goals but also continued to expand the frontiers of investment space thereby attracting improved local and foreign direct investment, FDIs into the economy through innovative regulatory guidelines and collaboration with other relevant institutions.\n\nFor instance, on market-wide issues, the Commission has drafted and presented an amendment to ISA Bill to the National Assembly as part of its efforts to enhance the regulatory framework of the Nigerian capital market, lead to the introduction of new products into the market, and increase the effectiveness of the Investments and Securities Tribunal, amongst other benefits to ensure that the provisions of the Bill represent realities in the nation\u2019s investment climate.\n\nAlso, the Commission is collaborating with National Assembly Business Environment Roundtable NASSBER to prepare a roadmap towards passage of the Bill within the shortest time frame.\n\nAlso, the Yuguda-led executive management team has been implementing capital market development goals set out in the Capital Market Master Plan (CMMP) (2015-2025) and successfully completed the review of CMMP to realign the initiatives/deliverables to prevailing market conditions and keep the document relevant in the dynamic capital market due to issues related to Fintech, sustainability and regional integration.\n\nTo resolve legacy issues of Identity Management which is a crucial driver in improving market participation and solving unclaimed dividends and related problems, the management also inaugurated a market-wide Identity Management Committee with mandate to harmonize the various databases of investors in Nigerian capital market, facilitate data accuracy in the market, mitigate fraud, improve KYC requirements and manage AML/CFT risks, among others.\n\nThe report of the committee is expected to resolve issues that have hindered growth of the Market, hampered investor confidence, and matters that serve as barriers to entry for potential investors, amongst other benefits.\n\nOn primary market activities, the Yuguda-led executive management of the SEC has also in the past two years approved 41 new equities issues valued at N656.9 billion, 37 bonds valued at N776.2 billion, 28 applications for shelf programmes valued at N2.5 trillion and 21 Exchange Traded Derivatives Contracts.\n\nThis is even as it processed six Schemes of Merger, seven Acquisitions, 21 Corporate Restructurings, and three Takeovers during the period. It also ensured that over N11 billions of untraceable shareholders\u2019 funds from Schemes of Arrangement in the custody of Registrars were transferred to the National Investor Protection Fund NIPF.\n\nAs part of the process of improving time to market of transactions and fast tracking the review process, the Commission conducted training for issuing houses to help improve the quality of applications submitted.\n\nSimilarly, Commission also recorded a landmark achievement on the first electronic offering with combined feature of book building to Qualified Institutions and use of the price discovered from book-build for sales to Retail Investors. It also granted approval for the first 21 derivatives contracts which had seven and 14 different contracts from both the NGX and FMDQ Exchanges respectively in the past two years.\n\nOn Collective Investment Scheme CIS, the Yuguda-led management has also, following completion of series of monitoring and evaluation processes, commenced implementation of 100 per cent custody requirement in the CIS sector to protect investors. As a result, all clients\u2019 assets currently managed under discretionary and non-discretionary mandates are to be held under independent custodial agreements in custodial banks.\n\nThe Commission has also recorded remarkable milestones in its secondary market activities in the past years with successful demutualization of the Nigerian Exchange Limited NGX which investment analysts see as milestone in the development of Nigerian capital market.\n\nThis is even as the management collaborated with University of Cambridge\u2019s Centre for Alternative Finance, UK for the training of its select employees on a certified course on Fintech & Regulatory Innovation, to enhance the Commission\u2019s capacity in regulating Fintech.\n\nAlso, it collaborated with the World Bank to commission a Fintech Scoping project and held collaborative engagements with 15 International and local Fintech stakeholders to guide the Commission on its Fintech policies.\n\nThe Regulatory Incubation Guidelines to operationalize provisional regulation for aspiring Fintech firms were released within the period. In furtherance of its market regulation roles, management of the Commission was able to ascertain the quantum of unclaimed dividends of publicly traded companies that fall within the categories eligible to be borrowed by the Federal Government.\n\nThis amounted to N56, 584,795,648.71 and $8,153,118.41 respectively. In addition, it also facilitated the transfer into the SEC/CNB NIPF Account of N2.3 billion in excess of return monies and N11.4 billion in Schemes consideration money, both of which had previously been held in the custody of the Registrars.\n\nOn the pesky issue of Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing Of Terrorism AML/CFT, following the GIABA Mutual Evaluation of Nigeria, the Yuguda-led executive management had made concerted efforts in the capital market to meet both the GIABA Mutual Evaluation Report MER Follow-Up Process and the FATF International Cooperation Review Group ICRG requirements in order to avoid Nigeria being placed on the FATF public grey list at the Plenary when the grace period expires in October, 2022.\n\nFor instance, following the MER findings that Nigeria had several important deficiencies in its AML/CFT/CPF system in relation to Technical Compliance, and that its effectiveness controls were insufficient to mitigate its high ML/TF/PF risks, the Commission championed the amendments of Rules and Regulations of the Virtual Asset Service providers; the sector specific regulations to repeal the 2013 SEC AML/CFT Regulations and enactment of the 2022 AML/CFT Regulations; the SEC AML/CFT RBS Framework.\n\nThese new rules and amendments were done in order to address Nigeria\u2019s MER deficiencies and broaden the scope of preventive measures available to VASPs. In furtherance of its regulatory mandate, the Commission conducted investigations into complaints by investors and out of the 250 complaints brought forward into the period, 182 were resolved.\n\nAlso, out of the 58 complaints in relation to Ponzi schemes received, 45 were resolved. The Commission was able to recover 10,659,168 units of various companies\u2019 shares as well as the sum of N1, 384,255,526.73 recovered for investors during the period under review.\n\nIt issued New Rules on Robo-Advisory Services to guide the regulatory requirements and expectations for providing automated advisory services in the market and released the Rules on Trade Repositories during the period under review.\n\nSimilarly, the Yuguda-led executive management of the Commission also introduced new rules on Crowd Funding, Social bonds, Digital Assets Exchange DAX, Digital Assets Custodians DACs, Issuance of Digital Assets as Securities and Requirements for registration of Digital Assets Offering Platforms as part of its efforts to guarantee security of investments in the capital market.\n\nOn Corporate Governance measures, the Commission also released guidelines on the Implementation of Sections 60-63 of Investments and Securities Act (ISA), 2007 and in order to strengthen the disclosure regime in capital market, the Commission in a circular dated January 19, 2022 provided public companies a fast track option for filing Audited Financial Statements.\n\nIn addition, the Commission also developed the SEC Corporate Governance Guidelines SCGG to address corporate governance issues not considered in the NCCG, and released same in October 2020. As part of its efforts to harmonise the reporting timeline of the SEC Corporate Governance Guideline SCGG with that of the National Code of Corporate Governance NCCG, it also in year 2021 exposed to the public for comments an amendment to Rules 42(2).\n\nThe Commission has also as part of its regulatory interventions to amicably resolve disputes between the board and shareholders of listed companies resolved the disputes between Alhaji Muneer Alade Bankole (the Chief Executive Officer and Sheikh Abdulmohsen A. Al-Thunayan Chairman of the Board, of Medview Airlines, resolved those between major shareholders of Ikeja Hotels Plc and returned the company to profitability and also reached a settlement with Oando Plc in 2021 after concluding investigation of Corporate Governance allegations levelled against the company.\n\nIn regard to its market development mandate, the Commission has continued its Investor Education and Public enlightenment programmes by organizing workshops on infusion of Capital Market Studies into the curricula of Basic and Secondary Schools in Nigeria and also collaborated with the Standards Organization of Nigeria SON and other partners to organize Stakeholders\u2019 Sensitization Workshops on Commodities Standards in Lagos and Kano during the period under review.\n\nFurthermore, the Commission held webinars on Non-Interest Capital Market Products, Financial Inclusion, Ponzi Schemes and Solid Minerals targeted at the pension industry, investor protection, women, Youth/millennial and the commodities segment of the market.\n\nAlso in pursuit of non-interest market education and enlightenment programmes, the Commission collaborated with Islamic Financial Services Board IFSB and the Auditing and Accounting Organisation of Islamic Financial Institutions AAOIFI to organize Non-Interest Capital Market training for over 1000 participants.\n\nAlso, the Yuguda-led executive management of the Commission has led the team to improve the capacity of the Nigerian Capital Market Institute NCMI by providing it with necessary tools to train Capital Market Operators CMO in different fields.\n\nOn international engagements, Mr Yuguda is now saddled with leadership of West African Securities Regulators Association WASRA. Under his leadership, rules for the integrated West African Capital Market were developed and reviewed.\n\nOn human capital development, the Commission had in 2019 conducted an internal capacity assessment that outlined staffing deficits and needs.\n\nAlso, in furtherance of its drive to leverage its operations by deploying innovative technologies and solutions to its departments and units, the Commission conducted a review of its IT infrastructure and determined that it was in a poor state.\n\nThe investigations focused on the internal and external perceptions of the Commission with the conclusion that the IT infrastructure was out dated and needed to be upgraded to international standards of securities regulators.\n\nAlso, on its Risk-Based Supervision Framework Implementation and Capacity Building Project the Commission secured a $400,000 grant from the African Development Bank AfDB to support capacity building projects in the areas of RBS, Derivatives and Green Bonds.\n\nThe Commission has also secured counterpart funding of $450,000 from AfDB on its Nigeria Securities Market Surveillance System Project to support the deployment of a real-time market surveillance system for the Nigerian capital market.\n\nIn addition, it has also secured from the Central Bank of Nigeria CBN the sum of N3.5 billion for Information Technology transformation project. Given the unparalleled achievements recorded so far, it has been argued by some financial experts that there is nexus between Yuguda\u2019s reforms and investors\u2019 making Nigeria a preferred destination in recent times.",

The court also forewarned that it would order the Legal Aid Council to take up his case if he fails to show up for the next adjourned date without a lawyer.\n\nMr Omotubora was absent in court again on Thursday, resulting in another adjournment, but this time the judge expressed his displeasure with the situation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201d This is unbecoming of a lawyer of this noble profession, this particular counsel has failed to come to court to conduct his trial and this court strongly condemn it,\u201d the judge said.\n\nMr Omotubora has been absent from court five times in a row, but on the most recent adjourned date, June 30, the court ordered that his defense be handled by the junior counsel from his chambers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier in the day, the Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice Moyosore Onigbanjo SAN, who announced his appearance for the prosecution of the case, leading the Director of Public Prosecutor DPP, Dr Babajide Martins, and the Deputy Director of Public Prosecution Adebayo Haroun, told the court that the matter was for continuation of trial.\n\nThe AG said \u201d The matter was adjourned till today on 30th June 2022, in the presence of counsel for the defence. This morning again the defence is not represented. I would be urging the court to ask the defendantt for the whereabouts of his counsel, before I make any necessary application\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, when the court asked Andrew Nice the whereabouts of his counsel, he said, \u201d I was not able to reach him, I am not aware that my counsel will not be in court today\u201d.\n\nThe AG informed the court that the prosecution was ready to proceed with its case and that there were five witnesses in court to testify: two bank officers who had been subpoenaed, an investigative police officer and the team leader from the State Criminal Investigation Department, Panti, as well as the deceased\u2019s brother.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said \u201d My lord in view that the defendant is unable to defend himself, my application is for the court to appoint a lawyer who will represent the defendant either from the Office of the Public Defender (OPD) or from the Legal Aid Council, to continue with the defence of the defendant.\n\n\u201d It is also clear that the defendant\u2019s counsel who is aware of this date did not deem it fit to inform the court that he would not be in court today. I want the court to take note before appointing OPD or LAC. This is a capital offence and the defence counsel\u2019s conduct is just to frustrate this case\u201d.https://www.tvcnews.tv/2022/07/president-buhari-visits-kuje-prison-laments-security-failures/\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn view of the AG\u2019s submission, Justice Sonaike asked Andrew Nice if he could defend himself, and Mr Ominnikoron replied that he was ready to defend himself.\n\nBut Mr Onigbanjo said \u201d Even though the defendant said he can defend himself, I will say the court should tread with caution. I would urged the court to appoint OPD or LAC, to take over defence and represent. I want a fair trial\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsequently Justice Sonaike adjourned the case to September 28 for continuation of trial.\n\nMr Omininikoron was facing four counts of conspiracy, rape, and murder of Miss Ayanwola contrary to and punishable under sections 411, 223, 260 and 165 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the last adjourned date, a junior lawyer, P.O Idogun, from Omotubora chambers informed the court that Mr Omotubora though recovered from his illness had to travel for an interview in Abuja, while seeking an adjournment for the continuation of trial.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe lead counsel was in Abuja for an interview and it is not yet concluded. He called me this morning to hurriedly come here and attend this matter. This is not to disrespect this court. Our application is to pray for an adjournment before the court.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI have not appeared in this matter before. I know I am duty-bound to continue but I appeal before the court that the matter will proceed on the next adjourned date because I might not properly and effectively do it today,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Attorney-General of the state, Moyosore Onigbanjo, SAN, leading the prosecution, objected to the application citing the matter had been adjourned for the third time in a month at the instance of the defense counsel. He said the interview should not supersede the criminal case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe second prosecution witness Kayode Aluko, has concluded his evidence while the prosecution called another witness, ASP Amos Isibor, who was the Incident Duty Officer.\n\nHe narrated to court how he met a naked female lifeless body.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fourth prosecution witness, Segun Abbey, a field officer of the Lagos State Domestic and Sexual Violence Agency, testified as well about how the agency received a similar report from one Odezelu Mary-Jane, who accused the defendant, Andrew Nice Ominikoron of raping her.

          "text": "US President Joe Biden will discuss energy supply, human rights, and security cooperation in Saudi Arabia on Friday on a trip designed to reset the U.S. relationship with a country he once pledged to make a \u201cpariah\u201d on the world stage.\n\nThe White House said Biden would hold a bilateral meeting with Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz at the royal palace in Jeddah and then the president and his team would have a working session with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as MbS, and Saudi ministers at the palace.\n\nEnergy and security interests prompted the president and his aides to decide not to isolate the kingdom, the world\u2019s top oil exporter and regional powerhouse that has been strengthening ties with Russia and China.\n\nA U.S. official told Reuters on Friday that Washington is not expecting Saudi Arabia to immediately boost oil production and that the United States was eyeing what the OPEC+ group decides in its next meeting on Aug. 3.\n\nThe visit will be closely watched for body language and rhetoric. U.S. intelligence concluded that MbS directly approved the 2018 murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, while the crown prince denies having a role in the killing.\n\nWhite House advisers have declined to say whether Biden will shake hands with the prince, the kingdom\u2019s de facto ruler. Biden will meet with a broader set of Arab leaders at a summit in the Red Sea port city of Jeddah on Saturday.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s going to meet about a dozen leaders and he\u2019ll greet them as he usually does,\u201d a senior Biden administration official told reporters.\n\nAt the start of Biden\u2019s trip to the Middle East, officials said he would avoid close contacts, such as shaking hands, as a precaution against COVID-19. But the president ended up engaging in hand-shaking in Israel. read more\n\nBiden said on Thursday his position on Khashoggi\u2019s murder was \u201cabsolutely\u201d clear. Biden made his \u201cpariah\u201d comment less than two years ago after the journalist\u2019s killing and while campaigning for president.\n\nBiden said he would raise human rights issues in Saudi Arabia, but he did not say specifically if he would broach the Khashoggi murder with its leaders.\n\nSaudi ambassador to the United States Reema bint Bandar Al Saud, writing in U.S. magazine Politico, reiterated the kingdom\u2019s \u201cabhorrence\u201d of the killing, describing it as a gruesome atrocity, and said it cannot define U.S.-Saudi ties.\n\nShe said the relationship should also not be seen in the \u201coutdated and reductionist\u201d oil-for-security paradigm.\n\n\u201cThe world has changed and the existential dangers facing us all, including food and energy security and climate change, cannot be resolved without an effective U.S.-Saudi alliance.\u201d\n\nThe United States is eager to see Saudi Arabia and its OPEC partners pump more oil to help bring down the high cost of gasoline and ease the highest U.S. inflation in four decades.\n\nRiyadh faces its own balancing act as it seeks to improve ties with Washington while shoring up the OPEC+ oil alliance with Russia.\n\n\u201cThe Saudis definitely are intending to boost capacity and with oil prices so high they have the wherewithal to do that, particularly as they see production constraints elsewhere in a market that is still growing,\u201d said Daniel Yergin, S&P Global vice chairman and an expert in world energy markets.\n\nBiden will encourage peace and press for a more integrated Middle East during his trip, the administration official said. Topics include strengthening a truce in Yemen, \u201cbalance\u201d in energy markets and technological cooperation in 5G and 6G.\n\nAhead of the visit, Saudi Arabia said it would open its airspace to all air carriers, paving the way for more overflights to and from Israel, in what Biden described as a historic and important step towards building a more integrated and stable Middle East. read more\n\n\u201cThanks to months of steady diplomacy between my administration and Saudi Arabia, it is finally a reality,\u201d Biden said in a statement. \u201cI will do all that I can, through direct diplomacy and leader-to-leader engagement, to keep advancing this groundbreaking process.\u201d\n\nBiden will be the first American president to fly from Israel directly to Jeddah, a step the White House says represents a \u201csmall symbol\u201d of warming Israeli-Saudi ties. Two years ago, Riyadh gave a tacit nod for the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain to normalise relations with Israel.\n\nThe U.S.-brokered deals known as the Abraham Accords established a new axis in the region, where Gulf states share Israel\u2019s concerns about Iran\u2019s nuclear and missiles programmes and proxy network. Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia and Shi\u2019ite Muslim Iran have for years vied for regional influence but launched direct talks last year in an effort to contain tensions.\n\nThe Saudi ambassador said U.S.-Saudi efforts to ensure peace and security should focus on enhancing cooperation and \u201creinforcing a rules-based system\u201d to confront the \u201cvision of chaos promoted by Iran\u201d.\n\nDuring his visit to Israel, Biden and Prime Minister Yair Lapid signed a joint pledge to deny Iran nuclear weapons, which the Islamic Republic denies seeking.\n\nReuters",

Manuri Pabasari, told the BBC at the time that a protest rally against Ranil Wickremesinghe was expected in the coming days.\n\n\u201cHe has no people\u2019s mandate [and] is a well known Rajapaksa supporter,\u201d she added. \u201cI mean the new president and the new prime minister should be not a Rajapaksa supporter.\u201d\n\nThe governor of Sri Lanka\u2019s central bank, Nandalal Weerasinghe, has warned the country may shut down if no stable government is formed soon.\n\nThere was a \u201clot of uncertainty\u201d over whether enough foreign exchange can be found to pay for essential petroleum, he told the BBC\u2019s Newsnight programme, and progress on getting an international bailout package depended on having a stable administration.\n\nMeanwhile, Singapore says the ousted president Gotabaya Rajapaksa did not ask for political asylum when he arrived there.\n\nThe former president, who arrived with his wife and two bodyguards, no longer has legal immunity as a head of state and his position is now more precarious as he tries to find a safe country to shelter in.\n\nHe is expected to stay in Singapore for some time before possibly moving to the United Arab Emirates, Sri Lankan security sources told AFP news agency.\n\nSri Lanka: The basics\n\nSri Lanka is an island nation off southern India: It won independence from British rule in 1948. Three ethnic groups \u2013 Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim \u2013 make up 99% of the country\u2019s 22 million population.\n\nOne family of brothers has dominated for years: Mahinda Rajapaksa became a hero among the majority Sinhalese in 2009 when his government defeated Tamil separatist rebels after years of bitter and bloody civil war. His brother Gotabaya, who was defence secretary at the time and later became president, fled the country after mass unrest.\n\nPresidential powers: The president is the head of state, government and the military in Sri Lanka, but does share a lot of executive responsibilities with the prime minister, who heads up the ruling party in parliament.\n\nNow an economic crisis has led to fury on the streets: Soaring inflation has meant some foods, medication and fuel are in short supply, there are rolling blackouts and ordinary people have taken to the streets in anger, with many blaming the Rajapaksa family and their government for the situation.\n\nBBC",

          "title": "Nigeria: Brigade of Guards Tightens Security in Abuja Over Terror Fears",
          "text": "In anticipation of potential terror attacks in Nigeria\u2019s capital Abuja, Nigeria\u2019s Brigade of Guards, responsible for the security of the president, his family and the Federal Capital Territory(FCT), has stationed troops at the captital\u2019s entry and exit points.\n\nTo this end, soldiers have intensified stop and search operations with increased checkpoints in view of the development.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nMeanwhile, President Muhammadu Buhari, Thursday, said the armed forces response to insecurity in the country was commendable and therefore, pledged the readiness of his administration to provide additional logistics and support to the military towards eliminating terrorism and insurgency in the country.\n\nHowever, in Abuja, civil servants and other residents had a tough time getting to their offices as the security checks snarled traffic, keeping motorists stranded in traffic for hours.\n\nThe traffic gridlock was noticed in Nyanya-Karu Road, Lugbe-Abuja City Gate axis and Gwagwalada-Zuba area.\n\nThe tightened security, THISDAY gathered, might not be unconnected to a security alert issued last week by the FCT command of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), that the insurgents were planning to attack schools, churches and public infrastructure in the territory.\n\nThe situation has forced schools and churches to review their security arrangements.\n\n\u201cWe spent more than two hours in the traffic before getting to work,\u201d a resident said.\n\nThe new security measures came as the Defence Headquarters (DHQ) said naval troops on anti-bunkering operations in the Niger Delta region destroyed 109 illegal refining sites and arrested 24 oil bunkerers in the last two weeks.\n\nSpeaking at a media briefing in Abuja, the Director, Defence Media Operations (DDMO), Maj Gen Bernard Onyeuko, said soldiers recovered over N2.7 billion stolen crude comprising over four million litres of crude oil, two million litres of Automotive Gas Oil (AGO)and 30,000 litres of DPK.\n\nHe said troops of Operation Delta Safe, also discovered and destroyed 34 wooden boats, 150 storage tanks, 119 ovens, 104 dugout pits, 27 pumping machines, one weapon, one speed boat, 13 vehicles and seven outboard engines.\n\nOnyeuko said the soldiers achieved the feat while on operation Octopus Grip conducted in creeks, towns and communities in Delta, Bayelsa and Rivers States.\n\nThe DMO spokesman, while giving an update on military operations conducted between June 30 to July 14, also said 3,858 Boko Haram fighters and their families surrendered to troops fighting the counter-insurgency war.\n\nThose who surrendered included 505 males, 1,042 females and 2,311 children, as well as six commanders of the terrorists, amongst them, Mallam Mala Hassan, Ali Madagali, Musa Bashir, Buba Dahiru, Jafar Hamma and Abbali Nakib Polisawa.\n\nWithin the period under review, Onyeuko said soldiers killed several terrorists and arrested some logistics suppliers/collaborators with various items at various logistics towns within the theatre.\n\nBuhari: Armed Forces Response to Insecurity Commendable, Pledges More Support\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, who pledged the readiness of his administration to provide additional logistics and support to the military towards eliminating terrorism and insurgency in the country, has also described the armed forces response to insecurity as commendable.\n\nHe further disclosed that the nation, in the last 12 years, had experienced more security challenges but was quick to hail the operational capability of Nigerian military.\n\nSpeaking Thursday at the graduation ceremony of 247 students of the Senior Course 44 of the Armed Forces Command and Staff College, Jaji, the president promised that his government would continue to provide the needed support required to wipe out terrorists and insurgents off the face of the earth.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThis government will continue to provide the required guidance and support to ensure that the desired results are achieved. The Armed Forces of Nigeria are working tirelessly to enhance their combat effectiveness, operational capability and training necessary to eliminate the threats, in synergy with other institutions and nations.\n\n\u201cThe response of the Armed Forces of Nigeria to the Boko Haram insurgency, banditry, militancy, kidnapping as well as the activities of separatists and armed militias amongst others have been commendable.\n\n\u201cWe have witnessed recent terrorist attacks in Nigeria bearing the hallmark of national and trans-border insurgents trying to cause havoc in Nigeria as well as in neighbouring countries.\n\n\u201cIt will be part of your duty to confront these terrorists and insurgents and wipe them off the face of the earth and bring peace to our countries,\u201d the president told the graduating students.\n\nHe described the specifics of their training, which focused primarily on countering security threats as very important, adding that, \u201ccombating these prevalent security threats effectively demands that African countries continue to work together at all levels; be it tactical, operational and strategic.\u201d\n\nAppraising the ongoing collaboration of the Armed Forces of Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger Republic, Benin Republic and Chad in a multinational operation to combat the Boko Haram Insurgency in the Lake Chad region, the president said it has been productive, commendable and successful.\n\n\u201cThe synergy achieved in operating together must have been enhanced by an understanding of the doctrines of the cooperating forces. This occasion provides me another opportunity to briefly reflect on the state of the Nigerian nation, particularly, regarding national security. The last 12 years have been very challenging for our nation, considering the different security threats that have besieged the country.\n\n\u201cOur government is poised to promote national security and development, as well as to remain committed to promoting a vision of a secure, safe, just, peaceful, prosperous and strong Nigeria. We shall be employing all elements of our national power in ensuring security, a just society, peaceful coexistence, national unity and sustainable development while promoting our good standing internationally.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari expressed delight that amongst the graduating students were international officers from sister African countries, saying he was confident they enjoyed the friendliness of the country during their stay.\n\nArmy Assures Corps Members of Safety in Katsina\n\nThe Nigerian Army has assured the National Youths Service Corps (NYSC) members deployed to Katsina State of adequate security throughout their service year in the state.\n\nThe commander 17 brigade, Nigerian Army, Katsina, Brigadier General Ibikunle Ajose, gave the assurance during an interactive session with the state NYSC Coordinator, Aisha Muhammed, in her office.\n\nHe added that the military was determined to provide adequate security for NYSC members serving across the 34 local government areas of state\n\nThe Army general expressed readiness to render necessary assistance to the corps members and the state NYSC management whenever the need arose in order to ensure effective and efficient service delivery.\n\nAjose equally promised to sponsor sporting activities and competitions among corps members in the camp for harmonious coexistence to thrive.\n\nResponding, Muhammed thanked the Nigerian Army for vowing to secure the lives and property of Corps members in the state.\n\nShe added that the NYSC management and the Nigerian Army would work assiduously to safeguard corps members, promising to report any suspicious person or movement to security agencies in the state for prompt intervention.\n\nDeji Elumoye, Kingsley Nwezeh, Michael Olugbode in Abuja and Francis Sardauna in Katsina",

          "title": "Osun Election Will Herald an End to APC\u2019s Reign in Nigeria, Atiku Says",
          "text": "Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, on Thursday, said a PDP victory in the Osun State governorship election on Saturday will bring an end to the reign of the ruling All Progressives Congress in the country.\n\nThe former vice-president, said Senator Ademola Adeleke\u2019s win would send a clear message to the APC, adding that he was convinced by the popularity of the party\u2019s candidate in the state.\n\nAlso, the National Chairman of the PDP, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu; Vice-presidential candidate of the party and Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa; former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki and governors of the PDP, on Thursday led a final campaign for Adeleke ahead of Saturday\u2019s election.\n\nBut mild tension erupted Thursday in Osogbo, the Osun State capital, when the government reportedly denied the PDP use of the Osogbo township stadium for its planned mega rally.\n\nThe PDP was equally denied the use of the Technical College field and the Freedom Park. Yet, the APC and the Labour Party, were on Tuesday and Wednesday, allowed to use same facilities for their rallies.\n\nThis is as the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), has deployed 11, 226 officers and men to cover the 3,763 polling units, collation centres, flashpoints as well as critical national assets and infrastructure in all the 31 local government areas of the state during Saturday\u2019s gubernatorial election.\n\nSpeaking on the prospect of the PDP in Saturday\u2019s election, Atiku said, \u201cOur victory in Osun, by God\u2019s grace and the overwhelming decision of the electorate, will send a strong message to the ruling APC party that their reign has come to an end. APC\u2019s loss in Osun is a win for the people of the state. It is when the people win that the PDP can truly boast of victory.\n\n\u201cAnd that is the promise that the PDP holds, not just in Osun but everywhere else. Thus, the election this Saturday is a battle between the people and the forces of darkness that has held us hostage. But it is a battle that I am certain that the people shall win.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t speak Yoruba but I understand a bit of it. Some members of my family speak the language fluently. Of course, the Yoruba people are dear to my heart as other tribes in our country. But the Yoruba language, has a unique quality that I admire in particular. It has the power of descriptiveness.\u201d\n\nOn the popularity of the PDP candidate, Atiku said, \u201cBy my understanding, the slogan of Imole as the brand identity of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) gubernatorial candidate in the Osun State election could not have been more apt.\n\n\u201cImole is not just light. Indeed, the closest English interpretation of it is \u2018to illuminate\u2019. And for that, it is no wonder why our gubernatorial candidate, Senator Ademola Adeleke enjoys a groundswell of support amongst the esteemed people of the state across all localities and local governments.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cFor the past 12 years, Osun that was once a shinning star of the West, has been thrown into a state of doldrums. But the good news is here, because the PDP is here.\n\n\u201cImole has come on a rescue mission to return Osun to its state of glory and splendour and I, Atiku Abubakar, and all leaders of our great party will be on ground in Osogbo to mobilise support for the success of our campaign.\u201d\n\nDescribing the crisis in the party as a social media creation, Atiku insisted that the PDP was one united party, stating that he was open to meeting the Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike.\n\nFielding questions after the mega rally in Osogbo, the PDP presidential candidate said, \u201cIt is a social media drama. There is nothing like a Wike camp or Atiku camp. There is one PDP family.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether he was willing to meet Wike for discussion, the former vice-president answered: \u201cWhy not? I am open to that. Some people get angry, when things don\u2019t go their way and so on and so forth. We will overcome that. I have every belief that we are going to do that.\u201d\n\nAyu, Okowa, Saraki, Govs in Final Campaign for Adeleke\n\nDespite being denied the use of the stadium facility for its mega rall on Thursday, the PDP still held its rally at the state secretariat with a large turnout of members.\n\nIn attendance were Atiku and his running mate, Okowa, Ayu, who led other members of the National working committee to the mega campaign; Saraki, the Governor of Sokoto State and chairman of the PDP Governors Forum, Aminu Waziri Tambawul.\n\nOther PDP governors in attendance were the Edo State, Godwin Obaseki; the chairman of the Osun State campaign council and Governor of Bayelsa State, Douye Diri,\n\nOne after the other, the PDP chieftains spoke on why the electorate should vote for PDP, even as they described Osun as a PDP state, insisting that the stolen mandate must be returned back.\n\nSaraki also posted on his verified Twitter handle, saying, \u201cYesterday, at the training of PDP Polling Unit agents in Osun State, I was proud to see the level of preparation of our party and Senator Adeleke. There, I called on all PDP polling agents to not be intimidated on Saturday and to protect all PDP votes!\n\n\u201cWe have learned from the Osun 2018 gubernatorial election. This time, we are more prepared. Our agents have been trained, using INEC guidelines and we are sticking to the letter of the law,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, for denying the PDP the opportunity to hold the mega rally, the state chapter of the party described the action as shameful.\n\nAccording to the party\u2019s Caretaker Chairman, Dr Akindele Adekunle, the party was denied the use of stadium, Technical College field and the Freedom Park, which it applied to use for the final campaign programme, adding that the action revealed the plan of the state government to incite violence and disrupt peaceful election on Saturday.\n\n\u201cAfter due consultations with prominent stakeholders in the state, including our highly revered royal fathers, the leadership of our party, decided to make do with the vicinity of our state secretariat for our Mega Rally.\n\n\u201cOur party considers the action of the state government as an affront of a dying horse and a deliberate attempt to provoke violent reactions from the good people of Osun State, thereby, instigating crisis in the state. It is a shame and a dent on the noble race of Yoruba nation that a governor living at the mercy of tax payers money would find it convenient to descend so low.\n\n\u201cIt is elementary for any reasonable government to know that public facilities are meant for public use. The main bowl of the Osogbo City Stadium we applied to use for today\u2019s rally, for instance, had been put in place and adequately maintained by successive administrations in the state for use of our people even before Alhaji Gboyega Oyetola retraced his history to Osun State from Lagos for political trading.\n\n\u201cWe are not unaware that Mr Gboyega Oyetola by his refusal to grant our party, the required permission to use the facility, was just only testing waters of the large scale violence he is planning against the state. We want to assure him and his cohorts that he would be matched. Any attempt to subvert the electoral verdict of our people will be resisted as bonafide residents of the state. It will not be in his interest nor that of entire country to underestimate this resolve.\n\n\u201cWhile we call on President Muhammadu Buhari to be awake about the crisis Oyetola is brewing in Osun State, we call on our people not to be discouraged by the defeatist antics of Mr. Oyetola and his baby vuvuzelas. This election is not just about the PDP or Senator Ademola Jackson Nurudeen Adeleke, but for the good of our people and humanity in general,\u201d he said.\n\nBut, in defence of the action of the state government, the Special Adviser to Oyetola on Political Affairs, Sunday Akere, said the party lacked organisation and failed to book the said venues until other groups did.\n\nHe stated that not using a venue has no correlation with deployment of thugs, calling on security operatives to take cognisance of the threat issued by the PDP.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that the PDP, due to lack of proper organisation, decided to book the venues after other groups have done so. Other parties have used many public facilities, it does not determine who wins an election. A youth group booked for the stadium ahead of them, while the mini bus union is using the freedom park,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, a pro-election group, Yiaga Africa, has condemned what it described as the weak response from government in prosecuting those arrested in vote-buying amidst the increasing tendencies for thuggery in tomorrow\u2019s gubernatorial election in Osun.\n\nA statement by Samson Itodo, Executive Director, Yiaga Africa and Ezenwa Nwagwu, a board member, Yiaga Africa, lamented the possibility of vote buying in the Osun election.\n\n\u201cWeak state action against vote buying mercenaries: Recent experience in Ekiti state reveals that despite rampant vote trading during the election, the Nigerian Police have continuously shied away from arresting political party agents that engaged in vote buying on election day.\n\n\u201cIn cases, where arrests are effected, there is limited information on consequential actions taken by the police to prosecute these offenders. This seeming laxity by the Nigerian Police may embolden party agents to engage in brazen violation of electoral laws regarding voter inducement or vote buying on election day.\u201d\n\nOn logistics deployment, Yiaga Africa said, it has noted the marked improvement in the deployment of electoral materials and personnel in the Ekiti election, which led to the relatively early commencement of polls.\n\nIt said Osun state, with a substantially larger number of registered voters and polling units, might pose a bigger challenge to INEC if the logistics for the election were not managed properly.\n\nNSCDC Deploys 11, 226 Personnel\n\nDirector, Public Relations, NSCDC, Olusola Odumosu, in a statement, said the personnel were deployed from the national headquarters and nine state commands: Osun, Ondo, Ekiti, Oyo, Ogun, Lagos, Kwara, Kogi and Edo to supply manpower for the election.\n\nThe CG stated that the objectives of the Corps in the forthcoming election was to create a secured environment for its successful conduct and enhance the general security in the state before, during and after the election.\n\nHe explained that personnel had attended various workshops on best practices during election and had been acquainted with the provisions of the Electoral Act as regards the Rules of Engagement, hence, must comply with the Corps\u2019 Operational Code, Standard Operating Procedure and above all, display professionalism and high sense of discipline throughout the election.\n\nHe noted that the robust operational order has been activated to ensure a hitch-free exercise and guide against molestation and intimidation of the electorate by hoodlums or party thugs.\n\nAudi, therefore, hinted that, in readiness for the election, the Corps\u2019 undercover personnel from the national headquarters had joined their counterparts in Osun for covert operations to nip any security compromise in the bud.\n\nAudi has also assigned Deputy Commandant General (DCG) in charge of Operations, Dauda Mungadi, to oversee the election exercise.\n\nHe also designated Assistant Commandant General (ACG) Operations, Philip Ayuba, Zonal Commander (Zone J), Fasiu Adeyinka and Commandant Special Duties, Oliver Ugwuja to serve as field Commanders monitoring each senatorial district of the state.\n\nHe noted that to ensure that critical assets of government were not vandalised by criminal elements before, during and after the election, there would be deployment of the Anti-vandalism Squad, Critical National Asset Protection Unit and other special forces to all key points in the state to protect them against vandalism, damage or arson.\n\nHe also warned all personnel deployed to remain apolitical, stressing that whoever was found perpetrating unethical conduct would face sanctions.\n\nChuks Okocha, Michael Olugbode in Abuja and Yinka Kolawole in Osogbo",
