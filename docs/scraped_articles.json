          "text": "Nobel laureate, Prof Wole Soyinka, has said Nigerians are still managing to eke out a living despite the bleak realities confronting the country.\n\nSoyinka spoke during an interview with the Cable News Network monitored by our correspondent.\n\nCommenting on the ironic title for his first novel in 48 years, Chronicles from the Land of the Happiest People on Earth, he said things happened around one as one grew up, witnessing the degrading of dream and environment in one\u2019s society and on the continent.\n\nHe explained that for him, the issue had been an arduous journey, adding, \u201cIt has reached such a stage, I found intuitively, that only prose fiction can handle things that have been bubbling up inside me.\u201d\n\nHe said the title came after some people some years ago conducted a poll which placed Nigeria among the top four happiest nations in the world.\n\nThe playwright noted, \u201cThat thing has been with me, in my head. I asked, \u2018Who are these people? What do they know? What have they seen? What have they experienced in Nigeria that they make such an attribution?\u2019 That title really has been waiting to answer that claim in many ways. When you look at the surroundings, everything is the opposite and yet, Nigeria is not a complete disaster.\n\n\u201cPeople still manage to eke out a living not only a living but to some extent a dignified and satisfied living. I think it\u2019s not surface appearance of contentment or making the best of a really bad job, insisting that no matter what life must go on\u2026 It\u2019s that which needed to be, quote and unquote, celebrated in addition to the bleak actualities.\u201d\n\nThe elder statesman further said he took the decision to change his former relationship if Donald Trump was elected president of the United States despite \u201cbeing literally an enemy of decency and humanity\u2019\u2019 and his blatantly discontent for non-white humanity.\n\nHe stated, \u201cI never really totally turned my back on the United States. I mean how could one? We have many Nigerians there, to start with. When I stroll through the streets of the United States, I sometimes think the United States is an extension of Nigeria, that it\u2019s part of our diaspora.\u201d That\u2019s not an easy decision but it was inevitable.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the 2021 Nobel Prize in Literature awarded to Tanzanian novelist, Abdulrazak Gurnah, Soyinka said his immediate statement after the announcement was \u201clet the African tribe expand wherever situated.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Secondus moves to stop PDP convention, writes party leaders",
          "text": "The national convention of the Peoples Democratic Party slated for October 30 and 31, 2021 may not go as planned as its court-suspended National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, has threatened to halt the convention.\n\nIt was learnt that attempts by party leaders, especially the Senator David Mark-led eight-member committee, to find an amicable solution to the feud between Secondus and the Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, have so far failed.\n\nA fresh dimension to the dispute surfaced on Friday with the lawyers to Secondus insisting that the appeal filed by their client against his suspension was still pending in court.\n\nIn the letter written by the legal representatives of Secondus, the suspended chairman warned the PDP against going ahead with the National Convention slated for next week Saturday and Sunday.\n\nThe letter dated October 21, 2021, written by the legal chambers of Tayo Oyetibo, Solicitors and Barristers, reminded the party about the pending appeal with suit number: CA/PH1341/2021, and an application before the Federal High Court seeking to restrain the party from conducting its national convention.\n\nOyetibo threatened to mount a legal challenge to the outcome of the convention should the party go ahead before the determination of the appeal.\n\nHe argued in the letter that since the party was in receipt of the court processes with respect to the matter, it was only proper for it to stay action and allow the suit to run its full course.\n\nThe letter was addressed to the PDP acting National Chairman, Yemi Akinwonmi; the Chairman, PDP National Convention Committee, Governor Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa State; PDP National Organising Secretary, Austin Akobund; PDP National Legal Adviser, Emmanuel Enoidem; and the party\u2019s National Secretary, Senator Ibrahim Tsauri. The letters were routed though the recipients\u2019 lawyers, Chief E.O. Oddey Odey and Odey Solicitors.\n\nThe letter from Oyetibo read in part, \u201cThis letter is intended to draw your attention to the position of the law of Nigeria on this subject as encapsulated in the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nigeria in the celebrated case of Governor of Lagos of Lagos State vs. Chief Emeka Ojukwu (1986) I NVVLR (Part 1 8) 621 @ 637, in which the court reviewed various decisions on the point, and approved the following principles as the correct position of the law, that is:\n\n\u201cThe rule is well-settled that where a suit is brought to enjoin certain activities of which the defendant has notice, the hands of the defendant are effectually tied pending the hearing and determination even though no restraining order or preliminary injunction be issued.\n\n\u201cThe conclusion to be drawn from all the cases is that after a defendant has been notified of the pendency of a suit seeking an injunction against him even though a temporary injunction be not granted, he acts at his own peril and subject to the power of the court to restore the status wholly irrespective of the merits as they may be ultimately decided.\u201d\n\nIn his appeal against the decision of the Court of Appeal, Port Harcourt Division, Secondus is seeking, among others, an order of injunction restraining the PDP, whether by itself, its officers, servants, agents and or representatives, from holding or conducting its national convention pending the hearing and final determination of his appeal.\n\nHis lawyers said the application had since been served on the party and other respondents in the appeal.\n\nHe, however, noted that \u201cnotwithstanding the service of the application for injunction, it has come to the notice of our client that the PDP and its officers continue to prepare to hold the national convention on 30 and 31.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted, the Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Diran Odeyemi, said, \u201cI believe the PDP is a law-abiding party and that it would do the needful. The fact remains that with recent happenings in the party, many members are unhappy but as loyal party members, we look to the party to lead the way.\u201d\n\nOladipo\u2019s disqualification may unite Osun PDP factions against Arapaja\n\nMeanwhile, the disqualification of a former National Secretary of the party, Prof. Wale Oladipo, from the race for the Deputy National Chairman of the party may have forced the two opposing camps in the Osun PDP to settle for a former governor of the state, Olagunsoye Oyinlola, as candidate for the post, Saturday PUNCH has learnt.\n\nSupport for Oyinlola and Oladipo had divided Osun PDP between the Senator Ademola Adeleke/Sunday Bisi faction and Akin Ogunbiyi/Soji Adagunodo group.\n\nWhile the camp of Adeleke, who was the 2018 governorship candidate of the party in the state, openly adopted Oladipo as its sole candidate for the post of Deputy National Chairman, the group enjoying the backing of Ogunbiyi had been campaigning for Oyinlola.\n\nBut following the Thursday disqualification of Oladipo, some stakeholders in the Osun PDP that spoke on the matter, accused the South-West leader of the PDP, Governor Seyi Makinde, of masterminding Oladipo\u2019s disqualification to pave the way for the current PDP South-West National Vice Chairman of the party, Taofiq Arapaja, who joined the race late.\n\nA reliable party source, who preferred not to be named, explained that Makinde withdrew his support for Oyinlola, who he initially endorsed for the post upon realising that \u201cwhoever is elected Deputy National Chairman, may end up being the national chairman, in case PDP gives its 2023 presidential ticket to a northerner.\u201d\n\nAccording to the source, the Makinde\u2019s camp was of the opinion that if Oyinlola, a former governor, becomes the party\u2019s national chairman, in case PDP\u2019s 2023 presidential candidate comes from the North, that may affect the influence of the Oyo State governor in the region.\n\nThe source said, \u201cOladipo was disqualified for actions he took while he was National Secretary, especially when the party was dragged to court.\n\n\u201cThat reason (the disqualification) was the handiwork of Makinde. His camp felt Oladipo should be taken out.\n\n\u201cMakinde\u2019s camp suddenly developed cold feet towards Oyinlola because of 2023. It was of the opinion that if PDP presidential ticket is given to the North, whoever is chairman from the North must resign.\n\n\u201cIf that should happen, and Oyinlola has been elected Deputy National Chairman, he will automatically step in and become the party\u2019s national chairman. It is common knowledge that Oyinlola is very close to former President Olusegun Obasanjo and military dictator, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida (retd.).\n\n\u201cMakinde\u2019s camp feels Oyinlola may be too powerful for any governor to control as the PDP National Chairman. After considering that, Arapaja, becomes a very good option for the Oyo governor\u2019s camp.\n\n\u201cNo matter what Arapaja becomes at the national level, the Makinde camp believes it can still manage him. Stakeholders in Osun State may be shifting their support to Oyinlola to check Makinde\u2019s camp. Many of them believe the division in the state PDP is making it easy for external forces to deprive it of privileges.\u201d\n\nBut when contacted, Oladele Oluwabamiji, the Director of Research and Publicity of the Senator Adeleke faction of the PDP in the state, said Oyinlola did not formally inform the party he was contesting the post of Deputy National Chairman.\n\nOluwabamiji said, \u201cWe are going to wait for the outcome of the party\u2019s Appeal Committee that will hear the case against the disqualification of Oladipo on Saturday (today) before taking any decision.\u201d\n\nOsun State should produce PDP deputy chair \u2013 Party faction\n\nMeanwhile, a faction of the PDP loyal to Soji Adagunodo in Osun State has said it hoped that Arapaja would step down for Oyinlola.\n\nThe spokesman for the group, Abiodun Adegoke, said Oladipo could not be said to be out of the race since the Appeal Committee had yet to take a decision on his appeal.\n\nHe, however, said the party would expect Arapaja to withdraw from the race and allow Osun State to fill a position micro-zoned to it since Oyo has taken the post of National Vice Chairman.\n\n\u201cNo one can say Oladipo is out of the race yet. The Appeal Committee will have to decide that before anyone can say he is out of the race. But we expect that Arapaja will withdraw from the race to allow Osun State fill the post which was micro-zoned to it,\u201d Adegoke said.\n\nI \u2018m not desperate \u2013 Oladipo\n\nHowever, Oladipo, in a statement on Friday, said even though he has a right to appeal, he had resolved not to push his case further.\n\nOladipo said he would rather concentrate his energy on ensuring that the PDP wins the next governorship election in Osun State next year.\n\nHe said, \u201cHaving the conviction that there will always be a tomorrow, l am not going to bother myself to push this case further beyond this point because l believe in our own cause, which is, first and foremost, to deliver Osun State to the PDP and from there to move on as a committed party member.\n\n\u201cThough I have a right of appeal, and to seek redress within the confines of the internal mechanism of the party\u2019s constitution, l am not a desperate politician to go that route since the \u2018powers-that-be today\u2019 have apparently decided on what to achieve at the convention. Therefore, l have no other choice but to move on to concentrate on delivering Osun State to the PDP in 2022.\u201d\n\nOladipo said \u2018interested powers\u2019 that were afraid of his electoral value at the National Convention caused a frivolous petition to be written and submitted concerning his activities during the crisis that engulfed the party over five years ago.\n\nHe further said, \u201cThe content of the hatchet job remains hazy but the little we know purportedly hinges on the past crisis that our party passed through then.\n\n\u201cBut it is interesting to note that throughout the period, l started with dignity and kept my mind fixated on how the party will progress therefrom. When the final decision was made, l abided by it and stayed by the party which consequently made us deliver on our mandate.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

I remembered I did a piece recently where I said for Nigeria, it is \u2018Peace Dole\u2019 (Peace by Force).\n\n\u201cThe idea of this movement, Ambassadors of Voice for Change, is very good. I am sure it is God that inspired it.\n\n\u201cWe know that there are lots of forces attempting to pull the country apart, but if the country will stay together (and it will stay together), we need initiatives like this, we need voices like this, we need ambassadors like this,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Special Adviser added that, \u201cit is in our collective interest that Nigeria survives. Our collective interest is that our unity in diversity is maintained, so that we remain together in peace and unity, and there is strength in unity.\u201d\n\nHe thanked the Voice for Change Ambassadors executives for the timely initiative, and assured them that because this is an initiative for peace and unity, his office will lend itself to project it.\n\nThe spokesperson of the group, Zack Orji expressed their readiness to collaborate with the security agencies and Nigerians to ensure that there is peace and unity in the country.\n\n\u201cThere is no way government is going to work alone without the cooperation of the people, this movement will cover the 36 States of the Federation, our aim is to engage road shows, town hall meetings, rallies and all kinds of meetings to sensitize people so they can be on the same band wagons as ourselves.\u201d\n\nThe group commended the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari on its effort to restore peace and unity in the country and assured him of their continued support.\n\nThe Ambassadors of Voice for Change is an organization made up of actors, musicians, comedians, producers, directors, and film makers, with representations from National Council for Women Society, National Associations of Nigerian Students, and market women across the country.\n\nThe representatives that came to the State House included Zack Orji, Ahmed Bala, John Okafor (Mr Ibu), Sani Denja, Saheed Balogun and Ben Kure.\n\nOthers are Gentle Jack, Benedict Johnson, Andy Chukwu and Chiege Alisigwe.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

That is one of the major factors fueling the insurgency and insecurity in the region,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said even as the country engages the Boko Haram terrorists militarily, it must address the factors, including low human development, that feed insecurity.\n\n\u201cThis must be anchored on a strategy that recognizes the security and development nexus as central to counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism in Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nFaulting the tendency for Nigerians to see the Boko Haram war as a fight between the insurgents and the military, Buratai said it is not a Boko Haram versus military war but Boko Haram versus Nigeria.\n\nHe said although the military had reduced the power of insurgents and render them able only to harass soft targets, even such residual powers of the insurgents need to be taken from them.\n\nSuggesting how this could be done, Buratai said, \u201cThere is the need to curtail sporadic attacks and bring the conflict to a permanent conclusion.

          "text": "By Eric Ikhilae, Sanni Onogu, Tony Akowe, Nicholas Kalu, Abuja and Bisi Oladele, Ibadan\n\nAlleges N273m passed through Igboho\u2019s account in eight years\n\nBlames IPOB for killing Akunyili, Gulak, 184 others\n\nDSS releases agitator\u2019s aides after 114 days in custody\n\nAfenifere, Ohanaeze, others kick\n\nThe Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, said yesterday that the Federal Government had found that the major financier of the Yoruba nation agitator, Sunday Adeyemo a.k.a. Sunday Igboho is a member of the National Assembly.\n\nMalami, who was silent on the identity of the federal lawmaker, said a report by a committee constituted by the Federal Government also revealed that Igboho allegedly received funding from a firm, Abbai Bako and Sons, allegedly being probed for terrorism financing activities.\n\n\u201cIt will be recalled that Abbal Bako & Sons and its promoter, Abdullahi Umar Usman, are suspects in the ongoing Joint Terrorist Financing Investigation.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cAbdullahi Umar Usman is, by way of financial transaction, connected to Surajo Abubakar Muhammad (who was sentenced to life imprisonment in UAE on charges of financing terrorism (Boko Haram),\u201d Malami said.\n\nBut reacting to the AGF\u2019s claims yesterday, the apex Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, described them as \u201cillogical reasoning\u201d.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nSenate spokesman, Senator Ajibola Basiru, also described the allegations against Igboho as weighty but lacking facts.\n\nAddressing a press conference in Abuja, Malami said the Presidential Ad-hoc Committee set up after the re-arrest of the leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, had been able to identify Igboho\u2019s sponsors and financiers.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Federal Government has received the report on financiers of Adeniyi Sunday Adeyemo a.k.a Sunday Igboho.\n\n\u201cThe report revealed that Sunday Igboho is a director and signatory to Adesun International Concept Limited, registered on 23rd April, 2010.\n\n\u201cAdesun International Concept Limited also has Oladele Oyetunji and Aderopo Adeyemo as directors. Sunday Igboho is linked to 43 bank accounts in 9 banks.\n\n\u201cThe major financier of the fugitive and separatists was found to be a Federal Law Maker in the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cA total sum of N127,145,000.00 was received by Igboho from his financiers between 22nd October, 2013 and 28th September, 2020 through Adesun International Concept Ltd accounts.\n\n\u201cA total sum of N273,198,200.00 transaction outflows was recorded from Sunday Igboho\u2019s account between 15th March, 2013 and 11th March, 2021.\n\nInvestigation reveals that Adesun International Concept Ltd (belonging to Igboho) transferred the sum of N12,750,000 to Abbal Bako & Sons.\n\n\u201cThe report found connections of financial transaction between Adesun International Concept\n\nLtd (belonging to Igboho) and some construction companies and businesses among others.\u201d\n\nThe AGF also said the committee catalogued the alleged atrocities committed by Kanu and his associates in the course of their terrorism activities.\n\nMalami claimed that Kanu took advantage of the 2020 EndSARS protest to destroy property and killed individuals, particularly security personnel.\n\n\u201cDespite the proscription of IPOB by the Federal Government, Nnamdi Kanu continued the subversive campaign, instigating and inciting broadcasts to direct members of the IPOB to launch attacks on government.\n\n\u201cThe EndSARS protests of October 2020 played into the sinister plans of Nnamdi Kanu, whereby he seized the protests through subversive and inciting online broadcasts and actively commanded and directed attacks on security personnel and facilities.\n\n\u201cAs a result of these broadcasts, members of IPOB attacked and killed security personnel and burnt down police stations, correctional centres, INEC offices, bus terminals, the palace of Oba of Lagos, banks, hospitals, shopping malls and vehicles, amongst others.\n\n\u201cOn 12th December, 2020, Eastern Security Network (ESN) was formed by Nnamdi Kanu as an armed wing of IPOB with the mandate to advance the nefarious agenda of the outlawed group.\n\n\u201cESN continued to launch attacks on security personnel, civilians perceived as enemies as well as destruction of private and public properties.\n\n\u201cThe destructive activities of IPOB/ESN pose serious threat to Nigeria\u2019s National Security and its corporate existence, which resulted into re-arrest of Nnamdi Kanu and members of his group,\u201d Malami said.\n\nThe AGF added that there was information that Kanu was receiving supports from both within and outside Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe have also established that KANU is not alone in his subversive activities. He has accomplices in Nigeria and abroad, individuals and groups as well as state and non-state actors who are aiding and facilitating his campaign against the people and state of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSome of the state actors aided KANU, even as a fugitive, in his destructive mission, ignoring the terrorist nature of his activities.\n\n\u201cWe call on these countries to desist from aiding subversive acts by KANU and IPOB against the state of Nigeria and its people,\u201d Malami said.\n\nThe AGF gave details of persons allegedly killed and property destroyed by Kanu\u2019s associates who acted on his inciting comments.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe committee finds as a fact, that consequent upon the instigating directives of Nnamdi Kanu, members of IPOB/ESN carried out massive attacks on democratic institutions especially INEC Facilities with a view to hampering democratic process in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThese attacks that were carried out between October 2020 and June 2021 include the following:\n\n\u201cActing on the instigating directives of Nnamdi Kanu, IPOB members and #EndSARS protesters attacked and killed many security agents, destroyed several public and private properties, including police stations, public transport buses and other facilities across the country.\n\n\u201cOn 21st October 2020, Nnamdi Kanu through an online call-in radio programme (Radio Biafra), further instigated IPOB members to burn down all police stations and kill government security forces, which was carried out and several security personnel (especially police officers) were killed and public and private properties destroyed.\n\n\u201c175 security personnel were killed by IPOB/ESN, comprising 128 Police men, 37 military personnel and 10 other security operatives.\n\n\u201cKilling of prominent Nigerians (recently there were gruesome killings of traditional leaders: Obi 1 of Okwudor autonomous community, Eze E. Anayochukwu Durueburuo and Eze Sampson Osunwa of Ihebineowerre autonomous community as well as the killings of Dr. Chike Akunyili and eight others as well as the killing of Alhaji Ahmed Gulak on 30th May. 2021);\n\n\u201cAs a consequence of Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s broadcasts, there were nineteen (19) attacks on INEC facilities that resulted in the destruction of offices as well as burning of 18 INEC logistical vehicles, several election materials, equipment and ICT gadgets in Abia, Akwa-Ibom, Anambra, Cross River, Enugu, Ebonyi and Imo states.\n\n\u201c164 police stations and formations, including Police headquarters, Owerri, Imo State were attacked by IPOB/ESN leading to the death of 128 policemen, 144 injured, while 628 vehicles were destroyed.\n\n\u201cThree hundred and ninety-six (396) firearms and seventeen thousand seven hundred and thirty eight (17,738) ammunition were carted away during the IPOB/ESN attacks;\n\n\u201cThere were three (3) IPOB/ESN attacks on Nigerian Correctional Service (NCoS), including the headquarters of NCoS, Owerri, Imo State where one thousand eight hundred and forty one (1,841) inmates escaped.\n\n\u201cThe headquarters of the Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS), Umuahia, Abia State was also attacked by IPOB/ESN leading to the death of one (1) officer,\u201d Malami said.\n\nIgboho\u2019s lawyer faults Malami, says politicians pressuring Yoruba nation agitator for endorsement\n\nThe lead counsel to the embattled Yoruba nation agitator, Chief Yomi Alliyu (SAN), however, faulted Malami\u2019s claims that a link had been established between his client and an alleged financier of terrorists.\n\nIn a statement yesterday, Alliyu explained that the minister only tried in futility to establish the link in order to nail his client who has been held in Cotonou, Benin Republic without charges since July 18.\n\nIgboho\u2019s detention is believed to have been carried out on the orders of the Federal Government of Nigeria to enable it prepare the ground for his arrest and prosecution for agitating for Yoruba nation.\n\nAlliyu\u2019s statement reads: \u201cOur attention has been drawn to a text press conference by the Hon. Attorney General and Minister of Justice wherein he fruitlessly tried to paint our client and those patronising his car trade as terrorists and/or financiers of terrorists.\n\n\u201cI have gone through the text. Sunday was alleged to have transferred the sum of N12.7m to Abbal Bako & Sons owned by Abdullahi Umar. Transferring money to bureau de change to buy dollars is what is done by every businessman of our client\u2019s calibre. Thank God that his passports and various bills of ladings were carted away by DSS during the ungodly invasion of 1st July, 2021.\n\n\u201cThus, so far, there is no evidence of receipt of money from Abbal Bako & Sons or Abdullahi Umar, going by the text conference. What the Hon AGF stated are mere conjectures, not hard fact.\n\n\u201cOur client, according to him, paid Umar and NOT vice versa, thus believing what the Honourable Attorney General of Federation earlier said that Chief Sunday Adeyemo is being financed by people.\n\n\u201cThe picture the Learned AGF wanted to paint is that our Client is being financed by Abdullah Umar allegedly involved in terrorists financing. Who is now financing who?\n\n\u201cAgain, Chief Adeyemo is a car dealer trading in the name of Adesun International Concept Ltd. Does it mean that anybody buying car from him or selling car to him is a terrorist?\n\n\u201cChief Sunday Adeyemo a.k.a Igboho Oosa was not into Oodua Nation until last year. So, finding over N273m turnover between October 2013 and September 2020 shows that he was not a poor man. His house invaded by DSS on 1st July 2020 is worth over N2 billion!\n\n\u201cI challenge the Hon AGF to mention the lawmaker that sent money to Chief Sunday Adeyemo for terrorist act whether he would not be damnified in exemplary damages for defamation.\n\n\u201cUp till date, our client has not been prosecuted or found liable for any criminal act or terrorism. There is also a valid and subsisting court judgment that agitation for self-determination is not an act of terrorism but fundamental human right of any citizen.\n\n\u201cMy Learned brother Silk and Hon AGF knows that suspicion, no matter how great, cannot grant conviction. Chief Sunday Adeyemo is not a terrorist but a campaigner for self-determination.\u201d\n\nAttorney-General\u2019s claims illogical \u2014 Afenifere\n\nApex Yoruba Organization, Afenifere has reacted to a statement by Nigeria\u2019s Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami that Yoruba activist, Sunday Igboho has ties to Terrorism.\n\nAfenifere, in a press release signed by its Secretary-General, Chief Sola Ebiseni, yesterday described Malami\u2019s statements as \u201cIllogical reasoning\u201d.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cThe Federal Government with its Attorney General will not stop amusing themselves with illogical reasoning on the nationality question.\n\n\u201cIt is expected that the AG would be guided by the standard of a reasonable man, which is a central test in legal inquiry, before addressing the public.\n\n\u201cThis time around, the team set up by him, at a time he is hell-bent on nailing Igboho, has satisfied his emotional expectations, but in a most unreasonable and tenuous manner, by suggesting that Sunday Igboho, a Yoruba nation campaigner, would be on the same sponsorship with Boko Haram.\n\n\u201cOnly someone with pathological hatred for Igboho and insult to the Yoruba nation will find a common bed for Yoruba nation agitation and Boko Haram which is known to act in tandem with the Fulani herdsmen whose terrorist acts were responsible for Igboho\u2019s campaigns.",

          "text": "From Godwin Tsa, Abuja\n\nThe trial of leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, has been adjourned to November 10 after he pleaded not guilty to a seven-count charge preferred against him by the Federal Government.\n\nThis is as he urged the Federal High Court to decline its jurisdiction to adjudicate over the charge filed against him.\n\nThe IPOB leader noted that from the amended charge, the only element requisite to constitute and found liability for incitement allegedly occurred wholly and entirely in London, United Kingdom and not anywhere within Nigeria.\n\nIn his notice of preliminary objections, Kanu argued that the alleged broadcasts were not shown to have occurred at sea or on the international waters abutting Nigeria, adding: \u201cI know as a fact that London, United Kingdom, is a sovereign state under International Municipal Law and has municipal laws punishing criminal offences.\u201d\n\nUSA companies need customer service reps to work from home, hourly pay in $13 per hour, must have a quiet environment to work, internet access.Click here to apply .\n\nKanu stated this through his counsel, Ifeanyi Ejiofor, shortly after he was re-arraigned on the amended charge before Justice Binta Nyako of the Abuja division of the Federal High Court, yesterday.\n\nKanu, who jumped bail following the chaos that characterised the military invasion of his residence was in June 2021 re-arrested in Kenya and extradited to face his trial.\n\nHe was first arrested in a Lagos hotel in 2015 by operatives of the Department of State Service (DSS) and arraigned alongside four others in 2016.\n\nAt yesterday\u2019s trial that was characterised by heavy security presence, Kanu arrived the court by 8am in a white Fendi designers cloth and was ushered into the courtroom at 10am by security operatives. He took his fresh plea to the amended charges at about 10:45am.\n\nBut he pleaded not guilty even as his lawyer had requested he be transferred to the custody of the correctional service centre. Justice Nyako, however, declined to grant the request on the grounds that it would be in the interest of Kanu to remain with the DSS.\n\nNyako adjourned to November 10 for hearing of Kanu\u2019s application challenging the court\u2019s jurisdiction to try him and the competence of the charge.\n\nAmong issues raised in the Notice of Preliminary Objection are that the said charge did not in anyway link the defendant to the charge and the alleged offences were committed in the United Kingdom, amongst others.\n\nHowever, Ohaneze Ndigbo has accused the Federal Government of conducting a secret trial on Kanu.\n\nChief Ralph Uwazurike, who spoke alongside former Anambra governor, Chief Chukwuemeka Ezeife, said the apex-Igbo socio-cultural group condemned the trial in its entirety because they were barred from covering the proceedings.\n\nSimilarly, Senator representing Anambra South Senatorial District, Senator Ifeanyi Ubah, also condemned the action of the Federal Government, claiming he ought not to be barred from witnessing the proceedings as a federal lawmaker. He lamented that even after filing a case in the matter, he was still denied access.\n\nJournalists were also barred from entering the courtroom.This was despite the fact that the journalists had forwarded their names to the court and DSS for coverage of the proceedings.\n\nKanu, in the preliminary objections filed by counsel said: \u201cI also know as a fact that jurisdiction is extrinsic to adjudication. It is conferred on a Court, aliunde. It is not intrinsic. That I know as a matter of fact, that as the element necessary to constitute incitement in the alleged several broadcasts of the Defendant/Applicant occurred in London, United Kingdom, and not in Nigeria, the court in Nigeria has no jurisdiction to try the defendant/applicant on any charge founded on any such alleged incitement, even if the defendant/applicant enters within the geographical boundaries of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe affidavit in support deposed to by Chinwe Umeche equally averred that \u201cI also know as a matter of fact that the alleged offences for which the defendant was charged, do not constitute terrorism offences in London, United Kingdom, where they were allegedly committed.\n\n\u201cThat I am further aware that there is an obligation on the Attorney General of the Federation, to maintain international co-operation for compliance with international treaties on terrorism.\n\n\u201cThat the defendant was abducted from Kenya and consequently extraordinarily rendered to Nigeria, without firstly subjecting him to extradition proceedings in Kenya. I know as a fact thatamended would amount to allowing the complainant to benefit from their illegality and wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cThat I am aware that he who comes to equity must come with clean hands, and no party should be allowed to benefit from his wrong doing.\n\n\u201cThat I know as a matter of fact, that the extraordinary rendition of the defendant robs the Honourable Court of the requisite jurisdiction of trying the defendant on counts 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the Amended Charge.\n\n\u201cThat counts 1, 2 and 3 of the amended charge were brought under a non-existent law. That count 3 of the amended charge relates to an offence allegedly committed in Ubuluisiuzor, in Ihiala Local Government Area of Anambra State, which is outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Honourable Court.\n\n\u201cThat I know as a matter of fact that an offence can only be tried by a court exercising jurisdiction over the place or area where the alleged offence was committed. That counts 5, 6 and 7 of the amended charge do not disclose an offence known to law. That there is no proof of evidence attached to the amended charge filed against the defendant. That even the purported proof of evidence to be relied upon by the prosecution does not disclose any prima facie case against the defendant.\n\n\u201cThat from the list of exhibits and witnesses attached to the amended charge, there is nothing relating to or linking the defendant to the 7-count charge, particularly counts 4, 5, 6 and 7 of thereof.\n\n\u201cThat no final pronouncement has been made on the purported proscription of the Indigenous People of Biafra, as the said purported proscription, is a subject matter of appeal in Appeal No: CA/A/214/2018, pending before the Abuja Division of the Court of Appeal.\n\n\u201cThat the defendant/applicant cannot be arraigned anew or tried for an offence when the judgment that made a pronouncement on the instrument constituting a state of affairs as such an offence, is the subject matter of an appeal. That it will be most unjust, painful, wicked and unfair for the Applicant to undergo the rigours of a full trial, when the amended charge as constituted, does not disclose a prima facie case against him.\n\n\u201cThat there is no ground for this Honorable Court to proceed with the trial against the applicant in the circumstance of this case.\n\n\u201cThat the Court has the powers and a duty to stop a prosecution which on the facts creates abuse and injustice.\n\n\u201cThat it will be in the best interest of justice if the present seven-count amended charge is struck out and or dismissed.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

The people have a right to vote and select their leader.\n\n\u201cNo group or individual will be allowed to stimulate anarchy and chaos, leading to murderous activities. The President has made it very clear that the Armed Forces and all law enforcement agencies must make sure that the elections take place even if it means overwhelming the entire environment with the presence of security agencies.\n\n\u201cThere are so many implications for elections to be sabotaged by non-state actors; in the first place, we are in a democracy, secondly it is important to note that if these non-state actors should succeed in destroying the potentials for orderly elections, then it is natural that other parts of the country would also want to copy this same situation.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mongonu, in the last two months, the military has recorded a lot of successes in the fight against insurgency in the North-East zone of the country which put pressure on the ISWAP and the Boko Haram Islamic terrorists.\n\n\u201cThe fact again is that the armed forces, the land forces have done an excellent job because in the span of one month we have been able to take out the leadership of the Islamic State of West African Province (ISWAP) \u2013 that is Abu Musab Al-barnawi.\n\n\u201cTwo days ago, the man who succeeded him, one Malam Bako, one of the prominent leaders of the Shura Council of the Islamic State of West African Province, was also taken out.\n\n\u201cThey are also contending with leadership crisis. You know these things are also accompanied with inherent issues of trust, conflicts, mutual suspicion and other things.\n\n\u201cSo, the operations being conducted by the armed forces in the northern parts of the country put a lot of pressure on the Islamic State of West African Province, Boko Haram and also the tangential group known as Islamic State in the Greatest Sahara.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

The commission appreciates the decision of the National Assembly to empower INEC to determine and deploy appropriate technology in future elections. For us in INEC, this is one of the progressive decisions by our National Assembly. As you finalise on the Electoral Amendment Bill, I urge you to continue to endow the commission with power to determine what technology to deploy in our elections at the appropriate time.\n\nUSA companies need customer service reps to work from home, hourly pay in $13 per hour, must have a quiet environment to work, internet access.Click here to apply .\n\n\u201cOne way of doing so is to make broad provisions of the law that will empower the commission to continue to innovate without restricting us to a specific technology, such as the Smart Card Reader, which could in due course become obsolete, inapplicable or irrelevant as is already the case, following the recent introduction of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) by the commission. The commission looks forward to the conclusion of the process without which we cannot make the regulations and guidelines to give effect to the provisions of the law. Without the regulations and guidelines, we cannot finalise on the manuals for the training of officials that will conduct elections. There are extensive provisions in the current Bill that require clear guidance by the commission. With only 484 days to the 2023 general election, time is of the essence.\u201d\n\nYakubu said in addition to the Anambra State governorship election holding on November 6, the commission had already scheduled three major elections to be conducted next year.\n\n\u201cFirst is the Area Council election in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) holding on February 12, 2022, followed by Ekiti governorship election on June 18, 2022 and Osun governorship election a month later on July 16, 2022. The Commission also has five pending bye-elections made up of three federal constituencies and two state constituencies to contend with.\n\n\u201cThe Electoral Act is one of the most important laws in any democracy. Election is a process anchored on a legal framework. First is the constitution, followed by the Electoral Act. In all jurisdictions, the Electoral Act provides more detailed provisions to govern the conduct of elections and the electoral process. One of the unique aspects of the current amendment of the Electoral Act is that it started well ahead of the forthcoming general election, unlike previous exercises which came too close to elections. The importance of starting early is that it allows for a thorough debate by citizens on aspects of the Bill long after the conventional public hearing as witnessed recently. Clearly, the Electoral Amendment Bill 2021 is one of the most extensively debated Bills in Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "title": "For the Record: Full Text of AGF\u2019s Statement on Outcome of Kanu, Igboho Investigation",
          "text": "Ladies and Gentlemen of the Press, I welcome you to this very important press conference.\n\nAs you are aware Nnamdi Kanu, the self-acclaimed leader of Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), has been at the center of a subversive campaign against the Nigerian State. Consequently, Nnamdi Kanu was arrested on 14th October, 2015. He was charged to court for treasonable felony, among other crimes. He was granted bail by the Federal High Court, Abuja on 25th April 2017. He however breached the bail conditions and fled abroad.\n\nWhile in self-exile, Nnamdi Kanu intensified his subversive campaign, using online Radio Biafra to instigate violence and incite members of IPOB to commit violent attacks against civil and democratic institutions, particularly the security personnel, Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), and civilians. He instigated the destruction of public and private properties across the country.\n\nAs a result of these criminal activities, IPOB was proscribed and designated a terrorist organization by a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, in an Order made on 20th September 2017.\n\nDespite the proscription of IPOB by the Federal Government, Nnamdi Kanu continued the subversive campaign, instigating and inciting broadcasts to direct members of the IPOB to launch attacks on government.\n\nThe EndSARS protests of October 2020 played into the sinister plans of Nnamdi Kanu, whereby he seized the protests through subversive and inciting online broadcasts and actively commanded and directed attacks on security personnel and facilities.\n\nAs a result of these broadcasts, members of IPOB attacked and killed security personnel and burnt down Police stations, Correctional centers, INEC offices, bus terminals, the Palace of Oba of Lagos, Banks, hospitals, shopping malls and vehicles, amongst others.\n\nOn 12th December, 2020, Eastern Security Network\u201d (ESN) was formed by Nnamdi Kanu as an armed wing of IPOB with the mandate to advance the nefarious agenda of the outlawed group. ESN continued to launch attacks on security personnel, civilians perceived as enemies as well as destruction of private and public properties.\n\nThe destructive activities of IPOB/ESN pose serious threat to Nigeria\u2019s National Security and its corporate existence, which resulted into re-arrest of Nnamdi Kanu and members of his group.\n\nThe eventual re-arrest of Nnamdi Kanu in June 2021, and some members of his group led to the inauguration of a Presidential Ad-hoc Committee, comprising twenty-four (24) members drawn from:\n\n1. Federal Ministry of Justice (MoJ),\n\n2. Federal Ministry of Information (MoI),\n\n3. Nigeria Police Force (NPF),\n\n4. Department of State Services (DSS),\n\n5. National Intelligence Agency (NIA), and\n\n6. Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA),\n\nThe Committee, inaugurated by the President, and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, Federal Republic of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari (GCFR), was headed by the Honorable Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice.\n\nThe Committee finds as a fact, that consequent upon the instigating directives of Nnamdi Kanu, members of IPOB/ESN carried out massive attacks on democratic institutions especially INEC Facilities with a view to hampering democratic process in Nigeria. These attacks that were carried out between October 2020 and June 2021 include the following:\n\nI. That acting on the instigating directives of Nnamdi Kanu, IPOB members and #EndSARS protesters attacked and killed many security agents, destroyed several public and private properties, including Police stations, public transport buses and other facilities across the country.\n\nII. That on 21st October 2020, Nnamdi Kanu through an online call-in radio programme (Radio Biafra), further instigated IPOB members to burn down all police stations and kill Government security forces, which was carried out and several Security personnel (especially Police Officers) were killed and public and private properties destroyed.\n\nIII. One hundred and seventy-five (175) security personnel were killed by IPOB/ESN, comprising one hundred and twenty eight (128) Police men, thirty seven (37) military personnel and ten (10) other security operatives;\n\nIV. Killing of prominent Nigerians, (recently there were gruesome killings of traditional leaders: Obi 1 of Okwudor autonomous community, Eze E. Anayochukwu Durueburuo and Eze Sampson Osunwa of Ihebineowerre autonomous community as well as the killings of Dr. Chike Akunyili and eight others as well as the killing of Alhaji Ahmed Gulak on 30th May. 2021);\n\nV. That as a consequence of Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s broadcasts, there were nineteen (19) attacks on INEC facilities that resulted in the destruction of offices as well as burning of eighteen (18) INEC logistical vehicles, several election materials, equipment and ICT gadgets in Abia, Akwa-Ibom, Anambra, Cross River, Enugu, Ebonyi and Imo States;\n\nVI. That one hundred and sixty-four (164) police stations and formations, including Police Headquarters, Owerri, Imo State were attacked by IPOB/ESN leading to the death of one hundred and twenty-eight (128) police men {as stated in III above}; one hundred forty four (144) injured while six hundred twenty eight (628) vehicles were destroyed.\n\nVII. That three hundred and ninety-six (396) firearms and seventeen thousand seven hundred and thirty eight (17,738) ammunition were carted away during the IPOB/ESN attacks;\n\nVIII. That there were three (3) IPOB/ESN attacks on Nigerian Correctional Service (NCoS), including the Headquarters of NCoS, Owerri, Imo State where one thousand eight hundred and forty one (1,841) inmates escaped;\n\nIX. That the Headquarters of the Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS), Umuahia, Abia State was also attacked by IPOB/ESN leading to the death of one (1) officer;\n\nX. That there were several IPOB/ESN attacks and destruction (arson) of public and private properties during the EndSARS and Biafra agitations across the country, especially in the South-East and South-South regions, notably the Palace of the Oba of Lagos where twelve\n\n(12) flats were completely looted and vandalized, the country home of the Governor of Imo State, Senator Hope Uzodinma, was burnt, over one hundred and fifty (150) buses burnt at the Lagos Bus Terminal, Sen. Ndoma Egba\u2019s home in Calabar Municipal, Cross River State, was completely looted and vandalized, Lagos State DNA and Forensic Centre, City Hall Race Course, First Bank Branch Lagos, Lagos State Public Works Commission, Nigeria Port Authority (NPA), Marina, Lagos, High Court Igbosere, Lagos, were all burnt, amongst other heinous crimes committed.\n\nWe have also established that KANU is not alone in his subversive activities. He has accomplices in Nigeria and abroad, individuals and groups as well as state and non-state actors who are aiding and facilitating his campaign against the people and state of Nigeria. Some of the state actors aided KANU, even as a fugitive, in his destructive mission, ignoring the terrorist nature of his activities.\n\nWe call on these countries to desist from aiding subversive acts by KANU and IPOB against the state of Nigeria and its people. Conversely, there are some friendly countries which, recognising the status of IPOB as a terrorist organization, have either banned the activities of IPOB or placed KANU on Stop List. To these peace loving countries that have put KANU on their Stop Lists and banned IPOB from operating in their territories, we express our appreciation.\n\nSimilarly, the Federal Government has received the report on financers of Adeniyi Sunday Adeyemo a.k.a Sunday Igboho. The report revealed that Sunday Igboho is a Director and signatory to Adesun International Concept Limited registered on 23rd April, 2010. Adesun International Concept Limited also has Oladele Oyetunji and Aderopo Adeyemo as Directors. Sunday Igboho is linked to 43 bank accounts in 9 banks.\n\nThe major financier of the fugitive and separatists was found to be a Federal Law Maker in the National Assembly. A total sum of ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-SEVEN MILLION, ONE AND FORTY-FIVE THOUSAND NAIRA ONLY (N127, 145,000.00) was received by Igboho from his financiers between 22nd October, 2013 and 28th September, 2020 through Adesun International Concept Ltd accounts.\n\nA total sum of TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY-THREE MILLION, ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY-EIGHT THOUSAND, TWO HUNDRED NAIRA ONLY (N273,198,200.00) transaction outflows was recorded from Sunday Igboho\u2019s account between 15th March, 2013 and 11 the March, 2021.\n\nInvestigation reveals that Adesun International Concept Ltd (belonging to Igboho) transferred the sum of twelve million seven hundred and fifty thousand naira (N12, 750,000) to Abbal Bako & Sons.\n\nIt might be recalled that Abbal Bako & Sons and its promoter Abdullahi Umar Usman are suspects in the on-going Joint Terrorist Financing Investigation. Abdullahi Umar Usman is by way of financial transaction connected to SURAJO ABUBAKAR MUHAMMAD (who was sentenced to life imprisonment in UAE on charges of financing terrorism [Boko Haram]).\n\nThis report shows the nexus between separatists\u2019 agitation, terrorism financing and disruptions of peace in the country.\n\nThe report found connections of financial transaction between Adesun International Concept Ltd (belonging to Igboho) and some construction companies and businesses among others.\n\nHaving received the reports, the Federal Government remains solute in its determination to have a peaceful Nigeria. The Federal Government will do the needful, within the context of the legal provisions, in ensuring that the matter is giving the deserved attention and those found guilty will be made to face the wrath of the law.\n\nI thank you most sincerely.\n\nAbubakar Malami, SAN Honourable Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "By Chuks Okocha\n\nA Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Mr Tayo Oyetiba, has written to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to suspend its planned convention slated for October 30 and 31, pending the determination of the appeal challenging the leadership of the party at the Court of Appeal.\n\nOyetiba is lawyer to the suspended National Chairman of the PDP, Chief Uche Secondus.\n\nSecondus was on September 10, 2021, restrained from performing the functions of the office of the National Chairman of the PDP by a High Court of Rivers State.\n\nThe restraining order was contained in a ruling in an application in suit number: PHC/2183/CD/2021 brought against Secondus by one Mr lbeawuchi Alex and four others.\n\nHowever, Secondus in Appeal number: CA/PH/341/2021, is seeking to quash the suspension and has applied for \u201cAn order of injunction restraining the PDP the six respondents herein, whether by itself, its officers, servants, agents and or representatives from holding or conducting its National Convention scheduled for 30th and 31st October 2021 or any other date, pending the hearing and final determination of this appeal.\u201d\n\nThe senior lawyer stated that in the alternative, the court should order that the parties to the appeal, particularly Secondus and PDP, should maintain \u201cstatus quo ante as at August 22, 2021, when appellant/applicant was occupying the office of National Chairman of Peoples Democratic Party, pending the hearing and final determination of this appeal\u201d.\n\nOyetiba argued that since the application being served on the respondents in the appeal, it behoves the PDP to halt the convention in deference to the Court of Appeal.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding the service of the application for injunction, it has come to the notice of our client that the PDP and its officers continue to prepare to hold the National Convention on 30 and 3 I October 2021,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the letter was intended to draw the attention of the respondents to the position of the law, which states that once an appeal has been filed and served, parties ought not to take any further steps in the matter pending the hearing and determination of the appeal.\n\n\u201cThe rule is well settled that where a suit is brought to enjoin certain activities \u2026 of which the defendant has notice, the hands of the defendant are effectually tied pending a hearing and determination even though no restraining order or preliminary injunction be issued\u2026\n\n\u201cThe conclusion to be drawn from all the cases is that after a defendant has been notified of the pendency of a suit seeking an injunction against him even though a temporary injunction be not granted, he acts at his peril and subject to the power of the court to restore the status wholly irrespective of the merits as they may be ultimately decided,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that the logical corollary of the foregoing pronouncements of the courts is that having been served with an application seeking to restrain the holding of its National Convention pending the determination of the appeal filed by Secondus, the PDP would be embarking upon a collision course with the court if it proceeds to hold the national convention before the hearing and determination of the application.\n\n\u201cShould such contumacious conduct of holding the national convention before the hearing and determination of the application be embarked upon by the party however, we shall not hesitate to bring the full weight of the law against all national officers of the party that are responsible for such conduct of contempt of court.\n\n\u201cQuite apart from the fact that such contumacious conduct would impinge on the integrity of the party, we would on our part, swiftly take steps to invoke the jurisdiction of the court to nullify any decision, action or step taken at such convention,\u201d Secondus\u2019 lawyer said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Monguno said besides the fact that the people of Anambra State deserved to elect a governor of their choice, the federal government would not sit by and let non-state actors set a wrong precedent in the country\u2019s electoral experience.\n\nThe NSA stated, \u201cThe president has directed that under no circumstances will anything be allowed to stop the elections from taking place successfully. The people have a right to vote, they have a right to select their leader, and no group or individual will be allowed to stimulate anarchy and chaos, leading to murderous activities.\n\n\u201cThe president has made it very clear that the armed forces, security agencies, and law enforcement agencies must make sure that the elections take place. If it means overwhelming the entire environment with the presence of security agencies.\n\n\u201cThere are so many implications for elections to be sabotaged by non-state actors. In the first place, we are in a democracy. Secondly, it is important to note that if these non-state actors should succeed in destroying the potential for orderly elections, then it is natural that other parts of the country will also want to copy this situation.\u201d\n\nMonguno said the council observed recent trends of violent activities and was desirous of seeing a hitch-free election in the state.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe problem here is that in as much as the government wants to conduct peaceful elections, there are non-state actors who have been heating up the polity, who have made all kinds of attempts to stymie orderly elections for next month.\u201d\n\nMonguno maintained that the president did not want to contemplate a situation in which he would be boxed into a corner.\n\n\u201cThe mere thought that a group of non-state actors want to portray his government as not being able to be firm is totally out of the question,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe tail cannot wag the dog, it is totally unacceptable and, again, we in the security and intelligence community have been trying as much as possible to talk with the leadership in the South-east, to make them aware of the fact that President Buhari is not averse to the aspirations of the people of the South-east,\u201d the NSA added.\n\nHe stressed, \u201cSo long as whatever they desire to achieve, they do it through the normal prescribed manner, either legislative, legal, or whatever. For as long as it is within the confines of legitimacy, President Buhari does not have a problem with that. But any action that is outlandish, any action that typifies roguery, the usurpation of the authority of the state is not going to be tolerated.\n\n\u201cAgain, we\u2019re also mindful of the fact that Nigerians, being what they are, also need to understand that if these non-state actors should go out on a limb and extend the frontiers of violence, and begin to kill people, there is a possibility that reprisal attacks can take place in other parts of the country, which is what we do not want to happen.\n\n\u201cSo, we\u2019re working with the community leaders, with the governors and everybody to ensure that they bring their people, restrain them on the leash.\u201d\n\nHe also said the NSC reviewed the security situation across the country, noting that the various security formations \u2013 the armed forces, intelligence sector and the police \u2013 have been recording successes from one end of the country to another.\n\nAccording to him, in a short space of time, the armed forces have recorded victory over terrorist groups in the North-east, as they have eliminated, in quick succession, leaders of the notorious Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP).\n\nThe NSA said about two months after the Nigerian Army eliminated Abu Musab al-Barnawi, the dreaded leader of ISWAP, troops, just two days ago, killed his successor, Mallam Bako, in combat.\n\nMonguno said inter-agency cooperation among the various forces and agencies had yielded appreciable successes in communities and the economy.\n\nHe noted the unprecedented feat in security within the country\u2019s maritime environment and the recent elimination of a notorious gangster in Benue State, one Aondofa Kefas (Azonto).\n\nAccording to him, \u201cOther aspects basically have to do with the current state of security in the country and the sub-region. Of course, the armed forces and security agencies have done so much in the last couple of months.\n\n\u201cLet me say clearly, in the last six months, they have been able to record a lot of successes.\n\n\u201cNow the issue here is that it is not very easy for the wider society to appreciate the successes being recorded by the armed forces, because there will definitely be incidents of misadventure. This is asymmetric conflict; it is not like the normal conventional war in which territories are won, you grapple with the enemy, you defeat him, and you move on. Here we have the enemy embedded in society, coming from all parts.\n\n\u201cLike I once said, someone had remarked after the Brighton bombing of 1984, that the difference between the terrorist or the criminal and the state is that it only takes one act for the terrorist to succeed and gain a lot of publicity, but for the armed forces, for the government and its agencies, you have to succeed on every occasion, otherwise, after 12 successes, if you fail, or you have a problem on the 13th occasion, nobody wants to know.\n\n\u201cSo, this is the situation with which we are faced. But, nevertheless, I will just highlight that the Chief of Defense Staff, service chiefs, and intelligence heads briefed Council and I can tell you that for the land forces, they have recorded a lot of successes in the last two months.\n\n\u201cWe have had a steady increase in the number of returnees, both combatants and non-combatants, from the theatre of operation; both from the Islamic State of West Africa Province and the Boko Haram enclaves.\n\n\u201cNow what has happened is we are now having to contend with 15,852 returnees. This in its own case is accompanied by problems; humanitarian problems, problems of logistics, problems of profiling each and every one because we are not just interested in profiling the ex-combatants, we are also interested in profiling those people who are assumed to be non-combatants, who may have reached out and assisted the terrorists in one way or the other.\u201d\n\nCommenting on frequent attacks and stealing of the country\u2019s arms and ammunition by bandits and terrorists, the NSA said moves were being made to end the menace.\n\nHe explained, \u201cEfforts right now are underway. As you already know, yesterday, the president had an important visitor, the president of Turkey.\n\n\u201cJust like he has had discussions with the President of Turkey, he has had discussions with other leaders on how we can share intelligence and acquire technical capabilities to deal with these emerging threats. So, it is basically a matter of looking at where we can get equipment and assets to deal with these threats.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Wants quick presidential assent\n\n\u2022Without regulations, guidelines, we cannot finalise on manuals for training of officials\n\n\u2022INEC releases notice for Anambra governorship election\n\nChuks Okocha and Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has appealed for the fast tracking of the processes leading to the passage and signing into law of the Electoral Act amendment Bill.\n\nThis is just as the Commission, yesterday, released the notice of the governorship election in Anambra State slated for November 6.\n\nWith only 484 days to the 2023 general elections, INEC said time was of essence if it would be able to put necessary guidelines in place for the elections in line with the provisions of the amended Electoral Act (2021).\n\nIn his remarks at the meeting of the Senate and House of Representatives Conference Committee on the Electoral Act amendment bill 2021 held in Abuja yesterday, in collaboration with Policy, Legislative and Advocacy Centre (PLAC), the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, said without the timely passage of the bill, the Commission cannot make the regulations and guidelines to give effect to the provisions of the law.\n\nYakubu said: \u201cThe Commission looks forward to the conclusion of the process without which we cannot make the regulations and guidelines to give effect to the provisions of the law.\n\n\u201cWithout the regulations and guidelines, we cannot finalise on the manuals for the training of officials that will conduct elections. There are extensive provisions in the current bill that requires clear guidance by the Commission\u201d\n\nYakubu also said early enactment of the Electoral law would enable the Commission to test-run procedures and pilot innovations ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\nThe bill which is now at the last stage before the passage by the National Assembly and submission to the executive for assent, provides amongst others, the use of electronic device for transmission of election results.\n\nYakubu said in addition to the Anambra State governorship election holding on November 6, 2021, the Commission has already scheduled three major elections to be conducted next year.\n\n\u201cFirst is the Area Council election in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) holding on 12th February 2022, followed by the Ekiti Governorship election on 18th June 2022 and the Osun Governorship election a month later on 16th July 2022.\n\n\u201cThe Commission also has five pending bye-elections made up of three Federal Constituencies and two State Constituencies to contend with.\n\n\u201cI want to assure you that in a proactive manner, the Commission has been studying aspects of the amendment Bill and identifying areas that require the formulation of regulations and guidelines as well as the review of prescribed forms for implementation.\n\n\u201cThis will enable the Commission to test-run procedures and pilot innovations ahead of the 2023 General Election. The speedy passage of the Bill will be in the best interest of our electoral process,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile highlighting the fundamental role of the Electoral Act in the conduct of the election, Yakubu said the Act was one of the most important laws in any democracy.\n\nHe stated that one of the unique aspects of the current amendment of the Electoral Act was that it started well ahead of the forthcoming general elections, unlike previous exercises which came too close to elections.\n\nThe INEC boss solicited further cooperation from the National Assembly to make broad provisions of the law that would empower the Commission to continue to innovate without necessarily restricting it to a specific technology such as the Smart Card Reader which could in due course become obsolete, inapplicable or irrelevant as was the case the recent introduction of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) by the Commission.\n\n\u201cElection is a process anchored on a legal framework. First is the constitution, followed by the Electoral Act. In all jurisdictions, the Electoral Act provides more detailed provisions to govern the conduct of elections and the electoral process.\n\n\u201cThe importance of starting early is that it allows for a thorough debate by citizens on aspects of the Bill long after the conventional public hearing as witnessed recently. Clearly, the Electoral Amendment Bill 2021 is one of the most extensively debated Bills in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cUnderstandably, the issue of technology in elections has dominated recent public discussions in Nigeria. The Commission appreciates the decision of the National Assembly to empower INEC to determine and deploy appropriate technology in future elections.\n\n\u201cFor us at INEC, this is one of the progressive decisions by our National Assembly. As you finalise on the Electoral Amendment Bill, I urge you to continue to endow the Commission with power to determine what technology to deploy in our elections at the appropriate time.\u201d\n\nINEC Releases Notice for Anambra Governorship Election\n\nMeanwhile, INEC yesterday, released the notice of the governorship election in Anambra State slated for November 6.\n\nWith this development, however, INEC said all the governorship candidates have been scheduled to sign a peace accord on November 4.\n\nA statement by the National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye stated that, \u201cSo far, the Commission has successfully implemented 12 out of 14 activities in the Timetable and Schedule of Activities.\n\n\u201cThe Commission has today published the Notice of Poll at its state and all the local government offices in Anambra State. By Section 46 of the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended), the Commission shall, not later than 14 days before the day of the election, cause to be published, a notice specifying the date and hours fixed for the poll; the persons entitled to vote; and the location of the polling units.\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, today is the last day for the submission of names of polling agents by political parties. By Section 45 of the Electoral Act, each political party may by notice in writing, addressed to the Electoral Officer of the local government, appoint a polling agent for each polling unit and collation centre.\n\n\u201cThe notice shall set out the name and address of the polling agent, accompanied by two passport photographs of each polling agent, and sample signature of the agent, at least, 14 days before the date fixed for the election. Political parties are strongly advised to adhere strictly to the law and the guidelines for the deployment of polling agents. Only duly accredited polling agents will be allowed to operate at the polling units and collation centres,\u201d Okoye explained.\n\nAccordingly, the INEC national commissioner said he was satisfied with the current level of preparations, explaining that, \u201cVirtually all non-sensitive materials have been delivered in readiness for the election.\n\n\u201cThe training of ad-hoc staff is also going on as scheduled. The Commission is in touch with the National Peace Committee under the Chairmanship of former Head of State, General Abdulsalami Abubakar (Rtd) GCFR. Preparations are underway for the signing of the Peace Accord in Awka on Thursday 4th November 2021.\u201d\n\nOkoye further said the commission noted with appreciation, the role of religious, traditional and community leaders in Anambra State as well as civil society, socio-cultural associations and the media in appealing for peace during electioneering campaign and election day activities.\n\nHe posited that with just a little over two weeks to the election, the Commission appealed for support from all and sundry in Anambra to ensure that the election was not only peaceful but also free, fair and credible.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The Governing Council of Bill and Melinda Gates College of Health Technology, Ningi has dissolved the Academic Board of the college after it found one Amina Sule Abdulkaidir, a daughter of the Council\u2019s Chairman, Alhaji Sule Abdulkadir Doguwa, and 10 other students guilty of examination malpractice, WikkiTimes\u2019s independent investigation revealed.\n\nAmina and 10 other students of the Department of Medical Laboratory Technology of the Bill and Melinda Gates College of Health Technology, Ningi, Bauchi State, were caught copying answers from a paper sneaked into the examination hall during the 2020/2021 academic session\u2019s examination.\n\nFrom Left: Garba Hussaini, Provost and Alhaji Sule Abdulkadir Doguwa, Chairman, Governing Council\n\nThe Academic Board of the college constituted a committee to investigate Amina and the other students who were caught copying answers during the examination. On March 8, 2021, the board considered the report and came to the conclusion that the students had violated policies of the college relating to examination malpractice as provided for in the Students\u2019 Handbook and recommended their dismissal.\n\nThe Board further nullified the entire examination and asked for a repeat, excluding those to be dismissed.\n\nA statement dated March 9, 2021 signed by one S.M. Abdu Yaya on behalf of the Provost of the college, Garba Hussaini, stated that Amina Sule Abdulkadir and 10 other students of the Department of Medical Laboratory of the college had been dismissed from the college.\n\nThe document, however, annexed the registration slips of Amina and the other 10 students duly signed by the college\u2019s admissions officer. It further indicated that a lecturer of the college had leaked questions and answers to the students.\n\nThe suspected lecturer involved in leaking the questions and the answers to the students was also suspended.\n\nHowever, the Governing Council led by Alhaji Sule Abdulkadir Doguwa, father of one of the dismissed students (Amina) and chieftain of the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state, was unhappy at the decision of the academic board.\n\nA document dated March 24, 2021, showed that the Council resolved to dissolve the academic board of the college.\n\nWikkiTimes investigations revealed that the decision of the Governing Council came after it failed to persuade the academic board to reverse its decision to dismiss the 11 students who had clearly contravened the regulations of the college.\n\nIt soon became obvious why the board was sacked.\n\nThe college immediately offered Amina an admission letter despite her dismissal from the examination that could have guaranteed her admission if she had passed. The management of the college also issued punitive queries to five of the directors on the dissolved academic board.\n\nThe queries, dated August 23, 2021, were signed by the Provost of the College, Garba Hussaini. The directors were asked to appear before the Senior Staff Appointment and Promotion Committee of the college on August 24, 2021.\n\nOne of the directors, who spoke to WikkiTimes on condition of anonymity, said they were not given a fair hearing in the entire process as none of them was given a verbal warning before the query was issued to them.\n\nAssault on School Laws\n\nThe decision is an assault on the regulations of the college and one that has ramifications for the quality of education and training offered at the college.\n\nThe students\u2019 Handbook of the College clearly defines and categorises unauthorised oral or written communication in the examination hall as examination malpractice. It also describes as examination malpractices gaining an undue advantage by influencing college\u2019s examination official, altering sitting position, being in possession of written or printed or photocopied material, copying answers from paper or book or note, consulting unauthorised notes or books, assisting another candidate to cheat in an examination, receiving or giving help to another candidate in examinations and assisting a candidate during practical examination.\n\nOthers are having solutions to questions via the help of a student or staff member(s), smuggling in and out a question paper, impersonation, disobeying lawful instructions, gaining previous knowledge of questions, copying from a fellow student, verbal or non-verbal noise making and malpractice through the use of phone or computer.\n\nThe appropriate punishments for these offences are also listed in the handbook. These include disqualification from continuing with relevant examination with automatic failure in the respective course; disqualification from the entire examination and rustication for one calendar year and dismissal from school depending on the nature of the offence.\n\nAll these laws were assaulted and ignored as evident in the case of Amina, the daughter of the Chairman of the Governing Council of the school.\n\nA source privy to what happened said it is \u201cbecause her father is an authority in the college and one that could not be dared in the State because of his connection\u201d,\n\nA group of five concerned staff members of the college formerly part of the dissolved academic board of the college have written petitions against the Chairman of the Governing Council of the College, Alhaji Abdulkadir Doguwa to Bauchi State Governor, Senator Bala Abdulkadir Mohammed.\n\nOne of the petitions dated June 2021 alleged that the Chairman of the Governing Council of the College is not a health professional.\n\nThey argued that his non-professionalism is affecting the running of the college and creating setbacks in the college.\n\nFor instance, the petition alleged that the Chairman of the Governing Council of the college was biased in the dissolution of the academic board after the board had indicted his daughter for examination malpractice.\n\nThe petition also faulted the appointment of Heads of Department and Directors as well as the appointment of junior staff members to head departments or direct the school\u2019s affairs.\n\nIn his response, Abdulkadir Doguwa claimed it was a case of corruption fighting back.\n\nAlthough he conceded that he is not a health professional, he said that had not affected the running of the college as alleged.\n\nIn his letter dated July 2, 2021 and sighted by WikkiTimes, he denied hijacking the responsibilities of the academic board and the management of the college.\n\nHe said: \u201cRegarding the dissolution of the academic board and leaving other tenured appointments, I can say that the appointment and tenure of school directors were clearly spelt in the law whereas the tenure for the other offices are stated in the scheme and condition of service which was giving partial approval and is being implemented.\n\n\u201cOn the issue of bias in the appointment of school directors and heads of departments, the extant law of the college section 12, 1-2 and 21, 1 that provides for the establishment of the college has given the Governing Council the power to appoint school directors and heads of department with their tenure without mentioning seniority as a criterion in the appointment.\u201d\n\nUnqualified Candidates Get Admission\n\nData available to WikkiTimes showed that the Pharmacy Technician Department of the College was officially given an admission slot of 40 students by the Pharmacist Council of Nigeria, PCN, for the 2020/2021 academic session.\n\nAt the end of its weeding examination for the session, the department ranked and shortlisted 46 students who passed the examination with grades ranging from 3.82 GPA to 2.05 GPA in line with set standards for absorption into its diploma programme out of 140 students that sat the weeding examination.\n\nMalam Babaru, an employee with the Pharmacy technician department of the college, told WikkiTimes that the department included students whose performances were on the threshold of probation and presented the result of 54 students to the Provost of the college.\n\nHe said the provost insisted that a quota system must be adopted to shortlist the final list of students to be absorbed into the diploma programme, which is contrary to the provisions set by the college for admission of students through its weeding programme.\n\nParts of the modalities for the weeding programme at the college stipulated that \u201cat the end of the semester, the result will be ranked and only qualified index-able number will be absorbed at the department.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the modalities added that any student on GPA \u201cless than 1.50\u201d will be advised to withdraw from the programme.\n\nBut Babaru revealed that the provost pressed for candidates of the Chairman of the Governing Council, Doguwa and Chairman, Bauchi State House of Assembly Committee on Health, Bello Jadori to be allowed to go continue even after failing the examination.\n\nTheir names were captured in the list of successful students.\n\nThe Provost later approved the result of 64 candidates after including the names of candidates who failed.\n\nOut of the 64 candidates, 15 were on probation meaning only 49 students merited to be absorbed into the Pharmacy Technician Programme of the College.\n\nWikkiTimes\u2019 analysis of the result showed that 24 students scored GPAs that are below 1.50 and 52 are on less than 1 GPA with 15 other students on probation.\n\nPharmacists Council of Nigeria, PCN, Responds\n\nPharmacist Nenlep Bakwa, Bauchi State Officer of the Pharmacists Council of Nigeria said the council is not aware of the admission racketeering in the Pharmacy Technician Department of the Bill and Melinda Gates College of Health Technology, Ningi as no report had been submitted to it in respect of the allegation.\n\nHe said the PCN approves only 40 students for each pharmacy technician department annually.\n\nHe said that the council index only approves quota assigned to each of the two colleges in Bauchi State with accreditation to run pharmacy technician departments.\n\n\u201cOur attention is being called to what Ningi did which is called weeding. But they say it\u2019s not only the department of Pharmacy Technicians. That\u2019s the rule of the school.\n\n\u201cThey admit some sets of students and those students are subjected to exams. Pharmacy Technician, we already know that it\u2019s 40.\n\n\u201cWe will not index more than the assigned quota. So, automatically the system regulates itself. I don\u2019t know whether they paste the index we send them. If they do, it is at their local level. But if the school says out of mistake or pressure we did this, please help us. We will write to the registrar. But I don\u2019t know the limit the registrar can give. And it can\u2019t be always,\u201d he said.\n\nProvost Failed Several Interview Promises, Ignores FOI Request\n\nGarba Hussaini, the Provost of the college serially failed to honour the interview appointments he gave to our reporter.\n\nFor instance, on September 13th 2021 WkkiTimes\u2019 reporter went to the college to honour an interview appointment with the Provost but was informed on reaching the office that he was not on his seat due to an ailment.\n\nThe Provost promised a phone interview when his condition improved but repeatedly refused to speak to WikkiTimes.\n\nHe rescheduled the interview to September 21, 2021. Again, he kept giving excuses after WikkTimes sent a team of three journalists to interview him.\n\nAfter several visits to Ningi on appointment to interview him failed, WikkiTimes sent a Freedom of Information Act request to the provost dated September 21, 2021, asking for his response to all the allegations against the Governing Council and the management of the college.\n\nHowever, the Provost did not also respond to the FOI request sent to him as of press time.\n\nChairman Governing Council Interrupts Phone Interview, Ignores Text Message Sent\n\nThe Chairman of the Governing Council also declined to comment on the role of the council in the erosion of academic excellence in the school.\n\nDoguwa directed the reporter to the Provost of the college, saying it is an \u201cissue that concerns the management of the college.\n\n\u201cIf you will ask me about what concerns me personally and ask about my daughter, you are not fair to me, you are not fair to me,\u201d he said and hung up.\n\nBauchi Health Ministry Ignores FOI Request\n\nAfter several visits to interview authorities of the Bauchi State Ministry of Health, WikkiTimes also sent a Freedom of Information Act Request dated 28th September. The request was also ignored.\n\nThis story is published with support from Civic Media Lab under its Investigative Reporting Partnership Project",

          "text": "The detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, was brought to the Federal High Court in Abuja last Thursday, the 21st October, for his trial to continue before Justice Binta Nyako. He faced an amended enlarged seven counts bordering on terrorism and treasonable felony levelled against him by the Federal Government. The amended charges reportedly included subversive activities, calling the President an \"idiot\" and operating an unregistered international pirate radio.\n\nUpon the reading of the amended charges (which suddenly rose from five to seven) to him in the presence of his lawyers (including one from America) Justice Binta Nyako took a plea of not guilty from Kanu and adjourned the trial for November 10.\n\nSOC Okenwa\n\nSeeing Kanu on some of the videos posted online many people must have felt relieved that he was hale and hearty. And above all, alive! He was seen bantering with his lawyers and in good spirit. When he was first brought before Justice Nyako some months ago following his audacious abduction in Nairobi, Kenya, and subsequent rendition to Nigeria he looked haggard and emaciated.\n\nBut given the amount of torture he claimed he suffered in the hands of his abductors in Nairobi for two long weeks prior to his rendition to Nigeria Kanu must have felt relieved and happy that justice is now the final arbiter in his case.\n\nEven before he was brought to the court reports online had it that Abuja was thrown into a security siege -- especially the neighbourhoods around the High Court complex. The blanket security thrown around the federal capital may not be unconnected to the Kanu myth and rumours flying about of the possibility of his abduction from the court by his armed supporters or even terrorists operating within the axis of the FCT.\n\nSenator Ifeanyi Uba, the former Anambra State Governor and elder statesman, Chukwuemeka Ezeife, leading a high-powered Ohaneze Ndigbo delegation, the intrepid SaharaReporters Publisher, Comrade Omoyele Sowore and a host of journalists and lawyers were all locked out of the court premises.\n\nThe popular human rights activist and former presidential contender, Comrade Sowore, suffered physical attack by the pro-Buhari hoodlums. And it was reported that when the sponsored mob were busy assaulting Sowore the security agents stationed near-by feigned ignorance of the ugly development with some of them laughing heartily!\n\nNigerians from all walks of life had condemned in unison the show of force by our security operatives in a civil case which ordinarily should not attract the military siege mentality for which the Buhari regime is notorious globally. Yet we always perform excellently in everything evil or antithetical to reason or morality.\n\nThe last time we checked Mazi Kanu is not a condemned criminal in the eyes of the law. The truth of the matter is that he is presumed innocent of all charges (some laughable) until he is pronounced guilty by the competent court. So, it boggles the mind how and why the security forces should be acting as if a notorious criminal is being docked.\n\nEven when the late Lawrence Anini, the notorious generous armed robber, was brought before Justice James Omo-Agege in Benin City observers and lawyers and journalists were not mistreated. Yet Gen. Ibrahim Babangida was then in power as a guileful dictator. I remember witnessing the proceedings then and everyone could testify that justice was served 'The Law' and his cohorts (including Monday Osunbor and policeman George Iyamu) by the verdict of death by firing squad.\n\nKanu had effortlessly propagated the Biafran nationhood idea even while in detention. And his followers are increasing by the day because there is this generalised perception of injustice and marginalization in Igboland. So what he is campaigning for, the sovereign state of Biafra, rings a deafening bell in the consciousness of many Biafrans at home and abroad.\n\nThe current judicial travail of the Biafran secessionist champion could make or mar the much-vaunted unity of the nation if professionalism is not applied by the security forces and justice, in its incontrovertible impartiality, rendered.\n\nJustice Binta Nyako must exercise her constitutional powers by ruling against the militarization of the Kanu trial. Unless she is acting out a malevolent script written extra-judicially by forces outside her control.\n\nThe Kanu/Biafra seperatist issue has drawn attention beyond our borders. It has since gone international with every detail of the struggle for freedom available online and offline. Therefore, the way justice is dispensed or abused in the process of trial would go a long way in demonstrating our commitment towards civilisation or diminishing our reputation as a chaotic nation in the eyes of international observers.\n\nThe crude and rude manner the security forces harassed citizens and prevented interested parties from gaining access into the courtroom is condemnable. It is a civil trial involving a Justice, a civilian. Democracy makes it clear that no one should be tried in secret and the constitution frowns at barring anyone from participating in any trial inside a courtroom.\n\nThe Buhari regime has once again demonstrated its military regime mentality. Militarizing Kanu's trial sent a strong negative message across the world reinforcing the belief in Biafraland that Kanu is indeed fighting a just cause.\n\nCome November 10 let the security authorities not make the mistake of harassing or intimidating anyone interested in witnessing Kanu's continued trial. Justice must be done and seen to be done!\n\nSOC Okenwa\n\n[email protected]\n\n[email protected]",
          "summary": "When he was first brought before Justice Nyako some months ago following his audacious abduction in Nairobi, Kenya, and subsequent rendition to Nigeria he looked haggard and emaciated.\nSo, it boggles the mind how and why the security forces should be acting as if a notorious criminal is being docked.\nJustice Binta Nyako must exercise her constitutional powers by ruling against the militarization of the Kanu trial.\nThe crude and rude manner the security forces harassed citizens and prevented interested parties from gaining access into the courtroom is condemnable.\nMilitarizing Kanu's trial sent a strong negative message across the world reinforcing the belief in Biafraland that Kanu is indeed fighting a just cause.",

          "title": "Baxi acquisition deal sees MFS Africa expand footprint into Nigeria",
          "text": "In a deal subject to approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria, MFS Africa has signed an agreement to acquire Capricorn Digital, one of Nigeria\u2019s largest digital solutions and distribution companies with a 90,000-strong agent network across the country, for an undisclosed amount.\n\nAs the largest fintech interoperability hub in Africa, MFS Africa connects banks, telcos, and money transfer operators across over 35 countries via a single integration point. Paga, MTN mobile money, Ecobank, and Safaricom are among the operators integrated on the hub, with an estimated 320 million mobile money customers interacting across various digital wallets without transaction fees associated with switching platforms.\n\nCapricorn, under its SME-focused brand, Baxi, operates an ecosystem of digital payment services. Its solution is built to help Nigerians with everyday payment needs; including utility bill payments, airtime purchases, pay-TV and data subscriptions, withdrawals, and money transfers. The company delivers these services through its retail network of agents and merchants in some of the remotest locations across Nigeria, and via its BaxiBox POS, BaxiPay, Baxi MPoS Device, and BaxiRIMS products.\n\nThe 100% cash acquisition, MFS Africa\u2019s third in five years, sees the pan-African payments giant expand into Africa\u2019s largest economy, where its presence to date has been limited given the country\u2019s small number of mobile wallets. Capricorn will be called MFS Africa but its core product, Baxi, retains its name.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBoth parties declined to disclose the value of the deal but on a call with TechCabal, Capricorn Founder and CEO, Degbola Abudu, said the deal is the second-largest of its kind in Nigeria\u2019s fintech space, behind the $200 million Stripe paid for Paystack last year.\n\nMFS Africa was founded in 2009 by Dare Okoudjou, a Beninese national, while Nigeria-born Abudu started Capricorn in 2014, with Folu Majekodunmi. The acquisition creates a larger, more versatile company that fuses interoperability between money operators and a super-agent network reaching the mass market.\n\nA pan-African march\n\nMFS Africa\u2019s big vision is to have a presence in all 54 African countries, serving 500 million people and millions of small businesses, according to Okoudjou.\n\n\u201cIf you have a phone or POS, it should be enough to transact with the rest of Africa and the world,\u201d he tells TechCabal. \u201cWe\u2019re building the foremost, currency-agnostic, real-time hub for payments on the continent, to enable people transfer money the way they can call each other.\u201d\n\nOften, MFS Africa\u2019s continental expansion plan has involved partnering with money operators and making minority investments in other fintech companies across Africa, as in the case of Julaya, Maviance, and Numida.\n\nHowever, Okoudjou explains that the company opts for full acquisition when both parties consider that more effective for achieving their shared long-term ambitions.\n\nDare Okoudjou, MFS Africa founder and CEO (left) and Degbola Abudu, co-founder of Baxi.\n\nWhy an acquisition?\n\nSimilar to Beyonic, a Ugandan fintech startup MFS Africa bought in June 2020 also for an undisclosed amount, acquisition talks with Capricorn evolved from a minority investment to a full buyout.\n\n\u201cThe more we spoke with Dee, the more we realised what we could achieve with a full acquisition instead of being only investors in which case there could be misaligned incentives.\u201d\n\nOkoudjou further explains that the need to \u201cbolster our presence in Nigeria\u201d given its unique market features\u2014the prevalence of offline payment touchpoints over mobile-first transactions\u2014drove MFS Africa\u2019s interest in Capricorn.\n\n\u201cIn other markets, one or two partnerships with mobile money operators could see us reach 60% of digital payment users in the country,\u201d he says. \u201cHowever, mobile money isn\u2019t that widely adopted in Nigeria. Instead, agent networks such as Capricorn\u2019s have grown rapidly.\u201d\n\nWhile MFS Africa can service SMEs online through Beyonic, for instance, Baxi enables the company to reach offline merchants in Nigeria and beyond.\n\nFor Abudu, the future of the mobile payments landscape in Africa is a game of few, where consolidation is the way forward, and attempting to scale alone would require more capital expenditure and a longer time to execute.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good time to partner with a company that brings a real pan-African presence and we see synergies across our operations. They offer a wide range of value-added products and services like cross-border payments while we have access to SMEs in Nigeria, one of the biggest markets in Africa,\u201d he says. \u201cWe believe that we\u2019ve barely scratched the market\u2019s potential.

          "title": "Editi Effiong: father, writer, producer and tech bro",
          "text": "Editi Effiong\u2019s genius is quiet yet obvious at the same time. He\u2019s a multifaceted creator, builder and thinker\u2014unafraid to tackle the impossible without doubt. From setting up Anakle, a Nigeria-based digital marketing agency, 10 years ago to transitioning into film-making a few years later, Editi has established himself as one of the leading entrepreneurs of his generation. When asked how he would define himself, he responded with, \u201cI\u2019m a father, writer, producer, and tech bro.\n\nThe big picture: Editi Effiong is not your average guy\n\nMany people know Editi Effiong as the brains behind Anakle. Some others might know him for the films he made through his production company, Anakle Films or might have stumbled across him after his involvement in the post-#ENDSARS judicial hearing panel in 2020. Editi attended and documented the daily proceedings, sharing videos, photos and commentaries on his Twitter page. His dedication to reporting on how Lagos State investigated the unforgettable event that took place on October 20 last year, garnered him respect, admiration and a flock of new followers and cheerleaders.\n\nAnakle Films\u2019 theatrical releases, Up North and The Setup, were acquired by Netflix in 2019 and 2020 respectively. Up North, which was based on a story written by Editi, is best described as one of Nollywood\u2019s most adventurous films. Up North did two things successfully: It brought some versatility to Nollywood, Nigeria\u2019s behemoth movie industry; and heralded the arrival of a different Editi. He was no longer just the CEO of a well-respected digital agency with a client list that most marketing agencies would love to get their hands on\u2014Wikipedia, Flutterwave, Glo, to name a few\u2014he was now a film producer and writer who took his craft seriously.\n\nAn illustrated photo of Editi at a filming location in Northern Nigeria\n\nThe Set Up pulled us in a different direction. In this film, there are no adventures or lush, green fields. But there\u2019s suspense and the dirty underworld of crime. Anakle Films distributed The Set Up with legendary film-maker, Niyi Akinmolayan, sitting on the director\u2019s chair.\n\nEditi displayed his writing chops in his most recent short film, Fishbone, released in May 2020. Fishbone, written and directed by Effiong himself, unearths the terrifying business of counterfeit drugs and how it strips our society of its ability to show love and compassion. Fishbone is a deliberately revealing film; it shows us snapshots of Effiong\u2019s mind and showcases his directorial ingenuity.\n\nIn this exclusive interview with TechCabal, Editi opens up about his childhood, the complexity that is his mind, building Anakle, being a father, and his decision to become a full-time film-maker and writer.\n\nAnakle and the race to get businesses online\n\nEven though Editi is eager to hand over the CEO reins to Anakle\u2019s COO, Munachi \u201cMuna\u201d Nwoke-Ekpo, and purposefully step into his role as founder and CEO of Anakle Films, I was compelled to kick off the interview with questions about Anakle\u2019s beginnings.\n\nIn 2011, digital marketing didn\u2019t have as much clout as it does now. It is hard to imagine a world that didn\u2019t exist with numerous digital and social media platforms. Our current economic climate demands that entrepreneurs move their businesses online and acquire a new crop of customers who are obsessed with social media and consumer technology. In conversation, Editi is a masterful storyteller who uses transparency and humour to pull his listeners in. At no point during our chat did he leave me feeling confused or unimpressed.\n\nKoromone Koroye: What inspired you to start Anakle? What did you see and understand about digital marketing that most people didn\u2019t back in 2011?\n\nEditi Effiong: Back in 2011, we had a slide that predicted that internet penetration would deepen in five years. We also predicted that more than five million Nigerians would be on the internet and that that number would eventually rise to 30 million by 2016. Back then, mobile penetration wasn\u2019t that great and Blackberry phones were still a thing. My business partner, Abass, would charge business owners \u20a650,000 to help them run digital marketing campaigns. And that 50K came with a money-back guarantee: if we weren\u2019t able to successfully promote their brands, they got their money back without any hassles. I mean, how on earth does someone believe that the internet can help you sell more? But we saw that there was a market online and we bet big on what we saw.\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: According to the Digital 2021 report, there were an estimated 104 million internet users in Nigeria in January this year. Additionally, internet penetration stood at 50% and 33 million Nigerians with active social media accounts, within that same period.\n\nDo you remember Anakle\u2019s first major campaign?\n\nEditi: In 2010, we ran Interswitch\u2019s first digital campaign. We did this whole flash animation video to push Interswitch\u2019s anti-fraud campaign. I designed the flash. In the early stages of Anakle\u2019s business, I was in charge of execution and Abass handled business operations. So, in this flash animated campaign, if someone emails you for your password or PIN, you don\u2019t give them because Interswitch would never ask you for your PIN or personal information. It was a really great campaign at that time. I mean now, we might take a simple campaign like that for granted; but 12 years ago, building and executing a campaign like that was a phenomenal experience for us and the brands we served during that period.\n\nHow did businesses relate with social media back when Anakle started out?\n\nEditi: \u200b\u200bThe first bank to get on social media was GTB (Guaranty Trust Bank) followed by Diamond Bank. We worked on a project with them and they had their brand assets burned onto a CD. Yes, CDs were a thing back then. But, anyway, they opted for the CD route because they didn\u2019t want anyone to distribute their assets to other sources or agencies. So I picked up Diamond Bank\u2019s CD on a Tuesday and started working on it straight till Thursday. And Thursday happened to be my wedding day.\n\nWoah. You did client work on your wedding day?\n\nEditi: Yes! I was out in the foyer of the hotel room working on this project until I got called into the hall to say my vows and, you know, get married. So I put down my laptop, you know, went and got married and came back and continued working even through my honeymoon. And to think that this was only the second bank that we helped build a Facebook app and get them on social media. Diamond Bank was the second bank in Nigeria to go down the digital marketing route.\n\nIn the summer of 2010, there was a huge opportunity to help businesses get online. And one of the things Anakle was trying to do was help smaller businesses improve brand visibility by getting them acquainted with the internet. We didn\u2019t just target the big brands and enterprise businesses, especially in the beginning. Anakle saw the future of digital marketing and built a business out of it. Our mission was to help businesses grow into the online space, and that\u2019s pretty much it.\n\nAt what point did you realise that Anakle had fulfilled its mission, or at least a part of it?\n\nEditi: There have been many moments. In 2017 we did a very successful campaign with Wikipedia. And that campaign was a forerunner to what became Anakle films. That campaign counted as a major milestone for us. There\u2019s also the part we played in hiring and training people who were new to the digital marketing space. For most of them, Anakle was their first job out of school, and now, most of them are running their own successful companies and projects. You know, making money and growing a company are necessary targets, but I\u2019ve always been more excited about mentoring people and helping them grow in the industry and become better versions of themselves even outside of the work they do at Anakle or anywhere else.\n\nIf our business no longer inspired the people who walked through its doors, then we have failed at our mission. So I get really excited when I see consistent growth in the people who walk through our doors; they come in, grow and become more than they thought they could be before they joined the company.\n\nWhat were Anakle\u2019s hiring values in the beginning? And did those values change after the business grew and garnered success?\n\nEditi: We were looking for people who had the \u2018Anakle spirit\u2019, which is a certain level of fearlessness. We wanted people who could work without fear. I didn\u2019t care too much about CVs and cover letters. We were looking for people who could challenge us; people who could look at the universe as it is and ultimately try to bend it. Because when people are able to challenge the status quo and say, \u201cI can take that on\u201d, then they can create a fire campaign for Sterling Bank or any other enterprise client.\n\nEditi Effiong\n\nHow did you delight Anakle\u2019s early employees?\n\nEditi: I\u2019ll be honest: Back then, we couldn\u2019t compete with Nigerian banks and their salary offerings and other benefits. so we ended up designing a workplace that was exciting. We wanted young people to feel excited about working for us and working out of our office. The Anakle office became our recruitment tool and it was so inspiring to hear people say they wanted to work with us, especially after visiting our office.\n\nNew beginnings: Anakle Films and the road to becoming a director, screenwriter, and producer\n\nKoromone: Moving swiftly along from building Anakle to setting up Anakle films\u2014\n\nEditi: Thank God!\n\nWhen did you know you were ready to make the move?\n\nEditi: Money! I had the money to make that leap of faith into Anakle Films.\n\nSo, how did it feel making that transition from running Anakle to leading the charge at Anakle films? Especially knowing that you were going to put a lot of time and effort into building out Anakle Films\u2019 brand?\n\nEditi: I think the biggest factor there is having a team that can do its job\u2014big props to Munachi. If you\u2019ve never heard of Muna, he\u2019s the best COO in the business. He\u2019s quiet but hard-working and has been with me for 11 years. Muna has done an amazing job at running the business at a group level, and having him around has been extremely helpful and instrumental. I recently received and turned down a global leadership position at a global company\u2014a fantastic offer with great pay\u2014but I turned it down because I wanted the freedom to wake up and do what I love doing or to not do something I hate doing. There\u2019s a madness to having that freedom that works for me. And I think I owe a lot of that to Muna. He gave me the courage to step out of Anakle.\n\nAn illustrated photo of Editi directing a film at a location in Nigeria\n\nTell us about your history and relationship with writing\n\nEditi: This isn\u2019t common knowledge, but I didn\u2019t start writing today. I\u2019ve been writing my entire life. I was also an avid reader when I was younger. My father studied literature and linguistics, so there were a lot of books around the house. I write almost every day and have written almost every day for my entire life. And when I cannot put into words things I want to say, I end up writing them down. I have hardly ever gotten in trouble for writing because I\u2019m able to articulate my thoughts without ambiguity. Wow! I just used a big word.\n\nMy move to Anakle Films is my way of preparing for retirement. I want to retire as a writer. My entire life is run by writing and this is the direction it is headed now. Anakle Films is my excuse to write; it gives me a reason to write, create and build something from the ground up. As you can imagine, there\u2019s a lot of craziness and madness around the work, but I love it.\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: Ambiguity is a situation or statement that is unclear because it can be understood in more than one way. [Source: Cambridge dictionary]\n\nEditi on documenting justice for #EndSars victims and survivors and finding his voice again\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: A few months after the #ENDSARS massacre, Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu set up a nine-person Judicial Panel of Inquiry to investigate allegations of police brutality perpetuated by the now-defunct Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) in Lagos State. This part of my conversation with Editi struck a raw nerve for the both of us, especially for Editi who had to restrain his emotions while he answered my questions. I think it takes a lot of courage to document the truth in the midst of pain and grief.\n\nKoromone: Let\u2019s pivot and talk about 2020. How did you find yourself involved in the #EndSARS Judicial Panel of Inquiry that sat in Lagos? A number of people don\u2019t know this, but you were shooting a film during that period.\n\nEditi: Yes, I was. When I couldn\u2019t attend sessions, I was on set. When I was a kid, I used to stutter. And, you know, I managed it through my teenage years until it went away. After October 2020, my stutter returned. I stutter a lot these days, especially when I\u2019m dealing with difficult situations. So if you pay attention when I speak, you will hear how slow and deliberate I am with my words. I speak slowly to avoid stuttering, and everytime I think about what went down during #EndSars, it messes up my speech.\n\nThe night of the shootings, I could hear the gunshots. And I was going to drive out there because our people were bleeding and needed help, but my wife said, \u201cNo, you cannot go. It is too dangerous.\u201d So, I didn\u2019t go, and that night, I couldn\u2019t speak at all. For hours, I could not say a word. Anytime I tried to say a word, something came up from inside me and blocked off my speech. And since then, I\u2019ve been managing a very bad stutter that comes and goes\u2014but mostly only comes when I\u2019m dealing with difficult subjects. And in the days following October 20, I felt nothing but numbness. Going to those panel sessions was kind of a metaphor for trying to find my voice again.\n\nFor a few weeks following the shootings, I couldn\u2019t speak properly, and writing about the sessions was my way of speaking and reconnecting with the voice I had lost.\n\nShare this article\n\nKoromone Koroye | Author",

          "text": "Like most Nigerian workers, Kola*, at his former job, used to be paid his salary in the country\u2019s official currency: the naira\u2014until he started working at a fintech company registered outside Nigeria. Now he gets paid in USD Coin (USDC), a Stablecoin tethered to the US dollar. With this switch in his salary\u2019s currency, Kola was offered a juicy opportunity to exit a quagmire many young Nigerians find themselves in: they make more money than their parents did but in a currency that has fallen so low their paycheck doesn\u2019t reflect in their purchasing power.\n\nNigeria, like many African countries, grapples with currency risk. Back in 2015, its current president, Muhammadu Buhari, campaigned on a promise to increase the value of the naira. But since the start of his presidency, the country\u2019s currency has plunged badly because demand for the dollar continues to outstrip supply. This plunge in the value of the naira has been majorly fueled by Nigeria importing more goods than it exports. With declining oil prices forcing the Nigerian government to devalue its official currency twice in the past year, and by roughly 35% over the past five years, the resultant inflation has thrown over 7 million people into poverty in 2020 alone, according to the World Bank.\n\nSince saving in naira is a dead plan, more Nigerians now save their earnings in foreign currencies. Data from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) revealed that Nigeria had a total domiciliary account balance of \u20a66.566 trillion as of March 2021, and when this figure is converted to dollars at the official rate of \u20a6410 per dollar, it translates to about $16 billion.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nVolatile naira drives Nigerians to digital currencies\n\nNigeria\u2019s weak currency has pushed its citizens into saving their money in foreign currencies, for wealth and value preservation. But even this is in limbo because uncertainties rule the country\u2019s financial regulatory climate. Nigeria\u2019s CBN has a long history of clamping down on individuals, groups and companies it suspects of being responsible for the slump in the value of the naira. Out of nowhere, the CBN banned the sale of foreign currencies to bureau de change operators\u2014also called the parallel or black market\u2014in the country, accusing them of creating an artificial foreign exchange scarcity. It also threatened to go after abokiFX, a website that collates the black market foreign exchange rates daily, asserting that there is only one acceptable exchange rate: the Investors\u2019 and Exporters\u2019 FX Window.\n\nThis has made a lot of people apprehensive, especially those with funds in their domiciliary accounts. Their fears were heightened after Ibrahim Obanikoro, a member of parliament, suggested in a tweet that the CBN close all domiciliary accounts for the next year.\n\nIn addition to saving in foreign currencies, Nigerians have turned to cryptocurrencies\u2014digital currencies that are out of the reach of federal government control.\n\nThis newfound hunger for cryptocurrency has seen Nigeria emerge as the leading country, per capita, for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency adoption in the world, according to a report by Statista\u2014despite government crackdown. In fact, the African continent has been the fastest adopter of cryptocurrency in the world. Chainalysis estimates that African countries collectively received around $105.6 billion worth of cryptocurrency between July 2020 and June 2021. For context, sub-Saharan Africa received an estimated $48 billion worth of remittances in 2019, about half of which went to Nigeria, according to a Brookings Institute study. Between July 2019 and June 2020, the volume of cryptocurrencies sent to Africa from outside the continent was the highest of all regions Chainalysis studied. With 96% of the crypto value coming from outside the continent, this suggests that more Africans are receiving remittances via crypto.\n\nDigital money is the future of finance\n\nIn February this year, the CBN placed a ban on cryptocurrency in the country when it directed banks to close the accounts of persons or entities involved in cryptocurrency transactions. At the time, the Nigerian apex bank claimed that cryptocurrencies and digital currencies were largely used in terrorism financing and money laundering, citing the anonymity of their transactions.\n\nBut months after that, the government, seeing it couldn\u2019t quench the fire of cryptocurrency in the country, bet on digital money as the future by launching a central bank digital currency (CBDCs) named eNaira and nicknamed \u201cProject Giant\u201d.\n\nDigital money like cryptocurrencies, CBDCs and Stablecoins will play a significant role in the future of financial services. Cryptocurrency is gaining worldwide acceptance; Stablecoin, a peculiar type of cryptocurrency, has been labelled the \u201cfuture of money\u201d by the Harvard Business Review; and all these are in direct competition with CBDCs.\n\nRest of World reported on how Stablecoins have found a use case in volatile markets like Nigeria, where CBN\u2019s regulations force Nigerians to spend limited amounts of US dollars via their dollar cards each month. In order to bypass this limitation, Nigerians have switched to using Stablecoins to make their payments.\n\nStablecoins, such as the Tether (USDT), Binance USD (BUSD) and USD Coin (USDC) are a form of cryptocurrency pegged to a traditional asset like the US dollar or gold. In sub-Saharan Africa, Stablecoin remittances can be up to 20 times cheaper than traditional money transfers. USDT and USDC transfer fees are often as low as 0\u20131%. Paxful, a leading cryptocurrency trading platform in the country, declares that 1.5 million Nigerian users, representing about 5% of the platform\u2019s trading volume, use USDT, the most popular Stablecoin.\n\nThere is a growing adoption of Stablecoins like $DAI, $USDT, $BUSD and $USDC in Nigeria. Unlike such cryptocurrencies as Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are notorious for their volatility, Stablecoin, like CBDCs, is a non-interest coin. Stablecoins have seen rapid growth this year, with USDC, the second-largest Stablecoin in the world, reaching a market capitalisation of over $30 billion.\n\nSalary alert\u2026but in crypto\n\nJust like Olaf Carlson-Wee, Coinbase\u2019s first employee who was paid entirely in Bitcoin, as far back as 2013, for three years, Nigerians also want to be paid in crypto.\n\nEarlier this year, in July, Timi Ajiboye, CEO and CTO of Helicarrier (formerly Buycoins), announced that the company\u2019s employees would now be paid in USDC. Twitter went agog, with many presenting themselves to Ajiboye for employment at his company.\n\nIn a process Kola describes as \u201cseamless\u201d when he receives his salary in USDC, he converts to naira only the amount he plans to spend for the week. \u201cI don\u2019t withdraw my full salary at once because you never know what the exchange rate will be tomorrow. So, even if waiting would add \u20a6500 to my salary, I\u2019d rather wait than withdraw all at once and have the naira in my account drop in value between when I withdraw it and when I spend it.\u201d\n\nKola says he can convert his crypto, using his company\u2019s product, a cryptocurrency trading app, within two hours. He is unbothered by persistent news around the steady drop of the naira. He isn\u2019t completely insulated from the naira crash, though, as a Nigerian living in Nigeria. But, he notes: \u201cAt least my salary\u2019s value isn\u2019t dropping as fast as it would have if I was earning in naira.\u201d\n\nA colleague of Kola\u2019s, Deji*, who receives his base pay and benefits in USDC as well, reveals that all employees were kept in the loop right from when the company decided that that was the route it would take regarding employee compensation. As a fintech company, there was no need to convince anyone on the team about how Stablecoins would protect them from the steady fall of the naira.\n\nThe problem with crypto-salaries\n\nAt Kola\u2019s company, individual contract staff, who make up a majority of its workers, are responsible for remitting their taxes. To help the employee with this process, an internal document containing information on tax and pension calculations and payments has been circulated around the company. This is the company battling the challenge that comes with paying employees in crypto, as legal barriers in many countries prevent this. Some of the barriers include the non-recognition of cryptocurrency as a legal tender and the challenge of calculating taxes when employees are paid in cryptocurrency.\n\nFor instance, it\u2019s still risky to pay employees in crypto in the US because the currency is recognised by the Inland Revenue Service (IRS) as a property and not a legal tender. A piece of legislation, the Fair Labour Standards Act\u2014a major custodian of employee rights\u2014backs this position. The act states that employees must be paid in \u201ccash or negotiable instrument payable at par\u201d.\n\nWhile legal systems around the world need more time to develop regulations that cater for crypto adoption, US-based Coinbase announced last week that it is launching a new direct deposit service, \u201cGet paid in crypto,\u201d that will let nearly anyone in the US receive all or part of their wages in cryptocurrencies. There are high hopes for the success of this rollout because if even a fraction of Coinbase\u2019s millions of US customers sign up, the service will contribute, in no small way, to making crypto mainstream in the broader American workforce.\n\nSome countries are already making progress with creating laws that define the payment of workers in cryptocurrency. For example, since 2019, New Zealand has made it legal to receive salaries in cryptocurrency and be taxed accordingly.\n\nBut in Nigeria, paying employees in crypto remains illegal. Nigeria\u2019s primary legislation on the relationship between an employer and employees, the Nigerian Labour Act\u2014established in 2004\u2014renders any contract where part or all of a worker\u2019s wages is made payable in another manner apart from legal tender illegal, null and void.\n\nDespite these legal constraints, Nigerian employers in technology startups continue to make smart moves to create value for their employees and the move towards remunerating employees in crypto is one that\u2019s unlikely to go away anytime soon.\n\n*Names have been changed.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nSultan Quadri | Author",

          "title": "I promise it\u2019s funnier in Swahili\u2026Kenyan Comedian Eddie Butita is Showing Netflix How Swahili\u2019s Done",
          "text": "For about a month now, Ubers branded with Netflix\u2019s logo have been zipping through Nairobi\u2019s streets. An Uber driver pulls up, blasting early-2000s hip-hop, ready to take on his next ride.\n\nWhen asked why his car is decked out in Netflix decals, he says that he and a group of other drivers were approached by a marketing company offering $90 to anyone willing to ride around the city with the Netflix promotion plastered on the side of their cars. \u201cEasy money,\u201d he says.\n\nStreaming Gets Serious\n\nNetflix is more serious than ever about capturing Kenyan viewers. Since September, Netflix has been offering freemium services and running targeted Twitter campaigns. But, in a move that displays a real willingness to solidify themselves in the hearts and minds of the East African nation\u2019s growing viewers, the streaming giant is now offering Swahili-language programming.\n\nTo roll out this project, the $25 billion company enlisted the help of celebrated Kenyan comic, Eddie Butita.\n\nOver a period of months, Butita translated and oversaw the dubbing for the Swahili language version of Wanda Sykes and Regina Y. Hicks\u2019 Netflix sitcom, The Upshaws.\n\nAt 28 years old, Butita has contributed to iconic series like Churchill Show and the work of other famous Kenyan comedians like Eric Omondi.\n\nBut it\u2019s clear that he was not approached by Netflix based on comedic talent alone. Butita is skilled at wielding digital technology in a market that\u2019s grown so big that Netflix can\u2019t ignore it.\n\nComedy Meets Digital Media\n\nComedy is big in Kenya, but digital media made it bigger.\n\nKenya\u2019s mobile penetration rate grew by 11% from 2020 to 2021 alone, making it one of the most connected countries in sub-Saharan Africa after Nigeria and South Africa. On top of higher-than-average mobile phone usage, the country is also home to some of the fastest mobile broadband speeds in Africa.\n\nMobile phone adoption in Kenya opened access to on-demand content via platforms like Youtube and Facebook. Before this, the nation\u2019s airwaves were more competitive than ever, forcing users to prioritise watch time.\n\n\u201c[It] has made it easier for people to access content anytime, anywhere. They don\u2019t have to be at home to watch certain TV shows. They can come back and watch. And if it\u2019s live, you can post it later,\u201d said Butita in an interview with TechCabal.\n\nThe flexibility viewers have to watch what they want when they want has the ability to extend the shelf life of content, opening the door for brand deals and collaborations for Kenyan comics\u2014an income stream that didn\u2019t always exist.\n\n\u201cPreviously you had to wait to perform or be featured in a movie. But now, you get a brand deal that gives you $10,000, $20,000 or $5,000 just to shoot content and do product placement,\u201d Butita said.\n\nBut Butita\u2019s collaboration with Netflix wasn\u2019t as simple as product placement. The process of translating and recording a dub from English to Swahili, for a US comedy show, was one that involved new levels of creativity and innovation, forcing Butita to ask himself \u201cSanifu or Sheng?\u201d\n\nLocalising Swahili\n\nSwahili is a regional language spoken throughout East Africa and it takes on different forms in each country.\n\nSanifu Swahili or \u201cproper Swahili\u201d is a term used to describe Swahili spoken in the standard form. Standard Swahili is spoken widely in Tanzania and on Kenya\u2019s coast, but in Nairobi, the language has taken on a new life. In the multicultural environment that is the Kenyan capital, a Swahili- and English-based slang called Sheng is spoken among the youth. The urban language has become popular enough for Butita to consider its use in his translations.\n\nBut Butita wanted to make sure that the comedy translated in his dubs could be felt by Swahili speakers across the world.\n\n\u201cI did some lines more than five or 10 times because you rewrite the sentence, it becomes funny, but now you feel like it\u2019s funny to just you because there\u2019s something you understand that other people might not understand. So you change the line. When you\u2019re recording again, you get a different feeling because of the cultural diversity that\u2019s there.\u201d\n\nROI on Local Content\n\nButita\u2019s dubbing and development of The Upshaws is nothing short of revolutionary, but one has to wonder if Netflix\u2019s Kenya-play will be the one that wins the game.\n\nAlthough Netflix is offering a free, limited mobile plan for Kenyan users in the short term, the viewer is still responsible for footing the data cost required to use the streaming service.\n\nMobile broadband speed in Kenya may be high, but the cost of data is high as well. According to the Worldwide Mobile Data Pricing (2021) report from Cable, a British technology research firm, Kenya takes the lead as the most expensive country for mobile data in East Africa. Viewing one hour of Netflix content on low resolution (480p) uses 300 MB of data per hour; in high resolution (1080p), Netflix uses 3 GB per hour. At an average cost of $1.05 per GB of data, Netflix viewers in Kenya stand to pay anywhere from $0.32 to $3.15 to watch a one-hour show.\n\nOn top of high data costs, Netflix will, in order to retain Kenyans\u2019 attention, eventually have to pivot to local content instead of dubs alone. The streaming giant has already done this with some success in South Africa, with shows like the teen drama, Blood and Water.\n\nBut in Kenya, content creation has been somewhat hampered by the low return on investment on original content due, in part, to the difficulty creators face finding fair-priced outlets to screen their content allowing them to recoup funds.\n\nGlobally Competitive Content\n\nMaybe this is where Netflix plans to make an intervention with streaming services. Netflix is a global platform that allows viewers to tap into content from any country at any time. The overnight success of the South Korean film, Squid Game, showed us just how successful well-made local content, that does not come from the West, can be. But, Korea\u2019s success in film and television has been hard-won through more than 40 years of carefully mobilized political and financial resources. It\u2019s paid off, in 2020 the nation\u2019s film industry was valued at around $884,229,150.\n\nIn markets like Kenya, where the culture of content creation is still growing, Netflix will have to spend more time and money developing local content that pops.\n\n\u201cIf we have platforms willing to purchase the content and make the returns be meaningful to creators, that means more content can come out and more people [can] get opportunities,\u201d Butita said.\n\nThere are signs that Netflix is already taking steps to make this happen. Netflix teamed up with UNESCO to fund six young creators in sub-Saharan Africa to develop six short films that reimagine folktales, set to be released in 2022.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nShare this article\n\nAlexandria Williams | Author @alexandriasahai",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs I spoke with Charles Isidi \u2014 a growth marketing expert and digital media and marketing communications professional \u2014 over the phone, both of us stuttering to varying degrees as we discussed stuttering, words from a 2001 R&B song came back to me.\n\nWithout bogging you down with details, the chorus goes, \u201cI can tell you\u2019re lying, because when you\u2019re replying, stutter, stutters, stutter, stutters.\u201d\n\nLovers of R&B know that in the rest of the song, Joseph Lewis Thomas, known mononymously as Joe, suspected his partner was cheating on him. Yes, he smelt cologne. Yes, she didn\u2019t pick up when he called. But, his strongest point was that she stuttered when answering his questions about her whereabouts.\n\nAnd therein lies a major misconception: people stutter when they are lying. Twenty-one years later, the chorus of that song still forms the basis of many people\u2019s interactions with stutterers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs someone with a slight stutter, I\u2019d be irked if people conclude I\u2019m fibbing because I can\u2019t get my words out coherently or quickly enough (for them). And I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone.\n\nSadly, being branded a liar because of a stutter is just one of the issues we stutterers face.\n\nStuttering in a tech-enabled world\n\nOne can be forgiven for thinking that there is a tech solution somewhere that does away with stuttering. Stuttering has no known cure, and the best technology can currently do is what therapy does \u2014 treat or manage the condition like other speech defects.\n\nPeople can get the most out of treatment if they address stuttering early enough \u2014 preferably as children. Treatment at any age seeks to improve speech fluency while simultaneously building the stutterer\u2019s confidence, thus helping them participate in school, work, and social settings.\n\nExpectedly, tech interventions exist, with many applications \u2014 Balbus Speech, Smarty Ears, and Stamurai (I like this name), to mention a few \u2014 for smartphones and tablets to help people with stuttering.\n\nStamurai, for instance, is a mobile app available on Google Play Store and the App Store. With the app, people learn and practice speech therapy exercises for stuttering. The best result they can get, however, is improved speech control.\n\nIn a world where social media is the go-to for content, many creators generate content from people\u2019s challenges for their jokes. Mildly put, this is insensitive and hurtful, and Charles strongly believes that people should be kinder to not only stutterers but everyone dealing with a disability.\n\nNumbers don\u2019t lie\n\nAccording to The Stuttering Foundation, stuttering affects 1% of the world\u2019s population; depending on what global population you accept, that\u2019s 78 or 79 million people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer a paper on the International Stuttering Association website titled, Increasing Stuttering Awareness in Africa, 11% of children in Africa \u2014 nearly 6.5 million \u2014 of pre-school age (between 2 and 5 years of age) stutter. About 20% or 1.3 million of these children are at the risk of developing chronic stuttering in adult life, and approximately one million school-age children and over ten million adults stutter in Africa.\n\nScience trumps mythology\n\nAcross Africa, traditional beliefs about stuttering abound, varying from one location to the next.\n\nIn South Africa, for instance, stuttering is believed to result from leaving a baby out in the rain, failing to inform ancestors of imminent childbirth, emotional trauma, and tickling a baby too much, among others.\n\nThe remedies for stuttering in these circles border on the hilarious, from standing in front of a mirror and speaking to oneself, to eating a fruit pecked by a bird, and maintaining correct posture, to mention a few.\n\nThankfully, science has provided clarity \u2014 for those ready to accept it \u2014 about the causes of stuttering.\n\nAccording to DoSomething.org, stuttering (or stammering, if you will) is a speech disorder that breaks up a speaker\u2019s flow of speech. A biological and neurological condition, it is caused by one or more of four possible triggers, the first being genetics, and the others, child development, the make-up of the brain, and family dynamics.\n\nFor some reason, stuttering is more common in boys than girls. Consequently, it tends to persist into adulthood more often in boys.\n\nOngoing research shows that people who stutter appear to process speech and language differently than those who don\u2019t. And while children with speech problems or developmental delays are more likely to stutter, strokes and traumatic brain injuries can also contribute to stuttering in adults.\n\nIt would be remiss of me to proceed without stating that proponents of traditional African ideologies about stuttering are right about emotional trauma having an impact; however, they\u2019d probably struggle to explain how. But science has shown that families with fast-paced lifestyles, high expectations, and emotional trauma often have stutterers.\n\nBeyond words; into the mind\n\nOther physical senses somewhat compensate for the loss of any sense, and so the blind, for instance, have keener senses of smell and hearing.\n\nPeople who struggle to speak often fill the vocal expression gap with writing, artwork, and other predominantly non-vocal forms of communication. Mostly, however, writing does it.\n\nFun fact: Isaac Newton stuttered throughout his life.\n\nFor Charles, who has stuttered for as long as he can remember, writing as early as seven has been a valuable alternative to sharing his experiences and documenting his thoughts.\n\nSpeaking about misconceptions he\u2019s had to deal with, he said, \u201cGrowing up in a country like Nigeria where people don\u2019t approach stuttering from a scientific point of view, you either get pity from people, or they assume you have anger issues.\u201d\n\nChioma, a recent mass communications graduate, shares Charles\u2019 thoughts.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learnt over time that I\u2019m okay; there\u2019s nothing incredibly wrong with me.\u201d\n\nPutting it succinctly, Charles said, \u201cstutterers are simply audibly different from other people, and that shouldn\u2019t be an indictment on capability or anything else for that matter,\u201d and with the right support systems in place from people, workspaces, and other social touchpoints, they can control their stutters, but even more, feel safe to be someone who stutters.\n\n\u201cHaving understanding parents helped me a lot; they shielded me from people who had the worst to say about me. The support of my extended relatives was also a good thing,\u201d he continued.\n\nAnother misconception people have is that stutterers bottle things up and are impatient. So they are often encouraged to speak up.\n\nHolders of the belief that stutterers don\u2019t know what they want to say often complete their sentences for them, suggesting words and phrases that they think express the thoughts in the speakers\u2019 minds. Interestingly, they are not always right, and Charles couldn\u2019t agree more.\n\n\u201cGrowing up, my parents never completed my sentences; they were always patient enough for me to get my words out. But in my experience as an adult, people try to finish my sentences or, as they think they\u2019re doing, help me out.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfair to do this because you\u2019re more or less saying \u2018I\u2019m helping you because you\u2019re incapable of doing this on your own,\u2019 and that\u2019s not true. All that\u2019s required of listeners is a bit of patience.\u201d\n\nResearch by Leila Cherif and other members of the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Hedi Chaker Hospital and University of Sfax, Tunisia, shows that \u201cstuttering children (SC) are perceived negatively by peers and are rejected by peers more often than children who do not stutter. SC are often exposed to negative social experiences with both their peers and families such [as] teasing and bullying. These problems interfere negatively with self-esteem (SE) development and anxiety levels.\u201d\n\nConsequently, stutterers\u2019 personalities are shaped by their experiences and interactions with people wherever they go.\n\n\u201cStuttering has shaped my personality; I\u2019m reserved, and I don\u2019t say anything around strangers unless it\u2019s necessary because I don\u2019t like being asked to repeat myself. It\u2019s hard to express my feelings, so, rather than talk, I write down my thoughts,\u201d Chioma submitted.\n\nBeing sensitive to the issues people face is a no-brainer, yes? Unfortunately, it isn\u2019t in some circles.\n\nA very Nigerian challenge is comedians joking about people\u2019s speech difficulties, such that rather than being given room for expression, they become the butt of jokes.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just the comedians; the audiences who find these jokes funny are the people with whom stutterers have to interact daily during their commutes, at work, at home, everywhere.\n\nRegardless of what they say, no one likes to be laughed at. So I was not surprised at how emphatically Chioma responded when asked if she would be open to trying out something to help with her stuttering.\n\n\u201cABSOLUTELY, I would like to speak without it looking like I have hot yam in my mouth.\u201d\n\nCharles, however, had different thoughts.\n\n\u201cA philosophy in support circles is do not do anything for anyone that they are capable of doing for themselves, it\u2019s a form of theft of people\u2019s responsibilities.\n\n\u201cAt this point in my life, having a speech defect is an important structure around which my life is built. I won\u2019t exactly say that taking that away is wrong. Stuttering or any disability adds to a person\u2019s humanity in a sense, and I don\u2019t know what kind of world we would have if we cannot feel the way others feel.\n\n\u201cTo take away a disability from someone who has likely lived this way all their lives is to level the playing field for them knowing that they didn\u2019t start the race at the same time. And I think that\u2019s unfair.\n\n\u201cInstead of taking it away with tech or medical intervention, I\u2019d rather create a world where people are kinder to those who function differently from how people typically act.\u201d\n\nInternational Stuttering Awareness Day (ISAD), or International Stammering Awareness Day, is a day set aside to raise awareness of the issues faced by millions of people who stutter or stammer. It is celebrated annually on October 22.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrecious Mogoli Website I love love and a little peace and quiet.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
          "summary": "Stuttering in a tech-enabled worldOne can be forgiven for thinking that there is a tech solution somewhere that does away with stuttering.\nStuttering has no known cure, and the best technology can currently do is what therapy does \u2014 treat or manage the condition like other speech defects.\nPeople can get the most out of treatment if they address stuttering early enough \u2014 preferably as children.\nNumbers don\u2019t lieAccording to The Stuttering Foundation, stuttering affects 1% of the world\u2019s population; depending on what global population you accept, that\u2019s 78 or 79 million people.\n\u201cStuttering has shaped my personality; I\u2019m reserved, and I don\u2019t say anything around strangers unless it\u2019s necessary because I don\u2019t like being asked to repeat myself.",

In 2021, over 1 million people registered to take the Joint Admission Matriculation Board (JAMB) exams in Nigeria. This is a compulsory test that determines qualification for entrance into a Nigerian university. But, it continues.\n\nAfter JAMB, students undergo another test from their chosen universities. These processes are one-off. If they don\u2019t pass, most young people have to reapply the following year. Some schools have the direct entry option but with the same level of uncertainty\u2014the ones who can leave the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis cycle thrives because of low spending power, lack of options, and the tendency to acknowledge skill or relevance based on a university degree. This lack of degree options and the scarcity of developers is what TalentQL is looking to solve with AltSchool.\n\nFounded by Adewale Yusuf, Opeyemi Awoyemi, and Akintunde Sultan, TalentQL launched in November 2020 as a talent pipeline to connect developers with jobs. On Thursday, October 21, 2021, AltSchool was launched.\n\nWhat is AltSchool? It is a 9-month mentorship and upskilling program to train entry-level developers. Open to everyone above age 16, no technical background is required. Participants receive a diploma in Software Engineering and a three-month internship opportunity upon completion.\n\nThere\u2019s more: TalentQL launches AltSchool Africa to train entry level tech talent for free\n\nSo you care about your privacy?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto Credit: Visual Content Flickr via Compfight cc\n\nUnder the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR) 2019, all citizens have several rights over their personal data.

Small and medium enterprises in Nigeria, however, need even more applause.\n\nIn a country where everything from infrastructure to capital is a struggle, it takes a lot of grit, unusual strength, and patience to run a business.\n\nEnter BIZ301. With two decades of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) experience, Toyin Akintayo acutely understands this struggle. And with the help of his team, he decided to build BIZ301 to help entrepreneurs digitise small businesses operations.\n\nThink of a platform that manages expenses and budgets, invoices, employee and payroll management, helpdesk, and facility management applications. For as low as \u20a61000 a month, users can access all this on BIZ301.\n\nCurious?

On Thursday, October 21, 2021, Brass, a Nigerian digital bank, announced $1.7 million in funding to aid their growth across Africa. The raise saw participation from US-based early-stage investors, Hustle Funds, Acuity Ventures, Ventures Platform, and Uncovered Fund.\n\nProminent ecosystem individuals like Flutterwave\u2019s Co-founder, Olugbenga \u2018GB\u2019 Agboola, and Paystack\u2019s Co-founder, Ezra Olubi, also participated in this round.\n\nWhat does Brass do? Sola Akindolu, ex-Head of Products at Nigerian fintech, Kudi, and Emmanuel Okeke, ex-Engineering Manager at Paystack, launched Brass in July 2020 to provide SMEs with banking services and help business owners have control over their money operations.\n\nCurrently, the platform provides SMEs with various services, including payroll and expense management, credit and payment services, and API support.\n\nBrass has reportedly served thousands of businesses from schools to restaurants and malls, with a customer portfolio that includes platforms like Mono and Eden.\n\nThey claim to have disbursed $2 million in credit via their crediting platform, Brass Capital, which is still in the Beta phase.\n\nWhere are the funds going? With this raise, the startup is looking to scale and improve upon its products. Already, they have completed incorporation in Kenya and are looking to do the same in South Africa. By 2022, they want to launch in both countries fully.\n\nThe big picture is to develop innovative products that offer all-inclusive banking solutions in Africa.\n\nNeobanks spree? With the number of Business to Customers (B2C), and Business to Business (B2B) neobanks like PayHippo, Prospa, and Sparkle already offering similar services, one wonders what makes Brass different. Per TechCrunch, Akindolu shares that the company\u2019s focus is financial operations and cash flow support for SMEs.\n\nIn case you missed it on Techpoint Africa\n\nTechpoint Awards 2021: Nominate your favourite startups, influencers, and investors.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, October 6, 2021, the BBC Insider Series hosted a few players in Africa\u2019s fintech sector during a panel discussion to discuss strides made by the sector to aid innovation and financial inclusion in Africa.\n\nModerated by BBC presenter, Zeinab Badawi, the panel had Olugbenga Agboola, founder and CEO of Flutterwave, Usoro Usoro, CEO, Y\u2019ello Digital Financial Services, MTN\u2019s fintech subsidiary, Bola Asiru, Principal/Divisional Lead, sub-Saharan Africa for Mastercard Advisors, and Yasmin Masithela, Managing Executive, Transactional Banking, Absa Corporate and Investment Banking.\n\nThe virtual event focused on fintech\u2019s allure to investors, the benefits Africans derive from fintech start-ups, partnerships between banks and fintech startups, and the role of regulators in the industry.\n\nDiscussing fintech\u2019s attractiveness to investors, the panelists were unanimous in their agreement that the scale of opportunity available to players in the fintech industry was a big factor in why investors are taken in by fintech.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the Mastercard Foundation, as of 2017, about 43% of people living in sub-Saharan Africa were financially included. This presents a huge opportunity for investors and entrepreneurs willing to look beyond the myriad of challenges that they are sure to face to build solutions.\n\nHowever, for Usoro, beyond the scale, the unserved segment of the market represents a huge opportunity as well. \u201cWhen we look at the market segment, you look at a lot of people that are unserved and when you look at the served segment, they\u2019re still lots of people that have not adopted the services. So it\u2019s both scale and the fact that a lot of people are still unserved that makes the market very attractive.\u201d\n\nWith the speed of innovation and execution exhibited by fintech, arguments have been made regarding fintech\u2019s potential to replace traditional banks. However, Agboola disagreed with that view, arguing that he sees a situation where fintech complement the works that banks do and vice versa, advocating for partnerships between banks and fintech.\n\nEven with the gains recorded, there is still a long way to go for fintech to plug the gaps in financial inclusion in Africa. For this Usoro argued that fintech in addition to providing a huge opportunity for investors also do good in the communities where they operate. \u201cIt\u2019s commercially attractive to investors but it also does some social good.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cWith the kind of services that we offer to customers, whether it\u2019s those micro-loans that enable SMEs to access inventory on daily basis, a lot of these services actually transform the lives of our customers.\u201d He added that with innovations in USSD technology and the adoption of agent banking networks, fintech are able to make it easier for most users to access financial services.\n\nDeepening financial inclusion is high on the agenda of Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank and Y\u2019ello Digital Financial Services has been playing its part in helping the apex realize this goal. With its wide network of over 150,000 MoMo agents, the organization offers financial services to customers.\n\nCustomers can pay bills, deposit and withdraw cash, as well as purchase data and airtime from agents. Through partnerships with over 40 banks and financial institutions in the country, customers can access funds in their accounts without using an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) in a secure manner.\n\nWith 54 countries in Africa, providing financial services to users comes with lots of regulatory hurdles in each country. However, startups need to build services for users regardless. Usoro stated that being able to build solutions that allow for these differences could fix these challenges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAt the technology and fintech level, the ability for us to build an interoperable switch to allow multi-currencies, multi-wallets, to speak to each other seamlessly may be one of the things we need to do to fix that hurdle.\u201d\n\nSome may argue that there are too many players in Africa\u2019s fintech sector but with the scale of the problem, there might be a need for more players to throw their hats in the ring to solve some of the problems.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Guyana, a tiny South American country, is attracting fresh private capital on oil and gas assets to develop critical infrastructure across its local economy, whereas Africa\u2019s biggest oil producer is struggling to attract private capital to build its energy sector.\n\nUnlike Nigeria, who squandered its 1981 oil boom, Guyana, South America\u2019s third tiniest oil country with a population of about 780,000, is bracing up for an oil boom that could catapult it to the top of the continent\u2019s rich list and ensure that its newfound riches benefit all Guyanese.\n\nBut history carries a warning for Guyana. The discovery of big oil in other developing nations like Nigeria has exacerbated existing corruption, leading to the new oil wealth being squandered and stolen \u2013 being known as the oil curse.\n\nTo avoid the \u2018oil curse,\u2019 Guyana is looking beyond the oil export revenues from the Exxon-operated projects off its shores. The country is attracting private capital to large oil and gas discoveries to build up an economy powered by its own energy resources.\n\nThis summer, the government of Guyana said it was looking for partners to invest in a $900-million gas-to-energy project for a natural gas pipeline from one of its most valuable oil fields, the Liza onshore.\n\nRead Also: Nigeria\u2019s oil industry faces another difficult year in 2021, says Platt\n\nThe planned 225-kilometre (140 miles) pipeline from the Liza area to the Wales Development Zone (WDZ) is expected to feed a gas processing plant and a natural gas liquids (NGL) facility, capable of producing at least 4,000 barrels per day, including the fractionation of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG).\n\nA power plant with a total capacity to generate 300 megawatts (MW) of electricity and an industrial park that could use gas, steam and/or electricity are also part of the gas-to-energy project.\n\n\u201cGuyana needs to convert its abundant resources. We need you. We welcome you, and we urge you to remember the name Guyana and to keep the name Guyana in your plans for growth and development, both in country and by businesses and sectors,\u201d Peter Ramsaroop, CEO at Guyana\u2019s government agency GoInvest told Bloomberg on the sidelines of the Dubai Expo.\n\n\u201cGuyana must have the gas and hydropower to be able to bring a competitive economy to the point where we can depend on our own energy to deliver our goods and services,\u201d Ramsaroop said.\n\nExxon, for its part, \u201cexpects to make significant progress over the next few years in cooperation with the Government of Guyana to advance a gas-to-energy project,\u201d the supermajor told Bloomberg in a statement.\n\nGuyana\u2019s government bets on the project, which it expects will come on stream by late 2024, to more than halve its electricity costs, seen by the private sector as prohibitive to investment in the country, the South American nation said.\n\nThe government expects the gas-to-energy project to revolutionise and significantly improve the ease of doing business in Guyana, it said in July.\n\nThe gas from the recent massive oil discoveries could transform Guyana\u2019s economic fortunes forever.\n\nWhile Guyana is not only growing its economy but also making plans to further increase its oil production per person by having a favourable attractive investment condition, Nigeria is still battling insecurities, hostility from host communities, increasing cost of oil and gas projects and unfavourable government policies all of which are making it more expensive for IOCs to operate.\n\nAnalysts say Nigeria does not appear a good investment destination compared with advanced countries at the moment, despite its status as a frontier market with growth potentials and market accessibility.\n\nAccording to a global investment trends monitor report released by the United Nations\u2019 Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflow hit $2.6 billion in 2020, the lowest since 2005.\n\nUnlike Guyana, Nigeria remains \u201cExhibit A\u201d of the so-called resource curse, particularly when you split its oil production across the population.\n\nNiyi Awodeyi, CEO at Subterra Energy Resources Limited, says Nigeria\u2019s oil production per head has been in a miserable state in the last 10 years.\n\nDespite huge oil reserves, Nigeria has the 19th lowest production per capita among top 20 oil-producing countries in the world; the country produces less than a barrel per 100 people, only China produces lower at 1/3 of a barrel per person.\n\nIn comparing this to the Gulf States, widely accepted to be the most oil-rich in the world, Saudi Arabia produces about 28 barrels per 100 people; Kuwait produces 60 barrels per 100 people, while UAE produces 32 barrels per 100 people.\n\nAlthough Nigeria produces the most oil in Africa, it also underperforms against its African peers with regards to per capita production; it produces less oil per person than Angola and Algeria.\n\n\u201cNigeria is not expanding its oil potential despite having an expanding population,\u201d Awodeyi notes.\n\nSome experts have recommended that for Nigeria to turn the tide against its declining oil and gas investments there must be deliberate multi-agency efforts to bring about needed reforms. But the efforts must start with bringing credibility to both fiscal and monetary policies.\n\nThe government\u2019s many failings with attracting foreign direct investment, most especially in the oil and gas sector, have meant Nigerians have grown poorer as economic growth is slower than population growth.",
          "summary": "Guyana, a tiny South American country, is attracting fresh private capital on oil and gas assets to develop critical infrastructure across its local economy, whereas Africa\u2019s biggest oil producer is struggling to attract private capital to build its energy sector.\nTo avoid the \u2018oil curse,\u2019 Guyana is looking beyond the oil export revenues from the Exxon-operated projects off its shores.\nThe country is attracting private capital to large oil and gas discoveries to build up an economy powered by its own energy resources.\nUnlike Guyana, Nigeria remains \u201cExhibit A\u201d of the so-called resource curse, particularly when you split its oil production across the population.\nNiyi Awodeyi, CEO at Subterra Energy Resources Limited, says Nigeria\u2019s oil production per head has been in a miserable state in the last 10 years.",

          "text": "The Nigerian economy will create more wealth for its 200 million people by changing its approach to trade and focusing more on exports, according to Ogho Okiti, a doctoral degree holder in Economics from the University of Manchester, U.K and Managing Director of BusinessDay Media.\n\nAccording to Okiti, rather than focus solely on producing to meet local demand, the government should incentivise local businesses to serve the international community in order to earn much-needed foreign exchange and trigger wealth creation.\n\n\u201cIf we got 10 companies in Nigeria and asked them to produce for the international community, it would translate to higher foreign exchange earnings for Nigeria and create more wealth locally,\u201d Okiti said.\n\nOkiti questioned Nigeria\u2019s obsession with producing for home when wealthy nations in Europe and Asia are concerned about what they can produce for others.\n\n\u201cCountries don\u2019t prosper because they feed themselves, they prosper because they exchange,\u201d Okiti, who was speaking at the Think Business conference, said.\n\nNigeria is home to the world\u2019s largest number of poor people, with 87 million people according to a Brookings Institution report, the populations of Spain and Canada combined.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari is keen to grow the economy and create wealth for the vast majority of Nigerians through agriculture after many years of oil dependence. Buhari\u2019s agriculture policy thrust is centred around the country feeding itself when the actual focus should be more on producing to feed the outside world.\n\nRead Also: How Nigeria exports wealth, jobs through its raw materials\n\nCritics say Buhari has a penchant for running a closed economy that does not prioritise trading with the outside. In 2019, he shut the land borders for nearly two years to curb smuggling even when it was hurting exporters.\n\n\u201cPolicies that make an economy open to trade and investment with the rest of the world are needed for sustained economic growth,\u201d IMF economists said in a report as far back as 2011.\n\n\u201cThe evidence on this is clear. No country in recent decades has achieved economic success, in terms of substantial increases in living standards for its people, without being open to the rest of the world,\u201d the IMF said.\n\nNigeria needs to boost economic growth and improve living standards now more than ever. Average incomes have contracted every year since 2015, according to data by the government data agency, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).\n\nWhile global incomes have tripled since 1960, Nigeria\u2019s average income has only grown by 0.5 percent, according to Okiti, a reflection of the poor living standards in the country.\n\nIn the last five years alone, the economy has contracted twice, 2016 and 2020. The first contraction was caused by a sharp decline in oil prices, while the second was induced by the COVID-19 pandemic which yet again caused a sharp dip in oil prices.\n\nThe IMF and Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) see the Nigerian economy recovering next year on the back of higher oil prices and improved production, however that recovery is tipped to fizzle out by 2025 as oil prices begin to cool.\n\nOkiti said the pre-pandemic condition of Nigeria already means it will be difficult for the country to see sustained recovery without addressing underlying issues from rising poverty to escalating debt levels and high unemployment.",

The panel has done its work and submitted its report.\n\n\u201cIn summary, 117 petitions were received, 25 of them were struck out while 10 were dismissed. The panel recommended compensation to be paid to victims totaling N190 million, while the amount of judgment sum recommended being enforced was N98 million. I have accepted that we will pay those who were victims; we are not waiting for anybody, not even the Federal Government.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere should be a regular promotion for the police when it\u2019s due, enforcement of welfare package, training and re-training of police officers, upward review of salaries, yearly mental evaluation and quarterly tests for hard drugs,\u201d the governor added.\n\nReassuring that his administration will do all within its power to implement the 15 recommendations of the panel, Obaseki said Edo youths are the greatest resources of the state.\n\nHe noted that the panel also recommended that youths should be encouraged in the area of agriculture, entrepreneurship, empowerment, girl-child education, provision of annual state scholarship, and building recreation centres, among others.\n\nObaseki said the government has provided opportunities for Edo youths in the last five years with the deliberate emphasis on youth empowerment, adding, \u201cWhat we have done with primary one to six, through the EdoBEST programme, is going to be extended to junior secondary schools, placing emphasis on practical training at the junior level.\n\n\u201cWe are working out scholarship schemes and students\u2019 low-interest arrangements to enable our students to have cheap interest loans to go to school. We are rebuilding our School of Nursing, School of Agriculture, and College of Education. This is to ensure the training of a new generation of teachers.\u201d\n\nThe governor also gave paid N1 million naira each to two victims of the EndSARS protests, Ohima Steven and Miracle Ailenokhoria, promising to pay for their continuous treatment.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe two young men brought here today as victims of the EndSARS protest will get N1 million naira each to ease their pains. I am working with the Commissioner for Health to pay for their continuous treatment.\u201d\n\nThe youths in their response, hailed the governor, promising to work with his government in the realization of the Making Edo Great Again (MEGA) agenda.\n\nA representative of the youths, Solomon Idiogbe, commended Obaseki for improved security across the state, urging him to engage more youths as a means of checking cultism in Edo State.\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, on Friday, charged the judiciary to speed up the process of justice delivery on cases of sexual and gender-based violence, noting that the conviction of more offenders will serve as a deterrent to others who might have the intention of committing the same crimes.\n\nObaseki gave the charge at a one-day sensitization and capacity building workshop on Gender-Based Violence (GBV) for High Court Judges and judicial officers in Edo State, held in Benin City.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cFor us in Edo, we consider gender-based violence as serious, which is why from the onset of our government we made a commitment to protecting the rights of vulnerable persons in our state.\n\n\u201cWe saw a tremendous increase in gender-based violence during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, and this has prompted us to increase our actions in tackling the issue of abuses.\u201d\n\nHe noted, \u201cThe gruesome murder of Uwaila Omozuwa was a wake-up call for us. As a government, we couldn\u2019t just sit and allow our society to accept such conduct. It is our collective responsibility to drive the desired changes that are required to ensure that we have a society that is free of violence, particularly gender-based violence.\n\n\u201cThe Judiciary is a very critical arm of government; you must play a very active role in addressing these challenges. We must get a lot more convictions because it\u2019s only convictions that serve as a deterrent to the abuse of persons.\n\n\u201cWe have worked with our lawmakers to update our statues to meet our present-day challenges, and are very much aware and understand the tasks ahead in establishing synergy and ensuring policy consistency across our three arms of government, as part of the efforts that we must understand to rein in offenders.\u201d\n\nReassuring the government\u2019s commitment to protecting the girl-child in the state, the governor stated, \u201cIn Edo, our commitment to address gender-based violence or violence against persons has been demonstrated as we are one of the first states in Nigeria to sign the Violence Against Persons (VAP) Bill into law.\n\n\u201cWe have launched a sexual offenders\u2019 register which serves as a tool to shame all those persons who have been convicted in gender-based violence. We have linked our register with that of the national register. We are driven by the need to ensure that those who perpetrate gender-based violence are apprehended and made to face justice strictly.\u201d\n\nObaseki further noted, \u201cIt is important to note that Edo has established the Sexual Assault Referral Centre which is named after a girl, Vivian Ogu, whose life was cut short by criminals who tried to rape her, years ago. Addressing the menace of sexual-based violence has to be holistic and thorough.\n\n\u201cYou are all gathered here today because we want you to take charge of this mandate. We are lucky in Edo because the majority of our judges are women, so we do not have to preach to the converted.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the wife of Edo Governor, Mrs. Betsy Obaseki, who is the Chairperson of the Edo State Gender-Based Violence Management Committee, reiterated the need for more convictions in support of the government\u2019s fight against gender-based violence in the state.\n\nShe noted, \u201cLet us all be committed and take all we have learned from the workshop seriously and put them into practice, and taking our work to the international high level. At the end of the day, we want to see more convictions.\n\n\u201cThe governor has assured us of providing requisites; we need to build new courthouses and a special courthouse for gender-based violence, with special judges assigned to these courts.\u201d\n\nIn her welcome remarks, Ms. Comfort Lamptey, United Nations (UN) Women Representative to Nigeria and Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), who spoke via zoom, described the judiciary as crucial in ensuring access to justice for women and girls.\n\nLamptey further applauded the state government\u2019s commitment to ensuring access to justice for all, especially for women and girls in Edo.\n\n...",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nThe erstwhile National Secretary of the People\u2019s Democratic Party, PDP, Professor Wale Oladiipo has said he received with shock, the news that he had not been cleared to contest for the position of Deputy National Chairman (south) by the Screening Committee of the party, blaming same on what he described as observable shenanigans by some \u201cinterested powers\u201d that were afraid of his electoral value at the National Convention.\n\nOladipo said the powerful forces caused a frivolous petition to be written and submitted concerning his activities during the unfortunate crisis that engulfed the party more than five years ago.\n\nAccording to him, the content of the hatchet job remains hazy but the little the people know purportedly hinges on the past crisis that the party passed through then.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is funny and extremely absurd that three petitions can be written by the same person, using the same address and same word processing machine on three different aspirants from Osun, Ondo and Anambra States!!! What a tragic comedy! The petition was not made available to me before decision was taken.\n\n\u201d However, throughout the duration of the avoidable crises, l served our party with dignity and kept my mind fixated on how the party will progress therefrom.\n\n\u201cWhen the final decision was made, l abided by it and stayed by the party which consequently made us deliver on our mandate.\n\n\u201cAt this juncture, it is expediently necessary to reiterate the following facts in sequence order to refresh your memory regarding my activities this far thus:\n\n(1) That when l was the National Secretary, l was never found wanting, but rather performed my duties without blemish up to the point of my exit.\n\n(2) That l have thereafter been performing my roles in terms of responsibilities and privileges.\n\nI have diligently been discharging my responsibilities as a member of NEC of our great party and BoT. I am also a proud member of both the Convention Committee and the PDP e-registration Committee.\n\n(3) That l am also pleased to say that l have been delivering my constituencies constantly to the party.\n\nI have never decamped to any other party or sabotage the interests of the party in any form.\n\n(4) That l have never left the party.\n\nIt is therefore funny that those who walked out of convention when we had a sitting President are cleared to contest. To me, this is most abnormal and unfair\u201d\n\n\u201d Even then, every power is temporary.bThose who have power today should be conscious of the fact that some people had it yesterday while some other people will still have that power tomorrow. Power is transient like the effervescence of soda.\n\n\u201cHaving the conviction that there will always be a tomorrow, l am not going to bother myself to push this case further beyond this point because l believe in our own course which is first and foremost, to deliver Osun State to PDP and from there to move on as a committed party faithful.\n\n\u201cThough I have a right of appeal, and to seek redress within the confines of the internal mechanism of the party\u2019s constitution, but l am not a desperate politician to go that route since the \u201cpower that be today\u201d have apparently decided of what to achieve at the convention, l have no choice than to move on to concentrate on delivering Osun State to PDP in 2022.\n\n\u201cWe have delivered in the past and we shall continue to deliver. By the special grace of God, after delivering Osun State to PDP, we will be back stronger and higher\u201d\n\nThe member of Board of Trustee of PDP urged the people to be cool and calm and not be discouraged or distracted from the task of delivering Osun for PDP in all our future elections beginning from the 2022 governorship election.",

We are supporting our primary, secondary and tertiary institutions and positioning them to compete globally. Our strategy is to commit huge financial resources into the sector, assemble the best hands to manage the institutions and partner with well-meaning citizens and friends of the State to achieve our objective.\n\n\u201cUnder this arrangement, we are renovating our schools, including technical and school for children living with disabilities, providing educational facilities and training and re-training our teachers to make them to provide top-notch services and produce competitive products.\n\n\u201cWe are also collaborating with our partners to facilitate equipment, including laboratories, research workshops and teaching hospital for our tertiary institutions as appropriate,\u201d he\n\nsaid.\n\nGovernor Oyetola also commended the organisers of the award for instituting the Obafemi Awolowo Free Education Series to interrogate and advance tangential development issues in the nation and to keep the legacy of free education alive.\n\nSpeaking on the theme of the lecture, \u201cAwolowo Legacies In Education and Policies: Enduring Lessons for Contemporary Nigeria\u201d, Chief Adebisi Akande said the late Awolowo was an exceptional model in politics whose indelible legacies in education cannot be over-emphasised.\n\nAccording to him, the late Sage believed so much in education as he, in 1952, awarded 200 scholarship to indigent students for a university education having submitted in his advocacy for mass universal education as a panacea to socioeconomic development.\n\n\u201cAwolowo left behind imperishable legacies. He believes that the man\u2019s greatest need is education. He ensured that every child must be educated. His policies were centered on education.\n\n\u201cSome of the Awolowo\u2019s imperishable legacies were his consistent advocacy for true federalism to put an end to unchecked impunity of the then rulers, he fought for the unity in diversity among Nigerians as he used his innovative tendencies in governance to impact many lives\u201d, Akande added.\n\nReceiving Governor Oyetola and other awardees, Vice Chancellor, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Prof. Eyitope Ogunbodede, lauded the Administration of Governor Oyetola for investing hugely in the education sector as manifested in the success the State had recorded so far.\n\nOgunbodede who described Oyetola as a lover of education said the award was in recognition of his tremendous contributions to educational reformation and advancement of the course of quality, functional and qualitative education in the State.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis programme is aimed to honour our own, late Obafemi Awolowo whose passion and love for education cannot be quantified. He used all the available resources to advance the education as this legacy lives till now.\n\n\u201cIt is in respect of this that we have resolved to honour this legacy. No doubt, our Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola has done so much to develop the education sector. He has done so much for the university more than expectation.\n\n\u201cYou have been so supportive. You have been coming to our aid whenever we need your support. You have been doing well. Our prayer is that God will continue to be with you and enrich you to continue to do more for the State.\u201d\n\nIn her welcome address, the Dean, Faculty of Education, Prof. Bonke Omoteso, urged the leaders and well-meaning Nigerians to support education and donate generously to the growth and development of education in the country particularly in the university.\n\nShe said: \u201cAwolowo was a man of vision and a dynamic administrator. He fought that the State resources should be channelled into education. He introduced free basic education. We enjoyed it and we are still enjoying it until today.\u201d\n\nThe representatives of the National Leader, All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu; Ekiti State Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi; Ondo State Governor, Arakunrin Rotimi Akeredolu and Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi lauded the Awolowo\u2019s enduring legacy on education.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "title": "I'm a car dealer not a terrorist: Igboho blasts Malami",
          "text": "Yoruba nation activist, Sunday Igboho has punctured the claim by Abubakar Malami, the attorney general of the Federation, that he is being sponsored by an unnamed National Assembly member.\n\nChief Yomi Alliyu, Igboho\u2019s lawyer issued a rebuttal of the claim in a statement released in Ibadan, the second of the day, on behalf Igboho.\n\nIgboho challenged Malami to mention the lawmaker sponsoring Igboho and also questioned the attempt to link Igboho with a Bureau de change operator, Abdullahi Umar, linked with Boko Haram financing.\n\n\u201cThe picture the AGF wanted to paint is that our client is being financed by Abdullah Umar, allegedly involved in terrorist financing. Who is now financing who?\u201d, said Alliyu, a senior advocate of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAgain, Chief Adeyemo is a car dealer trading in the name of Adesun International Concept Ltd.\n\n\u201cDoes it mean that anybody buying a car from him or selling a car to him is a terrorist?\n\n\u201cI challenge the Hon AGF to mention the lawmaker that sent money to Chief Sunday Adeyemo for terrorist act whether he would not be damnified in exemplary damages for defamation\u201d, Alliyu said.\n\nIn a press statement in Abuja today, Malami claimed that a report by a Federal Government inter-ministerial committee has identified an unnamed Federal lawmaker as the sponsor of Sunday Igboho\u2019s agitation for a Yoruba nation.\n\nMalami said the report, full of many holes, unravelled how Igboho got monies from 43 bank accounts, across nine banks.\n\nAt first blush, the report appears to cover Igboho\u2019s financial records long before he got involved with Yoruba nation agitation.\n\nIgboho did not get involved with agitation until early 2021.\n\nHis involvement with Igangan crisis with Fulani settlers was the immediate catalyst.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government has received the report on financiers of Adeniyi Sunday Adeyemo a.k.a Sunday Igboho\u201d, Malami said.\n\n\u201cThe report revealed that Sunday Igboho is a Director and signatory to Adesun International Concept Limited registered on 23rd April, 2010.\u201d\n\n\u201cAdesun International Concept Limited also has Oladele Oyetunji and Aderopo Adeyemo as Directors. Sunday Igboho is linked to 43 bank accounts in 9 banks.\n\n\u201cThe major financier of the fugitive and separatists was found to be a Federal Lawmaker in the National Assembly. A total sum of ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-SEVEN MILLION, ONE AND FORTY-FIVE THOUSAND NAIRA ONLY (N127, 145,000.00) was received by Igboho from his financiers between 22nd October, 2013 and 28th September, 2020 through Adesun International Concept Ltd accounts.\n\n\u201cA total sum of TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY-THREE MILLION, ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY-EIGHT THOUSAND, TWO HUNDRED NAIRA ONLY (N273,198,200.00) transaction outflows was recorded from Sunday Igboho\u2019s account between 15th March, 2013 and 11 the March, 2021.\n\n\u201cInvestigation reveals that Adesun International Concept Ltd (belonging to Igboho) transferred the sum of twelve million seven hundred and fifty thousand naira (N12, 750,000) to Abbal Bako & Sons.\n\n\u201cIt might be recalled that Abbal Bako & Sons and its promoter Abdullahi Umar Usman are suspects in the on-going Joint Terrorist Financing Investigation.\n\n\u201cAbdullahi Umar Usman is by way of financial transaction connected to SURAJO ABUBAKAR MUHAMMAD (who was sentenced to life imprisonment in UAE on charges of financing terrorism [Boko Haram]).\n\n\u201cThis report shows the nexus between separatists\u2019 agitation, terrorism financing and disruptions of peace in the country.\n\nThe report found connections of financial transaction between Adesun International Concept Ltd (belonging to Igboho) and some construction companies and businesses among others.\u201d\n\nApart from Igboho\u2019s lawyer, Alliyu, the Pan Yoruba Group, Afenifere has also dismissed Malami\u2019s report.\n\nThe group in a statement signed by its Secretary-General, Chief Sola Ebiseni, said the latest claims made by Malami indicated that the Federal Government is hell-bent on destroying Adeyemo.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government with its Attorney General, will not stop amusing themselves with illogical reasoning on the nationality question.\n\n\u201cIt is expected that the AG would be guided by the standard of a reasonable man, which is a central test in legal inquiry, before addressing the public.\n\n\u201cThis time around, the team set up by him, at a time he is hell-bent on nailing Igboho, has satisfied his emotional expectations, but in a most unreasonable and tenuous manner, by suggesting that Sunday Igboho, a Yoruba nation campaigner, would be on the same sponsorship with Boko Haram.\n\n\u201cOnly someone with pathological hatred for Igboho and insult to the Yoruba nation will find a common bed for Yoruba nation agitation and Boko Haram which is known to act in tandem with the Fulani herdsmen whose terrorist acts were responsible for Igboho\u2019s campaigns.\n\n\u201cThe whole world knows what Igboho stood and still stands for his peaceful modus operandi, in spite of the unwarranted invasion of his house which was aimed at his life by the Federal Government.\u201d\n\nHe said further that \u201cit is of amusing cruelty that the Federal Government which was unable to defend itself of terrorism against Igboho and for which it was handed N20 billion in aggravated damages, would turn around that Igboho received less than N200 million to sponsor terrorism since 2013 when Igboho had never been heard of and when Major General Muhammad Buhari, as former Military Head of State then was campaigning for the Sharia as a law of general application in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government and its security agencies should better pay the damages awarded against them, apologise to Igboho and his household for the acts of terrorism committed against the peaceful campaigner.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government may continue to play the ostrich, the whole world knows those who enacted, engineered, and continue to promote terrorism in Nigeria.\u201d",

          "text": "The Lagos State Ministry of Justice through the Directorate of Public Prosecutions (DPP) on Friday held a stakeholder\u2019s meeting to enhance and promote plea bargain and district prosecutor\u2019s scheme of the state government.\n\nThis is part of its efforts in the continuous decongestation of correctional facilities across the State and ensuring quick dispensation of justice.\n\nAddressing participants at the meeting which was an hybrid version of both physical and online, the Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Mr. Moyosore Onigbanjo (SAN) said the meeting presented an opportunity to create more awareness about the Plea Bargain and the District Prosecutors Scheme as well as a platform to receive feedback from stakeholders on how to improve and further strengthen the Plea Bargain and District Prosecutor Scheme.\n\nAccording to the Attorney General, The District Prosecutor Scheme took off in April 2020 following the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Police Prosecutors at the Magistrate Courts, chaired by Mr. Fola Arthur-Worrey (former Attorney General Ministry of Justice), to set up a review mechanism that will ensure residents are not unnecessarily detained for charges that are civil in nature.\n\n\u201cBased on these recommendations, Mr. Governors approval was sought and with the cooperation of the Lagos State Judiciary, the Ministry of Justice deployed District Prosecutor\u2019s to three (3) Magistrates Courts (Ebute-Metta. lkorodu, Ogba) to vet charges prior to filing and ensure case files submitted for remand meet the evidential threshold required by law.\n\n\u201cSeeing the huge impact of this scheme, Lagos State Government extended the services to all Magistrate Court Houses across the State\u201d. Onigbanjo said.\n\nThe commissioner also stated that plea bargain has served as an important tool to keep the wheel of justice moving in a timely and cost-effective manner as it has helped decongest the extremely congested correctional facilities in the State as available data reveals that the facilities exceed their capacity by 100% with inmates awaiting trial at 85%.\n\n\u201cTo demonstrate our commitment towards the exercise, we took plea bargain a step further about four (4) months ago, when i led a team of Lawyers to the Kirikiri Maximum Correctional Facility for a Plea Bargain sensitization exercise where more than 15 plea Bargain Agreements were executed onsite and sanctioned immediately by the Judges through Virtual Hearing\u201d.\n\nOnigbanjo reiterated the present administration\u2019s commitment to enhancing the administration of criminal justice in the State with the implementation of the use of video conferencing in criminal proceedings, magistrates visits to police stations monthly, prohibition of media parade of suspects, remote hearing, award of compensation to victims of crime, among others.\n\nHe, however, sought the continued cooperation and partnership of stakeholders to implement the laudable initiatives.\n\nThe Solicitor General and Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Justice, Ms. Titilayo Shitta-bey stated that the State Government has done a lot to improve on its administration of justice system with the various innovations designed by the state which has set the pace for other states.\n\nAccording to her, the Plea Bargain has also assisted in the decongestion of prisons and promotion of speedy dispensation of justice in Lagos State which is not restricted to particular persons but for everyone irrespective of the person\u2019s status (rich or poor/illiterate or literate), race and tribe.\n\nShe also stated that the Ministry recently introduced District Prosecutor\u2019s Scheme following the recommendation of a committee set up by the Attorney General and has created district prosecutor offices in magisterial districts in the state to screen and vet charges before cases are filed and assigned to the magistrate courts.\n\nThe Director Public Prosecution, Lagos State Ministry of Justice, Mrs Adeyinka Adeyemi noted that the essence of the workshop is to eliminate the perceived misconception on plea bargaining hence the need for the sensitisation programme of stakeholders in the legal community as well as the public.\n\nShe however reiterated that the application for plea bargaining is free while noting that over 500 applications have been reviewed and considered.\n\nThe State program coordinator of The Rule of Law and Anti-Corruption (RoLAC) program, Mrs. Ajibola Ijimakinwa noted that the body has partnered with the State\u2019s ministry of justice on plea bargain with the training of judges, magistrates and prosecutors and also the development of a plea bargain manual to sensitise lawyers and also judicial correspondents on how to report plea bargain processes and outcomes accurately.\n\nShe commended Lagos State for being a pacesetter in the administration of criminal justice system while urging other states in the federation to emulate the giant strides achieved by the State.\n\nReiterating the importance of the District Prosecutor\u2019s Scheme, a guest speaker and former Attorney General and Permanent Secretary Ministry of Justice, Mr. Fola Arthur-Worrey stated that the District Prosecutor (DP) duty is to ensure that the Attorney General prosecutorial mandate is properly represented at the district level, and that only cases that satisfy the \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d clause of the 1999 constitution and the \u201cprobable case\u201d provision of the ACJL are allowed to pass through the vetting process and end up before the magistrate for trial or remand.\n\nThis he noted will reduce the issue of congestion of cases while abuse of prosecutorial power would be checked and matters concerning actual suspects will proceed speedily.\n\nIn his submission, an Associate Professor of Public law at the University of Lagos, Dr. Akeem Bello said that one of the strategies to decongest correctional facilities is the periodic review of case dockets to identify problematic cases that may be reconsidered for plea bargaining while noting that the negative public perception about plea bargain need to be addressed through a systematic engagement and enlightenment of the public.\n\nPresent at the meeting were representatives from the Legal unit of the Nigerian Police Force, lawyers, district prosecutors, law firms, representatives from the correctional facilities in the State, amongst others.",

          "text": "The Nigerian Government has alleged that the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu is responsible for the murder of Chike Akunyili, the widower of the late Director-General of the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), Dora Akunyili.\n\nDora Akunyili was also the information minister during the tenure of the late President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua.\n\nThe claim was made by a committee set up by President Muhammadu Buhari to investigate Kanu, who is standing trial for terrorism related offences.\n\nThe committee is headed by the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, SAN.\n\nThe 24 members of the committee were drawn from the Federal Ministry of Justice (MoJ), Federal Ministry of Information (MoI), Nigeria Police Force (NPF), Department of State Services (DSS), National Intelligence Agency (NIA), and Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA).\n\nChike Akunyili, the widower of the late Prof. Dora Akunyili\u2019s was shot dead by unknown gunmen in September 2021.\n\nThe government also accused Kanu of being responsible for the murder of a former Presidential Aide, Ahmad Gulak, and over 177 other cases in the South-East.\n\nThe committee said IPOB and its military wing, the Eastern Security Network (ESN), followed Kanu\u2019s directives and carried out massive attacks on democratic institutions, especially facilities of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), intending to hamper the democratic process in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to the report, the attacks that were carried out between October 2020 and June 2021 led to the killing of 175 security personnel.\n\nThe report read in part, \u201cActing on the instigating directives of Nnamdi Kanu, IPOB members and #EndSARS protesters attacked and killed many security agents, destroyed several public and private properties, including police stations, public transport buses and other facilities across the country.\n\n\u201cThat on October 21, 2020, Nnamdi Kanu through an online call-in radio programme (Radio Biafra), further instigated IPOB members to burn down all police stations and kill government security forces, which was carried out, and security personnel (especially police officers) were killed and public and private properties destroyed.\n\n\u201cThat 175 security personnel were killed by IPOB/ESN, comprising 128 policemen, 37 military personnel and 10 other security operatives. Killing of prominent Nigerians: Recently there were gruesome killings of traditional leaders: Obi 1 of Okwudor autonomous community, Eze E. AnayochukwuDurueburuo and Eze Sampson Osunwa of Ihebineowerre autonomous community as well as the killings of Dr. Chike Akunyili and eight others as well as the killing of Alhaji Ahmed Gulak on May 30, 2021.\u201d\n\nThe committee alleged that Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s broadcasts led to 19 attacks on INEC facilities that resulted in the destruction of offices as well as burning of 18 INEC logistical vehicles, several election materials, equipment and ICT gadgets in Abia, Akwa-Ibom, Anambra, Cross River, Enugu, Ebonyi and Imo states.\n\nThe Presidential committee stated that 164 police stations and formations, including police Headquarters, Owerri, Imo State were attacked by IPOB/ESN leading to the death of 128 policemen while 144 were injured and 628 vehicles were destroyed.\n\nIt said 396 firearms and 17,738 ammunition were carted away during the IPOB/ESN attacks.\n\n\u201cThat there were three IPOB/ESN attacks on Nigerian Correctional Service, including the Headquarters of NCoS, Owerri, Imo State where 1,841 inmates escaped.

          "text": "\u2026Only 3.6m citizens\u2019ve received vaccines \u2013 NPHCDA \u2026Mandatory vaccination\u2019ll limit virus spread \u2013 Experts \u2026It violates existing labour terms, fundamental rights \u2013 Ubani \u2018Govt should focus on entire population rather than its workers\u2019 \u2018\u2026Civil servants now buy forged Covid-19 vaccination certificates\u2019\n\nNigeria is currently witnessing a surge in Covid-19 infections largely due to the refusal of many citizens to adhere to Covid-19 guidelines on the one hand and vaccine apathy on the other. BENJAMIN SAMSON in this report takes a look at the moves by the federal and some state governments to make vaccinations compulsory.\n\nThe federal government has directed all its employees to get vaccinated against the Covid-19 virus as this will soon become a prerequisite for gaining access into their various offices. The chairman of the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) on Covid-19, Boss Mustapha, announced the new directive at its briefing, recently.\n\nMustapha said beginning December 1, 2021, all federal government employees would be required to show a proof of Covid-19 vaccination or present a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result to gain access to their offices.\n\n\u201cWith effect from 1st December, 2021, federal government employees shall be required to show proof of Covid-19 vaccination or present a negative Covid-19 PCR test result done within 72 hours, to gain access to their offices, in all locations within Nigeria and our Missions,\u201d he had said.\n\nHe noted that appropriate service-wide circular would be issued to guide the process. He had, on September 2, 2021, said the Covid-19 vaccination would be compulsory for federal civil servants once vaccines were available for everyone.\n\nHesitancy\n\nStatistics released by the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) on September 7, 2021, showed that so far, only 3.6 million persons had received vaccines, while about 1.5 million out of this figure have completed their dosage. The implication is that less than one per cent of Nigerians are fully vaccinated.\n\nSpeaking with Blueprint Weekend via WhatsApp, the medical director of Rhema Diagnostics, Israel Omotunde, said vaccine scarcity is partly responsible for vaccine hesitancy.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is bad enough that the country witnessed a setback in the vaccination drive between July and August due to a scarcity of doses. With the arrival of more vaccines in recent weeks, it was expected that Nigerians would throng the various health centres across the country for vaccines, but this has not been the case. For those who are willing, vaccines are available in many centres, but many are refusing to take them. Consequently, the infection rate has continued to soar.\u201d\n\nStates too\n\nLikewise, the Kaduna state government on Tuesday, this week, announced a 12-day ultimatum for all civil servants in the state to receive Covid-19 vaccines in the latest of compulsory vaccinations push embarked on by the federal and some state governments.\n\nThe ultimatum was announced in a statement issued by the special adviser to the governor on media and communication, Muyiwa Adekeye. According to the statement, all civil servants are expected to be vaccinated by October 31, after which they will be denied entry into government offices if found not to have complied with the directive.\n\nOndo\n\nIn Ondo, the state government stated that it would begin barring its employees from gaining access to their work places beginning November 1, if they failed to obtain vaccinations against Covid-19. The order was made known on Wednesday in Akure by the permanent secretary of the Ministry of Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Segun Odusanya.\n\nAccording to him, the decision became necessary in view of the ravaging effects of Covid-19 and its attendant morbidity. Odusanya warned that presentation of the Covid-19 vaccination card and compliance with its protocols would be the gate-pass to the work place from November 1.\n\nHe said those without the card would not be allowed into the ministries and other areas of the secretariat, adding that the order would be enforced as a means of protecting members of staff.\n\nThe permanent secretary, therefore, urged civil servants to prioritise their health by doing routine checks of their blood pressure, blood sugar and other necessary checks as certain deaths could be prevented if one is careful and sensitive.\n\n\u201cBe conscious of your health, do routine checks. Be up and doing on your jobs, stay in your offices, face the reality of the economic situation in the country, don\u2019t spend recklessly and make good use of the little that is available to you and all will be well,\u201d he said.\n\nOther countries\n\nFindings by Blueprint Weekend showed that several countries have adopted mandatory Covid-19 vaccination policies for their workforces.\n\nCanada has imposed a mandatory Covid-19 vaccine for its federal workers and all transport workers, while in France, healthcare workers must be vaccinated or face dismissal or suspension without pay.\n\nIn Italy, public and private sector workers must have a green pass showing vaccination proof, a negative test result, or recent recovery from Covid-19.\n\n\u201cAny worker who fails to present a valid health certificate after five days on leave risks suspension without pay, while unvaccinated workers who go to work can be fined up to $2,000,\u201d according to a directive.\n\nIn the United States of America, all federal workers and contractors must be vaccinated, while private employers with 100 or more workers must require staff to be vaccinated by December, or get tested weekly. Violators could face termination.\n\nIn Malaysia, federal employees must be vaccinated by the end of October or face disciplinary action. New Zealand has also made Covid-19 vaccinations mandatory for teachers, and healthcare workers\n\nDivision\n\nHowever, mixed reactions have greeted the announcements by the federal and some state governments to make Covid-19 vaccinations mandatory for civil servants and citizens.\n\nA consultant virologist, Prof. Uchenna Maduka, told this reporter that unlike in previous circumstances, he backs the federal government on mandatory vaccination.\n\nHe said: \u201cI have on several occasions disagreed with the Presidential Task Force on Covid-19 (PTF)/Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) on some of their orders; however, on this one, they have my support. The government has made it easy for civil servants to access the vaccine by providing sufficient number of doses and has given the civil servants up to December 1 to get vaccinated.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of mandatory vaccination is to limit the spread of the virus through uncontrolled human transmission and thereby reducing the development of new variants. Immunity developed after vaccination against the existing/original virus strain may not be so effective or protective against the new variants. Therefore, the less or complete absence of new variants is to all our advantage.\u201d\n\nOn whether the directive violates fundamental human rights of civil servants or not, Maduka said: \u201cThose who have medical contraindications for not taking the vaccine have the right not to be infected by those who refuse to take the vaccines for other non-medical reasons.\n\n\u201cIt is the balance of the right of the majority over that of the individual. In any case, the government is giving conditions for entering public premises and buildings, just as organisations have rules and regulations for those permitted to enter their premises. In addition, those who prefer not to take the vaccines, have the choice of providing negative laboratory tests only twice in a week.\u201d\n\nAlso, the national president of Nigeria Medical Association (NMA), Prof. Innocent Ujah, told Vanguard that the policy will help to reduce the spread of the Covid-19 virus and improve health-seeking behaviour of Nigerians.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are in support of the policy introduced by the federal government because it will help to reduce the spread of the virus and improve health-seeking behaviours of Nigerians. What the government needs to do going forward is to ensure the vaccine is available.\n\n\u201cMy advice to civil servants is that they should make themselves available for the vaccine. Nothing negative about the vaccine, I took my own a long time ago and I am still healthy and strong. I also believe that enforcement won\u2019t be a problem because workers are under different agencies with heads that will ensure enforcement for the benefit of all.\u201d\n\nUjah noted that vaccine hesitancy is not a new thing as it happened during polio, \u201cbut we need to understand that the eventual acceptability of the vaccine and immunisation take us out of the polio pandemic as a country.\u201d\n\nHowever, the chairman of Nigerian Bar Association Section on Public Interest and Development Law (NBA-SPIDEL), Dr. Monday Ubani, has said he would not hesitate to drag the federal government to court if it goes ahead to enforce the directive on compulsory vaccination for civil servants.\n\nDescribing the directive as \u201cinsensitive,\u201d Ubani stated that compulsory vaccination \u201cviolates the existing labour terms and the fundamental rights of the civil servants to their privacy, life, movement, religious belief and faith, and liberty.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cAny directive on compulsory vaccination is immature, needless, unacceptable and should be totally rejected.\n\n\u201cThe punishment of denial of access to office by the directive is a clear violation of the contractual terms of employment, and secondly, a restriction to freedom of liberty and movement guaranteed under Chapter 4 of the 1999 Constitution, as amended, Universal Declaration of Human Rights as well as African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights.\n\n\u201cWhen these civil servants were employed, compulsory vaccinations and its attendant punishment for non-compliance were not part of their terms of contract. This new policy is a rude interruption to cordial labour relationship and is against international best labour practices.\n\n\u201cThe federal government is hereby put on notice that any intention to pursue this illegal policy will be met with stiff legal challenge.\u201d\n\nUbani further noted that in the absence of any substantive legislation that makes Covid-19 vaccination compulsory, such policy directive which would invariably take away guaranteed rights, is illogical, unlawful, null and void.\n\nHe also insisted that the best policy for the country remains that the citizens be not allowed to lower the guard in preventive measures in dealing with the pandemic.\n\n\u201cAs the government has failed to concretely convince the citizens on the issue of health, safety and bodily harm of this vaccination, they are advised to desist from pursuing their present policy that is in collision course with the bodily integrity of the citizens.\n\n\u201cThey should rather utilise persuasive methodology to get citizens convinced of the benefits of the said vaccinations but most importantly, they are advised to pursue free education, free health policies and other social welfare policies and make them compulsory for the citizens which will in turn attract accolades for the government.\u201d\n\nLikewise, a legal practitioner, Dienma Princewill, in a chat with this reporter, said there is no provision of the law mandating Nigerians to take vaccines.\n\n\u201cYou know sometime last year, the government proposed the Control of Infectious Disease Bill 2020, otherwise known as the NCDC Bill, which didn\u2019t see the light of the day. So, there is nowhere in the law that says that people should be forced to take the vaccine.\n\n\u201cThe federal, Edo, Osun and state governments should come out and point out where it is written in the law that citizens will be forced to take the vaccine.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the executive-director of Gender and Reproductive Rights Watch, Azuka Eboh, a non-governmental organisation, told Blueprint Weekend that the government should focus on the entire population rather than civil servants alone.\n\nShe, however, urged the government to educate citizens on the need to take the vaccine rather than apply force.\n\nShe said, \u201cThere is a basic rule of law which stipulates that one\u2019s human right stops where others\u2019 rights begin. You have a right to refuse vaccines, but you do not have the right to endanger the health of others.\n\n\u201cI am also concerned that the focus is on workers alone, rather than the entire population. We must note that the battle against the virus cannot be worn in that manner. Any effort towards tackling Covid-19 must be one that would incorporate all citizens. The government should also be careful not to create a window for Nigerians to forge fake Covid-19 vaccination certificates.\n\n\u201cBefore government enforces the mandatory policy, there is a need for massive and coordinated enlightenment campaigns at all levels to educate citizens on the dangers of not getting vaccinated. Traditional and religious leaders as well as non-governmental organisations should be involved in this advocacy that should aim at tackling vaccine hesitancy and misinformation. Citizens\u2019 response to issues of responsibility is better appreciated when done out of conviction, not out of coercion. People need to be convinced that aside from endangering the lives of others, they could be denied entry into other countries for not taking Covid-19 vaccination.\n\n\u201cWhen vaccination centres become easily accessible to all Nigerians, it would be time to proclaim the mandatory law. At that stage, there could be sanctions for individuals who refuse to get vaccinated against Covid-19, including denying them certain privileges as citizens.\u201d\n\nFake certificate\n\nInvestigation by Blueprint Weekend revealed that in a bid to avoid the government sanctions, Nigerians especially civil servants are procuring fake Covid-19 vaccination certificates for as low as N3, 000.\n\nThis is coming against the backdrop of warnings by the executive-director of the NPHCDA, Faisal Shuaib, that those behind the \u2018criminal behaviour will be prosecuted\u2019 after investigation.\n\nA civil servant who does not want his name in print for obvious reasons said people are working around the system by paying as low as N3, 000 to get forged Covid-19 vaccination certificates.\n\nHe said, \u201cI don\u2019t know the actual person who does it for them. All I know is that they send all the required information like their date of birth, age, sex, occupation and their National Identification Number to the person with amount ranging from 3,000 to 5000 depending on how fast you want it.\u201d",

We continued to broadcast the proceedings. The result of the publicity and openness was that we ultimately secured our democracy.\u201d\n\nNnamani also spoke of how he had written a speech he read to appeal to the conscience of his colleagues on the issue and how the speech \u201cworked the magic.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter I delivered it and called for votes to determine whether the bill should be read a second time, there was total silence.

          "text": "The boss of a notorious Haitian gang accused of kidnapping 17 members of a U.S.-based missionary group last weekend is warning that the hostages will be killed if his demands aren\u2019t met.\n\n\u201cI swear by thunder that if I don\u2019t get what I\u2019m asking for, I will put a bullet in the heads of these Americans,\u201d gang leader Wilson Joseph said in a video posted on social media Thursday.\n\nOfficials said early in the week that the 400 Mawozo gang was demanding $1 million for each of those kidnapped, although it wasn\u2019t clear if that included the five children in the group, among them an 8-month-old. Sixteen Americans and one Canadian were abducted, along with their Haitian driver.\n\nJoseph also threatened Prime Minister Ariel Henry and Haiti\u2019s national police chief as he spoke in front of the open coffins that apparently held several members of his gang who were recently killed.\n\n\u201cYou guys make me cry. I cry water. But I\u2019m going to make you guys cry blood,\u201d he said.\n\nLater in the day, Henry\u2019s office announced that L\u00e9on Charles had resigned as head of Haiti\u2019s National Police and was replaced by Frantz Elb\u00e9. The newspaper Le Nouvelliste said Elb\u00e9 was director of the police departments of the South East and Nippes and previously served as general security coordinator at the National Palace when Jocelerme Privert was provisional president.\n\n\u201cWe would like for public peace to be restored, that we return to normal life and that we regain our way to democracy,\u201d Henry said.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Charles or Elb\u00e9.\n\nThe missionaries who were abducted Saturday during a visit to an orphanage are with Ohio-based Christian Aid Ministries, which held a news conference before Joseph\u2019s video was posted.\n\nWeston Showalter, spokesman for the religious group, said the families of those kidnapped are from Amish, Mennonite and other conservative Anabaptist communities in Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Oregon and Ontario, Canada. He read a letter from the families, who weren\u2019t identified by name, in which they said, \u201cGod has given our loved ones the unique opportunity to live out our Lord\u2019s command to love your enemies.\u201d\n\nThe group invited people to join them in prayer for the kidnappers as well as those kidnapped and expressed gratitude for help from \u201cpeople that are knowledgeable and experienced in dealing with\u201d such situations.\n\n\u201cPray for these families,\u201d Showalter said. \u201cThey are in a difficult spot.\u201d\n\nThe organization later issued a statement saying it would not comment on the video.\n\nThe gang leader\u2019s death threat added to the already intense concern in and around Holmes County, Ohio, where Christian Aid Ministries is based and which has one of the nation\u2019s largest concentrations of Amish, conservative Mennonite and related groups. Many members of those groups have supported the organization through donations or by volunteering at its warehouse.\n\n\u201cMany people in the community feel helpless, but they also realize the power of prayer and the power of our historic theology,\u201d including the Anabaptist belief in nonresistance to violence, said Marcus Yoder, executive director of the Amish & Mennonite Heritage Center in Millersburg.\n\nThe same day that the missionaries were kidnapped, a gang also abducted a Haiti university professor, according to Haiti\u2019s ombudsman-like Office of Citizen Protection. It also noted a Haitian pastor abducted earlier this month had not been released despite a ransom being paid.\n\nCriminals \u201coperate with complete impunity, attacking all members of society,\u201d the office said.\n\nUNICEF said Thursday that 71 women and 30 children have been kidnapped so far this year \u2014 surpassing the 59 women and 37 children abducted in all of last year. \u201cThey represent one third of the 455 kidnappings reported this year,\u201d the agency said.\n\n\u201cNowhere is safe for children in Haiti anymore,\u201d Jean Gough, UNICEF regional director for Latin America and the Caribbean, said in a statement. \u201cWhether on their way to school, at home or even at church, girls and boys are at risk of being kidnapped anywhere, at any time of the day or night.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, hundreds of demonstrators blocked roads and burned tires in Haiti\u2019s capital to protest a severe fuel shortage and a spike in insecurity and to demand that the prime minister step down.\n\nIn addition to kidnappings, the gangs are accused of blocking gas distribution terminals and hijacking supply trucks, which officials say has led to a shortage of fuel. Many gas stations remain closed for days at a time, and the lack of fuel is so dire that the CEO of Digicel Haiti announced this week that 150 of its 1,500 branches countrywide are out of diesel.\n\nAlexandre Simon, an English and French teacher, said he and others were protesting because of the dire conditions facing Haitians.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of people who cannot eat,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no work \u2026 There are a lot of things we don\u2019t have.\u201d",

          "text": "Twenty four hours after the anniversary marking the #ENDSARS protest, Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu has said the final report of the Judicial Panel of Enquiry and Restitution in the state was being awaited, assuring that his government would disclose the report fully to members of the public.\n\nSanwo-Olu, who spoke on the difficult task of rebuilding the state, one year after Lagos was hit by a wave of arsonist attacks resulting from protests, said the state government would not attempt to cover up the recommendations of the panel, whether it is in its favour or not.\n\nThe Governor said the panel report would be helpful in strengthening true reconciliation and preventing re-occurrence of violence in the State.\n\nLagos recorded a huge loss in assets and resources, following the violence that trailed the protest, as public transportation infrastructure, court buildings, police stations, private properties and iconic assets were razed by arsonists on October 21, 2020.\n\nSanwo-Olu said the panel was set up to look into allegations of human rights abuses against the police and also determine the cause of coordinated attacks on Lagos, noting that the panel\u2019s final report would be fully implemented.\n\nThe panel concluded its sittings last Monday, 12 months after it was constituted.\n\nSanwo-Olu said: \u201cThe panel concluded its sittings about three days ago and has asked for time to put the reports together behind closed doors. We do not know the content of the report, but we want to say publicly that, upon the handover of the report, we will be making it public.\n\n\u201cWe will not cover up anything. This is not who we are and that is not what our government stands for. We will make full disclosure of whatever recommendations that the panel will come up with. I assure citizens of Lagos that we will not leave anything to chance.\u201d\n\nThe governor also spoke on the arrest of some youths that participated in a drive-through #EndSARS memorial protest at the Lekki Tollgate on Wednesday, disclosing that he had ordered an unconditional release of those detained by the police, except one person who was caught with dangerous weapons at the scene.\n\n\u201cYesterday (Wednesday), we saw a protest in Lagos and everybody that was arrested in connection with the protest have all been released, except an individual that was caught with dangerous weapons and who confessed to the police that he joined the protest to cause mayhem,\u201d the governor said.\n\nHe commended the police for being alive to its responsibility by identifying and isolate troublemakers from among law-abiding people who conduct themselves in line with the laws.\n\nSanwo-Olu, again, extended a hand of fellowship to the youth to be stakeholders in the development of the state, while reiterating his commitment to reconciliation. He urged them to join the rebuilding effort in order to restore the operating capacity of institutions affected in the violence.\n\nSpeaking on the rebuilding effort, the governor said the destruction had slowed down operational activities of the affected public institutions, but stressed that the State Government would not shy away from its responsibility to rebuild the facilities and restore their operating capacity.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is exactly a year ago today when Lagos was hit by violence in the aftermath of the EndSARS protests. Lagos witnessed massive destruction of infrastructure, iconic buildings, transport infrastructure, police station and others.\n\n\u201cToday being a year after the event, there is no better time to say how difficult it has been for us as a State and how committed it has been for us. As tough as it is, the Government will certainly not shy away from its responsibility. We see the incident as a challenge and we will fix it with everything that we have.\u201d\n\nSegun James and Dike Onwuamaze",

          "title": "Buhari Assures Anambra Election Won\u2019t Be Disrupted, Directs Military to Use Overwhelming Force If Necessary \u2013 Arise News",
          "text": "Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday vowed that he would never allow anything or anyone to disrupt the forthcoming governorship election in Anambra State. He made the declaration during a National Security Council (NSC) meeting in Abuja with the service chiefs, where the election and rising cases of violence became the focus of attention.\n\nHe gave marching orders to the security agencies to apply overwhelming force, if necessary, to protect the November 6 governorship election and ensure it was not interrupted by non-state actors who have been heating up the polity.\n\nNational Security Adviser (NSA), Major General Babagana Monguno (rtd), disclosed the president\u2019s directive to journalists at the end of the security meeting. Monguno said besides the fact that the people of Anambra State deserved to elect a governor of their choice, the federal government would not sit by and let non-state actors set a wrong precedent in the country\u2019s electoral experience.\n\nThe NSA stated, \u201cThe president has directed that under no circumstances will anything be allowed to stop the elections from taking place successfully. The people have a right to vote, they have a right to select their leader, and no group or individual will be allowed to stimulate anarchy and chaos, leading to murderous activities.\n\n\u201cThe president has made it very clear that the armed forces, security agencies, and law enforcement agencies must make sure that the elections take place. If it means overwhelming the entire environment with the presence of security agencies.\n\n\u201cThere are so many implications for elections to be sabotaged by non-state actors. In the first place, we are in a democracy. Secondly, it is important to note that if these non-state actors should succeed in destroying the potential for orderly elections, then it is natural that other parts of the country will also want to copy this situation.\u201d\n\nMonguno said the council observed recent trends of violent activities and was desirous of seeing a hitch-free election in the state.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe problem here is that in as much as the government wants to conduct peaceful elections, there are non-state actors who have been heating up the polity, who have made all kinds of attempts to stymie orderly elections for next month.\u201d\n\nMonguno maintained that the president did not want to contemplate a situation in which he would be boxed into a corner.\n\n\u201cThe mere thought that a group of non-state actors want to portray his government as not being able to be firm is totally out of the question,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe tail cannot wag the dog, it is totally unacceptable and, again, we in the security and intelligence community have been trying as much as possible to talk with the leadership in the South-east, to make them aware of the fact that President Buhari is not averse to the aspirations of the people of the South-east,\u201d the NSA added.\n\nHe stressed, \u201cSo long as whatever they desire to achieve, they do it through the normal prescribed manner, either legislative, legal, or whatever. For as long as it is within the confines of legitimacy, President Buhari does not have a problem with that. But any action that is outlandish, any action that typifies roguery, the usurpation of the authority of the state is not going to be tolerated.\n\n\u201cAgain, we\u2019re also mindful of the fact that Nigerians, being what they are, also need to understand that if these non-state actors should go out on a limb and extend the frontiers of violence, and begin to kill people, there is a possibility that reprisal attacks can take place in other parts of the country, which is what we do not want to happen.\n\n\u201cSo, we\u2019re working with the community leaders, with the governors and everybody to ensure that they bring their people, restrain them on the leash.\u201d\n\nHe also said the NSC reviewed the security situation across the country, noting that the various security formations \u2013 the armed forces, intelligence sector and the police \u2013 have been recording successes from one end of the country to another.\n\nAccording to him, in a short space of time, the armed forces have recorded victory over terrorist groups in the North-east, as they have eliminated, in quick succession, leaders of the notorious Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP).\n\nThe NSA said about two months after the Nigerian Army eliminated Abu Musab al-Barnawi, the dreaded leader of ISWAP, troops, just two days ago, killed his successor, Mallam Bako, in combat.\n\nMonguno said inter-agency cooperation among the various forces and agencies had yielded appreciable successes in communities and the economy.\n\nHe noted the unprecedented feat in security within the country\u2019s maritime environment and the recent elimination of a notorious gangster in Benue State, one Aondofa Kefas (Azonto).\n\nAccording to him, \u201cOther aspects basically have to do with the current state of security in the country and the sub-region. Of course, the armed forces and security agencies have done so much in the last couple of months.\n\n\u201cLet me say clearly, in the last six months, they have been able to record a lot of successes.\n\n\u201cNow the issue here is that it is not very easy for the wider society to appreciate the successes being recorded by the armed forces, because there will definitely be incidents of misadventure. This is asymmetric conflict; it is not like the normal conventional war in which territories are won, you grapple with the enemy, you defeat him, and you move on. Here we have the enemy embedded in society, coming from all parts.\n\n\u201cLike I once said, someone had remarked after the Brighton bombing of 1984, that the difference between the terrorist or the criminal and the state is that it only takes one act for the terrorist to succeed and gain a lot of publicity, but for the armed forces, for the government and its agencies, you have to succeed on every occasion, otherwise, after 12 successes, if you fail, or you have a problem on the 13th occasion, nobody wants to know.\n\n\u201cSo, this is the situation with which we are faced. But, nevertheless, I will just highlight that the Chief of Defense Staff, service chiefs, and intelligence heads briefed Council and I can tell you that for the land forces, they have recorded a lot of successes in the last two months.\n\n\u201cWe have had a steady increase in the number of returnees, both combatants and non-combatants, from the theatre of operation; both from the Islamic State of West Africa Province and the Boko Haram enclaves.\n\n\u201cNow what has happened is we are now having to contend with 15,852 returnees. This in its own case is accompanied by problems; humanitarian problems, problems of logistics, problems of profiling each and every one because we are not just interested in profiling the ex-combatants, we are also interested in profiling those people who are assumed to be non-combatants, who may have reached out and assisted the terrorists in one way or the other.\u201d\n\nCommenting on frequent attacks and stealing of the country\u2019s arms and ammunition by bandits and terrorists, the NSA said moves were being made to end the menace.\n\nHe explained, \u201cEfforts right now are underway. As you already know, yesterday, the president had an important visitor, the president of Turkey.\n\n\u201cJust like he has had discussions with the President of Turkey, he has had discussions with other leaders on how we can share intelligence and acquire technical capabilities to deal with these emerging threats. So, it is basically a matter of looking at where we can get equipment and assets to deal with these threats.\u201d\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja",

Police and FBI agents had been searching for him there since his family reported him missing in mid-September.\n\nLaundrie had been named a \u201cperson of interest\u201d in Petito\u2019s disappearance but was never criminally charged in her murder. A federal grand jury in Wyoming indicted him on Sept. 23 on a single count of fraudulently using her bank debit card.\n\nPetito\u2019s disappearance in late August during a cross-country \u201cvan life\u201d road trip with Laundrie was followed closely by Americans as the case became an internet sensation and then a tabloid mystery.\n\nPetito, 22, was last been seen alive on Aug. 26. Her body was discovered on Sept. 19 near the remote Spread Creek Dispersed Campground in Bridger-Teton National Forest in western Wyoming. Medical examiners found she had been strangled.\n\nHer remains were found less than 1,000 feet (300 m) from where, on the evening of Aug. 27, another pair of travel bloggers caught video images of the couple\u2019s 2012 white Ford Transit van parked along a dirt road.\n\nPetito and Laundrie, who lived with Laundrie\u2019s parents in North Port on Florida\u2019s west coast, embarked on their trip in early July from New York\u2019s Long Island, where they had both attended high school.\n\nAs they traveled through Kansas, Colorado, Utah and points west, Petito documented their trip on social media with videos and pictures that depicted a loving couple on an American adventure.\n\nOn Aug. 12, a 911 caller reported that Laundrie was slapping and hitting Petito in front of the Moonflower Community Cooperative in Moab, Utah.\n\nMoab police stopped the van on a highway near Arches National Park. Body camera footage showed Petito crying as she described an argument that escalated into her slapping Laundrie as he drove. The officers did not detain the couple but told them to spend the night apart.\n\nPetito posted her final photo to Instagram on Aug. 25, the same day she last spoke to her mother by phone. The family believes the couple was headed to Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming at the time.",
