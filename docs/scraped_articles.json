          "title": "Gumi knocks Army as 200 killed in Zamfara despite Buhari\u2019s no-fly zone",
          "text": "The Nigerian Army and a popular Islamic cleric, Ahmad Gumi, on Wednesday disagreed over the latter\u2019s allegation that security agents were collaborating with bandits.\n\nGumi, while featuring on Morning Show, a programme on Arise TV, on Wednesday, alleged that a lot of those he described as bad elements in the nation\u2019s security forces were colluding with bandits.\n\nThe cleric stated that the bandits had been able to access assorted weapons that they used against Nigeria due to the cooperation of the security agents.\n\nGumi said these as The PUNCH learnt that at least 200 residents of Zamfara State had been killed in violent attacks despite an order by the President, MajorGeneral Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), declaring a \u2018no-fly-zone\u2019 over the state\u2019s airspace.\n\nOn his part, the Kaduna-based cleric alleged that the security agents were doing business with the security and lives of Nigerians\n\nGumi said, \u201cThese bandits, if you don\u2019t know, are cooperating with a lot of bad elements in our security system. This is a business. So many people are involved; you will be surprised.\n\n\u201cThey were caught in Zamfara. They were caught everywhere. How do these big weapons cross our borders?\n\n\u201cHow can these big weapons cross our borders and get into the forest without the cooperation of some bad elements of the security operatives assisting them? It is not possible.\n\n\u201cIf I give you the same quantity of guns, can you take them to the UK? You can\u2019t, because the security is at alert. Part of fighting this banditry is to overhaul our security system.\u201d\n\nHe attributed the incessant banditry and herdsmen attacks across the country to tribal wars.\n\n\u201cWhat you call banditry, when you cross to the other side, you find out Nigeria is fighting a tribal war,\u201d he said.\n\nGumi, who admitted that bandits commit atrocities, also accused the government at all levels of taking sides in the raging attacks on Nigerian communities.\n\n\u201cWhen you said these bandits are committing atrocities, yes, agree they are committing crimes. They are killing people. They are raping. They are doing all sorts of atrocities.\n\n\u201cBut, have you for once gone to their own sides and see all sorts of atrocities that are also committed against them?\u201d he asked.\n\nGumi claimed that herdsmen had been lynched across the southern region, while specifically naming Anambra and Oyo states.\n\nThe prominent cleric believes that the government should be neutral, rather than taking sides in addressing banditry and herdsmen attacks.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe moment government takes sides, it becomes part of the conflict. And this is what I saw in Zamfara State, in Niger State and other states.\n\n\u201cIt is very unfortunate that in the 21st century because of the fracture in our governmental structure people have turned to tribalism or religion originality to express their grievances,\u201d he lamented.\n\nHe described the amnesty granted to bandits by the Katsina State Governor Bello Masari as \u201ca political amnesty without any package.\u201d\n\nGumi said \u201cYou granted a political amnesty, I mean an amnesty in the front of the media but in the real sense there was no amnesty.\n\n\u201cAmnesty comes with a package,\u201d he maintained, stating that \u201cthe package is that you rehabilitate these criminals, you provide them social amenities.\u201d\n\nAllegation, attempt to undermine troops, denigrate military \u2013 Army\n\nBut the Army denied the allegation made by Gumi.\n\nThe Director of Army Public Relations, Onyema Nwachukwu, in a statement on Wednesday described the claim by the cleric as a calculated attempt to undermine the sacrifices of the troops aimed at restoring peace in the country.\n\nThe statement was titled \u2018Nigerian Army not colluding with bandits.\u2019\n\nIt read, \u201cThe Nigerian Army has just been alerted to a submission by Sheikh Ahmad Abubakar Gumi when he featured on ARISE TV Morning Show on Wednesday, June23, 2021 alleging that the Nigerian military is colluding with marauding bandits who have been responsible for various crimes and atrocities against Nigerians and the Nigerian state.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Army wishes to state that contrary to Sheik Gumi\u2019s claims, the Nigerian Army remains a bona fide symbol of national unity that has conducted its constitutional responsibilities in the most professional manner in line with global best practices of adherence to the rules of engagement and protection of the fundamental human rights of the citizenry.\n\n\u201cThe sweeping allegation peddled by the scholar is not only sad and unfortunate, but a calculated attempt to denigrate the Nigerian military and undermine the sacrifices of our patriotic troops, who are working tirelessly to restore peace and stability across the country.\u201d\n\nOnyema stated that the military accused of connivance recently put their lives on the line to rescue abductees of the Government Secondary School, Birnin Yawuri from bandits.\n\nHe added, \u201cWhile the NA will not attempt to excuse the possibility of black sheep amongst its fold, it must be stated unambiguously that it will not condone any form of sabotage or aiding and assisting the enemy by any personnel, as provisions for dealing decisively with such acts are crystallised in Section 45 (1) of the Armed Forces Act CAP A 20 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004.\n\n\u201cIt must also be pointed out that while the military is very much receptive to constructive criticism, it should not be perceived as a gateway for derogatory comments that have the potential to embolden criminals. It is also necessary to reiterate that patriotism must be taken to a trajectory where subversive conversations on the state are brought to the barest minimum.\n\n\u201cOpinion leaders are enjoined to demonstrate patriotism in building the peace, rather than being agents of destabilisation, thereby aggravating the current security challenges facing the nation.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Army wishes to reassure law abiding citizens, that troops will continue to conduct themselves professionally in consonance with the code of conduct guiding our operations in all combat engagements, in line with the provisions of the Nigerian Constitution and global best practice.\u201d\n\nOver 200 killed in Zamfara despite Buhari\u2019s no-fly-order\n\nA tally by The PUNCH shows that 200 residents of Zamfara State have been killed in violent attacks despite a \u2018no-fly-zone\u2019 declared over the state\u2019s airspace.\n\nThe National Security Adviser, BabaganaMonguno, had on March 2, 2021, conveyed the President\u2019s no-fly-order which was done in a bid to end banditry in the gold-rich state.\n\nSeeking to put an end to banditry that has ravaged Zamfara State and other parts of the North-West and North-Central states, Buhari declared the state a no-fly-zone and placed a ban on all mining activities.\n\nA no-fly zone is a territory established by a military power over which certain aircraft are not permitted to fly.\n\nPresidency officials had told The PUNCH that Buhari was shocked that some of the foreign illegal miners were linked to acts of banditry and the Zamfara State government simply ignored the destruction of some villages where the mining takes place and tolerated the use of choppers in and out to facilitate illegal mining.\n\nThe traditional rulers in the state told service chiefs, who visited the state, that there were over 30,000 bandits in Zamfara forests, a number that far outweighs the less than 10,000 troops deployed in the state to tackle insecurity.\n\nA tally by The PUNCH, however, showed that at least 200 people had been killed by bandits since the no-fly-zone came into effect in March even as states sharing boundaries with Zamfara such as Kaduna,Niger and Kebbi had continued to witness killings and abductions.\n\nOn March 3, a day after the no-fly-order came into effect, about 50 persons were abducted while several houses were burnt in an attack on Tungar Baushe community in Mutunji district, Maru Local Government Area of the state but no deaths were reported.\n\nOn March 17, eight persons, including three soldiers and five civilians, were killed by terrorists at Kasaba village, Magami district, Maru Local Government Area, Zamfara State, an act which was condemned by the governor in a statement signed by his Commissioner for Information, Ibrahim Dosara.\n\nSome of the bandits were also reported to have been killed by the military. The Nigerian Army said on May 10 that its troops killed 48 bandits operating across different camps in the Maru local government area of the state.\n\nOn April 21, however, about 90 persons were killed during separate attacks in Gusau, Maradun and Bakura local government areas. Many of the victims were said to be vigilantes. While 62 corpses were immediately recovered, residents stated that the death toll rose to 90 the following day.\n\nOver 100 bandits were reported to have stormed Dansadau Town on May 18, stealing over 300 cows and looting shops but no deaths were reported.\n\nHowever, on May 22, bandits killed 21 people including two policemen in Gabaken, Rigiya, Donroyi, Torawa, and Riwoji all located in the Zurmi and Kaura Namoda local government areas of the state.\n\nOn May 24, gunmen on motorcycles invaded Dandamji, Gidan Runji, Doka, Yanmadanga and Yarkatsina villages killing at least 10 people. The police, however, claimed to have killed 10 of the bandits as well.\n\nBandits killed about 12 farmers and injured nine others in attacks in the Gusau Local Government Area on June 3.\n\nOn June 12, about 54 villagers were killed in an attack on five communities in Zurmi village. The residents were reported to have taken some of the corpses to the palace of the village traditional ruler to protest.\n\nFG should assess impact of no-fly-zone \u2013 Zamfara\n\nWhen contacted, the Special Adviser to Governor Bello Matawalle on Public Enlightenment Media and Communication, Alhaji Zailani Bappa, said the question on whether the no-fly-zone order had reduced killings and kidnapping in Zamfara State should be directed to the Federal Government.\n\nBappa said the Federal Government has enforced the no fly zone order aimed at restoring peace in the state as such it should be asked whether the order has made an impact.\n\n\u201cYou should direct your question to the Federal Government no know whether the no fly zone order has stopped the killings and kidnapping of people in the state\u201d.\n\n\u201cZamfara State Government is not supposed to say whether the order has made an impact or not because it was not responsible for that\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs a journalist, you can make your own assessment through investigation to find out whether the order has stopped the killings and kidnapping of people in the state,\u201d said Bappa.\n\nSpeaking with The PUNCH on Wednesday, the Country Director of Amnesty International, Ms. Osai Ojigho, said it was very sad that Zamfara and other states were still seeing high numbers of people who had been killed, lost their homes and displaced as a result of the violence.\n\nOjigho added, \u201cOne of the things we are getting from the ground is that many of these areas are dominated by a strong military presence but there is a slow response in terms of engaging the bandits, criminals whatever you want to call them in these communities and it is due to years of failing to find long lasting solutions to this crisis.\u201d\n\nIn his reaction, however, the Director, Army Information, Brig. Gen.Onyema Nwachukwu, said the army had averted many attacks in Zamfara State and had bombarded the hideouts of bandits.\n\nHe, however, urged residents to assist the military with credible information on security.\n\nNwachukwu said, \u201cAs we speak, troops of the Nigerian Army under the aegies of Operation Hadarin Daji in the North West are conducting aggressive clearance operations on suspected bandits\u2019 enclaves.\n\n\u201cStop and search operations are also ongoing, to fish out fleeing bandits and intercept flow of illegal arms and ammunition. Troops are equally maintaining blocking positions to deny the bandits freedom of action.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "\n\n\n\nThe Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha, has said that the Federal Government would soon take decision to recall civil servants working from home back to work.\n\nMustapha said this in Abuja on Wednesday at the 2021 commemoration of Public Service Day, organised by the Bureau of Public Service Reforms (BPSR), with the theme \u201dBuilding the Africa we want through the impact and value of Public Service Organisations to the Society.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSOReps member wants social media regulated in Nigeria like China\n\nRepresented by the Permanent Secretary, General Services in the Office of the SGF, Maurice Mbaeri, Mustapha stressed that all issues that necessitated the work from home order have been addressed.\n\n\u201dYou will all agree with me that the COVID-19 pandemic has challenged everyone, including governance and its operation.\n\n\u201dNevertheless, the federal government is committed to building a public service that is capable, efficient, open, inclusive, and accountable institutions, which are critical for sustainable growth and inclusive national development after COVID-19.\n\n\u201dThe federal government\u2019s e\u2013government master plan currently being implemented, is innovation and technology pooled to deliver services.\n\n\u201dThe e\u2013government master plan is intended to equip public servants with skills necessary to be effective, responsive and relevant in the digital age.\n\n\u201dTherefore, I wish to use this medium to encourage all civil and public servants to carry out their roles with dedication and a commitment to the civil service and its core values of integrity, honesty, objectivity and impartiality.\n\n\u201dI am glad to salute all public servants across the globe, especially our Nigerian patriotic public and civil servants whose contributions to the growth and development of our dear nation cannot be over emphasised,\u201d he said.\n\nSenator Ibrahim Shekarau identified some characteristics of effective public service as having a stable leadership structure which include the political leadership and leadership in the civil service structure.\n\nShekarau said that for effective public service, there must be identified vision or mission and objectives of the services through formulation of policies.\n\n\u201dAppropriate planning is required for effective civil service and well spelt out schedules of duties, guardians and rules must guide the civil service.\n\n\u201dIdentified sources of funding the services with judicious management of the funds, for effective public service, there must be accountability,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Director General, BPSR, Mr Ibrahim Arabi, said that the last decade brought about a digital revolution that changed the way we live, work, and govern.\n\nAccording to Arabi, \u201ctechnology and data driven innovations have increased the pace of our daily life, opened up information and elevated civil society voices and changed how we solve problems, design policy and deliver services.\n\n\u201dIn parallel, governments find themselves under resource pressures and increasing public demands, having to do much more, with less.\n\n\u201dThe 2020 COVID-19 pandemic was a force multiplier to these trends, introducing remote work in government, digital service delivery, virtual service teams, and even new portfolios.\n\n\u201dThe Africa continent had to catch up. else, she would be left behind. The public service and by extension public servants will serve as the tool that governments would use to sail this turbulence times.\n\n\u201dIt is expected that this forum today would provide the needed platform to convey government policies that require the buy-in of critical stakeholders as we commemorate the 2021 UN Public Service Day.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President, Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Abdrafiu Adeniji, said that Nigeria must work assiduously to achieve SDG 8 that targets achievement of full and productive employment and decent work for men and women. including persons with disabilities.\n\nAdeniji, however, called for massive employment for youths, reduced forced labour and principally protection of workers rights in the public service.\n\n\u201dAlso, the need for new recruitment and training and retraining of public servants to acquire knowledge and skills that will make them competitive and productive in the contemporary times,\u201d he said.",

PHOTO: Abayomi Adeshida\n\nUN Secretary-General, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has urged countries to consider the world\u2019s 250 million widows in their social assistance programme to alleviate their suffering.\n\nGuterres made the appeal in his message to mark the International Widows\u2019 Day, celebrated annually on June 23, to draw attentions to the plight of widows.\n\nAccording to him, COVID-19 pandemic has both increased the number of widows globally and exacerbated many of the challenges they face, including access to bank accounts and pensions.\n\n\u201cAs governments provide economic and social support in response to the pandemic, they must consider the world\u2019s 250 million widows.\n\n\u201cEven before the pandemic hit, nearly one in 10 widows lived in extreme poverty.\n\n\u201cSocial assistance, including cash transfers and pensions, can help support widows who are often left to take full responsibility for their families.\n\n\u201cGovernments should make special efforts to ensure these measures reach women with low visibility, for example, those without identity cards or bank accounts.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe secretary-general also urged every country, as a critical element of my Call to Action on Human Rights, to pass and implement legislation and policies that promote gender equality.\n\nHe therefore called all every country to promote gender equality and to repeal all discriminatory laws that perpetuate women\u2019s subjugation and exclusion.\n\n\u201cThe persecution and disinheritance of widows, by law and custom, is one of the worst examples of gender discrimination.\n\n\u201cOn International Widows\u2019 Day, let\u2019s commit to making sure all widows occupy a respected place in our societies.\n\n\u201cLet us be committed to make sure all widows occupy a respected place with access to legal and social protection, so they can live their lives in peace and reach their full potential,\u2019\u2019 the secretary-general said.\n\nGuterres said for many widows, losing their husband also meant losing identity, land rights, property, income, and possibly their children.\n\nHe said their physical safety was at greater risk, just when they might be suffering serious emotional trauma.\n\n\u201cHuman rights, including the right to inherit and own property, should not be contingent on marital status.\n\n\u201cInheritance laws and social safety nets should ensure that widows are protected and secure,\u2019\u2019 the secretary-general said.

Milland Dixon Dikio (rtd), has urged members of PAP\u2019s Strategic Communications Committee to change negative public perception about the scheme.\n\nDikio urged the committee consisting of ex-agitators to ensure effective dissemination of information about the scheme to attract expected development to the region.\n\nSpeaking yesterday in Port Harcourt, Rivers State capital, at the second quarterly meeting with members of the committee, Dikio explained that the absence of a proper channel of communication in the past led to misinformation.\n\nHe advised members of the committee to be adequately prepared for the task ahead and to understand the sensitive nature of their assignment.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDikio further urged them to know the importance of operating within the limits of their mandate and recognising the hierarchy and chain of command in the dissemination of information emanating from the PAP office.\n\nHe noted that any information coming out of his office must be authorized by him and disseminated through the media office duly signed by his Special Adviser on Media, Mr Neotaobase Egbe.\n\nDikio stressed that members of the committee must cross-check with PAP\u2019s media office before going public with any information.\n\nHe said a specialised training on public communication, media relations for members of the committee would be organised to build their capacity.\n\nHe said for business to thrive and for development to be attracted to the region, the committee must take its task seriously. The highpoint of the meeting was the presentation of official letters to members of the committee.",

Don\u2019t lose faith, we shall overcome the challenges.\n\n\u201cWhat we want is peace, and an end to banditry and criminality. All we want is an improvement in the economy of our country for the betterment in the lives of our people generally, especially the North.\u201d\n\nAliyu said: \u201cNorth will not ask for separation of the country. There are due processes of going about agitation.

Just three days ago, we had a mishap where one of the bridges had a problem; the approach to the bridge, it caused so much traffic jam in Port Harcourt for hours and we had to move in. To the glory of God, we have repaired the damaged section of the road and traffic is flowing and we are working very hard to make sure we complete that road next year for the benefit of the Nigerians and not just Niger Delta alone,\u201d he said.\n\nAkpabio warned that Nigeria cannot afford to have a crisis in South South of the same magnitude of the South East and other crisis-ridden regions of the country because of its importance to the economic survival of the nation.",

          "text": "From Ndubuisi Orji, Godwin Tsa and Aidoghie Paulinus, Abuja\n\nThe Federal Government and the House of Representatives clashed yesterday over the suspension of Twitter.\n\nOn June 4, government banned Twitter after the microblogging site pulled down a tweet by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nIn reaction, the House mandated its Committees on Information, Communication and Justice to investigate the legal backing for government\u2019s action.\n\nAt the resume hearing yesterday, government said it suspended operations of the micro-blogging and social networking site in line with the Terrorism Act 2011 and other extant laws.\n\nMinister of Information and Orientation, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, who appeared before the lawmakers, alongside the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) and the Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC), insisted that the suspension had nothing to do with the pulling down of Buhari\u2019s tweet.\n\nHe also read the riot act to Facebook and other social media operators saying government would not hesitate to wield the big stick if they crossed the red line.\n\n\u201cWe suspended Twitter because Twitter became a platform of choice for those that want to bring down this country. If any other platform does it, we will suspend their operations too. It is because there is a country called Nigeria that they have business here. Social media is a menace everywhere in the world. We believe that the best way to start is regulating them.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIncidentally, the Twitter suspension is indefinite; it\u2019s not banned. The doors are not closed. We are willing to speak to Twitter. Twitter has written a letter seeking for government dialogue and just today, I did issue a statement which I announced the government\u2019s team that is ready to meet Twitter.\n\n\u201cWhen I leave here, I intend see whether we can have a preliminary meeting of that committee. We hope that the committee will be able to meet first and that the committee would have a good dialogue with Twitter. But like we said, there are two basic things that Twitter or any OTT or social media needs to do: they must first be registered as a Nigerian company after which they will apply for license. Other conditions will come up as we go along.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the minister had said that the Federal Government has said that it suspended the operations of micro-blogging and social networking site, Twitter, in the country in line with the Terrorism Act 2011 and other extant laws.\n\n\u201cIf you look at section 3 of the National Security Act which cloth the State Security Service with the powers to preserve the internal security of Nigerians, it is very instructive that any platform that threatens the internal security of Nigeria will not be allowed to operate.\n\n\u201cThis is a case where the Federal Government deemed it necessary that the activities of twitter in Nigeria in particular is inimical to stability in the country.\n\n\u201cThe right to freedom of expression on the Twitter platform is further qualified by section 45 of the constitution in light to the provisions of section 5 (1) and (2) of the Terrorism Act 2011 which states that any person who knowingly, in any manner directly or indirectly solicits or render support or the commission of an act of terrorism or to a terrorist group commits an offence under this act.\n\n\u201cWe all know that IPOB is proscribed by a High Court in Nigeria and yet, twitter is the platform of choice through which IPOB direct its people to kill soldiers, kill policemen and burn public institutions.\n\n\u201cSo, it is clear that Twitter operations in Nigeria is inimical to our growth, both in common law and national security and so, we had to suspend their operations.\u201d\n\nHowever, a member of the joint committee, Shaba Ibrahim, said while he agreed that everything pales into insignificance when national interest and security is at stake, government\u2019s action smacked of incipient totalitarianism.\n\n\u201cWe are at the mercy of people who handle social media irresponsibly. All it took to wake to that responsibility was for Twitter to bring down Mr President\u2019s tweet. With all due respect sir, I don\u2019t think that was good enough.\n\n\u201cI agree that no right is in absolute terms. But again, we must mind the timing of it so that proactive actions are taken to nip these things in the bud, because what you have done whether you like it or not looks like symptoms of emerging totalitarianism.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the court of the Economic Community of West Africa States (ECOWAS) has restrained President Buhari and agents of the Federal Government from unlawfully imposing sanctions or doing anything whatsoever to harass, intimidate, arrest or prosecute Twitter and other social media service providers, media houses, radio and television broadcast stations and other Nigerians who are Twitter users, pending the hearing and determination of the suit.\n\nThe ruling of the court was predicated on the suit filed against the government by Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) and 176 concerned Nigerians where they argued that \u201cthe unlawful suspension of Twitter in Nigeria, criminalisation of Nigerians and other people using Twitter have escalated repression of human rights and unlawfully restricted the rights of Nigerians and other people to freedom of expression, access to information, and media freedom in the country.\u201d\n\nThe court gave the order after hearing arguments from Solicitor to SERAP, Femi Falana (SAN) and lawyer to the government Maimuna Shiru.\n\nLai, Pantami make govt\u2019s reconciliation team\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has approved a Federal Government\u2019s team to engage with Twitter over the suspension of its operations in the country.\n\nMinister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, announced the composition of the team in a statement in Abuja by Segun Adeyemi, special assistant to the President on Media, office of the Minister of Information and Culture.\n\nThe team which is chaired by Mohammed the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami; Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Pantami; Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama; Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola and Minister of State, Labour and Employment, Festus Keyamo, and representatives of relevant government agencies as members.\n\n\u201cFollowing the indefinite suspension of its operations in Nigeria, for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence, Twitter wrote to President Buhari seeking to engage with the Federal Government over the suspension, with a view to charting a path forward,\u201d the statement read.",

          "title": "Senate May Pass 2021 Supplementary Appropriation Bill Tuesday",
          "text": "Refers bill to appropriate committee\n\nBy Deji Elumoye and Juliet Akoje\n\nThe President of the Senate, Dr Ahmad Lawan, has hinted that the 2021 Appropriation Bill sent to the Senate by President Muhammadu Buhari for approval may be passed next Tuesday.\n\nLawan dropped the hint Wednesday while speaking after the Senate Leader, Senator Yahaya Abdullahi, had led the debate for the second reading of the N895.84 billion supplementary budget for 2021 fiscal year.\n\nHe, therefore, referred the Appropriation Bill sent to the Senate by the president on June 15 to the Senate Committee on Appropriation headed by Senator Jibril Barau.\n\nLawan, who gave the directive after the supplementary appropriation bill passed the second reading on the floor of the Senate, asked the committee to submit its report Tuesday next week.\n\nAccording to him, the report of the panel would be submitted, considered, and passed the same day.\n\nPresident Buhari had on Tuesday, June 15 transmitted the 2021 Supplementary Appropriation Bill to the National Assembly for consideration and approval.\n\nThe supplementary budget bill was transmitted via a letter dated 15th June, 2021, and addressed to the President of the Senate, Lawan.\n\nPresident Buhari, in the letter which was read Tuesday at the commencement of plenary after a 12-day recess by the Senate to mark the second legislative year of the ninth National Assembly, explained that the amount captured in the Bill was proposed to fund the COVID-19 vaccine programme.\n\nHe added that part of the supplementary budget would be used to also fund health-related expenditures for treatment of additional 50,000 patients under the Nigeria Comprehensive AIDS Programme in states; as well as to procure additional equipment captured in this year\u2019s capital expenditure on defence and security to tackle prevalent security challenges across the country.\n\nThe president also explained to the senators that the supplementary budget will be funded through existing facilities sourced from the World Bank as well as available new facilities.\n\nThe letter read in part: \u201cLet me seize this opportunity, to express my deep gratitude, for the cooperation and support, of the Leadership and Distinguished Members of the Senate, in our collective efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic and address the various security and other challenges facing the country.\n\n\u201cIt has become necessary to prepare the 2021 Supplementary Appropriation Bill considering the urgent need to make provision for procurement and administration of COVlD-19 vaccines.\n\n\u201cThe availability of COVlD-19 vaccines and the procurement terms were still uncertain as at the time of finalising the 2021 budget. Hence, there was no provision in the 2021 Appropriation Act for the procurement and administration of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n\u201cHowever, the Federal Ministry of Health and the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency (NPHCDA) have now developed a Covid-19 vaccine programme for the country. Under the vaccine programme, 70% of eligible Nigerians are to be vaccinated between 2021 and 2022.\n\n\u201cIn addition, our security and law enforcement agencies urgently need to procure additional equipment and other resources in response to the prevalent security challenges across the country.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Defence has carefully scrutinized these procurement needs, which the military authorities claim to represent the minimum requirements to secure our country and address current external and internal security challenges.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, additional funds are required to meet our commitment to treat additional 50,000 patients under the Nigeria Comprehensive AIDS Programme in States (NCAPS), as the amount provisioned in the 2021 Appropriation Bill for this purpose was inexplicably cut by the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cIn order to address the urgent problem of oxygen availability in the country and avoid the potential loss of lives, provision was made for the procurement and installation of new oxygen plants nationwide and repairs of oxygen plants in FCT hospitals.\n\n\u201cIt is also necessary to provide additional funds for public service wage adjustment to cater for sundry wage-related issues in the health and other sectors, which if not resolved can add to the prevalent sense of instability in the polity.\n\n\u201cThe Supplementary Budget request is for a total sum of N895, 842, 465, 917 (Eight Hundred and Ninety-Five Billion, Eight Hundred and Forty-Two Million, Four Hundred and Sixty-Five Thousand, Nine Hundred and Seventeen Naira) only.\n\n\u201cWe propose to fund N45.63 billion of the N83.56 billion required for the COVlD-19 vaccine programme by drawing on existing World Bank loans (which would be restructured) as well as Other Grants totalling US$113.22 million.\n\n\u201cThe balance of N37.93 billion required for COVlD-19 vaccines, salaries and other health-related expenditures totalling N41.69 billion and the N48.20 billion recurrent component of defence/security expenditure will be funded by drawing N135 billion from some Special Reserve/Levy Accounts, which will be captured as revenues to the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN).\n\n\u201cWe propose to fund the balance of N722.40 billion for capital expenditure on defence/security and capital supplementation from new borrowings, in the absence of any supplementary revenue sources.\n\n\u201cUnderstandably, needs currently abound in many other sectors. However, we have limited the supplementary budget proposal to just these critical and emergency areas of need due to our severe fiscal constraints.\n\n\u201cAll other needs would be deferred to the 2022 budget, which we plan to present in September of this year.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Says AGF studying court ruling on twitter\n\nBy Deji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nThe Presidency has washed its hands off the current attempt by the National Assembly to amend the Nigerian Press Council (NPC) Act and the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) Act, a move media stakeholders have condemned as an attempt to gag the press.\n\nThe Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, who spoke Wednesday with newsmen after the weekly meeting of the Federal Executive Council (FEC), however, said although it is an initiative of government which only the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, can address.\n\nHe said: \u201cThat is not strictly a Presidency thing because the president has nothing to do with that. It\u2019s a government thing and it\u2019s the minister that can talk about it. So, thank you.\u201d\n\nHe also said that there was nothing to report on the FEC meeting as the issues discussed were not meant for public consumption at this stage.\n\nThe spokesman, however, revealed that President Muhammadu Buhari has given approval that the Second Peer Review Country Self-assessment Report should be done.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe only thing of interest I would like to talk about is the second Peer Review Country\u2019s Self-assessment Report. Nigeria is ready for the second Peer Review Country Self -assessment Report to be done by AUDA-NEPAD. I think the last self-assessment report was done 10 years ago in Nigeria. Now, Nigeria is ready for the second review self-assessment report. It\u2019s been discussed at the council and the president has granted the approval that the peer review report can be conducted on Nigeria.\n\n\u201cActually, if you have an insight into the report that was presented, which the woman in charge of NEPAD, Mrs. Akobundu, can give you, Nigeria has made progress in several areas and on several fronts. While 10 years ago, petroleum contributed more than 70%, even up to 90%, to GDP, you will find that today, petroleum contributes just about 45% and non-oil products contribute about 55% to the Nigerian economy.\n\n\u201cSo, if Nigeria had been talking of diversification for 40, 50, 60 years, the economy can now be said to be diversified because our GDP, non-oil revenue, contributes about 55% to 45% of oil. So, it\u2019s one of the highlights of the Peer Review Country Self-assessment Report that was presented at the Council meeting today. Details of that can be gotten from the AUDA-NEPAD office.\n\nThat is the only thing we can talk about FEC today. If there\u2019s any question, then I\u2019ll gladly take. Thank you.\u201d\n\nThe media adviser also disclosed that the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice is studying the ruling by the ECOWAS Court to the effect that Twitter users cannot be arrested or prosecuted following the suspension of the activities of the microblogging site in the country.\n\nAccording to him, the AGF would advise the federal government on the next step to take.\n\nAdesina confirmed that the committee made up of ministers to engage Twitter over its suspension has commenced work.\n\n\u201cThe Attorney-General of the Federation is going to study that report and then he\u2019ll advise government on the way forward.\n\n\u201cThe committee set up by the president to engage with Twitter is actually holding a meeting about now, or it will hold a meeting this afternoon (Wednesday) towards engaging with Twitter,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Jesse Forrester started an e-mobility company in Kenya after deciding against going to university",
          "text": "My Life In Tech is putting human faces to some of the innovative startups, investments, and policy formations driving the technology sector across Africa.\n\nIf you were to look at three different pictures of Jesse Forrester today, you will notice the same unmistakable red cap. It\u2019s a part of his visual identity.\n\n\u201cIt was given to me by a dear friend and for me, it has just come to represent the people that have supported me and I carry them with me wherever I\u2019m going,\u201d Jesse said.\n\n\u201cI also think it\u2019s really cool.\u201d\n\nJesse Forrester and the Mazi Mobility team. Spot his red cap.\n\nHe pointed out how the hat contributes to his very pan-African life.\n\nJesse grew up in Nairobi, Kenya. After high school, he travelled to South Africa where he finished his A-levels at the African Leadership Academy (ALA).\n\nHis journey at ALA exposed him to several things including a wide network of pan-African thinkers.\n\nHis red cap has often gotten him mistaken as Nigerian, something he does not shy away from. But he never fails to remind people that the cap is actually from Tunisia in North Africa.\n\nAfter ALA, Jesse took up a fellowship. It was his first stab at being employed and he quickly found that it was not something that he fancied.\n\nThe idea of going to university didn\u2019t thrill him either. So he did something he\u2019d always wanted to do \u2013 he started his own business.\n\nToday, his company Mazi Mobility is backed by global venture builder, Satgana, and is aiming at implementing an electric vehicle ecosystem in Africa. To this end, they recently launched a new fleet of electric bodas or motorcycles.\n\nWhen he speaks of Africa and the possibilities that exist in the space of e-mobility, his excitement is almost palpable.\n\nHe started his company without a university degree and he is now preparing himself to dominate the African e-mobility space.\n\nHis name is Jesse Forrester and this is his life in tech.\n\nIf you look back, you see it\n\nJesse grew up in Huruma flats in the Eastlands. He lived with both his parents but more time was spent with his mother.\n\nAs a child, he wanted to be a pilot but his interests varied. On some days he wanted to just sit by the television and watch a NatGeo documentary on exotic animals in the thick Amazon and on other days his PlayStation 2 was all the entertainment he needed.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t an exact time when he decided he didn\u2019t want to be a pilot anymore. It was just one of those things that\u2019s there one day but slowly faded away with time \u2013 like a puddle drying in the sun.\n\nHis varying interests expanded to include his small businesses in school \u2013 selling lemonade and sweets. He also enjoyed tinkering with things \u2013 pulling them apart and putting them together.\n\nMazi Mobility, Jesse\u2019s startup, is making it easier for boda riders to own and use electric vehicles that help save the planet by reducing CO emissions.\n\nTo pinpoint when in his life he got the inspiration to want a cleaner Africa, you would need to consider two things; a minister who did his job and a matatu\u2019s smoke cloud.\n\nIn 2004, a man named John Michuki was the Minister of Transportation in Kenya. During that time, the state of buses, or matatus, in the country was terrible. These vehicles had no speed governors, seat belts and would often carry more passengers than they were supposed to.\n\nMichuki established the \u2018Michuki Rules\u2019 which served as a game-changer for the transport sector by providing strict guidelines for matatus at the time. But one thing they inadvertently did was inspire a prepubescent Jesse.\n\n\u201cI actually saw a meaningful change that had a huge impact. And according to my mum, I said I wanted to become something in transport like transport minister.\u201d\n\nFast forward to 2018 and Jesse was back from studying in South Africa and living in Nairobi again.\n\n\u201cI was walking around the city, just going on my errands, this massive matatu cuts me off and just as it\u2019s leaving and I have a mouth full of swear words, the thing just blows a huge amount of smoke in my face.\u201d\n\nSet 14 years apart, these two events paved the way for the creation of Mazi Mobility but also helped inform the decisions of a young man who really cares about his environment.\n\n\u201cJesse, meet Tech\u201d\n\n\u201cMy foray into tech really happened in secondary school, where I learned a lot about what actually makes up a game and how to actually make it,\u201d Jesse told me over our WhatsApp call.\n\nHis introduction to tech came in the form of MIT\u2019s Scratch Blocks. The program allowed people to develop programming skills by using blocks to code visually.\n\nHe didn\u2019t just explore software, his tinkering came in handy when he got a chance to work with Arduino motherboards which allow people to create complex computer systems from scratch.\n\n\u201cI wanted to be a good engineer, that was kind of my path because it would mix hardware and software.\u201d\n\nJesse\u2019s tango with tech did not end in high school. It followed him right into ALA.\n\nIn 2017, when bitcoin was still worth only $2,000, blockchain was primarily known as the technology behind bitcoin and not much else. For Jesse, it became an interesting tool.\n\n\u201cI was part of a blockchain club. I was running for treasurer [in student government], and the decision was to have the elections on the blockchain.\u201d\n\nHe would go on to win the elections and also create a project that would win his school $100,000.\n\nThe journey to Mazi by way of ALA\n\n\u2018Mazi\u2019 was not always \u2018Mazi Mobility\u2019. At one point, in the time before Jesse got into ALA, it was a photography collective \u2013 one of Jesse\u2019s many interests.\n\nBut getting into the Africa Leadership Academy was not the smoothest ride for him.\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing you must know, it is that Jesse Forrester sets high expectations for himself. He first heard of the Academy when he turned 12 and he knew he wanted to attend but the minimum age was 15 so he decided to wait.\n\nAt 15, he was in the middle of his high school education and decided not to apply until he was done. In his final year of high school, he finally applied.\n\n\u201cThey waitlisted me. So I had a chip on my shoulder where I had to prove that I\u2019ve got the leadership potential to get into the school.\u201d\n\nWhat followed was the creation of Mazi \u2013 a photography collective with a focus on creating discourse around the environment, speaking at a TEDx talk, and getting networking certifications.\n\nAnd what did he do with all these things? He sent ALA an update. They needed to know that he was meant to be there.\n\nThis time they listened. He was accepted and resumed in South Africa for his 2-year course.\n\nAt ALA, Jesse was a part of the team behind \u201cThe Living Machine\u201d a water treatment system that won them the $100,000 Zayed Sustainability Prize in 2019.\n\nAfter his encounter with the smoky matatu in 2018, Jesse decided he wanted to start a company that provided electric matatus.\n\n\u201cI wanted to start with putting solar panels on matatus but I quickly realised that was not smart because you need like 60 of them for one matatu.\u201d\n\nWith a few calls, he was able to connect with his co-founder and founding investor Troy Barrie.\n\nWhile they discussed kicking off the business, Jesse had to leave the country briefly to present a report on The Living Machine in Abu Dhabi. During this trip, he also got a chance to interview musician and investor, Akon.\n\nJesse with Akon\n\nWhen he returned and settled down, he quit his job and focused full time on Mazi. They made plans to begin getting investors. This was March 2020.\n\nBuilding Mazi through a pandemic and looking to the future\n\n\u201cSo now we are back to running a hardware business, in Africa, in a pandemic?\u201d Jesse laughed when he said this. It was ridiculous to even think about.\n\nThe potential investors all seemed to say the same things: \u201cSo we\u2019re focusing on our portfolio companies right now. Let\u2019s touch base in about a year.\u201d\n\nAnd who could blame them, 2020 was a weird year.\n\nBut he needed to raise money and to most people, Jesse just seemed crazy. While Jesse dealt with the anxiety and despair that came with 2020, he also had to get enough money to match his founding investor\u2019s investment.\n\nA $15,000 fund from ALA helped turn things around and in February the electric motorcycles landed in Kenya \u2013 sort of.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe thing is, when you import something from China, especially these bikes, you have no manuals whatsoever. So we had no way of knowing what to assemble because there was a huge language barrier, so it was incredibly challenging.\u201d Jesse said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really happy that one of my chief engineers is a really smart guy and a biker.\u201d\n\nFor the next month, the team would spend time figuring out the bikes and how to assemble them. They were working \u201cfrom eight to eight\u201d.\n\nA deadline for a prototype bike was fast approaching and during our call, Jesse reminisced about what it felt like at the time.\n\nThey were just four men in his living room, trying to put an electronic boda together. It was a Saturday when they decided they were going to have to work all night to figure it out. That night, they had ugali and eggs for dinner.\n\nBy 6 am on Sunday, with none of them having slept a wink, they had built their first product, by themselves, in Jesse\u2019s living room.\n\n\u201cAnd right now I\u2019m really proud to say that all the bikes we have are fully assembled here in Kenya, by Kenyans. And we have the capacity to assemble \u2013 with a really small team \u2013 over 200 bikes, a month from parts all the way up. Without investment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always tell investors, \u2018You guys give us X cash, you can imagine what we can do.\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nI asked Jesse Forrester, as I always do with these interviews, to tell me what plans he has for the future.\n\n\u201cThe total estimated addressable market right now stands at about $12 billion in East Africa, for electric motorbikes alone, and I say hey we want to capture a fraction of the market so I want to do over 1000 bodas by the end of next year. I want to get to over 5000 bodas by the end of 2023 with up to 200 tuktuks and 100 matatus.\u201d\n\nFrom your mouth to God\u2019s ears, Jesse.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "SEC approves Chaka as first licensed stock trading app in Nigeria",
          "text": "After months of uncertainty regarding regulations, Chaka has received a license from Nigeria\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to operate its digital platform for buying and selling stocks.\n\nChaka becomes the first to acquire the digital sub-broker license introduced by SEC in April of this year. As part of a major amendment to its Consolidated Rules and Regulations, SEC recognised sub-brokers who use digital platforms to serve multiple brokers.\n\nTosin Osibodu, the startup\u2019s CEO, said on a call on Wednesday that the acquisition took \u201ca tremendous amount of effort\u201d and is the fruit of frequent engagement with the capital markets regulator.\n\nOn the 19th of December 2020, the SEC published a statement that effectively barred Chaka from offering its services in Nigeria. SEC\u2019s complaint was that Chaka operated \u201coutside the regulatory purview of the Commission and without requisite registration, as stipulated by the Investment and Securities Act 2007.\u201d\n\nSEC ordered Chaka to stop advertising to users, justifying it as a need to prevent \u201cunscrupulous actors\u201d from harming the investing public. Though the order was particular to Chaka, it was the first major signal that regulation was coming to the investment-tech sector.\n\nThat December warning enabled Chaka to take the lead and open talks with the SEC. With the license now acquired, Osibodu says it affirms Chaka\u2019s commitment to full regulatory compliance and provides clarity to the market.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve built a great relationship [with SEC] that we think will be beneficial for the whole ecosystem moving forward,\u201d Osibodu said.\n\nHe said the license also means Chaka could now enable other stockbroking firms who want to have a digital presence. \u201cWe want this benefit to accrue to as many stockbrokers as possible.\u201d\n\nUntil now, Chaka\u2019s operations were based on a partnership with Citi Investment Capital Ltd, a Lagos-based broker licensed by the SEC. An official license now places the startup directly under SEC\u2019s supervision.\n\nChaka\u2019s app hosts over 4,000 stocks from publicly traded companies in Nigeria and the US. Founded in January 2019 by Osibodu with Olaolu Ajose as the chief technology officer, the startup bills itself as an \u201cinvestment passport\u201d which powers borderless investing for users.\n\nAnyone with an internet-enabled smartphone can download the app, sign up and begin investing with $2 or \u20a61,000. Chaka is only available in Nigeria at the moment.\n\nOsibodu did not specify what Chaka did, in terms of fees or filings, to receive the license.\n\nBut according to the SEC\u2019s recent amendment (pdf, page 3), a sub-broker license for digital platforms involves a minimum capital of \u20a610 million and a Fidelity Bond covering at least 20% of the minimum capital.\n\nOther requirements include four separate fees totalling \u20a6500,000, a number of SEC forms, company documents and other documentation about people involved with the company.\n\nDigital sub-brokers are also required to fully describe the technology that their infrastructure is built on, including details about security, backup and recovery processes.\n\nThey should have adequate Know Your Customer processes and have documented policies for managing technology risks. Also, they are expected to show how they assess the capacity of potential customers to use its platform for transactions, plus clear explanations of the features, risks, responsibilities, obligations and liabilities that come with using the app.\n\nIt is not clear if this license officially permits Chaka (and other fintechs in the sector) to offer stocks listed in foreign markets \u2013 like Tesla and Google \u2013 to Nigerians. In April, SEC sounded a warning that seemed to declare such offerings as being illegal.\n\nOsibodu\u2019s coy response was that Chaka is committed to SEC\u2019s objectives for financial inclusion in Nigeria by, among other things, increasing retail investor participation in the financial markets.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it to a whatsapp group or telegram channel.\n\n.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "From Konga to mPharma, logistics for health products is growing in Africa",
          "text": "\u201cPeople order drugs on Jumia?\u201d\n\nThat was the reaction from the most ardent online shopper I know. She buys running shoes, mom jeans and hair products but doesn\u2019t understand why anyone would buy drugs online. It just doesn\u2019t feel right for her to buy ingestible medicines on the same website she shops for underwear.\n\nBut a search under Jumia\u2019s \u2018medications & treatments\u2019 tab reveals syrups, nasal sprays, and pain relief capsules. At the bottom of their healthcare page, a blurb assures visitors that products listed on the website are from \u201cvarious trusted brands that will meet your health needs.\u201d\n\nIndeed, African e-commerce marketplaces are venturing into the delivery of health care products as part of a strategy to broaden their value to customers.\n\nThese platforms are part of a broader crop of innovators at an interesting intersection of healthcare and logistics on the continent. Going by recent data, this sub-sector has grown over two years.\n\nAt least 61 companies are using tech for health distribution across sub-saharan Africa, a growth of over 100% in the number of active players (28) captured in 2018. That\u2019s according to a report by Salient Advisory, an Africa-focused healthcare consultancy.\n\nThese health logistics companies include e-commerce players like Jumia, Copia and Konga, and also core health startups like mPharma, Lifestores Pharmacy, Chekkit and Sproxil. Salient\u2019s report focuses on companies delivering over-the-counter products, hence it does not include LifeBank which specializes in blood and oxygen products.\n\nMost of these companies are in Nigeria, Ghana, Uganda and Kenya with only 6 spotted in the francophone region. 31% of the companies surveyed were founded within the last two years and 62% operate in a single African country.\n\nSnapshot of innovators in the health products distribution space in Africa. Source: Salient Advisory.\n\nSalient categorizes the landscape of companies into three groups by the type of service they deliver: consumer-facing companies, producer-facing companies and product data companies.\n\nThe first group of companies (like Drugstore.ng) deliver over-the-counter and prescription drugs as well as virtual patient care to individuals. Provider-facing ones serve healthcare businesses either by delivering to them, hosting an online marketplace, providing inventory management tools (an example here is Lifestores Pharmacy) and/or offering financing.\n\nThe third group offers data related services like product analytics and drug authenticity verification. An example in this category is Chekkit, a verification technology startup that was recently accepted into Google for Startups accelerator programme for 2021.\n\nTraditional e-commerce platforms like Jumia, Copia and Konga are able to play in the consumer and provider-facing buckets. Because of their presence in multiple African countries, all three companies surpass the combined reach of other direct-to-consumer startups in the health product distribution space.\n\n\u201cWhat they are doing can accelerate access to medicines and have an incredible impact on public health,\u201d says Yomi Kazeem, one of the authors of Salient Advisory\u2019s report.\n\nAccording to Konga\u2019s co-CEO Nick Imudia, the e-commerce company\u2019s plan to deliver health products started shortly after they were acquired by the Zinox Group three years ago.\n\n\u201cWe started building warehouses and logistics assets to enable us to reach every local government area in the country,\u201d Imudia says to TechCabal.\n\nKonga.com is a marketplace where pharmaceutical companies can list health products like medicines. Konga delivers orders from those pharmacies to individual consumers.\n\nBut beyond fulfilling orders to individuals, Konga plans to go bigger by working on bulk orders between pharmacies and businesses or government agencies, Imudia says. That will require some investments on infrastructure for cold distribution and ensuring warehouses are of the right temperature.\n\nSalient Advisory\u2019s report notes that \u201cclear and harmonised regulations\u201d could boost this entry of e-commerce players into the health products distribution space.\n\nKonga has two licenses to directly distribute products for drug manufacturers and import drugs from the Pharmaceutical Council of Nigeria, Imudia says. But he clarifies that Konga will not act as a pharmacy by selling drugs directly to consumers \u2013 but will rely on its marketplace platform that allows merchants to sell on Konga.com\n\nHow big can this new business line be for Konga? Imudia declines to share what health products logistics currently contributes to Konga\u2019s overall business. But he believes it will be \u201ca major part\u201d of Konga\u2019s business in the future.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it to a whatsapp group or telegram channel.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "In Hero Mode, all Troy wants is to work at Playfield, his mom\u2019s 12-year-old gaming company. But she insists he focus on a dull computer science course at school. The real reason, however, is that she wants him to have a \u201cnormal\u201d childhood away from video games.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem: Playfield is sinking. Their only potential angel investor bailed because their latest game sucked. A cheap buy offer from a rival is on the table.\n\nBut Troy convinces his mom to let him rebuild the game. He adds a rainbow that talks and a Barack Obama feature. And the rest is\u2026 actually, go watch the rest.\n\nReal life Troy stories are rare in Nigeria but an active gaming community is growing. Platforms like Twitch and Discord are spurring a global gaming economy and a means for financial independence for young Nigerians \u2013 like Olaide and Ying-Yi Akanji.\n\nThey met in 2012 at a GCE exam hall. When they started dating, Olaide introduced Ying-Yi (who is half-Nigerian, half-Taiwanese) to online gaming. Now married, they are an ardent gaming couple.\n\nWhile speaking with them on Tech Republic \u2013 a weekly radio show produced by 88.5 UFM Lagos in collaboration with TechCabal \u2013 I felt nudged to pick a controller and earn some recharge card money, at least. But how does a rusty Millennial get started?\n\nBelow is an excerpt of the chat with the Akanji\u2019s, edited for clarity. Most questions are from Tech Republic hosts Jay and Didi.\n\nJay: What\u2019s the situation with gaming in Nigeria?\n\nOlaide: I have been playing video games since I was a kid. My first Playstation 2 was from my dad. I became very good at gaming but I felt it couldn\u2019t take me anywhere because our 300kbps internet was so bad. Playing online was just impossible.\n\nThen I moved to the UK to study software engineering and everything was better. I dived into e-sports and built a following on Twitch. But I was not comfortable with a foreign audience. Gaming was more fun when I moved back. I could chat and banter on my streams in Pidgin and Yoruba.\n\nBut then came the issues \u2013 internet and electricity. It was demotivating to the point where I almost quit. The main problem was ping \u2013 a measure of how fast you get responses when you click to pass or shoot or any other action.\n\nOur problem here is that when you click on a button for any of those actions, it needs to travel to a server in Europe before it returns to Nigeria. And if you are playing against someone in Europe, their ping is much faster. I may shoot him first but it may not get to him when I do; then he shoots a second later and wins. That\u2019s why you have not seen Nigerians breakthrough internationally.\n\nDidi: Okay, how do I get into gaming? Can I start now even if I didn\u2019t play as a kid?\n\nOlaide: Yes you can! That\u2019s what I love about gaming. When people tell me they don\u2019t like video games, I say you haven\u2019t tried it out. There are so many games out there, it\u2019s impossible for you to hate them all.\n\nA 16-year-old kid won $3million playing Fortnite in 2019 and I actually played in that tournament. I made it into the top 1,000 from the initial 80 million people. The top 100 played in the finals in the US.\n\nBut that prize money shows how this sport has grown. I think the biggest prize money ever won in Nigeria was around \u20a65million.\n\nJay: This is really an untapped market in Nigeria\n\nOlaide: Oh my God, there\u2019s so much potential. I\u2019ve had many conversations with companies that want to get into online gaming but they fear the risks. And it\u2019s understandable because you need 24/7 electricity.\n\nI\u2019ve heard stories about NEPA taking power in the middle of a tournament. It\u2019s painful. When we compete against South Africans, they win because their internet is better.\n\nStill, the Nigerian gaming community is growing.\n\nDidi: How many female gamers are in Nigeria?\n\nYing-Yi: We have quite a few, but the gaming scene is saturated with guys. Girls in Nigeria have less time to play video games because they are more likely to do house chores, while guys can keep playing. Women gamers have to put in more effort. That means we are not a lot but we are getting there.\n\nParents also need to understand that gaming helps to improve cognitive reasoning of both boys and girls. Yes it can be sedentary but parents can set the balance between gaming and other activities.\n\nAlexander: So how do you pitch online gaming to people in government, as something good for the digital economy?\n\nOlaide: People are investing in electronic sports (esports) because every competition provides a level playing field for amateur and expert gamers. No connections needed.\n\nAnybody can buy a console, start playing and competing. Gamers like TimTheTatman are terrible at gaming but make millions because they make entertaining gaming videos. That opportunity should be open to all Nigerian youth looking for jobs and alternative income streams.\n\n\u2014\n\nListen to Tech Republic every Thursday at 2pm WAT on 88.5 UFM Lagos. Brought to you in collaboration with TechCabal.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued a new license for digital stock trading to Chaka technologies limited.\n\nThe commission\u2019s Sub-Broker Serving Multiple Brokers Through a Digital Platform License will enable Chaka to offer stocks directly to Nigerian investors. The licence also lets the company work with multiple stockbrokers and help digitise their services.\n\nFounded in 2019, the Chaka offers over 4000 stocks from the US, the UK, China, and Nigeria. Along with players like Bamboo, Trove and Risevest, the investment-tech space has been gradually expanding.\n\nWhile Chaka did not have a stockbroking licence at the time, it struck a partnership with Citi Investment Capital Limited for Nigerian stocks and DriveWealth LLC for its foreign stock offerings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer its legal page, the startup did not manage investor funds itself, as that was the purview of licenced brokers; it simply served as a digital outlet that brings the capital market to a wider audience.\n\nHowever, in December 2020, Chaka received a surprise as SEC issued a court order that effectively restricted it from offering stocks to the investing public.\n\nIn April 2021, the regulator followed this up by warning investment-tech platforms to desist from offering US stocks to Nigerians.\n\nA changing structure?\n\nTosin Osibodu, CEO, Chaka\n\nTosin Osibodu, CEO of Chaka, reveals that the company has been actively engaging SEC since the circular was first released in December 2020.\n\nOsibodu reveals that the new digital sub-broker licence would change its investment operations structure as it would no longer need to operate through a broker.\n\n\u201cWe now have direct oversight from SEC. So the customer is aware that all the funds and his entire account are supervised directly by the SEC,\u201d he reveals.\n\nThough SEC has not published a specific regulatory framework for the Digital Sub-broker licence, an April 2021 amendment to the SEC rule indicates that the regulator now fully recognises the presence of investment-tech platforms.\n\nAccording to SEC, the \u2018\u2019Sub-broker Serving Multiple Brokers Through a Digital Platform\u2019\u2019 uses a digital platform to serve clients and interact with the sponsoring broker or brokers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer Osibodu, Chaka can now help regular stockbrokers digitise their services.\n\nThis new licence category requires a $24,300 (\u20a610 million) paid-up capital requirement, a Fidelity bond covering 20% of the paid-up capital, and four application fees that cumulatively cost $1200 (\u20a6500k).\n\nWhile Osibodu does not confirm if this licence addresses SEC\u2019s warning against offering foreign stocks, he affirms that it will be business as usual for its customers. Osibodu\u2019s affirmation implies that the company would continue offering both local and foreign shares to investors.\n\nNigeria\u2019s vast and diverse fintech space is replete with sub-sectors that either have defined or undefined regulations. But that appears to be changing.\n\nPer its recent circular, the commission wants fintech companies without defined regulations to undergo an incubation program from Q3 2021.\n\nThough SEC has not issued an official framework on the new sub-broker licence, other industry players would likely follow suit. Meanwhile, the regulator might be coming up with more defined regulations that would, in its words, \u201cPromote innovation, and bring more people into the Nigerian Capital market.\u201d\n\nAs we\u2019ve examined previously, it would take a lot more than technology to boost Nigeria\u2019s capital market, and any regulatory reform that promotes this would be a welcome initiative.",

This means the phone-based service has been transferred to its affiliate, Airtel Mobile Commerce Uganda Limited (AMC Uganda).\n\nThis separation follows Uganda\u2019s National Payment Systems (NPS) Act, 2020, passed on 4th September 2020. The regulation was announced in an official newspaper on 5th March 2021.\n\nPer Section 9 of the Act, the Bank of Uganda announced the issuance of two licences to AMC Uganda on May 24, 2021.\n\nThe first licence is a Payment Service Provider \u2014 Class A Licence, Number PSP 01/21 \u2014 which authorises the company to offer electronic Airtel Money services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe second licence is a Payment System Operator Licence \u2014 (Electronic Money Systems), Number PSO 01/21 \u2014 which authorises AMC Uganda to operate a payment platform (Airtel Money).\n\nThus, in Uganda, AMC will conduct all Airtel Money services while partnering with and through the licensed telecommunications network of Airtel Uganda.\n\nThe separation will result in the migration or sharing of the Airtel Money accounts and related information with the new company.\n\nMoreover, Airtel Uganda will now focus on the operations of telecommunication infrastructure and the offering of telecommunications services to its network subscribers and licensed operators.\n\nRecall that in 2015, a commercial High Court ruled against five telcos \u2014 MTN, Warid, Uganda Telecom, Airtel, and Africell \u2014 operating mobile money in Uganda, saying that mobile money operations were illegal.\n\nThe pronouncement followed a petition by Abdu Kantunu, a Bugweri County Member of Parliament, to have mobile money regulated under the Financial Institutions Act of Uganda.\n\nThe reason was that the companies were registered as telcos and not as financial institutions, which means the Bank of Uganda did not license them.\n\nFollowing this recent separation, AMC Uganda is now regulated and supervised by the Bank of Uganda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReportedly, the Ugandan government intends to enhance financial inclusion, especially for the rural population, via access to financial service by separating telecommunication services from financial services.\n\nWhile customers may be worried about the new change, Manoj Murali, Managing Director, Airtel Uganda, assured customers that the split doesn\u2019t change their services.\n\nHe clarified that the affiliate company, AMC Uganda, will provide Airtel Money services to registered subscribers of Airtel Uganda with the same terms and conditions.\n\nSimilarly, MTN Uganda promised to hand over its financial services and change its name from MTN MoMo to MTN Uganda Limited on June 1, 2021. It also assured customers that financial and telecommunication services would be normal following the separation.\n\nThis seems like a common practice in a few African countries.\n\nIn 2015, Ghana broke-up its telecommunication services from financial services, ensuring that all institutions offering the latter are regulated under the Banking Act, 2004 (Act 673).\n\nAlso, Kenya Information and Communication (Amendment) Bill 2019 could force its telecom operators in Kenya to separate financial services from telecom services if approved.\n\nIn 2020, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) reportedly sent a circular to telecom companies, among other non-financial institutions, to apply for licences to become payment banks.\n\nThis involves setting up a separate company and depositing a minimum capital of $13 million (\u20a65.3 billion).

          "text": "Editor\u2019s Note: The following is a repurposing of a random conversation that started in Techpoint Africa\u2019s team WhatsApp group.\n\nOghenekaro Obrutu (Techpoint Product Lead) asked:\n\nOf the tech giants (Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Apple and Facebook). Who do you think is most likely to collapse first? (Think like Yahoo, BlackBerry, Kodak etc). P.S: I know there isn\u2019t a huge chance of this, but just rank them in order of likely to unlikely (to collapse). Just to get an idea of how solid they really are. Advertisement\n\nTeam responses ensue\u2026\n\nThen comes Oghenekaro\u2019s answer, increasing order of unlikelihood:\n\nFacebook\n\nFacebook CEO, Mark Zuckgerberg\n\nFacebook has the weakest business model in my opinion. If there\u2019s a mass exodus from Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp today due to cancel culture or something (and there are several competing products rising in their space right now), I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll survive.\n\nThey basically have only Oculus to rely on for revenue, and even then, that won\u2019t cut it as profit margins there are quite slim.\n\nBut that\u2019s not even counting what\u2019s more likely to kill them \u2014 government regulations.\n\nVerdict: Probably a very quick death for these ones\n\nGoogle (Alphabet)\n\nPhoto on Photostockeditor\n\nMore than 80% of Google\u2019s revenue is still stuck in Ads. With regulations on cookies and tracking constantly biting at them, and the fact that they have offered too much stuff for free, it\u2019ll be hard to make up that 80% in any reasonable time if for some reason they can\u2019t advertise.\n\nVerdict: Most likely a slow death\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApple\n\nThey have been desperately trying to diversify incomes recently but almost everything they offer is still closed in their ecosystem. Their major attractions are quite fickle if you think about it.\n\nFirst one is their ecosystem, which is pretty great because all their stuff works well together.\n\nBut if one of their products fails or is out innovated by someone else, they could lose many users across all their products, because their other products won\u2019t play nice.\n\nSecond attraction is their social allure and brand, but a brand can go from 100 to 0 pretty quickly (remember BlackBerry was king of social proof before they went down).\n\nIf for some reason their devices stop being trendy or there\u2019s a new trendy thing, then they lose almost all they have.\n\nVerdict: Slow or quick death, it depends.\n\nAmazon\n\nPhoto by Rich Bamford https://www.flickr.com/photos/[email protected]/29934487872\n\nI consider Amazon to be tied with Microsoft for least likely to collapse for similar reasons; their money primary comes from governments, institutions and massive enterprises (including Apple).\n\nWhat\u2019s common with huge organisations is that they are extremely resistant to change, so even if a better technology comes along it\u2019ll take a while before Amazon Web Services (AWS) starts losing business.\n\nRunning nearly half of the entire internet is quite a feat.\n\nOh, and there\u2019s still their mainstream Amazon.com, where they have every other person\u2019s business (hardware, ads, software, even on demand streaming and more).\n\nVerdict: I don\u2019t know how these ones can die.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nSimilar to Amazon in the enterprise space. Add that to their Surface line, Windows, Xbox, Office and whatever else they\u2019ve got running.\n\nVerdict: Like Amazon, I can\u2019t predict how they can die",

An alarming 4.4 million people are expected to need food assistance during the current lean season. This includes an estimated 775,000 people facing emergency levels of food insecurity, with an elevated risk of famine in areas that are cut-off from assistance due to high levels of insecurity and targeted attacks on humanitarian workers.\n\nIn response, the acting High Commissioner of Canada in Nigeria, Nicolas Simard, is pleased to announce that Canada is providing $26.95 million in new humanitarian assistance funding to help meet the basic needs of conflict-affected populations. This funding will help provide food assistance, treatment for acute malnutrition and other critical health care, safe water and sanitation, and protection services. Canada\u2019s support is being provided through experienced humanitarian partners, including UN agencies, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, and non-governmental organizations. This assistance is in line with commitments made under the G7 Famine Prevention and Humanitarian Crises Compact, which notes north-east Nigeria as being at immediate risk of famine.\n\nCanada\u2019s funding is focused on supporting gender-responsive humanitarian action, recognizing that women and girls continue to be disproportionately affected by the ongoing conflict. This includes improving access to sexual and reproductive health care, preventing and responding to sexual and gender-based violence, and supporting the leadership, participation, and decision-making of women and girls in humanitarian action.\n\nTo complement its humanitarian assistance, Canada is also providing $5.5 million to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization to help conflict and pandemic-affected households in the north-east regain and strengthen their livelihoods. This funding aims to help restore the self-sufficiency and resilience of affected communities, with a focus on women\u2019s empowerment.\n\nIn fiscal year 2019/20, Canada provided over $123 million in international assistance to Nigeria, making it the 6th largest recipient of Canada\u2019s international assistance worldwide.\n\nQuotes\n\n\u201cThe conflict in north-east Nigeria continues to exact a terrible toll on vulnerable populations, with women and girls suffering the worst effects of the crisis.

          "text": "Getting a second jab of the COVID-19 vaccine does not necessarily reduce one\u2019s chance of infection, but reduce the chance of getting ill, says the Lagos state commissioner for health, Prof. Akin Abayomi, while urging Lagosians who have received the first dose of the vaccine, to go get their second jab.\n\nAdvertisements\n\n\n\n\n\nAbayomi who made this call on Wednesday after receiving his second jab, noted that the second dose of the vaccine helps to boost immunity, thereby reducing one\u2019s chance of getting ill to the point of complication or death, if infected with COVID again.\n\nThe commissioner explained that with the second jab he received, he was certain that his immunity is built up.\n\n\u201cIf I come across the virus either by contacting someone or in an environment when the virus is in the air, the virus will try to infect me again but the vaccination would have built up my immunity; and you know I have had COVID before, so when you\u2019ve had COVID plus the vaccination, you immune system is really high.\n\n\u201cWhat this means is that you can still catch COVID but it won\u2019t create an illness that results in complications that can lead to death. So what we are trying to do here is not necessarily reduce your chance of infection, but reduce your chance of getting ill and dying; which is what we are all about, we are just trying to save lives,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to him, there are multiple variants of the virus circulating around the world which the World Health Organisation (WHO) has reclassified into Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta variants of COVID.\n\nAdvertisements\n\n\u201cThe virus is changing and as it changes, it can deceive your immune system, so even if you\u2019ve had it before, the new virus variants that are coming on now, your body may not recognize it as the original COVID and it can therefore make you unwell.\n\n\u201cSo we are saying, if you\u2019ve had the infection before and you\u2019ve had the two doses of the vaccine, at least it gives you a start to fight the virus and stop you from getting sick,\u201d he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHighlighting various strategies put in place by the Lagos State government to mitigate a possible third wave of COVID-19, Abayomi stated that the most likely source of the virus that is going to cause a third wave in Lagos or in Nigeria is going to be imported.\n\n\u201cIn Lagos, we have what is called the Third Wave Prevention Strategy and the most likely source of the virus that is going to cause a third wave in Lagos or in Nigeria is going to be imported. So, we have put very tight measures at the airport.\n\n\u201cAnybody coming in from a country where we know there are variants of COVID will get mandatory isolation, a test immediately they arrive and another test on day seven; so we are testing twice now.\n\n\u201cYou heard that some people were trying to avoid this new guidelines and the federal government and Lagos State Government is going to come down very hard on them. They will have their passport suspended, they may be arrested, fined and if not a Nigerian, their work permit and visitors\u2019 visa may be cancelled.\n\n\u201cSo, these severe sanctions are for people who are going to try and avoid the new guidelines that have been established by the Federal Government to stop the importation into Nigeria which can trigger a third wave.\n\n\u201cWe have picked up some positives and we have isolated them, that means that they cannot spread that virus into the community and that is why we are still enjoying freedom from third wave but if we relax and we do not become as stringent and watchful as we are now, the third wave may come in,\u201d Abayomi stated.",

          "text": "Tunde Opalana, Abuja\n\nThe Senate has ordered a hike in importation duties on syringes and needles into the country and therefore recommended 75 percent port duties.\n\nThis is as the upper chamber mandated full implementation of the policy on usage of locally manufactured syringes and needles by federal government owned hospitals and health institutions across the country.\n\nThe two directives were meant to protect local manufacturers, give them enabling environment to contribute to the revenue base of the nation and to reduce unemployment.\n\nThese mandatory recommendations followed the consideration and approval of the reports of the Senate Committee on Health presented by chairman, Sen. Yahaya Oloriegbe (Kwara Central).\n\nAccording to the chairman, the committee discovered that majority of the imported syringes and needles are substandard, unsterile (used and rewashed syringes from Asian continent) hence endangering the lives, health and safety of Nigerians.\n\nHe said \u201cdespite several policies of the Federal Government especially the introduction of 75% import duties on imported Syringes and Needles to deter importation, the Nigeria Customs Services has not been able to enforce this effectively, thereby leading to mass importation of cheap, substandard and\n\nunsterile syringes and needles.\n\n\u201cImportation of syringes and needles is killing local manufacturers making them to lay off staff and preventing them from contributing effectively to the economy.\n\n\u201cNAFDAC regulates seven (7) products including Syringes and Needles. NAFDAC has a 5+5 policy which means at the end of 5 years the importer must migrate from importation to manufacturing. This policy is just 2 years in operation hence it has not been applied to this sector.\n\n\u201d The Federal Ministry of Health lacks policy on the procurement and utilization of Syringes and Needles by government-owned Hospitals and agencies. This has led to government-owned hospitals to sometimes procure and use substandard Syringes and Needles in their hospitals and medical centres.\n\n\u201cCompulsory requirement for manufacturers to register to pre-qualify for the World Health Organisation\u2019s certification costs about $1.5bn. This has been an impediment to local manufacturers attaining this status and preventing their being patronized by organisations using donor funds\u201d.\n\nThe committee therefore recommended that \u201cthe Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment should finalise the process of approval of the Backward Integration Policy(BIP) (for the sector) by the Federal Executive Council and commence the implementation of the Policy by 1#t August 2021.\n\nThat \u201cas a matter of urgency, the Federal Government should fully implement 75% import duties on the Importation of syringes and needles and put stringent measures to the defaulters thereby encouraging local manufacturers and ensuring employment opportunities. Towards this end, the Nigeria Customs Services should enforce this policy.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Health should develop a policy on the procurement and utilization of Syringes and Needles by government hospitals and offices by 1st July 2021. That is within six (6) weeks all Federal Government owned hospitals are to use locally manufactured Syringes and Needles in order to strengthen local manufacturing.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Health should develop and implement a Policy Guideline that will ensure that all hospitals projects and programmes funded with the government of Nigeria\u2019s funds to procure and use Syringes and Needles approved by relevant Nigerian Regulatory Bodies without a requirement for World Health Organisation\u2019s pre-qualification.\n\nThe Senate also asked syringes and needles manufacturers to take the advantage of the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s Special Intervention Fund for the Health sector to improve and extend their capacities.\n\nRecalled that the Medical Device Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MDMAN), producers of syringes and needles sought the intervention of both the Senate Committee on Health and of Industry Trade and Investment on the implementation of exiting policies meant to protect local manufacturers.\n\nThe association in its petition, had alleged that government at all tiers were not patronizing local manufacturers but instead patronize foreign syringes and needles.\n\nPresident of the Medical Devices Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MEDMAN), Mr Akin Oyediran had during interface with the Senate committees and the Health minister, Dr. Osagie Ehanire and NAFDAC Director General, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye said the implementation of the policy would stop importation of low quality medical devices that may expose patients to health dangers.\n\nOyediran explained that the Backward Integration Policy (BIP) entails Nigerian manufacturers\u2019 right to produce syringes for local market and can import same to meet local demands if their factories could not produce enough quantity to satisfy local needs .\n\nREAD ALSO: Igala Will Not Be Part Of Biafra \u2013 Group Tells Nnamdi Kanu\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have the capacity to produce the required syringes and needles that we need in the country.\n\n\u201cOne of the manufacturers in Nigeria, the Jubilee Syringe of which I am the MD is the largest manufacturers of Syringes in Africa.\n\n\u201cThe local manufacturers are actually the highest supplies of syringes and needles for hospitals. There is no point in why government hospitals should use imported syringes when we have locally manufactured ones.",

          "text": "A Kenyan woman Florence Mwende Musau living in Massachusetts, United States has admitted to her role in an elaborate romance scam, masterminded by Nigerian Mark Arome Okuo, that bilked multiple men out of more than $4million.\n\nFour Nigerians, among whom were Osakpamwan Henry Omoruyi, 36 and Osaretin Godspower Omoruyi, 34, both residing in Canton, Mass. were indicted for similar romance scams in March.\n\nAlso charged with one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud. was Macpherson Osemwegie, 32, of Hyde Park.\n\nMike Oziegbe Amiegbe, 42, another Nigerian residing in Dorchester, Mass., was charged in a third complaint with one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud.\n\nHowever, Okuo, 41, a Nigerian residing in Canton and Musau, 36, were charged in a separate complaint with one count of conspiracy to commit wire and bank fraud.\n\nThe Kenyan who previously resided in Canton, pleaded guilty on Monday to federal counts of conspiracy to commit wire and bank fraud, the US attorney\u2019s office in Boston said.\n\nShe faces a maximum of 30 years in prison when she is sentenced on October 14 by U.S. District Court Judge Allison D. Burroughs.\n\nOn March 25, 2021, Musau and five others were charged in connection with their roles in online scams that are alleged to have collectively defrauded victims of more than $4 million.\n\nAccording to the charging documents, Musau participated in a series of romance scams designed to defraud victims into sending money to bank accounts controlled by her and others.\n\nRomance scams occur when a criminal adopts a fake online identity to gain a victim\u2019s affection and trust. The scammer then uses the illusion of a romantic or close relationship to manipulate and/or steal from the victim.\n\nTo carry out the schemes, Musau used fake passports in the names of numerous aliases to open bank accounts in and around Boston to collect and launder the proceeds of the romance scams.\n\nShe then executed large cash withdrawals from those accounts, often multiple times on a single day and generally structured in amounts less than $10,000, in an effort to evade detection and currency transaction reporting requirements.\n\nSome of the fake names she used to open bank accounts in the Boston area were Precious Adams and Catherine Muthoki.\n\nShe would collect the money in cash and then laundered the proceeds of the scams, prosecutors said.\n\nMusau and one of her alleged accomplices, 41-year-old Nigerian national Mark Arome Okuo, were accused of transferring or depositing $1.3million in fraudulent proceeds, since 2018, into various bank accounts, including $195,000 obtained through five romance scams.\n\nA criminal complaint by the Department of Justice in Distict of Massachusetts , details how Okuo would allegedly meet women on dating sites and pretend to be a US Army soldier serving in the Middle East or Africa.\n\nAs the relationships developed, Okuo claimed that he needed the women to wire him money so that he could leave the military and return to the US to marry them, according to the court documents.\n\nIn one case, a victim was said to have transferred $137,000 to bank accounts controlled by Okuo and Musau, thinking it would help her groom-to-be to obtain his military retirement benefits early.\n\nIn another case, Okuo allegedly told a woman from Georgia that he lived in Kuwait and worked in the oil industry, but was in love with her and needed $4,700 to return to the US to be with her. The victim promptly wired the sum to an account controlled by the accused con man.\n\nAs part of the dating scam, Musau swindled a California resident she met on social media out of $7,800 by claiming that she was a United Nations refugee camp worker who needed the money to return to the US to start a new life with him.\n\nThe bank accounts opened by the accused con artists also were used to collect a further $20,000 through pandemic unemployment benefits in the names of unsuspecting Massachusetts residents who did not apply for such benefits.\n\nThe charge of conspiracy to commit wire and bank fraud provide for a sentence of up to 30 years in prison, five years of supervised release, a fine of up to $1 million or twice the gross gain or loss, whichever is greater, restitution, and forfeiture.\n\nSentences are imposed by a federal district court judge based upon the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.\n\nActing United States Attorney Nathaniel R. Mendell; Joseph R. Bonavolonta, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Boston Division; William S. Walker, Acting Special Agent in Charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Boston; Joshua McCallister, Acting Inspector in Charge of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, Boston Division; and Jonathan Davidson, Special Agent in Charge of the U.S. Department of State\u2019s Diplomatic Security Service made the announcement on Monday.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Ian Stearns of Mendell\u2019s Securities, Financial & Cyber Fraud Unit is prosecuting the case.\n\nThe details contained in the charging documents are allegations. The remaining defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.",

Willie Obiano, raised up Soludo\u2019s hand as the duly elected candidate of the party in the forthcoming election.\n\nIn his remark, Obiano congratulated Soludo for his victory while calling on party faithful to continue to support the party.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, the former CBN governor said he welcomed the nomination of APGA to fly their banner in the forthcoming governorship election.\n\n\u201cI accept your nomination in the November 6 governorship election. I am proud that I came from Anambra. I offer nothing but statement of gratitude, thank you for the mandate to fly our flag. I assure INEC that APGA is a law-abiding party.\n\n\u201cI salute the other aspirants. I salute you. This is the time to unite. We won the primary by over 80 percent, but let us come together. The coming election is consequential for the state. It will determine our match for progression of retrogression,\u201d he said.\n\nSoludo commended previous governors of Anambra for transforming the state, but noted that Governor Willy Obiano had taken the state to the next level.\n\nHe said there is no state government in Nigeria with comparable revenue like Anambra State that is doing well than the present administration, saying there is no need to change a winning team.\n\n\u201cWe need continuity, consolidation and transformation, we need to build on what is on ground. We will unveil our campaign manifesto in August. I am a poor boy whom God has raised to serve. I have been decorated with over 200 awards.\n\n\u201cI believe it is now time for me to serve my people. I have decided to give back to the people.\n\nOpinion polls, he said, showed that members of other political parties said they would support him if he emerged APGA candidate, he said.\n\nIn a reaction, Chief Neville Uchendu, a chieftain of APGA said the outcome of APGA primary was a tip of the iceberg on what would happen during Nov.6 election.\n\n\u201cSoludo is greatly loved by Anambra people and they will massively vote for him during the election,\u201d he said.\n\nDelegates for the election had assembled at the popular Alex Ekwueme Square Awka, for accreditation before proceeding to Prof. Dora Akunyuli Women Development Centre.\n\nThere was heavy security presence at the two locations in Awka even as journalists were refused entry into the two places.",

          "text": "Chairman, Nigerian Indigenous Nationalities Alliance for Self-Determination (NINAS), Prof. Banji Akintoye on Wednesday said it is time the Yoruba people hold a referendum to secede from Nigeria.\n\nAkintoye, in a statement said the Yoruba people must now move forward to accomplish their Yoruba Nation\u2019s self-determination by holding a referendum.\n\n\u201cA referendum is exactly like a regular election in which people line up at voting stations to vote for a candidate.\n\n\u201cI want the Yoruba Republic separate from Nigeria. Each voter will be able to vote YES or NO. That is the Yoruba Nation Referendum,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut we Yoruba need to take some steps before we can get to our referendum. The first step is to make a strong statement loud and clear that we Yoruba want a referendum. The best peaceful way to make that statement is to circulate a petition among us that we want a referendum,\u201d he added.\n\nAkintoye urged all the millions of Yoruba people within and beyond Nigeria to vote in support of that petition, saying that signing in the petition that they wanted the Yoruba Nation would enable the group use the petition supported by millions of Yoruba people as a weapon to get referendum.\n\nAccording to him, the group might use the petitions to pressurise the Federal Government to grant Yoruba people referendum, adding that the chances were that the Federal Government would not grant the petition.\n\nAlternatively, Akintoye said the group might take their petition to state government and demand that they should grant them referendum.\n\n\u201cSince our state governments are our own elected governments, we have a much better chance to compel them to do what we will want. What we will need is intense pressure persistently applied. We must not take no for answer.\n\n\u201cFinally, we can take our petition to the United Nations and demand of them to come and arrange our referendum. The United Nations has carried out referendums in many parts of the world. One such referendum made it possible for South Sudan to break away from the Republic of Sudan. Another made it possible for Timor Les to break away from Indonesia,\u201d he said.\n\nAkintoye added that their petition supported by millions of Yoruba people was a great weapon to get their referendum.\n\n\u201cSo, we Yoruba must all make a rush to vote for the petition that is now being circulated by NINAS,\u201d he stated.",

          "text": "Following the October 20, 2020 gunshots, the Nigerian Army and the Lagos State Government conspired and surreptitiously transported 20 dead from the Lekki Tollgate to the state pathologist for autopsy, according to SaharaReporters.\n\nThe Lagos State Pathologist, Prof John Obafunwa, conveyed this revelation confidentially to members of the Lagos State EndSARS panel sitting in Lekki, according to a top source.\n\nThe bodies of the Lekki Tollgate victims had already spent three days in the mortuary before being brought before the Pathologist for an autopsy, according to a source familiar with events at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, Ikeja.\n\n\u201cOn October 24, the Nigerian Army and the Lagos state government transported 20 Lekki massacre victims to a pathologist in Lagos, but they claimed they were persons attempting to get out of Ikoyi prisons.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe bodies had been at the morgue for three days before being transferred to the pathologist, which is interesting. This is in addition to the 99 bodies they admitted to taking to the pathologist previously, three of which were from Lekki Tollgate, according to the source.\n\nOn June 5, Obafunwa, the Lagos State government\u2019s consultant pathologist, first stated that between October 20 and 24, last year, 99 bodies were deposited in the mortuary of the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital. Only three of them, he was told, were from Lekki.\n\nNigerians around the country took to the streets in October 2020 to protest police brutality and terrible governance as part of the #EndSARS campaign.\n\nSoldiers from the 81 division\u2019s Bonny Camp, however, attacked the Lekki tollgate, where some demonstrators had congregated, and fired rounds on October 20.\n\nSince the tragedy, there has been debate on the number of people killed.\n\nObafunwa said 99 bodies were received for autopsy between October 20 and 24 during a session of the judicial panel set up to probe the soldiers\u2019 invasion of protesters.\n\nApart from the three bodies believed to have come from Lekki, Obafunwa said the rest were brought in from Surulere, Ikorodu, Ajah, and Fagba, among other places in the state.\n\n\u201cThey told us to conduct autopsies on victims that arrived between the 20th and 21st of January and up to roughly the 24th of January, and we did the autopsies on bodies from Ajah, Surulere, Ikorodu, Fagba, and Ikoyi prisons, totaling 99. But I\u2019m only bringing the three for Lekki,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe pathologist indicated he would have to check his records for the exact date and hour the remains were received.\n\n\u201cI have no idea how many bodies arrived on the 21st. I\u2019d have to go check them out. But I can tell you that we have to finish all the cases between the 20th and the 24th,\u201d he had added.\n\nObafunwa then proceeded to discuss the autopsy findings for each victim.\n\nAccording to him, the first victim was brought in from Lekki Bridge and found to have sustained a laceration on one side of his skull, but died as a result of bleeding in his \u201cchest cavity\u201d and \u201cblunt force injuries to the chest.\u201d\n\nThe second individual was declared dead in the early hours of October 21 after sustaining an open skull fracture, although there was no trace of gunshot injuries, according to Obafunwa.\n\nHe added the second body had hypertension and rib fractures, but the cause of death was \u201cskull and brain injuries related to blunt force trauma.\u201d\n\nAccording to the pathologist, the third body died of substantial blood loss as a result of complications from a gunshot wound.\n\nObafunwa was invited to return to the panel on June 19 with reports on the remaining 96 remains after giving his testimony.",

They are still at it and they\u2019re doing a great job, but we need more support by all Nigerians and in fact all to ensure that we give them our maximum cooperation to finish what they have started.\n\n\u201cPresident has, as always, expressed sympathy to those innocent persons who are held hostage against their will by terror elements and he condemned the action of all terror groups, wherever they are, whether they are bandits, Boko Haram, or any group that is taking away the liberty and freedoms and, in fact, lives and livelihoods of others. He maintained the instruction he has always given to the security agencies to give their maximum best in dealing with those criminal elements.\n\n\u201cOur stand, I have made it very clear this is condemnable, this should not happen and all people of goodwill, all good people should mobilise to confront evil and evil elements and criminal elements in our society. It\u2019s not just a job for the security agencies, we have to support them. We have to mobilise.\n\n\u201cSince I made that statement, which I meant by every stretch of imagination, many groups have come out to demonstrate similar supports and yesterday we have seen mobilisation by the Niger State governor and I believe we\u2019ll see more in the coming days.\n\n\u201cNigerians should unite so that we confront criminality. Even yesterday, Fulani leaders in Kebbi State all visited Government House, Kebbi, even though I was not there to receive them, to condemn and to distance themselves from those renegade groups, or renegade criminal elements and to offer to support in whatever role the security agencies will want them to play,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board, JAMB, has said that introduction of National Identity Number, NIN, as one of the requirements for 2021 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination, UTME has no deleterious effect on the financial base of the Board.\n\nThe Head Media, JAMB, Dr. Fabian Benjamin was reacting to a recent publication alleging that JAMB blames NIN requirement for revenue drops to N5.8bn.\n\nTo correct what the Head Media referred to as erroneous, he said, \u201cFirst, it is an error of fact to denigrate the wonderful contribution of the NIN to the UTME registration process by insinuating that it had deleterious effect on the financial base of the Board when, in actual fact, we are not a revenue generation agency nor purported to be one.

While it is true that an initial appropriation of the above stated sum was made due to the decaying nature of the National Assembly Complex which has not witnessed any major maintenance or overhauling since construction, the said amount was reduced to 9 billion naira after the breakout of COVID-19 pandemic. Even with this reduction, the sum of 9 billion or any amount is yet to be cash backed or released to the National Assembly. None of this amount is even appropriated for the National Assembly bureaucracy or its leadership. It must be reiterated that the National Assembly Complex is a National Monument which falls under the purview of control of the Federal Capital Development Agency. In essence, the FCDA is responsible for its maintenance as well as renovation and not the Leadership of the National Assembly as being falsely bandied about. The leakage witnessed at the foyer of the National Assembly yesterday justifies the apprehension of the leadership of the National Assembly and the FCDA and further underscores the need for an urgent intervention in revamping the dilapidated structures within the complex before it falls into further dilapidation with the attendant huge cost of a possible replacement.\n\nSigned\n\nSenator Surajudeen Ajibola Basiru Ph.D.\n\nSenate Spokesperson\n\nDated this 23rd day of June, 2021",

It is essential to remind ourselves that this same military, being accused of connivance, are the ones who recently put their lives on the line to rescue abductees of the Government Secondary School, Birnin Yawuri from kidnappers,\u201d the statement read.\n\n\u201cWhile the NA will not attempt to excuse the possibility of black sheep amongst its fold, it must be stated unambiguously that it will not condone any form of sabotage or aiding and assisting the enemy by any personnel, as provisions for dealing decisively with such acts are crystallised in Section 45 (1) of the Armed Forces Act CAP A 20 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004.\n\n\u201cIt must also be pointed out, that while the military is very much receptive to constructive criticism, it should not be perceived as a gateway for derogatory comments that have the potential to embolden criminals. It is also necessary to reiterate that patriotism must be taken to a trajectory where subversive conversations on the state are brought to the barest minimum.\n\n\u201cOpinion leaders are enjoined to demonstrate patriotism in building the peace, rather than being agents of destabilization, thereby aggravating the current security challenges facing the nation.\n\n\u201cThe NA wishes to reassure law abiding citizens, that troops will continue to conduct themselves professionally in consonance with the code of conduct guiding our operations in all combat engagements, in line with the provisions of the Nigerian Constitution and global best practice.

          "text": "Two South African brothers who ran a cryptocurrency investment platform called Africypt have vanished with $3.6 billion worth of bitcoin in what could potentially be the biggest cryptocurrency heist in history.\n\nThe incident could spur regulators\u2019 efforts to impose order on the market amid rising cases of fraud.\n\nA Cape Town law firm hired by investors says they can\u2019t locate the brothers, Ameer Cajee who acted as the Chief Operating Officer and Raees Cajee who acted as the Chief Executive Officer and have reported the matter to the Hawks, an elite unit of the national police force.\n\nThe law firm says it\u2019s also told crypto exchanges across the globe should any attempt be made to convert the digital coins.\n\nThe first signs of trouble came in April, as Bitcoin was rocketing to a record. Cajee, the elder brother, informed clients that the company was the victim of a hack. He asked them not to report the incident to lawyers and authorities, as it would slow down the recovery process of the missing funds.\n\nSome skeptical investors roped in the law firm, Hanekom Attorneys, and a separate group started liquidation proceedings against Africrypt.\n\n\u201cWe were immediately suspicious as the announcement implored investors not to take legal action,\u201d Hanekom Attorneys told Bloomberg. \u201cAfricrypt employees lost access to the back-end platforms seven days before the alleged hack.\u201d\n\nThe firm\u2019s investigation found Africrypt\u2019s pooled funds were transferred from its South African accounts and client wallets, and the coins went through tumblers and mixers \u2014 or to other large pools of bitcoin \u2014 to make them essentially untraceable.\n\nCalls to a mobile number for Cajee were immediately directed to a voicemail service. He and his brother, Raees set up Africrypt in 2019 and it provided bumper returns for investors. Calls to Raees also went straight to voicemail. The company website is down.\n\nThe saga is unfolding after last year\u2019s collapse of another South African Bitcoin trader, Mirror Trading International. The losses there, involving about 23,000 digital coins, totalled about $1.2 billion in what was called the biggest crypto scam of 2020, according to a report by Chainalysis. Africrypt investors stand to lose three times as much.\n\nWhile South Africa\u2019s Finance Sector Conduct Authority is also looking into Africrypt, it is currently prohibited from launching a formal investigation because crypto assets are not legally considered financial products, according to the regulator\u2019s head of enforcement, Brandon Topham. The police have not yet responded to a request for comment.\n\nChina has recently escalated its crackdown on cryptocurrency trading after a frenzied surge in Bitcoin and other tokens over the past six months heightened longstanding Communist Party concerns about the potential for fraud, money laundering and trading losses by individual investors.\n\nIn January, the daily value of crypto-asset trading exceeded 2 billion rand ($141 million) for the first time in South Africa, suggesting significant appetite in a market that was largely going unchecked by regulatory powers.",
