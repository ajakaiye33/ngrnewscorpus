          "text": "t; Delta Governor, Senator Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa(left); Deputy Speaker, house of Representatives, Rt. Hon. Ahmed Idris Wase(middle);and Hon. Ndudi Elumelu, (right),during a courtesy call by Members of House of Representatives sub- Committee on the review of 1999 Constitution on the Governor in Government House ,Asaba. Thursday\n\nDelta Governor Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, on Thursday, advocated for the devolution of powers to states and local governments to stop overburdening the Federal Government with many responsibilities.\n\nOkowa made the call when he received on a courtesy visit, House of Representatives Sub-Committee on review of the 1999 Constitution led by Deputy Speaker of the House, Rt. Hon. Ahmed Wase, at Government House, Asaba.\n\nREAD ALSO:Okowa\u2019s statement on power rotation quoted out of context \u2013 DPM\n\nAccording to him, the Federal Government is overburdened with many responsibilities in the exclusive list, making it encumbered and inefficient.\n\nHe stated that states and local governments were closer to the people and required more funds to execute life-changing projects that would be beneficial to the people.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a need for devolution of power. We believe that the exclusive list is too burdensome for the Federal government to handle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about this administration; it\u2019s about all the administrations at the national level. When you take too much to yourself, you find it difficult to be as efficient as you would have been ordinarily.\n\n\u201cThe sub-national governments are closer to their people and in the best position to reach out to the needs of the people. So, we think that there\u2019s a need to look at the exclusive list and make adjustments, which will devolve more powers to the state.\n\n\u201cThis will also follow a re-allocation of resources in order to make the sub-national government more impactful than they are at the moment.\n\n\u201cWhen we concentrate too much power at the national level, it creates a lot of challenges; there\u2019s no doubt about that,\u201d he said.\n\nOkowa called for the amendment of Section 162 on public revenue, fiscal federalism, and revenue allocations, adding that there was the need to look at that aspect very closely.\n\nHe said that there hadn\u2019t been any review since 1999 even when the Constitution provided for a review every five years.\n\n\u201cIn the past several years, that include all administrations from 1999 to date, we have not had a review of the revenue allocation formula. It ought not to be so, because that is not what the law provides for.\n\n\u201cBut what has made it difficult to have a review of the allocation formula is the fact that of the provision of the Constitution in section 162 Sub-Section 2, which provides that Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission, will need first to make proposals to Mr President, who will in turn send the proposal to the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cIf we go back to history lane, you will agree with me that the RMAFC has on more than one occasion, sent their proposals to the presidency and at no time has it ever been laid before the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cTherefore, at no time has the National Assembly had the opportunity of debating such proposals. So to cure that, we think that that section giving part to lay their proposal to the president first should be amended.\n\n\u201cLet the Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission make their proposals directly to the National Assembly. If you lay something before me and I am not convinced as a person that it will favour me in the National Assembly, I will not lay it before them.\n\n\u201cFor justice and fairness, the revenue allocation commission should lay its proposal directly to the National Assembly,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe governor also said that oil-producing states were not fairly treated because of the ecological and environmental degradation they suffered as a result of oil exploration and production.\n\n\u201cWe also believe that the oil-producing states are not fairly treated on the issue of derivation. We know that the provision in the Constitution is that derivations shall be at least 13 percent, but we are stuck at that 13 percent.\n\n\u201cFrom all our workings, we do know that the states that are oil-producing do not receive up to 13 percent. Why we think that we ought to receive more is that I wish you can be opportunity to be in the creeks, you will understand what we are facing here.\n\n\u201cForty percent of Delta State is covered with water and I know it is a lot more in a state like Bayelsa. There\u2019s one of my LGAs called Burutu. You cannot get to that place by road.\n\n\u201cI thought we could build bridges to get to the place by road. I asked for the estimate to build bridges, I was told it would be about 20 bridges that would cost about N48 billion, and that was in 2016.\n\n\u201cSo, the best way forward is truly to increase the revenue allocation by way of derivation. Those who ask what we are doing with the 13 percent do not have an idea of the way Nigeria is,\u201d Okowa said.\n\nHe called for the amendment of sections 214 to 216 of the 1999 Constitution to pave way for the creation of state police, saying \u201cthere\u2019s the need for state police which even the governors have agreed on.\n\n\u201cWe are not saying that the Federal Police is inefficient, but we believe that it will be very difficult for them to have enough personnel with a good command structure that would be functional enough to handle the level of insecurity in our land today.\n\n\u201cSo, Section 214 down to Section 216 needs to be amended. We are not asking for a scrap of the Federal Police. Nigeria will not be the first to have a functional state and federal police working together to check insecurity,\u201d the governor stated.\n\nEarlier, Wase had said that the Committee members were in the state for ongoing review of the 1999 Constitution and called on stakeholders to come with submissions that would make the exercise a huge success.\n\nHe lauded Governor Okowa for his contributions to national development and urged him not to relent in transforming Delta State in terms of development.",

The Benue governor spoke on Thursday, at the commissioning ceremony of the 65km Moniya-Ijaiye-Iseyin which held at Akinyele Local Government secretariat, Moniya, Ibadan.\n\nDescribing himself as a man who stands and seeks justice, equity and fairness in all things, Ortom challenged the APC-led FG to provide the needed leadership for the country, saying: \u201cour people are in pains.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cOyo and indeed the Yoruba nation have always stood with and supported the oppressed and have always been the voice of the oppressed in the country right from the inception.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is what I stand for.

I promise you that I will never say anything again.\u201d\n\nHe called on the APC led federal government to rise up and give leadership to the country noting that the situation of things was not as bad as it is today when the party took over reigns of affairs in 2015.\n\n\u201cLet me once again call on the APC led Federal Government to rise up and give leadership. Our people are in pains.\u201d\n\nALSO READ: Wike blames FG for continued lockdown of courts\n\n\u201cFrom the North-East, North Central, North-West, South-South, South East and Southwest, everyone is faced with security challenges. Without security, there can be no meaningful development except in PDP controlled states.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to challenge the APC in this country because they have failed. Economically, security wise, socially and politically, the APC government is in deficit.\u201d\n\n\u201cGovernment is all about providing security for lives and property. Government is about providing infrastructure like the one we are doing here today.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday, I am here in Oyo state, my brother (Makinde) was in Adamawa, a PDP controlled state earlier to commission project and lay foundation. Go to Rivers state, everyday what you see is laying of projects or commissioning of project, the same thing in Bauchi state, go to Sokoto and other PDP controlled states, you will see development. That is what leadership is and that is what the people of Nigeria are yarning for,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile commending the host Governor Seyi Makinde on his efforts, he urged him never to contemplate leaving the people but work with them and do what they want to feel their pains.\n\nHe added: \u201cI commend my brother, that within the spate of two years, we are here to commission among others, a 65km of roads duly asphaltic with a guarantee of 20years. I congratulate you my brother.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I believe and trust that he will do more for the people of the state. I commend Oyo people for giving him the backing and support.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t ever contemplate on leaving your people, work with them, do what they want, feel their pains, share their pains and also give them leadership that will lead them out of their pains.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his remark, Governor Makinde accused the immediate past administration in the state of using jargon to deceive the people all in their effort to embezzle funds.\n\nALSO READ: Why I\u2019m passionate about developing Anambra \u2014 Orajiaka\n\nHe recounted that the project was earlier awarded at a cost of N7billion by the immediate past administration who also paid N2billion to the control that could not do anything about the road for about two years.\n\nHe said he had to terminate the contract and re-awarded at a higher cost because of some other things factored into the construction.\n\nHe also disclosed that he had succeeded in recovering N1billion from the initial contractor, threatening that he would likewise recover the huge amount of money spent on the Ologuneru-Eruwa road.\n\nMakinde said: \u201cAlthough a contract for rehabilitation of this road was awarded by the previous administration, our initial inspection visits in 2019 revealed that the contractors had not even done 5 percent of the work here before abandoning it. We therefore had to revoke and re-award the contract.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, the immediate past administration, they had a language they use when they want to embezzle money, they use the word \u2018limited rehabilitation\u2019, so a contract was awarded for the limited rehabilitation of this road for N7billion.\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore we came, they already paid N2billion and they gave the contract to one Oladiran Associate. They didn\u2019t do anything serious for over two years and they collected N2billion but I recovered N1billion from the money.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, when we awarded the road for N9billion, they accused us that the road they approved for N7billion, we awarded for N9billion that we don\u2019t know what we are doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the same manner, they awarded Ologuneru-Eruwa road for N10billion on Limited Rehabilitation. You all can go there to see the level of work done. They already paid N6billion out of the N10billion but as I have recovered N1billion on this Moniya-Iseyin road, I will also recover the money on the Ologuneru-Eruwa road too.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Right now, it is land flowing with bitterness and sadness. That is not what God meant for this country. We must change it. And we must change the narrative.\n\n\u201cWe must talk to ourselves in a civilized language in which we talk to ourselves. I told some people who came to look for in the morning today if you look around, there is no section of this country where you will not get genius, north, south, east, west and anywhere.\n\n\u201cSo, for what reason should we look down on ourselves? Or for what reason should we look down on others that you are not a human being? \u201c\n\nHe went on: \u201cAs at today, the white race is being led by the Americans. I don\u2019t know how long that will be. The yellow race is being led by the Chinese and whatever we say or do, China will lead the world before the middle of this century. There is nothing we can do about that. I believe that God has created Nigeria to lead the black race.\n\n\u201cThat we are not doing it is not because God has not given us all that we needed to do it. It is because we have failed in leadership to do it. And that has to be corrected.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that it is the fault of all of us. We should speak up, we should speak up. And you should say what you should say and say it when you should say it.\n\n\u201cWhy do Nigerians bloom outside Nigeria? As at today, we have four Nigerians, about five, directly running international organisations and running them well. And one or two are at the number two levels. We have Akinwunmi Adesina running the African Development Bank, we have Benedict running Afroexim Bank, we have Bakindo running the OPEC, we have my sister, Ngozi running WTO, we have Amina who is risen to number two position at the UN.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThese are things that should give hope and encouragement but the point is that if these people are here in Nigeria, if you hear about them at all, we would have shackled them and make it impossible for them to perform as they are performing outside.\n\n\u2018\u2019And each of these that I have mentioned, they are doing fantastically well. We now have even at the AU, Bankole who has just taken over as Commissioner for political and security.\n\n\u2018\u2019So, why are they doing well there and here they are not doing well? We should be interrogating this. And then what should we do? What should we do is to put our house in order. And we can put our house in order.\u201d",

So, in principle, every human being has the right to defend himself or herself. But the practice of that needs to be examine thoroughly before putting it to use.\u201d\n\nThe clergy also chided those criticising the church for speaking about issues relating to governance, explaining that \u201cthe church has the moral authority that it uses in interfacing with the people and the word of God being the basis for such interaction.\n\n\u201cThe church will continue to awaken the conscience of the people of our nation on the values that are necessary for the common good, the church will assist in teaching the people about issues concerning love for one another.

          "text": "By Zika Bobby\n\nDiaspora Igbo group, the Igbo World Assembly (IWA), has said there was need to restructure Nigeria to ensure true federalism as it was in the 1963 Constitution based on regions.\n\nIt condemned Federal Government\u2019s shoot-on-sight position, noting that such could be termed an act of ethnic cleaning.\n\nIWA Chairman, Nwachukwu Anakwenze, who stated this in a keynote address in Abuja at the just-concluded 2023 Presidential Transition Inter-ethnic Peace Dialogue, said true fiscal federalism was needed in Nigeria to address issues affecting the country.\n\nRestructuring of Nigeria, according to him, should be a means of tackling the worsening security situation and the agitation for secession.\n\n\u201cWe need a Nigerian political structure that is based on equity, fairplay, balance and equal access to political power for the good of all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIWA feels that what Nigeria needs on the long run is true fiscal federalism which is a system of government based on democratic rules and institutions in which the power to govern is shared between national and regional/state governments. The individual federating units need to have more control over their affairs.\n\n\u201cThe regional government should control their resources and pay a percentage royalty tax to the Federal Government. The Federal Government should control issues in the single exclusive list such as military or foreign policy. We should return to agricultural businesses such as was practiced in the sixties by our former leaders. There is a need to restructure Nigeria to ensure true federalism as it was in the 1963 Constitution based on regions or zones.\u201d\n\nWe need a Nigerian political structure that is based on equity, fair play, balance and equal access to political power for the good of Nigerians,\u201d Anakwenze said.\n\nHe said a future Nigeria requires respect for our constitution and rule of law, respect for human rights and civil rights, respect for the federal character commission rules from 1979 constitution, implementation of restructuring, regionalisation and devolution of powers, merit-based appointment to government positions, firm knowledge and competent management of Nigeria\u2019s economy.\n\nAnakwenze said detribalised appointments and leadership in all sectors of the government, equal and equitable treatment of all Nigerian regardless of tribes of origins or religion, elimination of ethnic cleansing in the Nigerian political space, free and fair electoral process, a government that unites all Nigerians and not one that is divisive, were needed now.\n\n\u201cWithout mincing words, if we cannot work this out quickly, a referendum might be needed so that all the major Nigerian groups can go their separate ways,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the group position about presidency of Nigeria of South East extraction, he said: \u201cWe ask that all political parties should zone Nigerian presidency to South East in 2023. And efforts should be geared to achieving that goal. IWA states only restructuring can prevent Nigeria from disintegration.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the Fulani herdsmen, he said Ndigbo will no longer tolerate the attack by herdsmen.\n\n\u201cWe are very concerned about that because the well-being of our people is involved. We will no longer accept this condition and we are going to talk to our people on what to do about it.\n\n\u201cEverybody needs to prepare to defend themselves and his family against the herdsmen because we are not prepared to cede an inch of Igbo land to anybody because our land is very small.\n\n\u201cOur people must protect their crops always. If any animal comes to eat the crops, it means hunger will be in the land because that is what the people use after harvesting and sales to train their children or pay for hospital bills.\n\n\u201cIf the herders kill our people and destroy our things, we have the right to reciprocate.

          "title": "FG Protests Deletion of Tweet, Says Twitter Can\u2019t Gag Buhari",
          "text": "\u2022Accuses microblogging site of double standards\n\nBy Deji Elumoye\n\nThe federal government yesterday accused the social media giant, Twitter, of double standards in its treatment of issues affecting Nigeria.\n\nIt warned that it would not allow the microblogging site to dictate to President Muhammadu Buhari his views on national issues.\n\nThe accusation followed the decision of Twitter to delete a controversial post by Buhari on the Nigerian civil war.\n\nThe president, in the post on Tuesday, had warned against insurrection, saying that those fomenting trouble in the South-east are in for a rude shock.\n\nBuhari, in a series of tweets on Tuesday via his verified Twitter handle @mbuhari had said: \u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian civil war. Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.\u201d\n\nBuhari\u2019s statement, which was also tweeted, sparked outrage on the social media with some Nigerians reporting it to Twitter.\n\nHowever, some said the president sounded firm in his warning against perpetrators of violence in the South-east.\n\nBut yesterday, Twitter pulled down the tweet for violating its community standards.\n\nTwitter, in a comment, said: \u201cThis Tweet violated the Twitter Rules.\u201d\n\nThe federal government, however, kicked against the decision with the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, wondering why Tweeter would object to a submission by the president on national issues but would ignore provocative postings by the leader of the proscribed Independent People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu on its site.\n\nThe minister told journalist at the end of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting at the State House, Abuja that Twitter\u2019s mission in Nigeria is suspect.\n\nHe wondered if Twitter has ever deleted offensive tweets by Kanu.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe mission of Twitter in Nigeria is very suspect. Has Twitter deleted the violent tweets that Nnamdi Kanu has been sending? Has it? The same Twitter during the ENDSARS protests promoted tweets trying to raise funds for the ENDSARS protesters. It was the first to close the account of former President of US, Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cAnd you see, when people were burning police stations and killing policemen in Nigeria during ENDSARS, for Twitter, it was about the right to protest. But when a similar thing happened at the Capitol, it became insurrection. You see, we are not going to be fooled by anybody. We have a country to rule and we will do so to the best of our ability. Twitter mission in Nigeria citing those two examples is very suspect. What is their agenda?\n\n\u201cHow does Mr. President\u2019s speech that anybody who is destroying infrastructure, who is destroying police stations, who is destroying INEC offices should be ready for the consequences; is that inciting violence?\u201d\n\nWhile accepting the fact that Twitter may have its own rules, Mohammed said that should not stop Buhari from expressing his views against a banned organisation like IPOB inciting people to commit arson and the likes in the South-east.\n\nHe stated: \u201cTwitter may have its own rules, it\u2019s not the universal rule. If Mr. President, anywhere in the world feels very bad and concerned about a situation, he is free to express such views. Now, we should stop comparing apples with oranges. If an organisation is proscribed, it is different from any other which is not proscribed. Two, any organisation that gives directives to its members to attack police stations, to kill policemen, to attack correctional centres, to kill warders, and you are now saying that Mr. President does not have the right to express his dismay and anger about that? We are the one guilty of double standards.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see anywhere in the world where an organisation \u2013 a person will stay somewhere outside Nigeria, and will direct his members to attack the symbols of authority, the police, the military, especially when that organisation has been proscribed. By whatever name, you can\u2019t justify giving orders to kill policemen or to kill anybody you do not agree with.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m saying that you cannot compare anybody with Kanu who boldly say, go and kill policemen.\n\nI think sometimes\u2026policemen are brothers, they are our uncle, they are children. We kill them their wives become widows, their children become orphans. And what is the offence of these policemen \u2013 because they are working to keep the country one. What about soldiers that are putting down their lives so that you and I can sleep? It is not acceptable anywhere in the world for anybody, anywhere, to stay in the comfort of wherever he is and now give directives to go and kill soldiers, go and kill policemen.\u201d\n\nAsked why Sheikh Ahmed Gumi whose comments were perceived as justifying Boko Haram actions has not been arrested, Mohammed asked who appointed Gumi as the go-between between government and Boko Haram.\n\n\u201cWho appointed Gumi middleman between government and Boko Haram? Listen, for me, unless you come and tell me this what Gumi said that is inciting that you are comparing to Kanu\u2026 anyway what we\u2019re discussing is different. We\u2019re discussing Twitter. If you want to ask any question about Gumi or any other person, go ahead but please, be objective,\u201d he added.\n\nHe also said if government had resolved to pick up all those critical of the Buhari administration, the detention centres would have been full by now.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere are so many people who have been spewing hate against Mr. President, against this governments. So if you want to comment, be fair; don\u2019t take a position, which is not objective. If we were to pick up everybody today who had been abusing this administration, the detention centres will be filled up and you will be the first person also to talk about lack of tolerance, lack of rule of law.\u201d\n\nReacting to Buhari\u2019s tweet, human rights activist, Aisha Yesufu, described as \u201cinsensitive\u201d the civil war analogy by the president.\n\nYesufu, in a video statement yesterday, said: \u201cMy name is Aisha Somtochukwu Yesufu. I am Igbo, a threat to the Igbo people is a threat to me. Any attack on the Igbo people is an attack on me. Any malignment of the Igbo people is a malignment to me. We are all Nigerians and no Nigerian is more Nigerian than the others.\n\n\u201cThe government must ensure that it deploys its resources and its apparatus equally to every section of this country.\n\n\u201cI totally condemn the tweet from the president where the president is threatening the Igbo people. He is threatening them with what happened in 1967. What happened in 1967 was a genocide; a crime against humanity and it must never ever be allowed to happen again.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cFor a president to come out today and use 1967 as a yardstick to threaten people with what happened then, with the 30 months of gruesomeness, with the 30 months of heinousness, with the 30 months of atrocities that were meted out on human beings, on fellow brothers and sisters, on children in this country, is inhumane, it is insensitive, it is callous, and it is unspeakable.\u201d\n\nFormer Ekiti State Governor, Mr. Ayodele Fayose, however, called on Twitter to hold presidential spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu and Mohammed accountable for the controversial \u2018civil war\u2019 post.\n\nReacting in a string of tweets, Fayose wrote: \u201cA president who cannot address his own people in time of crisis can certainly not be the one tweeting on the crisis. Twitter should rather hold Garba Shehu, Lai Mohammed and co (others) accountable.\n\n\u201cIt is obvious that those using the president\u2019s powers for him do not know when and where to stop their power. Regrettably, Twitter may not know that Buhari is not the one operating the handle.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Ezeife: South-east Violence, Plot to Undermine Clamour for Igbo Presidency",
          "text": "\u2022Editors express concern over growing insecurity\n\nBy Alex Enumah\n\nA former Governor of Anambra State, Chief Chukwuemeka Ezeife, yesterday accused sponsors of the ongoing violence in the South-east of plotting to forestall elections in 2023 with the sole aim of thwarting the clamour by the zone to produce the next president.\n\nEzeife, while featuring on ARISE NEWS CHANNEL, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers, however, exonerated members of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and the Eastern Security Network (ESN) from the recent killings of police personnel and the torching of public institutions in the zone.\n\nHe spoke hours after the Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE) expressed concern over the growing insecurity in the country and advised government at all levels to activate their structures in tackling the challenges.\n\nEzeife described the insurrection in the South-east as an attempt to provoke indigenes of the South-east.\n\nHe added that their findings showed that those behind the killings and destruction of public institutions such as offices of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) are not Igbo.\n\nHe said: \u201cWho are the people burning INEC\u2019s offices, who are killing the police? There is the impression that some people even within the government are guilty of organising such threat and blaming it on IPOB and ESN.\n\n\u201cNow we know that more than 80 per cent of the people caught by the CCTV are not from the South-east.\n\nWas it a design to blame it on IPOB and ESN? We are learning more now that there is a design to provoke the East.\u201d\n\nHe, however, could not identify the sponsors but suspected that some of them might be in government going by some of the findings by South-east leaders.\n\nHe stated that a South-east governor who had earlier accused IPOB and ESN of executing the attacks had since exonerated the secessionist group.\n\nHe also expressed reservation that the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, could hold the groups responsible for the violence without evidence.\n\nHe said: \u201cIPOB does not have tradition of shedding blood or burning down things. It is not Igbo tradition to shoot police, burn down houses. During the ENDSARS protests, people attributed what was happening in Lagos to some Igbo people and it was later discovered to be untrue.\n\n\u201cThose who are sponsoring this destruction don\u2019t want election; they don\u2019t want president from South-east zone and would even want to scatter the Anambra election and go for emergency situation and appoint someone.\n\n\u201cNigeria should understand what is going on and not jump into conclusion.\u201d\n\nWhile not justifying the activities of IPOB and its leader, Ezeife stated that the federal government by its alleged continued marginalisation of the South-east, is pushing Igbo out of Nigeria.\n\nHe listed some of the injustices the youths are fighting to include the absence of tangible federal government projects in the area as well as the alleged disregard for the principle of federal character in appointments, to the detriment of the Igbo.\n\n\u201cThe federal government has been working hard pushing the Igbo out of Nigeria. The young men are reacting to what is coming from the federal government. Whether it is project location, we don\u2019t have any in Igboland; whether it is appointment, you don\u2019t find it but if it is retirement, we\u2019re dominant.\u201d\n\nEzeife also alleged that many Igbo businesses are being crippled by the government.\n\nHe dismissed insinuation that the Igbo cannot speak with one voice when it comes to presenting a candidate for the 2023 presidential election.\n\nAccording to him, the South-east has many individuals that can govern the country and the zone is currently working hard to win the support of other zones to clinch the presidency in 2023.\n\nOn the ongoing public hearing to review the constitution, the former governor urged legislators to stop wasting their time and public resources because what the people need now is a new constitution.\n\nEditors Express Concern over Growing Insecurity\n\nMeanwhile, the NGE has expressed concern over the growing insecurity in the country and advised government at all levels to activate their structures in tackling the challenges.\n\nIt also called for an enabling political and economic environment for the media to discharge their constitutional and social responsibilities.\n\nIt added that creating a conducive environment for the media to thrive would guarantee and sustain democratic space, sustainable development and provide incentives for social/democratic change.\n\nThe guild, in a communiqu\u00e9 issued and signed by its President, Mr. Mustapha Isah, and General Secretary, Mr. Iyobosa Uwugiaren, at the end of its 2021 Biennial Convention in Kano, called on the federal government to, as a matter of urgency, expunge, repeal or amend as may be appropriate, all existing obnoxious media laws that are inimical to press freedom.\n\nIt also urged editors and journalists to continue to subscribe to and uphold the journalism code of ethics \u2013 as developed by the Nigerian Press Organisation (NPO).\n\n\u2018\u2019The guild observes the need for the Nigerian mass media to exercise their freedom to operate freely with a sense of responsibility. And considering the spikes in the levels of insecurity across the length and breadth of the country, it is high time for the media to set the agenda and lead the country\u2019s drive to sustaining national cohesion.\n\n\u2018\u2019While observing Nigeria\u2019s consistent deterioration in the Global Press Freedom Index since 2005, the guild notes that it is worrisome that the slide is happening in a democracy, whereby the guild has had cause in recent times to issue three press statements on the threats of closure and imposition of fines on some broadcast stations by the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC),\u201d the communiqu\u00e9 added.\n\nThe guild noted that the huge disruption the COVID-19 pandemic has created globally, saying that the disruption has also had negative effects on the Nigerian media industry, leading to drop in revenues.\n\n\u2018\u2019For the media to respond to these challenges creatively, there is urgent need for the media managers to evolve diversification, designing of a dynamic management system, producing innovative contents, restructuring their production technologies and adapting new funding and business models.\n\n\u2018\u2019Considering that the role of information dissemination by the mass media is an essential public and social service, the guild calls on government to consider mitigating the media\u2019s operational costs and economic challenges by floating a national media subsidy regime, including tax holidays and waivers, lifting of licence fees for the broadcast media and offsetting debts of government media agencies in the country,\u2019\u2019 the guild stated.\n\nThe guild\u2019s national convention, which attracted over 300 editors and media owners across the country, also expressed concern over the prevalence and massive elevation of fake news, disinformation and propaganda due to the mishandlings of the social media platforms by negative persons.\n\nThe guild harped on the need for Nigeria\u2019s media publics, particularly the youth whom the media must carry along, to use, decipher and rely on the conventional media for reliable and credible information in taking their decisions.\n\nThe safety of journalists also attracted the attention of the editors, as they called on both the public and the private media operators to devise measures inclusive of guaranteed welfare and insurance schemes for the safety and security of journalists working for them.\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 added: \u2018\u2019Against the backdrop of the assailing new media trends, the guild highlights the essence of training and retraining of the Nigerian journalists to update their knowledge, skills and expertise of the profession \u2013 with a view to attaining the needed proficiency and competencies that are required to overcome the new media drifts that dragging journalism profession.\u2019\u2019\n\nWhile commending Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje of Kano State for keeping the state safe even in the midst of the prevailing insecurity in some parts of the country, the editors also appreciated the state government\u2019s phenomenal drive of infrastructure development; as well as the state government\u2019s determination to turn Kano into a modern city.\n\nThe guild thanked Ganduje and members of the state Executive Council for providing the enabling environment for the national convention to hold.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Barkindo: Oil industry\u2019s upstream spending slumped 30% in 2020\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has said that the Nigerian oil and gas industry will require at least $40 billion in direct investments in basic infrastructure to achieve the federal government\u2019s much talked-about about \u201cDecade of Gas.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Secretary General of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Dr. Sanusi Barkindo, said the cartel\u2019s latest assessment showed that capital investments in the upstream of the oil and gas industry fell by 30 per cent in 2020.\n\nNNPC said yesterday that it was targeting between 7.4 billion cubic feet to 10 billion cubit feet of gas in the next couple of years, compared to its current 1.6 bcf supply capacity.\n\nSpeaking at a virtual forum organised by the Association of Local Distributors of Gas (ALDG), tagged \u201cThe Decade of Gas: Unlocking Opportunities in the Domestic Gas Market,\u201d the Chief Operating Officer, Gas and Power, NNPC, Mr Yusuf Usman, stated that a major constraint in achieving local content through the programme is the difficult conditions placed by foreign lenders.\n\nHowever, he stated that the corporation expects to grow about 10 gas-based industries as it works towards the 10-year target.\n\nHe added that the figure on the quantum of funds needed is based on the submissions NNPC has received from potential investors.\n\nIn addition, he stated that about 39 thermal power plants were being targeted as opposed to the current 33.\n\nAccording to him, by the end of this year, the NNPC is projecting an added gas sales of about 600 mmscfd, compared to its current 1.6 bcf to hit 2.2 bcf by the end of 2021.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn terms of benefits, we will generate 45,000 megawatts of power in terms of gas use, creating massive employment and import substitution.\n\n\u201cThere are changes we need to look at to actualise the decade of gas. We see the huge amount of investment, both Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) that will come into the country upward of $40 billion or much more than that in order to achieve all the aggressive plans that that are outlined in the decade of gas.\n\n\u201cThis investment will come in the upstream, midstream and downstream, but there are challenges as well because there have been a lot of announcements around funding for fossil fuels and these are some of the things we have to look at as we go forward and we need to figure out the announcement vis-a-vis the foreign estimate that we expect.\u201d\n\nHe added that the corporation has a supply plan to deliver up to 4.5 bcf of gas into the market, while going forward, the country expects 7.4 bcf of gas.\n\nAccording to Usman, there are urgent plans to complete ongoing gas projects in the country, including the AKK project , which he described as one of the most aggressive and biggest pipeline infrastructure ever embarked upon by the country. The pipeline spans 614 km.\n\nHe said all the gas activities going on around the country were being handled by local construction companies and local providers of services due to the COVID-19 restrictions.\n\n\u201cGoing forward into 10 years, we expect to do another big pipeline that will take up gas from south, all the way into Ajaokuta and possibly we extend it all the way to Maiduguri,\u201d he said.\n\nHe expressed the hope that the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) will be passed this year, noting that the corporation is ready to adjust to the changes that the law will impose.\n\nUsman stated that by the corporation\u2019s projection, demand for gas to generate electricity in the country will consume between 60 to 70 per cent of the entire commodity produced, with the ongoing plan to generate 45,000MW.\n\n\u201cThe other challenge we have is the liquidity in the power sector, and there\u2019s a lot of work going on because it is a very huge market. If you see the demand projections that we have done, it is going to consume 60 to 70 per cent of the gas that we have.\n\n\u201cNot only that; without power, all the development programmes we are thinking of will be a mirage. It is an inevitable equation that we have to solve to move towards development and issues around it have to be resolved,\u201d he stated.\n\nUsman urged policy makers to answer the questions surrounding gas pricing, since Nigeria is interested in using gas as a source of revenue as well as balancing between investment and local content drive.\n\n\u201cAll these FDI come with conditionality before taking the money. That will put a limit to our local content drive. As you all know, the restrictions by itself affect the kind of projections that we look at,\u201d he added.\n\nHe stated that if Nigeria will achieve the decade of gas, it must transit to a willing-buyer willing-seller market.\n\nBesides, there must be a document with timelines as well as defined investment strategies on the announcement that is being made about the restriction for fossil fuel to achieve the decade of gas.\n\nBarkindo: Oil Industry\u2019s Upstream Spending Slumped 30% in 2020\n\nMeanwhile, the Secretary General of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Dr. Sanusi Barkindo, has said that the cartel\u2019s latest assessment shows that capital investments in the upstream of the oil and gas industry fell by 30 per cent in 2020.\n\nHe said at the first meeting of the OPEC-Africa Energy Dialogue that despite that, crude oil will continue to be relevant, especially in Africa.\n\nDescribing the future of Africa\u2019s oil industry as bright and the opportunities vast, Barkindo stated that the continent is currently home to five of the top 30 oil-producing countries in the world.\n\nAccording to him, oil is expected to retain the largest share of the global energy mix throughout the forecast period, providing nearly 28 per cent of global requirements in 2045, followed by gas at around 25 per cent and coal at roughly 20 per cent.\n\nIn 2019, Barkindo stated that the continent produced 8.5 mb/d of oil, which is around nine per cent of world\u2019s output.\n\nHe said at the end of 2019, Africa was estimated to have proven oil reserves amounting to around 126 billion barrels,with Nigeria holding the lion\u2019s share with 36.9 billion barrels, representing 29 per cent of Africa\u2019s reserves.\n\nBarkindo said demand in developing regions, including Africa, with its rapidly growing population and dynamic demographical shifts, would be intensified, and all forms of energy would be needed, not only to support the post-pandemic recovery but to satisfy long-term energy requirements.\n\n\u201cOne major issue looming in the long-term horizon is the lack of adequate industry investment.\n\n\u201cAccording to our latest assessments, upstream capital spending is estimated to have fallen in 2020 by a staggering 30 per cent or more.\n\n\u201cOur 2020 World Oil Outlook estimates that $12.6 trillion will be required between now and 2045 in the upstream, midstream and downstream.\n\n\u201cWe must continue to advocate a turnaround in this very upsetting trend. The very future of our industry is at stake,\u201d he stated.\n\nAccording to him, oil and gas will continue to be a vital part of the energy needs to ensure future demand is met, adding that policies must change in that regard.\n\nHe stated that another issue of utmost concern in Africa is the scourge of energy poverty, which continues to impact millions across the continent.\n\nCiting OPEC data, Barkindo said an estimated 47 per cent of the population in Sub Saharan Africa had no electricity and approximately 85 per cent of people lacked access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking.\n\nHe stated that considering the richness of the continent\u2019s resources, both conventional and renewable, this situation is hard to accept.\n\nHe urged all stakeholders to unite on the issues to ensure an equitable distribution of energy that leaves no one behind.\n\n\u201cWhen all is said and done, access to energy, like education and health care, should not be considered a luxury but a human right.\n\n\u201cOPEC will continue to work closely with our member countries to advocate for real and lasting change on this issue,\u201d he added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Yahaya Bello, governor of Kogi, has faulted the calls for the zoning of the presidency ahead of the 2023 election.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking with journalists after a visit to President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday, the governor said \u201crotational presidency\u201d has outlived its usefulness.\n\nRather than the zoning arrangement, the governor asked Nigerians to go for the \u201cbest candidate\u201d, irrespective of where the person comes from.\n\n\u201cFor once, let\u2019s get Nigeria fixed. We have practised as seemingly rotational presidencies since 1999 to date. Let us evaluate our successes or achievements from this seeming rotational presidency between then and now,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we simply go for the best? After all, we copied this democracy from America and some of the developed countries. How many of these countries are practising traditional presidency? You see, we are where we are today not because we are practising rotational presidency.\n\n\u201cIf you want to go by that rotational presidency, then do perfect zoning. Go by perfect rotation. And if you go by rotation and whichever way you come from, I don\u2019t think you should exclude where I come from. That\u2019s number one.\n\n\u201cNumber two, let us get a credible, sincere, patriotic Nigerian to fix it. If you\u2019re flying an aircraft, you don\u2019t ask who is the pilot? If you undergo operation in a hospital, you wouldn\u2019t ask \u201cwhich doctor is this?\u2019 \u2018Is he from your zone, your tribe, your religion?\u2019 All you want is the best pilot to fly you safely to your destination. All you want is the best doctor to handle you and deliver you safely from the operation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think Nigeria is at that point now of seeking the best from anywhere in this country, irrespective of where he comes from. Thereafter, you balance in position to reflect equity, fairness and justice. That is my position.\u201d\n\nBello, who had earlier said many Nigerians have been asking him to run for president, said he will find a way to get through to the south-east on supporting the next president.\n\nThe governor said he has always worked with people from the region, adding that Moses Okezie, his speech writer, hails from the south-east.\n\n\u201cI think where you come from should not matter in your service to this nation,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe religion you practise should not matter. The creed you belong to, the class you belong to, should not matter. What should matter most is the content that is contained in you \u2014 your stuff. What do you have to offer this country, to secure lives and livelihoods, to unite this country to make sure that Nigerians are respected not only at home, but abroad?\n\n\u201cSo, I want to believe that when the time comes, Nigerians will see reason. Of course, already, they are calling on me. When the time comes, it\u2019s going to be overwhelming. The 1993 hope that was dashed will be revived and actualised in 2023.\u201d",

He is of course entitled to his opinions, even where events consistently prove him wrong. But facts should not be bent to support distorted opinions,\u201d Shehu wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLet me give you one example. The authors write: \u2018At an April meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Buhari reportedly requested that the headquarters of the U.S. Africa Command be moved from Germany to Nigeria so that it would be closer to the fight against jihadi groups in the country\u2019s north.\u2019\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari did not request that AFRICOM move to Nigeria. The transcript of the call with Secretary Blinken is available on the State Department\u2019s own website.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a question of the invented addition of \u2018to Nigeria\u2019 with regard to AFRICOM. It sums up a piece that attempts \u2013 subtly but revealingly \u2013 to shift facts to suit an argument. Nigeria faces multiple challenges, not least of which is the dissemination of fake news and prejudiced opinion.\n\n\u201cThis is something we have come to expect from partisan blogs and politically motivated lobbies. It is still a surprise, and a disappointment, to see them joined by Foreign Affairs.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBuhari had, in April, asked the United States to consider relocating the headquarters of the US Africa Command (AFRICOM) from Germany to Africa.\n\nThe relocation, according to Buhari, is necessary as part of efforts to address insecurity in Nigeria and other African nations.",

          "title": "Can TalentQL\u2019s six-month program fill Africa\u2019s need for senior developers?",
          "text": "Adewale Yusuf, the founder and former publisher of Techpoint, made what many saw as a bold move last year.\n\nNot only did he swap the uncertainty of tech media for the vulnerability of founding a tech startup, he chose Ile-Ife, a town 200 km removed from the chaos of Lagos, as the \u201cquiet location\u201d for his new adventure.\n\nYusuf, along with one Jobberman co-founder and a couple other people, started TalentQL, an outsourcing firm for companies in need of quality software developers.\n\n\u201cHire top vetted technical talent across Africa quickly and seamlessly,\u201d their website says. Part of the plan was to produce talents by building campuses that house co-working spaces, with dependable electricity and Internet.\n\nOf course this is no longer a novel startup idea. Indeed it might appear late in the day to be getting into the \u201ctech talent matching\u201d game. Andela, one might say, has been there, done that. There probably isn\u2019t much mineral left in that mine.\n\nBut Yusuf thinks there is and has garnered resources to explore the endless possibilities that exist in the ecosystem. They launched last November with $300,000 seed money from Zedcrest Capital, Kola Aina of Ventures Platform and Prosper Otemuyiwa, a co-founder at Eden. In March this year, they got accepted into Techstars Toronto.\n\nFun fact: Over 70% of @TalentQL's African clients are Fintech companies.\n\nWe've placed CTO/Technical Lead in over 50% of them. \u2014 Adewale Yusuf (@AdewaleYusuf_) May 28, 2021\n\nYusuf is \u201cconvinced that what we are doing at TalentQL will change the African talent landscape. We believe that talent is Africa\u2019s greatest export and as such needs to be developed and refined.\u201d\n\nAll well and good. But what kind of talent are we exporting and why does it need to be refined? The answer has come nearly eight months after launch.\n\nMeet \u201cPipeline by TalentQL\u201c\n\nThis week, TalentQL has announced a \u201cspecialised training program for Software Engineers in Africa.\u201d It is coolly named Pipeline by TalentQL.\n\nThe program is for mid-level African software engineers, defined by TalentQL as those with three years work experience. In six intensive months, each of them will access \u201cadvanced resources\u201d and will be mentored by top senior software engineers working in global organisations like Twitter, Tesla, Gitlab, Amazon and Google.\n\nAccording to Yusuf, the program is necessary because up to 90% of TalentQL\u2019s clients want senior software engineers. Africa may have about 700,000 professional software developers but many are not experienced enough to meet global demand.\n\nThat\u2019s a familiar line for anyone who has followed Andela\u2019s story. Once the poster child of African tech for organising bootcamps that churned out junior developers at no initial cost, Andela hit the reality-check button in September 2019.\n\nFor a period of nine months to May 2020, Andela laid off more than 500 junior to mid level developers as they trimmed down to focus on senior talent. They have now expanded their talent pool to include Latin America to more ably serve the senior talent need that Africa alone cannot solve.\n\nOn one hand, TalentQL\u2019s Pipeline is a welcome plan to plug the experience gap in Africa by upskilling mid-level engineers. Yusuf insists Pipeline isn\u2019t for juniors \u2013 while the likes of Decagon and Semicolon serve as entry points for novices.\n\nTalentQL\u2019s promise with the program is that those who participate can expect to gain skills that will make them highly valued by employers. In addition to technical competence, Pipeline participants will be taught important soft skills.\n\nTheir mission comes from a good place but will it work?\n\nSenior developers are not a monolith\n\nTo get a sense of what to expect from Pipeline, I asked Sheriff Shittu, who runs a platform for developers seeking jobs, for his thoughts. His first inquiry was to know if the intensive program will involve live projects.\n\nWhile a training can make developers more knowledgeable, it may not immediately translate to experience and readiness for senior roles.\n\nBut \u201cif I work on high-impact fast live projects, my growth will be faster than someone who lets on select projects for two years,\u201d Shittu says.\n\nFor a senior developer at a Nigerian fintech, these four pillars are necessary for maturity: communication, problem solving, mentorship abilities, and ownership.\n\n\u201cI have been a good communicator from day one of my job, but my problem-solving abilities were not as good as they are now. If you become good at solving problems independently then you can take ownership.\u201d\n\nDoes he think Pipeline\u2019s six-month program will get mid-level devs to the senior ladder? \u201cIt depends, people are different.\u201d\n\nInviting similar upskilling initiatives\n\nKeeping both options in view, it is possible for TalentQL to achieve its purpose with this program if it meets a threshold for practicality and participants can meaningfully accelerate their communication and problem solving expertise.\n\nThe other implication is that Pipeline won\u2019t be open to just any mid-level engineer who has worked for three years. There will be a screening process to choose only those who want to \u201cmake the jump to become Senior Software Developers,\u201d Yusuf says.\n\nAdewale Yusuf, TalentQL\u2019s founder\n\nWhich, as you may have deduced, means that solving Africa\u2019s shortage of senior developers will require more than one training of this sort.\n\nDecagon, which aims to train 10,000 developers in 10 years, currently graduates about 100 juniors a year from its campus. It is reasonable to expect a lower figure from TalentQL\u2019s Pipeline.\n\nYet, it could be a valuable experiment for the ecosystem in training senior developers.\n\nIt is a free program that hopes to get returns when participants find senior work; that might be a questionable tactic seeing it didn\u2019t work for Andela. But the justification here is that there is enough demand to absorb people who graduate.\n\nIf that proves to be true, it won\u2019t be long before competitors arise to get a share of the Pipeline pie.",

          "text": "A tweet by Muhammadu Buhari, Nigeria\u2019s president, that seemed to imply certain people in the country will be dealt with violently caused a stir on Tuesday evening.\n\nAlmost immediately, there were calls for Buhari\u2019s tweet to be removed from the social media platform.\n\nTwitter answered that call on Wednesday afternoon. The tweet was part of a thread in which Buhari expressed displeasure at \u201cattacks on critical national infrastructure,\u201d including on facilities belonging to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nBuhari\u2019s deleted tweet was widely criticised as summoning the ghosts of the Nigeria civil war, a deadly three-year combat between the Nigerian government and a government in southeast Nigeria, which had seceded from the republic.\n\nThe Biafra war, as it is alternatively called, led to the death of nearly 1 million people, according to various accounts.\n\nWhile he may have intended to send a strong message against recent vandalism in the southeast supposedly led by the Indigenous People of Biafra, a proscribed militant group, Buhari\u2019s comment was interpreted as an affront and a threat to people in the region.\n\n\u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian Civil War,\u201d the tweet read.\n\n\u201cThose of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.\u201d\n\nThe controversial tweet was from what Buhari said in a televised meeting with the leadership of INEC. He did not seem to be reading from a script, according to a video recording.\n\nTwitter had never deleted tweets by the Nigerian president before. Given that Nigeria is the platform\u2019s biggest market in Africa, it marks a new paradigm in the role it plays shaping civic spaces and citizen-government relations in Africa.\n\nTwitter may have been nudged to take action on Buhari\u2019s tweet following complaints by multiple accounts. Peoples\u2019 Gazette, an online publication on political affairs, reports that Twitter initially said Buhari\u2019s tweet did not violate its policies but reversed itself later.\n\nIn a statement to TechCabal, Twitter said the tweet \u201cwas in violation of the Twitter Rules. The account owner will be required to delete the violative Tweet and spend 12 hours with their account in read-only mode.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile Lai Mohammed, Nigeria\u2019s information minister, has accused Twitter of not being clear in its standard for deleting tweets, implying the US company has a longstanding bias against the Nigerian government.\n\n\u201cThe mission of Twitter in Nigeria is very very suspect,\u201d Mohammed said.\n\n\u201cHas Twitter deleted the violent tweets that Nnamdi Kanu has been sending? The same Twitter that was funding #ENDSARS protesters\u2026 When people were burning Police stations and killing policemen, for Twitter it was about the right to protest. But when a similar thing happened at the [US] Capitol, it became an insurrection.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwitter\u2019s mission in Nigeria, citing those two examples, is very suspect. What is their agenda?\u201d\n\nLast October, Twitter became the platform where the world learned much about END SARS protests in Nigeria. Jack Dorsey, the company\u2019s CEO, expressed solidarity in a couple of tweets. But it is not clear that the company funded protesters in the way the minister alleges.",

          "title": "Banks don\u2019t fund African renewable energy startups. So where can founders find money?",
          "text": "Small and medium scale enterprises in Africa receive about $70bn of credit each year. But the International Finance Corporation estimates that the gap exceeds $300bn.\n\nWhy does the gap exist? Michael Famoroti, chief economist at Stears gave two reasons during a recent TechCabal Live event on financing renewable energy companies in Africa.\n\nFirst, there is an information problem.\n\nCredit providers seem to lack enough information with which to assess the risk worthiness of many borrowers. This problem exists at the retail level as most bank customers who have tried to take personal loans will be aware.\n\nBut it is arguably a bigger problem for SMEs and startups whose businesses are typically regarded as high-risk and unproven.\n\nThe second reason Famoroti gave is that credit providers may not find enough value in the use proposed for the funds. In this case, creditors may play safe by lending to legacy industries like real estate or banking, while taking a skeptical approach to promising but new ventures. Like renewable energy for example.\n\nSo if you are setting up a renewable energy startup to provide electricity to the more than 50% of people living in SubSaharan Africa who lack access, how do you find funding?\n\nThe TechCabal Live event had Marly Diallo, Wiebe Boer and Christian Wessels in attendance as guests.\n\nDiallo runs BRT Energy, a startup that regenerates batteries by reducing lead-acid waste. She started her career in fintech and banking, but when it was time to raise money for BRT, she hid many roadblocks.\n\nIn BRT\u2019s early days, she met the criteria for a certain funding program. But because she could not produce three years of financial statements, she did not get access to the money.\n\nMarly\u2019s experience is not an anomaly.\n\nWessels, co-founder and CEO of Daystar Power, also has a banking background having worked at Barclays for years. Founded in 2017, Daystar now operates hybrid energy solutions that combine solar and generator sets in Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal and Ivory Coast.\n\nLast year, they raised $38 million in a Series B round but it was mainly from development finance institutions in Nordic countries. But Wessels still remembers the anxiety that came with sourcing funds locally.\n\n\u201cNigerian banks played zero role in our financing. That\u2019s not great because we don\u2019t like the idea that as a West Africa company, that we are getting money mainly from overseas.\n\n\u201cI mean, thank God we get the money but why is it that we need to rely on DFIs and European investors when what we are doing is locally valuable?\u201d\n\nSuch experiences scar founders and make it seem like there are no funding opportunities for renewable energy financing within Africa. But some organisations have come aboard bearing some hope.\n\nAll On is an independent, off-grid energy impact investment company. It was founded by Shell, the oil company, as a vehicle for giving back to Nigeria by making impact investments into the renewable energy sector. Shell provided the seed funding but doesn\u2019t make any money from the venture.\n\nWiebe Boer, All On\u2019s managing director, empathizes with founders who need funding but have little sources to reach out to. With banks an obvious \u201cwaste of time,\u201d he advises that family and friends will continue to be the first base for most founders.\n\nFrom there, it might be possible to access funding from All On\u2019s initiatives for projects at the ideation stage. At the moment, the firm partners with two organisations for this purpose: the Clean Tech Hub in Abuja and the Nigeria Climate Innovation Centre in Lagos. These initiatives give up to $10,000.\n\nAbove that is another stage of up to $50,000 debt investment for companies that are, for example, doing their first minigrid or importing solar equipment. All On does this in partnership with the US Africa Development Foundation. USADF matches All On\u2019s $50,000 loan with a grant of $50,000.\n\nAll On could invest further in startups that show promise after this stage. For example, Auxano, a solar equipment company, received the $50,000 loan in 2018. It performed well enough for All On to invest $1.5 million last September to help the startup scale its assembly plant over the next five years.\n\n\u201cIt really is about being credible from the beginning and delivering even at a small level. With that, investors can give you more money,\u201d Boer says.\n\nWhat Marly, the BRT founder, has learned is that a pilot program can be useful in showing how useful an investor\u2019s funds will be.\n\n\u201cYou need to prove your concept by doing pilots to get customers.You need to make sure that what you are pushing is adopted by the market,\u201d she said.\n\nWessels, who now has access to entrepreneurship support networks like Endeavor Nigeria that give Daystar access to more funding, says new founders will need much tenacity and patience along the way. But he hopes they persevere because \u201cultimately, there is a big market to serve.\u201d\n\nWatch the full video of the TechCabal Live event on financing an African renewable energy company here.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Twitter has revealed plans to roll out Birdwatch as part of its efforts to combat misinformation on the platform.\n\nThe social media platform informed users in a tweet that they might see Tweets with Birdwatch notes across all devices.\n\nThe new feature, which is only available to a few pilot participants, requires users to add notes that provide more information to misleading tweets. A pilot version of the product was launched in January, with the social media giant calling it a community-based approach to misinformation.\n\nFinally, if all notes on a Tweet are \u201cCurrently not rated helpful,\u201d there won\u2019t be a card on the Tweet. You\u2019ll still be able to get to Birdwatch notes on that Tweet by clicking on the Birdwatch icon in the Tweet details page. pic.twitter.com/Ubf8qeAWxS Advertisement June 2, 2021\n\nIn a blog post explaining the new feature, Twitter\u2019s VP of Product, Keith Coleman, stated that the move was to \u201cbroaden the range of voices\u201d tackling misinformation.\n\nHow does Birdwatch work?\n\nThe Birdwatch feature comes with two notes: currently rated helpful and currently not rated helpful. Consequently, users can rate tweets displayed as the former to elevate the most helpful ones.\n\nHowever, if all notes on the tweet are currently rated not helpful, there won\u2019t be a card on the tweet, and users can still access the feature on that tweet by clicking on the icon.\n\nThe big picture\n\nJust last month, Facebook announced a new feature that would prompt users to read articles they intend to share. Twitter also released a similar feature last year that reminded users to read articles they were about to retweet.\n\nFacebook has also used the services of its Oversight Board to combat misleading information on the platform, with the board upholding Donald Trump\u2019s ban last month. Twitter\u2019s decision to launch Birdwatch is a different approach from Facebook\u2019s as it lets users decide.\n\nIt seems social media platforms are finally getting serious about combating misinformation but having released several features in the past with varying degrees of success; the jury is still out on these efforts.\n\nWhat should be the role of social media platforms?\n\nIn January, following tweets by former US President, Donald Trump, supporters of the president stormed the Capitol in an attempt to overturn the results of the election. Twitter subsequently suspended the President\u2019s account over claims that it incited violence.\n\nThis week, Twitter deleted a tweet by Nigerian President, Muhammadu Buhari, in which he referred to the Nigerian Civil War.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust like in Donald Trump\u2019s case, the move has faced criticism from different quarters. Critics see such interventions as a gag on free speech, although most social media platforms pride themselves as proponents of free expression.\n\nAs Top10VPN reports, sub-Saharan Africa lost $2.16 billion from the Internet or social media shutdowns in 2019. This could have severe economic repercussions.\n\nOn the other hand, victims of online abuse have consistently called on social media platforms to be proactive in combating issues, such as racism, which are frequently perpetrated on these platforms. In April, the English Premier League (EPL) organised a social media blackout to protest online abuse directed at players.\n\nAs social media platforms become more powerful, the question about whose responsibility it is to check abuse remains. Should governments be tasked with this responsibility, or should the platforms reserve that right?",

Despite the well documented harmful effects of carbon emissions on our environment, petrol engines in cars, bikes, and heavy-duty vehicles rule most roads across the globe in 2021.\n\nHowever, companies in more developed countries are embracing clean energy solutions.\n\nTesla, founded by serial entrepreneur, Elon Musk, is one of the world\u2019s most popular electric vehicle manufacturers. Lesser-known companies like Rimac also make Roadsters.\n\nDespite making some important strides, African companies sorely lag behind their global counterparts where renewable energy is concerned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, some African startups and entrepreneurs are taking the bull by the horn. Indigenous companies like Nord and Asian companies like Hyundai have been delving into the technology for the Nigerian market.\n\nSo far, it has been difficult to achieve improved adoption of electric vehicles. But a certain Nigerian entrepreneur is taking a gradual approach to cleantech for transportation.\n\nTolulope Williams is a legal practitioner who loves tech, toys, motorbiking, and travelling. And in the late 2000s, he made several trips to Asia.\n\nTolulope Williams, CEO of Savenhart Investment Limited Technologies (Siltech)\n\nWilliams visited several trade fairs, and a trend caught his attention; he saw several innovations and captivating technologies based on clean energy. The bike lover in Williams came to the fore as he decided to purchase an electric bike which he brought back home to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI think everybody wants to be a biker, as well. I always wanted to be a biker. But, I didn\u2019t think I had the time to ride or maintain a petrol engine. So, using an electric bike, I realised like, maintenance is way easier, and it\u2019s user friendly,\u201d says Williams\n\nMost Nigerian roads are notoriously bad and ridden with potholes, usually a nightmare for drivers, commuters, or any traveller, regardless of the vehicles they use.\n\nIn 2018, The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that 39,802 road traffic fatalities occurred annually in Nigeria. This means over 105 people die from road crashes daily in Nigeria. Besides notoriously bad roads, the country also has a history of epileptic power supply. The World Bank also reports that in 2018, 56.5% of the country\u2019s population had access to electricity.\n\nWilliam\u2019s decision to bring an electric bike to Nigeria could naturally raise the question, who buys an electric bike in Asia with better roads and stable power and brings it to Nigeria? Well, someone as passionate about clean and awesome looking technology as Williams.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen he returned to Nigeria with his bike, he discovered that the vehicle\u2019s suspension wasn\u2019t good enough for local roads since it was made for European and Asian markets with better roads.\n\nTolu Williams\u2019 first electric bike. Its suspension, while being good for Asian and European roads, could not survive Nigerian roads. So he had to tweak it. Today it stands as a monument at the Siltech office in Lagos, Nigeria\n\nWilliams decided to do something about it, and that decision took him on a journey that birthed Savenhart Investment Limited Technology (Siltech), a renewable energy transportation technology company, in 2012.\n\nBeing a lawyer by trade with no formal technology training, passion was all he had to go on.\n\n\u201cLaw really wasn\u2019t my passion, to be honest. If you knew me from a young age and came to my room, you would see toy cars arranged everywhere. I\u2019d arrange things like spaceships; I wouldn\u2019t throw them away, I\u2019d just try and make something out of them.\u201d\n\nWilliams reveals that he had to learn on the job, and he slowly began to understand the fundamentals of electric vehicles, from two-wheelers to three to four-wheelers.\n\nBefore long, Williams could fix the suspensions, increase the battery capacity, and improve the motor controllers on the electric bike he bought.\n\nWilliams says he was proud of the attention and the puzzled glances he got when using the sleek bike with an irregularly positioned engine.\n\nSoon after, people around him began to take interest. Ezra Olubi, Co-founder and CTO of Nigerian fintech startup, Paystack, then a neighbour of his, saw him riding on his street and wanted one for himself.\n\nBuilding a business from a hobby\n\nAfter this, Williams realised that he could start a business, and Savenhart Investment Limited Technologies (Siltech) was born. However, passion and creativity alone would not cut it this time. So he plunged himself into more training and figured out other significant aspects of his business.\n\n\u201cYeah, there was a lot of YouTube, and I also did a lot of schooling in Asia as well. Some training courses with the EV companies I was working with,\u201d Williams recounts.\n\n\u201cI then realised that the key to all this is really the suppliers. It\u2019s getting the right chain of suppliers and ensuring you have the right warranty for all these kinds of technologies.\u201d\n\nWilliams also had to consider safety issues and ensure that the products coming into the Nigerian market were of the right quality.\n\n\u201cSo, in doing that, we created a robust after-sale service, and really became very, very technically sound on all the products and actually started improving them, and working with suppliers over there to create products solely for this market.\u201d\n\nWith Siltech coming to life, there was a bit of a talent hurdle to cross. Electric vehicle production is not exactly taught in Nigerian schools or regular auto assembly and repair shops.\n\nWilliams explains that the company employs people with pre-existing knowledge of motorbikes and combustion engines and trains them to assemble and maintain electric vehicles.\n\n\u201cWe have about ten technical staff. And then, we also have other people in charge of other areas like marketing, international partnerships and communications, legal affairs, and all that,\u201d Williams says.\n\nFlexing creative muscles\n\nWith a quality team in place, Siltech can design some of its vehicles while tweaking those made by other manufacturers to fit the Nigerian market. William says it goes to great lengths to ensure quality.\n\n\u201cSo each of these products has been extremely well thought out and tested over quite a period in different terrains to ensure that it\u2019s something that people can use every day,\u201d he says.\n\nBut building vehicles at scale for the African market has been complex. Williams says getting vehicle parts has been a bit tricky as everything needs to be bespoke.\n\nSurprisingly, Williams doesn\u2019t believe power has been much of an issue as the company uses a battery swapping technology that allows for flexibility. Users can charge on an inverter, a small generator, or with regular power.\n\n\u201cAs long as you can charge your laptop and your mobile phone, you have access to charging life; you can charge your electric bike. You can go to your friend\u2019s house or a charge centre, and you can charge your battery for the same cost you charge your phone,\u201d he submits.\n\nIf you live in Lekki, Lagos, for example, depending on the size of the battery, some of the bikes can carry you around your locality. Others can take you from Lekki to Ikeja (a 46km ride). These bikes could go from Lagos to Ibadan (131km) with two or three swap stations.\n\nSome bikes can go as far as 46km on a single charge. About three battery swaps can take it on a 131km journey\n\nCurrent model\n\nThe Siltech Showroom, Lagos, Nigeria\n\nWilliams likes to describe Siltech as the church of eMobility in Africa. The company has a showroom in Lagos, Nigeria, where people can walk in to make purchases and a website and an Instagram page for people to order online.\n\nThe company runs distribution centres in Abuja and Port Harcourt, where there has been a high demand. Williams reveals that compared to previous years, the company sold more vehicles in 2020 and Q1 2021; he believes the increase in sales was because of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cFewer people were moving, and there were fewer vehicles on the roads. I believe that got people to be more conscious of the environment and the impact petrol engines were having,\u201d Williams says.\n\nThis perceived adoption of clean energy in Nigeria is symbolic of a larger global sentiment. Tesla shares added $14 trillion in value at the height of the pandemic. In 2020, the Nigerian government announced the Hyundai-Kona, a made-in-Nigeria electric vehicle.\n\nSo far, the company has not received any form of funding, and it runs mainly on the sales and distribution of its vehicles.\n\n\u201cSo we always reinvest in the business. With everything that has been happening, we just continue reinvesting in the customisation of the technology for this market has been the main focus.\u201d\n\nBesides electric vehicle sales, the company also runs consultancy projects for companies looking to delve into clean energy vehicles. Williams was the Head, E-Mobility for Nigerian mobility startup, MAX.ng, and he reveals that one of Siltech\u2019s prototypes gave birth to the MAX E Series 1.\n\nThe Max E Series 1 prototype, one of the first electric bikes used by a mobility startup in Africa.\n\nThey\u2019ve taken the consulting project a step further, acting as consultants for security companies and oil companies looking to employ clean and silent electric bikes for their operations.\n\n\u201cWe launched our e-security, Silent Patrol Systems, a very successful security company. Right now, we\u2019re leading consultants for one of the top security firms that have electric vehicles deployed all around the estates that they\u2019re guarding.\u201d\n\nSilent Patrol vehiles used by Security firms in some estates in Lagos, Nigeria\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also focused on agriculture as well. So we have utility vehicles that pull load as well. We\u2019re also focused on refineries. You know, there\u2019s a limit to what combustion engines can do in the oil and gas industry, and most of these complexes are very, very big,\u201d he adds.\n\nGathering a decent community of users, Williams believes more adoption would reduce the number of cars and bikes on Nigerian roads.\n\nBut how much does it cost?\n\nOn average, Siltech\u2019s bikes cost around \u20a6700k (or $1,700). Not the kind of money for the average salary earner in Nigeria. Thankfully, it allows for payment plans for low salary earners.\n\n\u201cWe have the option for three months, six months, and then twelve months.\u201d\n\nHowever, even on a 12-month payment plan, these EVs would cost \u20a658k ($141) and might be a little expensive for people earning \u20a6100k ($243). It will also be way more than Nigeria\u2019s \u20a630k ($73) minimum wage which most Nigerians live on.\n\nWilliams promises that the company will make much cheaper vehicles that low salary earners can afford.\n\nWhat does the future hold?\n\nFourwheel cart is produced by Lights-Quad-Karts \u2014 an Abeokuta-based cart manufacturer. This will form the prototype for the Roadster, which could be Nigeria\u2019s first electric car\n\nWilliams embraces anyone working in the e-mobility space and does not treat them as a competitor. However, he argues that Siltech\u2019s years of experience gives it an edge over most players.\n\n\u201cIn terms of competition, I think it\u2019s a big advantage. Anybody who would want to enter the e-mobility market would want to talk to Siltech about it.\n\n\u201cReleasing any product in Nigeria is not easy because of the different things that we have. And we\u2019ve already overcome that, so now we just want to sell. We are not testing our products in the market. Our products have been tested and refined through the years,\u201d Williams states.\n\nSiltech also plans to launch battery swap stations across the country in the coming months. The pilot will be at Victoria Island before moving to Lekki, GRA, and other areas in Lagos.\n\nAccording to Williams, the launch will serve as the template for the expansion to other Nigerian cities.\n\nMost exciting, perhaps, is the company\u2019s plan to launch Nigeria\u2019s very first Roadster before the end of the year through its partnership with Lights-Quad-Karts \u2014 an Abeokuta-based cart manufacturer.",

          "text": "Nigerian banks access low-cost funds from individual/corporate deposits, interventions from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and development finance institutions but lend same to customers at higher rate.\n\nNigeria\u2019s Deposit Money Banks (DMBs) pay customers an average interest rate of 1.15 percent for saving with them but lend to customers at an average rate of 18 percent for prime lending and average rate of 30 percent for maximum lending, according to applicable rates for each of the DMBs as of May 14, 2021, published on the CBN\u2019s website.\n\nA publication by the CBN, themed \u2018Bullion,\u2019 noted that 2019 started with the industry weighted average prime lending rate (PLR) and maximum lending rate (MLR) as high as 16.01 percent and 30.48 percent, respectively.\n\nAverage saving rate for the industry during the period was 4.07 percent. By the end of April 2019, the PLR and the MLR spiked and climaxed at 18.23 and 30.89 percent.\n\nAstonishingly, the average saving rate fell to 3.91 percent, according to a study titled, \u2018An Appraisal of CBN Temporary Credit Initiatives: An exploratory Analysis,\u2019 written by Baba Yaaba.\n\nThis implies that while the cost of funds to banks was declining, lending rate was on the rise. This disparity was a clear signal of exploitation by the banks, which is no doubt unfriendly to growth, the publication stated.\n\nRead Also: Nigerian banks lend to customers at higher rate despite cheap funds\n\nResponding to the development, Ayodeji Ebo, head, retail investment, Chapel Hill Denham, says the main reason lending rate will be high is because of rates in the interbank and financial markets.\n\n\u201cRates are in double digits, hence no incentive to create risk assets that come with various risks. To take the risk, then must come with a premium,\u201d Ebo states.\n\nThe Overnight (O/N) inter-bank rate, which is the rate at which DMBs borrow and lend to one another, increased by 2.17 percent to close at 14.83 percent on Wednesday as against the last close of 12.66 percent on Tuesday.\n\nAlso, the Open Buy Back (OBB) rate, the money market instrument used to raise short-term capital, increased by 2.33 percent to close at 14.33 percent from 12 percent on the previous day.\n\nIn July 2019, the CBN increased the Loan to Deposit Ratio (LDR) to 60 percent, which led to private sector credit expansion by 3.46 percent to 2.11 percent at the end of July 2019 from -1.36 percent in June.\n\nThe trend continued until it climaxed at 13.57 percent at the end of the year. Arising from the adjustment in the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) to 27.5 percent in January 2020, however, the private sector credit moderated to 12.57 percent.\n\nAs of fourth quarter of 2020, banks credit to the private sector rose by 2.56 percent to N20.37 trillion, the year that was bedevilled by the impact of COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) banking sector report released on April 2021 showed that total value of credit allocated by the bank stood at N20.37 trillion as of Q4 2020. Oil & Gas and Manufacturing sectors got credit allocation of N3.93 trillion and N3.19 trillion to record the highest credit allocation as at the period under review.\n\nThe reason for growth in banks\u2019 loan book was as a result of the implementation of the Loan to Deposit Ratio (LDR) policy of the CBN.",

          "title": "How Dave Umahi became enemy of Ebonyi people, By Abia Onyike",
          "text": "\u201cAll ambitions are lawful except those which climb upwards on the miseries of mankind\u2019\u2019. Joseph Conrad(1857-1924).\n\nIn the beginning:\n\nSaturday, the 29th day of May, 2021 marked the 6th anniversary of Gov. David Nweze Umahi\u2019s ascendancy into the Government House as the 3rd democratically elected Governor of Ebonyi state. The six years has been a horrible period in the life of Ebonyians. Visitors and foreigners who pass through Abakaliki or those who visit the Governor often tell stories about how the state has become an Eldorado or a bed of roses. Well, Umahi\u2019s 419 government may have deceived some people but he has merely succeeded in declaring himself the enemy of Ebonyi people based on the cumulative anti-people policies of his highly authoritarian and self-serving administration.\n\nThe people of Ebonyi state after six years of Umahi\u2019s fake leadership, have come to the realisation that he was merely after his pocket and the welfare of his family members. He is a man without central values. After he noticed that Ebonyians have deserted him, he threw caution to the winds and started behaving like a loose canon. He descended on the worthy leaders of the state- the same people who made him Governor in 2015. In 2014, as Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Chief Anyim Pius Anyim was instrumental to making things easier for Umahi to emerge as Governor of Ebonyi state. Anyim introduced him to some \u2018oracles\u2019 of economic and political power. The resources for his election was provided for him. And as the countdown to the 2015 Governorship elections gathered momentum, Umahi confided in some people that he needed the faces of people like Dr. Sam Egwu, the former Governor of the state to shore up his credibility to be able to win the election.\n\nUmahi then needed a sanctuary because the former Governor Chief Martin Elechi, whom Umahi served under as Deputy Governor(2011-2015) had described him as being \u201cworse than an armed robber\u2019\u2019 at the Abakaliki Township Stadium during a rally.\n\nUmahi fell out out of favour with Elechi. Today, Umahi has jumped ship and decamped from PDP to APC. Finding himself on a lonely road as the top PDP leaders in the state refused to follow him on his latest misadventure, Umahi declared war on them. He first accused them last year of being supporters of IPOB and now because the Ebonyi state members of the National Assembly raised alarm about the way Gov. Umahi was wrongly deploying the EbubeAgu Regional Security outfit to intimidate and threaten his real and imagined political opponents, Umahi reported them to the AIG Zone 9 who was at Government House Abakaliki on courtesy call.\n\nHe told the Police Chief to arrest the listed leaders of PDP and accused them of being behind the recent upsurge of criminal and violent crimes in the state. That was the height of cheap blackmail and abuse of official privilege and potrays Umahi as someone lacking in political maturity. He is someone who can sell his people for a pot of porridge and he may be willing to become the nemesis of his own people. Umahi displayed his inherent anarchic tendency. He is fond of threatening those who disagree with him on political issues. Sometimes he threatens to \u2018crush\u2019 and \u2018grind\u2019 them. For Umahi to do what he is doing now to Sen. Sam Egwu shows that he is a politician without pedigree. He is merely an upstart and a shameless opportunist.\n\n2. Gov. Umahi\u2019s tragedy of Populism: Administrative Recklessness, Grand Deceit and Massive Corruption.\n\nGov. Umahi wanted to package himself as a Messiah of sorts, a God-sent hero. But his love for money created terrible contradictions for the system he presides over. He is not a foundational man nor a pathfinder. Tyrants are worse than wicked men. And the Mammon spirit is the demonic drive behind all dictatorships in history. The Bible says that \u201c\u2026 the love of money is the root of all evil\u2019\u2019(1 Timothy 6:10). It is such fake populism that may have led him to desecrate the rules of the civil service, so as to be seen as a redeemer and charismatic leader- one who builds numerous cement roads without bitumen; and uses hand vibrators instead of modern vibrators to construct/compact roads, thereby leading to frequent road repairs.\n\nBut populism has its tragedy in politics. It can bring about abuse of people\u2019s basic rights and personality cultism where the leader sees himself as all-knowing. That is certainly Umahi\u2019s problem today. It is the problem of mediocre populism which has failed to anchor because of the prebendalism exhibited by the pseudo leader. Dr. Chuba Okadigbo referred to such characters like Umahi as \u201cpocket-size Napoleons and mid-night Hitlers,\u201d\n\nGovernor Umahi\u2019s government has become a disaster in the state. He does not tolerate any form of criticism, whether constructive or otherwise. He perceives himself as King Herod who must rule as he likes without recourse to the feelings of the people or the rules of engagement for public officers. That was why he beheaded the state civil service on assumption of office in 2015 and emasculated the Trade Unions/House Unions, through deliberate but illegitimate/illegal factionalization, bordering on barefaced tyranny, fraud, authoritarianism and totalitarianism. It was an act of micro treasonable felony for an elected officer to apply political hooliganism in undermining the rules of the civil service. He was the only Governor in Nigeria to have ruled his state without Permanent Secretaries from 2015 to 2019. He sacked the Perm Secs he inherited from the previous administration and refused to appoint new ones. The implication is that all the monies appropriated by Umahi in the four years under review in those Ministries, Departments and Agencies without Permanent Secretaries (Accounting Officers of the Ministries) have to be refunded by him because what he did amounted to misappropriation of public funds.\n\nIt is the worst form of systemic corruption in the history of Nigeria\u2019s public service. The practice of having Permanent Secretaries was never violated by Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, Dr. M.I. Okpara(pioneer Premiers of Eastern Region, Dr. Akanu Ibiam(pioneer Governor of Eastern Region), Col.Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu(Military Governor of Eastern Region), Chief Sam Mbakwe (Governor of Old Imo state), Chief Jim Nwobodo(Governor, old Anambra state), Chief C.C.Onoh(Governor, old Anambra state), Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu( Governor, old Abia state), Commander Walter Aye Feghabor(first Military Administrator, Ebonyi state),AIG of Police Simeon Oduoye(Military Governor, Ebonyi state), Dr.Sam Ominyi Egwu(first civilian Governor, Ebonyi state and Chief Martin Elechi(second civilian Governor of Ebonyi state).\n\nThe duty of the Perm Secs is to advise the Commissioners about the rules of the service, but Umahi hated such advice. Of all these leaders, military and civilian, Umahi is the only one with the temerity to lynch and violate the conservative rules of the civil service. But the time when he must pay for it will come by 2023 when he leaves office and loses his immunity. Chief Sam Mbakwe worked with some of the most seasoned, charismatic, influential and powerful Perm Secs in history, such as S.C.A Nwapa, Francis Oji, G.C Okezie, N.C Okoronkwo, A.E.N Izuwa, Friday Okengwu, I.D Nwoga, Kele Okereke etc. and still emerged as the best Igbo Governor of his generation. His picture hangs elegantly in the \u201cIgbo Hall of Fame\u2019\u2019 with the pictures of other Igbo pioneers/pathfinders in the same place such as Olauda Equano, King Jaja of Opobo, Nnamdi Azikiwe, Michael Okpara, Akanu Ibiam, Aguiyi Ironsi, Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, Chinua Achebe, Keneth Onwuka Dike, Eni Njoku, Z.C.Obi, Philip Emeagwali etc. For the Governors of the present republic, only three have been shortlisted for the Igbo Hall of Fame. They are Peter Obi, Sam Egwu and Achike Udenwa. One of them will be eventually picked after several years of thorough scrutiny. Umahi can never be allowed to come near the hall because trickstars are not worthy of such honours.\n\nAzikiwe\u2019s father, as at 1902 was already a trained teacher in Asaba. In 1903, he moved to Bonny where he met Lord Fredrick Lugard and followed him to Kano. Lugard appointed him his Secretary. They went to Zungeru where Nnamdi Azikiwe was born in 1904. From Zungeru they went to Calabar and by 1st January, 1914 they arrived Tinubu Square, Lagos to execute the historic Amalgamation of Nigeria. Then Ojukwu\u2019s father attended the Hope Waddel Training Institution(established in 1895) at a time when there were only eight secondary schools in Nigeria. He joined the Eastern Region Department of Agriculture and later left for John Holt where he was employed as a Sales Clerk. He resigned from there to set up Ojukwu Transport Company and later became the pioneer business mogul in Nigeria and first Director-General of Nigerian Stock Exchange and by the 1950s was Africa\u2019s first multi- billionaire. So, if their children, Emeka Ojukwu and Nnamdi Azikiwe with their powerful parentage, fame and high education could work with Perm Secs, why should some characters come from the pit of illiteracy to hold people to ransome in Ebonyi state? Infact the non-use or non-appointment of Permanent Secretaries is a violation of Section 208 of the Nigerian constitution. Umahi should examine the Circulars from the National Income and Wages Commission on the Appointment of Perm Secs to determine the amount to be refunded in respect of the first four years of his administration, from 2015-2019.\n\nAccording to a pamphlet issued by the Association of Concerned Ebonyi Citizens in Diaspora(ACECID), Vol.1, titled \u201c The Iron Fist of Poverty and Autocracy in Ebonyi State: Discovering Dave Umahi: His Deeds, Misdeeds, Truths and Untruths\u2019\u2019, \u201c Forget about the cosmetics, the decorations, bling bling lights and plastic Christmas trees\u2026mounting neon-lights and casting of concrete as a cover to retire billions into private pockets. What we are witnessing is gross maladministration, grand lacerny, callousness, cold heartedness, autocratic indifference to the sufferings that has endangered abject poverty and dehumanization upon the people of Ebonyi state.\u201d\n\nThe report went further to assert that: \u201cUmahi\u2019s authocratic personalization of power and needless privatization of state assets and resources to himself has played a perfect symphony of power grab, imperial domination and swagger. Vulgarity is the very definition of his style. He wants to remain the only man standing and towering above a rotten pile of poverty, suffering and helplessness.\u201d\n\nGov.Umahi\u2019s enemity with Ebonyi people was caused by himself. He embarked on four useless and wasteful projects worth billions of naira probably for siphoning funds into private pockets while the citizens wallowed in poverty. The projects include the new Government House project at Ochudo, the Ecumenical Centre, the Shopping Mall and the on-going construction of about a dozen flyovers in the state. Other useless and wasteful projects include the hotel building infront of Abakaliki Township stadium at Kpirikpiri which is still unoccupied several years after it was completed.\n\nUmahi spent huge sums of money renovating the Governor\u2019s residence in the old Government House, but suddenly came up with the idea of building a new Government House. This decision was considered very strange because the old Government House had no problem, it was located on top of a hill with a lake and with the headquarters of the Nigerian Police opposite it. What was Umahi looking for in Ochudo? The old Government Houses in Enugu, Umuahia and Owerri are still where the colonial authorities located them. The White House in Washingston DC in the United States is still standing where it was located 200 years ago. The problem with Umahi is that he has been running government since 2015 without any known seasoned Administrator by his side.\n\nIn fact he hates such people because he had made up his mind to run a lawless administration where looting can be made easy since there can be no in-built checks and balances. In 2015, before he started building the Shopping Mall, three private sector players came forward and bidded to build the Mall with private sector funding. Umahi waved them aside and preffered to waste Ebonyi public funds to build it and now he is confused about what to do next after making his own money from the building aspect of the job. He is always good in buildings but very poor in administering or managing institutions or businesses. And that is why Ebonyians call him the cement Governor. An Ebonyian told me that Umahi knows what he is doing.\n\nAccording to him, Umahi\u2019s development concentrates on the area where he has comparative advantage, ie. where he is very conversant with. But that is not what governance is all about. Now Umahi has failed to understand that developmet is a multi-sectoral process with diverse sectors such as the Civil service sector, Local Government and Rural Development Sector, Water Resources sector, Health Sector, Education Sector, Agriculture Sector, Commerce and Industry Sector, Human Capital Development Sector, Culture and Tourism Sector etc. Umahi has concentrated on only one sector- Infrastructure sector. This is akin to a child who went for examination and the instruction given to him was to attempt all questions. The boy ignored the instruction and concentrated on one particular question which he knew the answers very well. No matter how well he does on that question, he can never pass the examination. This is why Umahi is jittery because he has exposed himself as unintelligent in governance. No single state hospital is working in Ebonyi state. There is no pipe borne water in Ebonyi but every year #3 billion is appropriated for water supplies. Scholarships have been banned since Umahi came into office and the primary and secondary schools are declining and decaying because of poor funding. Umahi\u2019s government does not pay retirees their gratuities. Civil servants in the state have been placed on half salary since he came into office and their leave allowances and other statutory entitlements have been banned. When they are promoted, it comes without financial benefit. What a wicked and roguish government.\n\nUmahi has stopped due process in award of contracts and all the Departmental Tenders Boards and Procurement Council have either been banned or are manipulated out of context. Umahi\u2019s Commissioners are always under pressure from Umahi to get things done according to his whims and caprices, while the Commissioners themselves are always on the neck of civil servants to keep violating the civil service rules through all kinds of political pressures and administrative brigandage. The Local Government system has been bastardized and despoliated because of the insatiable greed of an authoritarian ruler. Council Chairmen are given mere stipends which cannot enable them to run the councils at the grassroots. Development Centres have gone into reticence and extinction. Local governments in Ebonyi state have been paralysed as the staff are no longer needed by Umahi who has taken over local government functions by himself. And he prides himself as one of the great leaders of our time. One wonders what he has done to make him think so highly of himself. Umahi\u2019s government cannot be compared to that of Dr.Sam Egwu. Under Egwu, Ebonyians witnessed a humane administration, which impacted on the lives of the people positively. Egwu pioneered all the sectors of development simultaneously and never practised family nepotism .\n\nInfact, Egwu\u2019s younger ones were intellectually promising and non of them took up any political appointment during his tenure. They respected themselves and allowed their brother to run his government with dignity and decency. In fact one of Egwu\u2019s younger brothers, Joe Egwu, proceeded to the United States of America for his post-graduate studies immediately his elder brother was sworn-in as Governor. But the way the Umahis manifested their level of hunger and abandoned all they were doing to become state dependants is unheard of. Furthermore, Gov. Umahi is a perfidious albion. He is extremely vainglorious, vindictive, viscious, dilettante, sadistic, meretricious, cantankerous, covetious, unnecessarily restless and over-zealously self-centred. That is why he has antagonised himself with the people and there is no peace in the state. It was Martin Luther King who said that \u201cwhere there is no justice there can be no peace\u2019\u2019. And St. Augustine said that \u201cany regime devoid of justice is nothing but a gang of robbers\u2019\u2019. Gov.Umahi\u2019s divide and rule tactics is at the heart of the insecurity in the state, but he can never know it because he is not a student of conflict and does not know how social systems operate. Immediately there is breakdown of law and order or inter-communal disturbances any where, he will blame others and begin to remove and suspend his appointees or even call on the police to arrest people at random, including elder statesmen, because he sees himself as the Rock of Gibralter who can never be arrested or removed.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t even know that the police are independent. Ebonyians are tired of Umahi\u2019s illiterate governance style but are only consoled that he has less than two years to go. The other day, Gov. Umahi sent words across to the people of Amagu in Abakaliki LGA who had concluded plans to celebrate their \u201cAmagu Day\u2019\u2019. The date was Saturday, 22nd May, 2021. The Community had planned to honour Sen. Sam Egwu, Rt. Hon. Sylvester Ogbaga and other distinguished sons and well-wishers of the community at the grand event. But Umahi the tyrant would have non of that. He sent a top politician from Izzi clan to go and warn the Traditional Institution there to stop any further preparations towards the event. He succeeded in scuttling it. He even threatened to seize their staff of office if they dared go against his directive.\n\nSometime last year, the Governor dethroned the Traditional Ruler of Nkalagu in Ishielu LGA and seized his official car from him. The Royal father was effectively deposed and replaced just because Sen.Obinna Ogba was showing interest in the 2023 governorship race and the Ezeogo was perceivrd to be close to Ogba. And even in the case of Amagu, we hear the target is Ogbaga for the same reason of showing guber interest. Is it not their right as citizens to aspire to any positions of their choice in a democratic system of government? What crime have they committed? Well, the main problem with Umahi is that he is loosing grip of Ebonyi state.\n\nWhen Sen.Ogba buried his father on 27th March, 2021, the ceremony witnessed the gathering of a mammoth crowd, with a galaxy of dignitaries which included serving and retired Governors, Ministers, Senators, House of Reps Members, Diplomats and others, headed by the number three citizen in Nigeria, the Senate President, Dr. Ahmed Lawan. Umahi could not attend the occasion for reasons best known to him. He missed out. Now he is afraid that such a grand gathering again at Amagu would finally send him out of reckoning. So he has devised a new method of stopping the gathering of the winning train in Ebonyi. He will soon get tired.\n\nThe ACECID pamphlet under review has documented that \u201cthe N12.7 billion Paris Club refund, N10 billion Infrastructure refund and $3million BESEDA fund were all in fixed deposit accounts\u2026\u2019\u2019. The report further states that \u201cN10 billion federal bailout fund; N8 billion loan from CBN on behalf of Ebonyi farmers over three years; $3 million BESDA fund; N24 billion from UBEB, N48 billion domestic loans, $65 million foreign loans, all stand unaccounted for\u201d. And Umahi is so secretive about public funds, which was why he appointed one of his cousins as the State Finance Commissioner.\n\nIn 2017, he imposed his brother as National Vice Chairman of the ruling party in the state ; another brother as the State Deputy Chairman of the party and yet another one as the defacto Attorney-General of the state. In 2015, when he became Governor, he quickly imposed his elder brother as the Traditional Ruler of his Community. As Chairman of South-East Governors Forum, he appointed his elder brother, Rtd. General Obi Umahi as the Chairman of South-East Security Advisory Committee. And now Austin Umahi, an unknown quantity has become Gov. Umahi\u2019s dreaded but shameless hatchetman/henchman.\n\nUmahi lacks the mental and psychological stability to run government independently unless his relations surround him. His level of nepotism is unprecedented. To further demonstrate his hawkish posturing, Gov. Umahi appeared on the SUNRISE morning programme of Channels Television station on 22nd April, 2021 where he called on security agents to arrest Nigerians who criticise government in the Social Media. Several human rihts groups lampooned him for the outburst. The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project(SERAP), a Lagos based human rights group called him to order, emphasizing that citizens have a right to criticize government and to hold the rulers accountable.\n\nIn Ebonyi state it has become commonplace for Gov. Umahi to declare his critics \u2018wanted\u2019. Once you criticise him or you do what he does not like, he will start announcements on the sate radio station that you have been declared wanted. Those declared wanted by Umahi in the recent past include Ene Odi and Barr. Silas Joseph Onu(State Publicity Secretary of PDP). In my own case, when I criticised him on 9th June, 2020, he made a special radio broadcast declaring me a COVID-19 patient and ordered that security agents should ensure that I was isolated in my residence for two weeks. The then Director of DSS sheepishly obeyed him and came to my house with armed security people to enforce Umahi\u2019s illegal order.\n\n3. Ebonyi State Poverty Threshold under Gov. Umahi\n\nIn 2020, the National Bureau of Statistics rated Ebonyi state as one of the ten poorest states in Nigeria. The states are: Sokoto, Katsina, Adamawa, Gombe, Jigawa, Plateau, Ebonyi, Bauchi, Kebbi and Zamfara. Ebonyi is actually the 7th poorest in Nigeria and the only state from Southern Nigeria in the list of poorest states. The report further stated that the factors responsible for the poverty were: bad government, unemployment and negligence of development priorities. These are actually the problems with Umahi. Infact a similar report released early this year indicates that Ebonyi state is the 3rd highest state in Nigeria in food inflation. Ebonyi\u2019s food inflation rating is 26.6%. Only Kogi (29.7%) and Sokoto(27%) surpass Ebonyi. Again, out of the three states mentioned, Ebonyi is the only one from Southern Nigeria.\n\nGov. Umahi\u2019s governance rating is terribly disastrous. Even with the lack of teachers in Ebonyi state schools, the last thing to suggest to Umahi is employment of teachers. Umahi preaches that people should go to private sector for employment, but he has destroyed the private sector in the state by seizing the market stalls of hundreds of traders who owned stalls in the old market.\n\nOut of frustration, majority of them, who are mainly non-indigenes are dying or suffering from strokes. Umahi has forgotten that the non-indigenes he is chasing about and maltreating were the same persons whose parents built up Abakaliki and made it stand as the capital of the state. Any time Gov.Umahi is asked a question regarding the terrible state of unemployment in the state, he begins to make disjointed and incoherent but deceptive statements, claiming that Ebonyi state is a huge construction site, how he built a shopping mall, international market and international airport to engage the youths. These are all balderdash(akuko ifo).\n\nHis recent fabrication claiming to have built the International Market is another fraud of the Umahi government. That market was built by Chief Martin Elechi, but Umahi\u2019s excessive greed could not allow him to hand it over to the Abakaliki Local Government who are the rightful owners/operators of the market. Umahi condescended from his Olympian height to personally seize the market, which is an aberration in the annals of governance in Nigeria. It is the responsibility of local governments to control markets but Umahi is all-knowing and can never let go. Even the sophisticated Onitsha Market, the biggest business emporium in West Africa, built by Drs Nnamdi Azikiwe and M.I.Okpara is run by Onitsha South LG. Umahi\u2019s brazen take-over of the constitutional responsibilities of the Local Governments was made possible through the selection(election) of pliable and surrogate characters as Council Chairmen in the state.\n\nGov. Umahi had appropriated all the revenue points in the state to himself in such a way that the Local Government Councils are left as mere spectators. He coerced the LGs to cede all their revenue points to the state government with the state acting as their contractors. So, the state collects the revenues and remits meagre sums to the Councils.\n\nGov. Umahi had promised that the old Abakpa market would be converted to Fruits and Vegetable market. But now he has put up advertisements to sell the land in metres, for N6 million per parcels and the old Building Materials land for N12 million. Now, many people in the state are not comfortable with the arrangement. Their argument is that Umahi has impoverished Ebonyians so terribly, and nobody will have the money to participate in the land acquisition except the Governor, his family members and cronies. That is an indirect way of taking over the land.\n\nWhy is Umahi neglecting the Agricultural sector and the Mineral resources sector in the state? Money sent in by the Central Bank as loans for farmers in 2018/2019 never got to the real farmers in good numbers. He thinks that bringing in Chinese patners to mine some sites for him is all there is to developing the huge mineral deposits in the state. He has no serious template on what to do with the huge mineral deposits in the state. Once he and his family members are alright, then Ebonyians can go to hell\n\nAnd the ACECID report, in reference to Umahi family members, noted that \u201cit is incredible that one family would insist on absolute dependence on the resources of the government of the state to the point that they are not capable of doing anything at all for themselves without dependence on the state funds\u2019\u2019. This is so because Umahi who preaches private sector to Ebonyi people recalled his blood brothers living in other parts of Nigeria to come back to Abakaliki in 2015 when he was elected Governor to come and chop. Gov. Umahi\u2019s neglect of the Education Sector has affected the youths of Ebonyi state.\n\nRight now, large numbers of Ebonyi youths have gone back to street trading. Several of them live in abject poverty in Asaba, Delta state, Benin in Edo state, Ilaje Costain area of Olodi, Apapa, Ejigbo, Moroko, Iyana Ipaja and other super slums in Lagos state, where more than 15 persons sleep in one room. Information from neighbouring West African countries like Togo and Benin Republic indicate that Ebonyi youths are the main street traders in those places, no thanks to Umahi\u2019s draconian policies which drove them out of schools.\n\nI am personally ashamed of Gov.Umahi\u2019s backward performance in office, as someone from the same Senatorial district with him. He has really let us down and depicted us as backward people, if the comments by Ebonyians from other parts of the state are anything to go by. The most annoying are his childish tantrums, references to Koboko horse-whips, his constant assault on the basic rights of citizens, which portrays him as a Zebrudaya politician.\n\nThe economy of Ebonyi state has been stifled by Umahi\u2019s individualism and personal aggrandizement. There is tremendous capital flight in the sate because Umahi buys all his building/construction materials(cement, rods etc) directly from the manufacturers in Lagos(Dangote etc) and yet imposes punitive/authoritarian levies and taxies on Abakaliki local traders whom he hardly patronizes. The Governor is the sole contractor of all government jobs, except he decides to sublet some to a few of his cronies. Most of the jobs are executed through direct labour, arranged by him or by companies owned and registered by his brothers at the CAC. Now, he has engaged his sycophants, charlatans and barbarians(who are mostly uneducated) to swoop on anybody who criticizes his evil policies. The Facebook has become their latest platform after the use of Traditional Rulers to ostracize his critics from their communities suffered a woeful failure. The man is certainly the enemy of the people.\n\n4. Gov.Umahi\u2019s Superiority Complex: A Study in Empty Arrogance.\n\nGov.Umahi should be advised to stop his unnecessary grandstanding. His childish culture of kneeling down on, and measuring roads or pointing at different sections of a project is a complete misunderstanding of what governance is all about. He is not a genius in anything. There are better and younger Engineers in the Ministry of Works to perform those duties. He was elected to govern and governance in the state is actually suffering while he keeps running from pillar to post. Afterall, nobody knew him in Nigeria as a wonderful road builder.\n\nIt was Dr. Sam Egwu who gave him the first set of roads he did in 2006/2007 and up till today, Umahi is yet to construct any smooth road in his career as a Civil Engineer. All the roads he builds are always rough and a threat to the tyre\u2019s lifespan. A typical example is the Abakaliki-Enugu Expressway, running from the PDP Secretariate to Onuebonyi River which was awarded to his Construction company, Brass when he was PDP State Chairman under Elechi. The cement roads he introduced will soon become death traps as the edges are yet to be dressed.\n\nWhen Gov. Elechi made Umahi the State Chairman of PDP, he gave him the freehand and latitude to run the party. True to type Umahi began to abuse the powers of that office. He became impudent, arrogant and uncontrollable. While building the state party secretariat, he simultaneously started building his Osborne La Palm Hotel in Abakaliki. Check the building materials used in the two places and observe the similarities and then use your tongue to count your teeth.\n\nToday, the people of Amike Aba axis who live along the Nodo-Ogbaga Road are living in terrible distress. They are the people who sold their lands to Umahi to build his hotel, but they are being punished because of Umahi\u2019s Marchiavellian antics. The Ogbaga road which they use for their transportation and economic activities has been abandoned by Umahi.\n\nUmahi\u2019s claims to being a superior human being played out when he was the State PDP Chair(2007-2011). Umahi querried the then Deputy Governor, Prof. Chigozie Ogbu, accusing him of hosting a meeting of political office holders from Ebonyi South Zone. The man who signed the querry for Umahi at the time was Prince Ugorji Ama Oti, who was the Ebonyi South PDP Vice Chairman. Even though Ogbu did not answer the querry because of Elechi\u2019s intervention, Umahi showed himself very early to be a desperate political gold-digger and one always willing to bite the fingers which fed him. Recall that Ogbu brought Umahi to Abakaliki to execute a contract during the second term of Sam Egwu when Ogbu was Deputy.\n\nBut when he(Umahi) became the Deputy Governor to Elechi in 2011, and handed over the party Chairmanship to Ama-Oti, he started lording it over the Prince and was dictating to him and could never have tolerated being queried by him. So you can see that Umahi lacks any iota of principle in everything he does. When he eventually emerged as Governor in 2015, and Barr. Onyekachi Nwebonyi became the Chairman of the party, Umahi went ahead to surround him with his blood rleations. Austin Umahi was super-imposed as the National Vice Chairman of PDP and Maxwell Umahi as the State Deputy Chairman of the party. The result was that tha party executive was pocketed by the Umahi family, which was the preparatory ground for the excessive monetisation of party primaries in 2014. The PDP in Ebonyi was a dead organization before Umahi defected to APC in November, 2020. Many PDP faithfuls heaved a sigh of relief and it was seen as good riddance to bad rubbish.\n\nIt is equally on record that Umahi as PDP State Chair, querried the former Secretary to the State Government(SSG), Chief F.O.U.Mbam,mni, for allegedly printing a sub-standard invitation card for the 2008 Children\u2019s Day Celebration for the office of the then First Lady, Mrs. Josephine Elechi. Umahi compelled Anaegbu Echara to appear before the State Working Committee(SWC) of the party, where he was drilled, harassed, intimidated and subjected to dehumanizing questioning. Umahi was inspired by his spirit of sycophancy, so as to be in the good books of the first family.\n\nAs the state party Chair, Umahi operated simultaneously as a contractor-businessman, which he still does today even as a sitting Governor. While dualizing the Spearer-in-Deo- Onuebonyi section of the Enugu-Abakaliki Expressway, he saw a car parked in the line of his work. Umahi ordered his workers to bury the vehicle. It has been stated by several Ebonyians who know the Umahis that Gov. Umahi is wicked but the most wicked amongst them is Austin Umahi.\n\n5. Gov.Umahi\u2019s Assault on the Education Sector.\n\nBefore Gov. Umahi came into office in 2015, Ebonyi state University was rated as one the best state universities in Nigeria. But immediately Gov.Umahi took over as Governor, he became restless and started disturbing the peace of the university. He even went to the extent of addressing the University academic staff, a practice that is unheard of in the university system. He reduced the monthly subvention of the university from #350m to N117m.\n\nAn insider in the university who wrote under the pen-name, Mazi Eziokwu bu Ndu on 24th October, 2020 commented that: \u201cthe relationship between Gov.Umahi and EBSU has been unholy and un-Godly, filled with nightmares and regrets. Gov. Umahi reduced Professors to TAs and STAs and changed them from university professors to \u201cDivine Mandate\u2019\u2019 pastors. The ranking of the university nose-dived terribly and the dreams of Sen. Sam Egwu and other patriotic Ebonyi leaders had been shattered by a shylock leader.\u201d\n\nOther atrocities committed by Umahi\u2019s government in EBSU include the demotion and suspension of lecturers for unjustifiable reasons and the reduction of their salaries by 50%. Then the #3billion TETFUND sent to the university for staff training and provision of infrastructure in the university was diverted to commence the building of the College of Medicine in Uburu. EBSU is still suffering from denial of staff promotions; refusal to increase academic staff capacity despite losses of several academic staff to federal universities and refusal to improve the university infrastructure despite increases in tuition fees by 100%. Meanwhile, the university is owing the university staff up to four months arrears of salaries. Then the Governor was said to have demanded that the academic staff of the university should forfeit 20% of their salaries or lose their salaries for the remaining period of this administration. Hiding under the subterfuge of a verification exercise, Umahi is now owing secondary school teachers about three months of salaries, thereby contributing to the poverty of the teachers, as their motivation to teach is drastically affected.\n\nUmahi\u2019s attack against the intelligentsia and the educational system is calculated to suit his parochial weltanschaung. Umahi has a very narrow window through which he views the world. His world outlook is phobic and he has phobia for investment in education and human resources. So, because of his fear of the intelligentsia, he thinks that the best thing to always do is to extinguish them.\n\nWhen the Academic Staff Union of Universities(ASUU ) gave indication of a strike action to press home its demands for improved working condition of its members, Gov.Umahi issued a statement proscribing ASUU, NASU and other unions in EBSU on 22nd October, 2020. He explained that \u201cthe decision was taken in order to ensure that academic and non-academic union activities do not negatively affect the resumption of EBSU and the commencement of academic and non-academic activities in the state-owned university.\u201d\n\nOn 25th October, 2020, ASUU National President, Prof. Biodun Ogunyemi described the proscription of ASUU by Umahi as an aberration, meaning that Umahi\u2019s action was eccentric, unusual and queer. He stated that it was \u201ca confirmation that some politicians have not outgrown the military hangover more than 20 years into civil governance\u2019\u2019. Then he concluded by saying that \u201cthe tragedy of our democracy is that most of those occupying elective positions today have doubtful democratic credentials. These members of the ruling class see the rest of us their subjects instead of free citizens and their principals. Nigeria\u2019s democracy will not take roots until we all rise to challenge this undemocratic disposition\u2019\u2019.\n\nThen on 5th April, 2021, Gov. Umahi announced that he was going to build three new state universities. First of all, he explained that the College of Medicine in Uburu would be converted to King David Umahi University of Medical Sciences, with a view to ending medical tourism in Nigeria. However, the claim about ending medical tourism in Nigeria is an empty claim. Umahi can only build but can never run any place. For instance, he can never pay the Doctors, Nurses and other Health professionals their jumbo salaries. He will become envious of the fat salaries and start talking of salary reduction and that will be the end of the story. And that is why after six years in office he cannot operationalize the General hospitals he renovated in the 13 LGAs in the state.\n\nBut tongues are wagging already that Gov. Umahi may have concluded plans to kake over the university as his personal asset. One may not be surprised if he went in that direction, otherwise why name the university after himself. And we hear he is making frantic efforts to let the institution commence classes in October, this year.\n\nThe other two universities he is planning to build are the University of Technology in Izzi and the Aeroneutical University, to be located at the International Cargo Airport under construction, in Ezzaland. Umahi is making a mockery of himself and can go ahead and build anything his imagination opens up to him. He is looking for a flimsy excuse to continue his cement construction, but never to use the constructed projects to help humanity. He constructs and collects his money, full stop.\n\nHow many state universities do they have in some of the more serious states in Nigeria, namely Lagos, Rivers, Kano, Akwa Ibom, Enugu, Anambra etc? They have only one state university each. Then one of the poorest states in Nigeria wants to have four state universities even when it cannot pay salaries to lecturers in the existing one at hand now. We hope Umahi is not getting mental. He should be examined thoroughly. He is no longer making sense in his actions and conversations.\n\n6. Gov. Umahi\u2019s Omnibus Exco and the payment of Severance Allowance.\n\nI was already concluding this piece when a report came in that Emperor Umahi had dissolved his cabinet. Though I didn\u2019t see it as a serious and significant event, I paused to take a critical look at the Governor\u2019s over-bloated Executive Council, which I consider as one of the main features of his highly incompetent and corrupt government. Umahi\u2019s Executive Council is an assemblage of all kinds of people: Commissioners, Senior Special Assistants(SSAs) and Special Advisers(SAs). He himself put the total number of the membership at 106.\n\nHe claimed to have dissolved 83 while 23 others were not affected. Umahi has about 27 Commissioners. He likes to celebrate mediocrity and his appointments into the council dramatizes such tendency. I believe that he created the omnibus council in order to undermine the strength and capacity of the statutory members of the council, namely the Commissioners. These are the ones manning the statutory ministries and not the concucted/mushroom ministries created by Umahi to suit his manipulations.\n\nHe brings in the mediocre elements into his oversized Council to make the meetings unnecessarily rowdy and noisy, thereby not creating room for rigorous debates and proper voting as is required when consensus is not arrived at. He prefers to populate the council;l with his chorus singers and most times decisions are imposed on the council using such slogans as: No be so, Na so. Umahi\u2019s council dissolution is a non-issue. He may call on them to reapply the way he did before. He would subject them to all kinds of humiliating drills, so that by the time he recalls them they would have been sychologically down-sized. He lacks the strength of character to carry out a far-reaching overhall of the cabinet. Afterall, most of those he appointed in 2015 are still in his government.\n\nHe likes to work with people with internal problems who would not look him in the face and tell him the blunt truth. Umahi tends to empower mediocres so as to get unalloyed loyalty from them. He is always fearful of intellectuals quite unlike former Governors Egwu and Elechi. Those Exco members who argued and disagreed with them openly based on policy principles were highly respected and admired by them. Egwu had only 13 Commissioners of Cabinet rank and one Commissioner without Portfolio(ie. a non-Ministerial Commissioner in the Governors office in-charge of Special Duties), bringing his entire Exco to 19(including himself, his Deputy, SSG, HOS and Principal Secretary).\n\nElechi had about 26 Exco members, because he permitted his SAs to attend Exco meetings.\n\nNow, Gov.Umahi has generated a new controversy in the payment of severance to Executive Council members, especially those who served under former Governor, Chief Martin Elechi. True to his character as someone who can never be useful to anysbody in life, Umahi has come up with some unthinkable and impossible conditionalities. First and foremost, we learnt he started paying those who served under Elechi\u2019s second tenure. And he introduced a discriminatory dimension to it. Only those who served for the whole four years from 2011-2015 will be paid. All those who were in office for less than four years cannot qualify according to Umahi. So, many of those who served under Elechi\u2019s second term have been technically disqualified from getting their severance allowance. This Umahi style is a horrible invention and unknown to the rules and practice of the public service. Even the idea of segmenting it and procrastinating the payment of those who served in Elechi\u2019s first term administration is absurd and sad.\n\nThe payment of the Severance Allowance should not be on the basis of discrimination. All those who served in that government should be paid no matter the length of their services. Serving a government at that level is not an easy assignment. What matters is the scope and intensity of the engagements and the sacrifices made and not a question of the length of service.\n\nAfterall the same Umahi who is here talking about the length of service is still holding on to the gratuities of those civil servants who worked for 35 years and retired whereas he collected 400 million just after his first four years in service. So, why the rabble-rousing? Umahi\u2019s approach is childish and illogical. It is akin to a situation whereby a team goes for the world cup with 23 players and when it comes to payment of the bonus, the Coach insists that only the eleven players who played full time of ninety minutes would be entitled to the bonus.

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s Vaccination Plans May Hit A Snag, Federal Govt Warns",
          "text": "The federal government has raised the alarm that Nigeria\u2019s vaccination programme against COVID-19 pandemic may hit a halt.\n\nMinister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, gave the hint on Thursday while speaking during the weekly ministerial press briefing, organised by the Presidential Communications Team in the Presidential Villa, Abuja.\n\nAccording to him, virtually all the initial plans to vaccinate Nigerians were threatened by non-availability of products from expected sources.\n\nHe, however, explained that expected supplies may not come soon.\n\nEhanire disclosed that the previously planned timelines in the delivery of vaccines for the remaining part of the vaccination programme had changed as many of the producer countries, like India, are currently facing their own pandemic crisis and had suspended supplies outside their shores.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe access to vaccine has been very limited because there are countries that give us the vaccines, but who, at the moment, have only promised to deliver many months from now, they want to take care of their own needs first, their own citizens and their immediate environment.\n\n\u201cThe over 4 million doses we have received so far have all come from India and as you all know, India is facing serious challenges right now with COVID infection, massive COVID infection, which is necessitating their turning their vaccine production to themselves and to their neighbourhood and they have told us that they can\u2019t supply us yet until a bit later in the year.\n\n\u201cWell, let me tell you that there are several countries facing that problem, in that if you do not manufacture, you\u2019re not producing and those who produce don\u2019t give you, and even if you have paid, they will tell you to wait, we\u2019ll give you later, we don\u2019t have vaccine. Essentially, you are in a situation where you\u2019ll have to start looking for other answers.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe, however, explained that the federal government was not folding its arms and resigning to fate, but had been working on exploring other avenues of getting vaccines for Nigerians, itemizing a number of measure being taken until normal supplies are restored.\n\n\u201cWhat we are doing now is approaching countries, which is called bilateral. Bilateral is that you approach certain countries that have surplus, or that have declared they have surplus and say, will you share with us. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re about to start doing.\n\n\u201cSome countries have announced publicly that they will share some of their vaccines. Right now, they are doing donations to make money available for COVAX, which is very good, but the problem is that all that money will not immediately translate into vaccines because you won\u2019t get it until months later.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019re looking for those who want to share. There\u2019s one country that announced that they won\u2019t use AstraZeneca anymore, so we are going to contact that country and say if you\u2019re not going to use it, send it to us, we are using it and it\u2019s working well for us. That\u2019s one example.\n\n\u201cAnother example, I think, is the UK and France who said that they want to donate a certain percentage of their surplus vaccines, maybe they can also share with us. Those are things we want to do.\n\n\u201cWe have already mentioned it to some of those countries that we are ready, we want to write to them and say, share your vaccines directly with us. Some want to give it to COVAX, who will share to everybody. So those are the measures we\u2019re trying to take to bridge the gap, until regular supply begins.\u201d\n\nAsked to comment on the concern that the AstraZeneca product might be ineffective against the strain of the virus, which had been causing much death in India, he said there would be no need for panic on that.\n\nAnswering with an assumption, he opined that India, which is the main supplier of AstraZeneca, withheld supply because it decided to use its product to address the crisis at home, adding that if the product was ineffective against the strain, India would have rather shipped it out in rejection.\n\n\u201cThe AstraZeneca we got came from India and in their own outbreak, which they are having now, they are having a serious outbreak, they\u2019ve told us they will not supply us vaccine anymore, they will use it for their own citizens. It\u2019s that same vaccine, which means it must be effective against Indian variant, which you\u2019re asking about, otherwise they themselves will not withhold it for themselves. So it\u2019s effective.\n\n\u201cThe only variant where there\u2019s a question about the effectiveness of AstraZeneca is the so-called South African variant, for which countries are now using another vaccine, Johnson & Johnson, which we ourselves are also expecting here, perhaps in August happily.\n\n\u201cSo yes, that vaccine is effective against the India variant, otherwise they themselves will not use it anymore, they will be giving it away\u201d, he said.\n\nThe minister also said the federal government wants to get the actual price of COVID vaccine before submitting a supplementary budget to the national assembly.\n\nAccording to him, the actual price for the COVID-19 vaccine is still in rough stages.\n\nThere are different prices of the vaccines, and we don\u2019t really know exactly the one we\u2019re getting. And we also know that the ones we\u2019re getting from COVAX are at no cost to us.\n\nSo what we\u2019re doing is that the additional ones that we\u2019re going to get will take care of 50 million Nigerians, COVAX will take care of 20 million, they are even offering to take care of more than that, maybe up to 30 million,\u201d Ehanire said.\n\n\u201cThe prices vary. Some vaccines are in the neighbourhood of $20 or $30, and others are $5 or $6. So to really make a budget, we are working on rough sketch, some money have been earmarked. But Mr. President has also announced that there will be a supplementary budget. But we want to get a clearer picture first before you actually submit a budget.\n\n\u201cSo, we only have rough figures, and as soon as those figures are there, we can continue. We are also looking for perhaps, as I said, if we have to make the payments, we can find some money to do that. But when that budget time comes, we need some precise information.\u201d",

          "title": "Remembering Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti \u2013 Nigeria\u2019s \u2018lioness of Lisabi\u2019",
          "text": "On February 18, 1977, approximately 1,000 soldiers stormed a compound in Lagos. It belonged to the famed Afrobeat musician and critic of Nigeria\u2019s military government, Fela Kuti.\n\nDuring the raid, Kuti\u2019s 76-year-old mother, Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti, was thrown from a second-storey window. She sustained injuries from which she never recovered and died at the General Hospital in Lagos on April 13, 1978.\n\nAt least two Nigerian news outlets reported her death with the headline: \u201cFela\u2019s Mum is Dead.\u201d\n\nBut Ransome-Kuti was not just \u201cFela\u2019s mum\u201d. The anti-colonial activist and feminist was, in many ways, the mother of the nation.\n\n\u2018No taxation without representation\u2019\n\nVenerable Victor Sotunde, now 88 and a retired priest from the Anglican Communion of Abeokuta in western Nigeria, remembers Ransome-Kuti from his days as a young boarding student at Abeokuta Grammar School. Her husband, Reverand Israel Oludotun Ransome-Kuti, was the school\u2019s principal and the couple lived on the premises with their children.\n\n\u201cDuring morning devotion at school assembly, we saw her come downstairs with her towel always over her left shoulder, walk past us to go to the bathroom,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWe could tell her husband, our principal, didn\u2019t like it because it was also during his inspection of students.\n\n\u201cShe was well-known to us youngsters, as the leader of the Abeokuta Women\u2019s Union (AWU),\u201d Sotunde explained. \u201cDue to her activism, she was given the traditional title of \u201cBeere\u201d, which is usually bestowed on female leaders, and translates as \u2018first of equals\u2019.\u201d\n\nUnder British colonial indirect rule, Nigeria had been divided into 24 provinces. For administrative reasons, each province comprised divisions and districts. Abeokuta province in southern Nigeria had two divisions \u2013 Egba and Egbado, which were divided into smaller districts. Each division and district was administered by a Sole Native Authority (SNA). Abeokuta town, where Ransome-Kuti was from, was the administrative headquarters for Egba division.\n\nAs the leader of the AWU, in the years before Nigeria declared independence from Britain in 1960, Ransome-Kuti often spoke to British district officials to explain her organisation\u2019s position \u2013 best captured by their slogan \u201cno to taxation without representation\u201d. At the meetings, she would speak in the Yoruba language, leaving officials scrambling for an interpreter.\n\nRansome-Kuti railed against what she said were unfair taxes levied on small traders \u2013 many of whom were women, who she led in colourful campaigns. After one victory over water rates in 1959, the Daily Times of Nigeria reported that thousands of supporters of the Federation of Nigerian Women\u2019s Union (NWU) \u2013 which had formed out of the AWU \u2013 danced around Abeokuta town.\n\nThe celebration had been triggered by the deferment of a proposed scheme in which women in Egba division would be asked to pay two shillings for water, while those in the districts paid one. This was too much for most women, who were either petty traders or unemployed.\n\nIt was Ransome-Kuti\u2019s latest victory in what was widely regarded as a war to end the unfair taxes imposed by the colonial government and implemented through the SNA. The SNA was headed by the traditional ruler of Abeokuta, Oba (Sir) Ladapo Ademola II.\n\nResistance\n\nThe women\u2019s revolt against taxation had been rumbling for more than a decade before the water rate victory.\n\nIn 1918, tax policies had been introduced that required women as young as 15, (the age at which they were considered marriageable) including those who were unemployed, to pay three shillings a year as income tax. Men, on the other hand, did not have to pay it until they were 18.\n\nIt was said government agents went about raiding homes and stripping girls of their clothes in order to assess their age for the purpose of taxation and, as the work was based on commission, extortion and abuse were rife.\n\nRansome-Kuti formed the AWU in 1946 to \u201cdefend, protect, preserve and promote the social, economic, cultural and political rights and interests of the women in Egbaland\u201d.\n\nHer aims and objectives were outlined in a document in 1947, called The AWU\u2019s Grievances, one of the sub-headings in which was \u201cStripped Naked\u201d. It contained a list of wrong-doings by the traditional ruler for \u201cmisusing his authority\u201d and by the administration for \u201cnot providing medical and educational facilities for women\u201d.\n\nA food price control policy had also been introduced by the colonial government during the second world war which, in addition to the tax, further hurt female petty traders. When they could not pay, their goods or produce were often seized by agents working on behalf of the SNA.\n\nAfter several years of complaints, the women mobilised under the leadership of Ransome-Kuti, and in December 1947, laid siege to the palace of Oba Ademola II, where they chanted war songs day and night, to demand the suspension of the tax.\n\nRansome-Kuti became known around the country for her activism. She had regular speaking engagements on women\u2019s rights both at home and overseas and toured her region, raising awareness about women\u2019s political and voting rights.\n\nHow it all began\n\nBorn on October 25, 1900, Ransome-Kuti attended the co-educational Abeokuta Grammar School, where she was the first female student to enrol.\n\nIn 1919, she went to Britain to study at Wincham Hall Schools for Girls in Cheshire, where she was taught subjects such as French, elocution, music and dress-making. But before she returned to Nigeria in 1922, she demonstrated the first sign of her rejection of British imperialism: Dropping her Christian names of Frances Abigail and adopting her Yoruba name \u2013 Oluwafunmilayo (shortened to Olufunmilayo or Funmilayo), meaning \u201cGod has given me joy\u201d.\n\nIn 1925, she married Israel Oludotun Ransome-Kuti, an educationist and co-founder of the Nigerian Teachers Union. The couple had four children \u2013 Dolupo, Olikoye, Olufela (Fela) and Beko \u2013 and worked as teachers.\n\nIyalode Alaba Lawson, a community elder who became the first female president of the Abeokuta Chambers of Commerce, as well as of the National Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mine and Agriculture (NACCIMA), remembers Ransome-Kuti as a \u201cdisciplinarian\u201d at school. \u201cThe students who were older than us always said \u2018Mrs Kuti\u2019s class is strict\u2019,\u201d she recalled.\n\n\u201cMy father was also a student at the school and we heard them talk about the Ransome-Kutis and their brand of discipline. Though I was very young, I saw her drive a car and, as a woman in Abeokuta in those days, it was an unusual sight for us as young girls. Many of us took her as a role model because she walked with so much authority and was always dressed in our traditional clothes.\u201d\n\n\u2018Lioness of Lisabi\u2019\n\nIt was, however, the 1943 \u201cGreat Weep\u201d and 1948 tax revolt, which earned Ransome-Kuti the title \u201cLioness of Lisabi\u201d (Lisabi being the traditional hero of the Egba people) in the press.\n\nThe \u201cGreat Weep\u201d episode saw women shed tears over the burden of income tax. According to a March 1959 report in South Africa\u2019s Drum magazine: \u201cThousands of Abeokuta women went about shedding tears. The Alake (the title of the traditional ruler, Oba Ladapo Ademola II) and the authorities could do nothing to stop it, and gave way to the women\u2019s demands.\u201d\n\nIn December 1947, Ransome-Kuti\u2019s husband arranged a meeting of men from Abeokuta town, during which they decided to support the demands of their wives and urged the traditional ruler to explore other ways of generating revenue.\n\nThe meeting and the prolonged siege of his palace forced Oba Ademola II to act. He suspended the taxation of women and went into exile in Osogbo, a town more than 200km (124 miles) away.\n\nIn March 1959, Ransome-Kuti told Drum: \u201cSo we gave a hell of a time to the chiefs, the government, to all those who were responsible for the systematic pauperisation of the mass of the people.\u201d\n\n\u2018We had equality till Britain came\u2019\n\nBut there was no doubt as to where Ransome-Kuti laid the blame for the plight of Nigerian women. \u201cWe had equality till Britain came,\u201d she wrote in an article published in the British communist newspaper, The Daily Worker.\n\nIn it, she noted that before the British arrival in Nigeria, life was mainly agricultural and there was a fairer division of labour between men and women: \u201cThe men cultivated the land and it was chiefly the duty of women to reap.\n\nWomen owned property, traded and exercised considerable political and social influence in society.\n\nThey were responsible for crowning the Kings on Coronation days. Whatever disabilities there (existed) were endured by men and women alike. With the advent of British rule, slavery was abolished, and Christianity introduced into may parts of the country, but instead of the women being educated and assisted to live like human beings their condition deteriorated.\u201d\n\nIn pre-colonial societies and kingdoms, women occupied prominent positions in public administration and decision-making. But, with the arrival of male colonial administrators and civil servants, women were sidelined from their previous roles.\n\nIn 1947, Nnamdi Azikiwe of the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons (NCNC), who would later become Nigeria\u2019s first president, invited Ransome-Kuti to travel to Britain to meet the secretary of state, Sir Arthur Creech Jones. She was the only woman in the seven-person delegation when she triumphantly boarded the Almanzora, which set sail from Lagos on June 26.\n\nThe purpose of their visit was to discuss the limitations of the 1946 Richards Constitution with British colonial officials. Named after Nigeria\u2019s governor-general, Sir Arthur Richards, it was the successor legal framework to the 1922 Clifford Constitution and was meant to ensure a better representation of Nigerians in the administration of the country.\n\nOne of the main objectives of the Constitution was to \u201csecure greater participation by Africans in the discussion of their own affairs\u201d. But it did not extend electoral representation to women and left the regulations on male-only suffrage just as they were in the previous Constitution.\n\nFurthermore, the Executive Council was still populated with British officials with only one Nigerian as an unofficial member. Thus the administration and decision-making in effect remained in the hands of the colonial government. This and other constitutional matters formed the crux of the delegation\u2019s mandate to Britain.\n\nAfter their return, despite some reports of disagreements among the delegation, Ransome-Kuti told the Nigerian Spokesman Newspaper at a reception held for them, the trip \u201cturned out to be money and time well-used, since the people\u2019s side of the case, for once, had been presented. I had an exciting time, sometimes three appointments in a day and before I left spoke with factory workers\u201d.\n\nIn 1949, Ransome-Kuti was nominated by citizens to represent Abeokuta at the provincial level of the General Constitutional Conference, which was scheduled to take place in January 1950. The aim of the conference was to collate the views of all Nigerians as part of a nationwide discussion on a new constitution. Ransome-Kuti was the only woman to deliberate on the proceedings at the provincial level on what ultimately became known as the 1951 MacPherson Constitution.\n\n\u2018She who must be obeyed\u2019\n\nBut not everyone agreed with Ransome-Kuti\u2019s activities and her opponents found willing allies in the male-owned press.\n\nThe Nigerian Tribune newspaper once called the AWU the \u201cTerrorist Women\u2019s Union of Abeokuta\u201d. The same newspaper featured the headlines: Mrs F Kuti Must Be Checked, and That Woman Again.\n\nOne article about the AWU, entitled Women May Seize Power stated: \u201cThere is growing suspicion that the women of Abeokuta mean to seize power and to bring the country absolutely under their own control, a large number of people are opposed to this idea and are urging that early steps be taken to end this move. Abeokuta is going the wrong way. Soon there will be a She-Who-Must-Be-obeyed.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: NECO appoints Ogborodi as new acting registrar\n\nThe content of some of the articles barely concealed the resentment of their male authors. The editorial leader entitled The Women are Ambitious, published in the Nigerian Tribune on February 11, 1950, stated: \u201cIt is gratifying to note that there is deep resentment among the Egba men of this dangerous ambition of their women. They and they alone can stop it; and it is necessary that they stop it, not only because of the loss of prestige in allowing their women to overwhelm them.\u201d\n\nAccording to an article by Nelson Ottah in 1959, which was published in Nigeria: The Birth of Africa\u2019s Greatest Country, other sections of the press showed a more grudging acceptance of women\u2019s activism under the leadership of Ransome-Kuti, describing them as \u201cthe petticoat fighters who had shown they were a force to be reckoned with\u201d.\n\nOba Ademola II, who had returned to his throne in 1950 after 28 months in exile, shared his views on Ransome-Kuti with Drum in 1959: \u201cThere is no satisfying Mrs Ransome-Kuti. Right now, she is up to another devilry. She is opposed to women of Abeokuta paying water rates. I am sure that if she would devote as much time to agitating for progressive measures as she does to everything that is conducive to disorder, she would become the greatest woman in Abeokuta, nay in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nOf the tax protests which led to his abdication, he added: \u201cI could not hate Mrs. Ransome-Kuti then and I cannot hate her now, although she continues to cause me a great deal of trouble because, I suppose, I admire her guts. My only regret is that she is using her guts wrongly. With a bit of more level-headedness, there is nothing the little woman couldn\u2019t do for Abeokuta and for Nigeria.\u201d\n\nSource: Aljazeera",

          "text": "The police in Plateau State\u2019s Jos South Local Government Area discovered an AK-47 production plant.\n\nTwo people were paraded as the factory\u2019s perpetrators.\n\nThe police also paraded 79 individuals suspected of being kidnappers, bandits, armed robbers, gun runners, and manufacturers of phony license plates.\n\nMr. Christopher Dega, a retired Assistant Inspector-General of Police (AIG) who served as Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom\u2019s security adviser, was traced to a caf\u00e9 in Jos, Plateau State, where he was assassinated, according to the police.\n\nJoe Michael and Iliya Bulus were identified as the weapon fabricators.\n\nThe individuals were apprehended by agents from the Intelligence Response Team (IRT) and the Special Tactical Squad (STS) in various locations around the country, according to Force spokesman Frank Mba.\n\nMba, a police commissioner, is concerned that the locally manufactured AK-47 is quickly becoming the weapon of choice for criminals. He believes the development poses a serious threat to the country\u2019s security.\n\nMba praised the Jos-made Ak-47 as a masterpiece that would require professional expertise to distinguish from European-made counterparts.\n\nHe said during the raid on the factory, 20 pieces of the gun were recovered by the operatives, who for a long time, were on the trail of the suspects.\n\nThe spokesman said: \u201cIf you look at these weapons locally-fabricated by the suspects, there is no difference from others imported. Unless you are trained, you will not be able to spot the difference. They use the same magazines.\n\n\u201cWe will follow up to track down those behind this, we will continue to deepen our intelligence, and continue to work with other sister security agencies to check the proliferation of illegal arms in the country.\u201d\n\nOne of the fabricators, Michael, who attended a technical institution in Jos, told reporters that in the last three years, he had built roughly 180 units, which he sold for N80,000 each.\n\nThe suspect also claimed to have learned the talent from his late boss, whom he identified only as James.\n\nThree of the 79 other defendants were exhibited for allegedly mass-producing and distributing special false number plates similar to those used by the White House and international embassies.\n\nSTS investigators nabbed the bogus number plate producers in Ikorodu, Lagos State, according to Mba. They had a total of 80 bogus number plates retrieved from them.\n\nThe Force spokesman said investigations had shown that the syndicate was being patronised by people of shady characters.\n\n\u201cThese shady characters get those specialised number Plates and fix them on their vehicles to beat security checks and to enjoy unmerited privileges in the society,\u201d Mba added.\n\nHe added that the police were in possession of the full list of persons with such fake number plates.\n\nMembers of a four-man kidnapping ring who allegedly abducted a university professor, Prof. Aliyu Mohammed, in Zaria, Kaduna State, were also paraded.\n\nAccording to Mba, the suspects were apprehended near the scene of a recent kidnapping of a Catholic priest in Kaduna State.\n\nA student at the University of Jos in Plateau State was also exposed for masterminding the murder of a friend who had given him a loan of N500, 000 for his wedding.\n\nAmong the displayed individuals was a trans-border gun smuggler known as \u201cBaba Busy.\u201d With a GPMG chain drive gun and 1,600 live rounds, he was apprehended near the Nigerian border.",

He is of course entitled to his opinions, even where events consistently prove him wrong.\n\n\u201cBut facts should not be bent to support distorted opinions.\n\n\u201cLet me give you one example:\n\nThe authors write:\n\n\u2018At an April meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Buhari reportedly requested that the headquarters of the U.S. Africa Command be moved from Germany to Nigeria so that it would be closer to the fight against jihadi groups in the country\u2019s north.\u2019\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari did not request that AFRICOM move to Nigeria. The transcript of the call with Secretary Blinken is available on the State Department\u2019s own website.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a question of the invented addition of \u2018to Nigeria\u2019 with regard to AFRICOM. It sums up a piece that attempts \u2013 subtly but revealingly \u2013 to shift facts to suit an argument.\n\n\u201cNigeria faces multiple challenges, not least of which is the dissemination of fake news and prejudiced opinion.\n\n\u201cThis is something we have come to expect from partisan blogs and politically motivated lobbies. It is still a surprise, and a disappointment, to see them joined by Foreign Affairs\u201d.",

I salute and congratulate Mo Ibrahim and the Mo Ibrahim Foundation for the comprehensive support they provide to the development of our continent.\u201d\n\nThe Ibrahim Prize recognises and celebrates excellence in African leadership. It ensures that the African continent benefits from the experience and wisdom of exceptional leaders once they have left national office, by enabling them to continue to contribute in other civic roles.\n\nOutlining the decision to make President Issoufou an Ibrahim Prize Laureate, Festus Mogae, Chair of the independent Prize Committee and former President of Botswana, said: \u201cPresident Issoufou made history in Niger.

His example shows that those who lead, whatever the challenges, can do so with the greatest reverence for both the citizens they serve and the rule of law.\u201d\n\nPresident Issoufou was congratulated by leaders from around the world.\n\nHis successor, Mohamed Bazoum said: \u201cDuring his ten years in office, President Issoufou remarkably stabilised the institutions of our Republic, strengthened the foundations of our economy, brought about a reduction in poverty, and provided real opportunities for the future of his country.\n\n\u201cI would like to say to the members of the Ibrahim Prize Committee that, in addition to the qualities that you have identified through his governance and leadership, President Issoufou\u2019s moral and human qualities also make him an exceptional man.\u201d\n\nAnt\u00f3nio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations said: \u201cThe awarding of this prestigious Prize to President Issoufou is a testament to his efforts as a champion of sustainable development, democratic consolidation, peace, stability, human rights and gender equality.

This is a priority for both the European Union and Africa, and an agenda close to my heart.\u201d\n\nMoussa Faki Mahamat, Chairperson of the African Union Commission said: \u201cMahamadou Issoufou\u2019s commitment to the development and well-being of his compatriots is known to all.

This has stirred up a lot of rumours in the media about mass retirements in the military,\u201d he told reporters at the briefing.\n\nHe added, \u201cI wish to use this medium to dispel such unfounded rumours. Retirement is only on a voluntary basis for senior officers who desire to do so. At this point, no retirement has been authorised by the Military High Command.\u201d\n\nThe military spokesman also highlighted some of the feats recorded by troops in the course of various operations in parts of the country.\n\nAccording to him, there is no gainsaying that the military and the security agencies are committed to ensuring peace returns to the country.\n\nOnyeuko also assured Nigerians that the military remained resolute to take decisive and adequate actions to abate the activities of terrorists and bandits, as well as other vices in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe Military High Command will not be weary of appreciating the general public for their support and continue to encourage them to provide credible and timely information that will facilitate our proactive engagements in the theatres of operations.\n\n\u201cThe Military High Command also lauds all efforts of the gallant troops of the Armed Forces and personnel of other security agencies involved in various operations across the country for their resilience and indefatigable commitment,\u201d he said.\n\nThe successes recorded by troops are highlighted below:\n\nGentlemen of the Press, it is my honour and privilege to once again update you on the operational efforts of the Armed Forces of Nigeria and other security agencies conducting operations to tackle insecurity in our dear Country.

Thanks to the FBI and IRS-CI, Onus is in custody and facing serious federal charges.\u201d\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cat least approximately 5,500 company user accounts were compromised between July 2017 and 2018, and more than $800,000 in payroll funds were fraudulently diverted to prepaid debit cards, including those under the control of Onus.\u201d",
