          "title": "South-East presidential aspirants not assertive, need to work harder \u2013 Ohanaeze",
          "text": "The apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, has called on presidential aspirants from the South-East to be more assertive and work harder in order to brighten the chances of the region to produce the next president of the country in 2023.\n\nThe spokesman for the group, Chief Alex Ogbonnia, who made this call while speaking with Sunday PUNCH expressed the need for each aspirant to reach out to Nigerians and inform them about their plans for the country.\n\nFormer Senate President, Senator Anyim Pius Anyim; pharmacist, Sam Ohuabunwa, ex-governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi, are among presidential aspirant from the region.\n\nOgbonnia explained that although each aspirant had his strategy, Ohanaeze Ndigbo would not shift ground on the need for a person from Igbo extraction to become the president in 2023.\n\nHe said, \u201cEach aspirant must be talking so that their chances will be brighter. The aspirants from the South-East are not assertive enough. They should work harder.\n\n\u201cIn the Peoples Democratic Party, we have two persons, Anyim Pius Anyim and Sam Ohuabunwa from the South-East. It appears they are not as aggressive enough, But that is entirely a different ball game.\n\n\u201cWe know that each aspirant has his own strategy, but as far as Ohanaeze is concerned, we are very constant like the northern star. Our position is very clear on Igbo presidency.\u201d\n\nHe, however, called on the two major political parties in the country, the All Progressives Congress and the Peoples Democratic Party, to zone the presidency to the South-East for the unity and progress of the country.\n\n\u201cWe made it clear that we are not going to consider vice presidency. It is either presidency or not. Any patriotic Nigerian should reason beyond now.\n\nPlot to deny Igbos Presidency will not work \u2013 Ohuabunwa\n\nMeanwhile, one of the presidential aspirants on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, Sam Ohuabunwa, has said any plot to deny the South-East the presidency in 2023 will not be successful.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe plot will not work. God Himself will not sanction injustice. I am still hopeful that wise counsel will still prevail as most God-fearing Nigerians are in support of justice. They support a shift to the East and by God\u2019s grace, it will happen.\u201d\n\nOhuabunwa, who is the President of the Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria and the founder of Neimeth Pharmaceutical, stated this in an interview with Sunday PUNCH.\n\nHe said he had worked harder than any other aspirant to succeed the President, Major-General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.).\n\nHe explained that the insinuation that Igbo presidential aspirants were not assertive and losing steam in their campaign was unfounded, adding that he would become the nation\u2019s president, come 2023.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt\u2019s not true, that Igbo presidential aspirants have lost steam and are not consulting and campaigning again. Yesterday, I was in the South-East. On Thursday, I was in Delta and I met with the PDP caucus there. On Monday, I will be going to Oyo and from Oyo, to Kwara. We are moving.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just that we don\u2019t have the resources the way Tinubu has; he has so much money and if he coughs, everybody hears about it. But we are doing much more than he does. Our move is towards the delegates, because we are not in the general elections yet. It\u2019s the PDP delegates we are focusing on now; we are not entertaining the general public.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we are strategic in our moves. It\u2019s not true that Igbo presidential aspirants are not doing anything about their ambition. If anybody is not moving, I am moving and strategising. I must tell you that in the last two or three weeks, I have done so much to ensure I clinch the PDP presidential ticket.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cTinubu is known to have so much money that he must spend. Atiku is known to have so much money he must spend. We are not known to have so much money to spend, but we are doing more strategic job behind the scene and we are appealing to the people to come on board with us.\n\n\u201cI have visited Obasanjo. I have been to IBB. I have been to so many others. So, I\u2019m working hard. I have evidence. No single presidential aspirant, in the APC or PDP is doing the strategic job I\u2019m doing to win.\u201d\n\nNigerians should support Igbo presidency in 2023 \u2013Accord Party\n\nIn a related development, the Accord Party presidential aspirant, Dr. Solomon Wining, has said that Nigerians should support the Igbo presidency as it is the key to the unity of the country.\n\nAddressing journalists in Awka on Saturday, Wining described Ndigbo as faithful to the ideals of national unity and integration of the country.\n\nHe said the South-East people were true democrats, as they remained the only tribe found in every part of the country and living peacefully with the people and developing their host communities.\n\nHe argued that the only way to end the agitations from all quarters was to give every ethnic group in the country a sense of belonging.\n\nTracing the leadership of Nigeria, Wining said, since the return of democratic rule in 1999 till date, the Igbo were yet to taste the seat of the president.\n\nWining added that Chief Olusegun Obasanjo was \u201cbrought on board as compensation for the injustice done to the late Chief MKO Abiola, whose June 12, 1993 mandate was annulled.\u201d\n\nOn his presidential ambition, he said, \u201cThis nation needs a man with fear of God, love for mankind, and above all, a person with the will and capacity to fix Nigeria, I\u2019m the right man now to move Nigeria in the desired direction.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Ensuring gender budgeting for sustainable, inclusive growth in Nigeria",
          "text": ".\n\nBy Chioma Obinna\n\nPrecisely in January 2022, the Centre for Social Justice, CSJ, Nigeria, a knowledge institution with a vision of Nigeria where social justice informs public decision-making published a manual on budgeting for gender-based violence, the first of its kind in Nigeria.\n\nThe publication which is part of a project funded by the European Union under the British Council\u2019s Agents for Citizen-driven Transformation, ACT, will see the publication of a thousand copies of the gender-based violence budgeting manual by the end of its first quarter.\n\nThe EU-ACT project is designed to make the Federal Capital Territory Abuja fully responsive to gender-based violence. In the end, it is expected that ministries, departments and agencies of government and partner Civil Society Organisations, CSOs, acquire strategic knowledge, skill and competences on budgeting to respect, protect and fulfill the state\u2019s obligations on gender-based violence.\n\nThis programme is relevant to the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and will contribute to the progressive achievement of SDG 16 but also promotes progress towards SDG 5. The overall objective of the programme is to contribute to more inclusive, effective, accountable and gender-responsive development in Nigeria.\n\nIt will complement sectoral programmes by contributing to the strengthening of a strong, vibrant, and independent civil society which can further good governance through policy analysis and advocacy, by monitoring government performance and the action and behaviour of public officials. There will be a specific focus on mobilising Nigerians, including women and girls, vulnerable and marginalised groups especially at the grassroots level, to participate more fully in politics and public affairs towards improving accountability and effectiveness of government.\n\nIn recent years, gender-responsive budgeting (GRB) initiatives have gained traction and currency. The concept examines the budget of a country to see how it affects women and men, girls and boys. They analyse how the government raises revenue and spends money to see whether it promotes gender equality or increases inequality.\n\nThey focus on budgets, because without money, the government cannot implement any other policy successfully. They ensure the needs and interests of individuals from different social groups are addressed in the budget, particularly women and men, girls and boys. They focus on gender rather than only on women.\n\nThey are not about separate budgets for women or men, but about mainstreaming gender awareness into all policies and budgets of all ministries and agencies.\n\nGRB work recognises women\u2019s unpaid contributions to society and the economy, suggesting ways to relieve this burden and improve its effectiveness and efficiency.\n\nLast week, the Lead Director of CSJ, Eze Onyekpere, at a capacity building workshop on Budgeting for the Reduction of Gender-Based Violence organized by CSJ said that gender budgeting is an approach to budgeting that can improve the economic prospects of Nigeria when fiscal policies and administrative procedures are structured to address gender inequality.\n\nHe also said that a gender transformative budgeting process is imperative for the reduction or eradication of GVB.\n\n\u201cNow, the overall aim and goal of this training are that it\u2019s been quite a while that we\u2019ve been discussing issues of gender-based violence, discrimination against women, but we have been discussing not from the standpoint of trying to provide practical solutions and practical responses and we know that every law or policy requires resources to implement within the context of the policy, plan budget continue.\n\n\u201cSo, for every policy and plan you have, you must put down money otherwise it will not be properly implemented. And we discovered that very few resources go to issues around gender discrimination and gender-based violence.\n\n\u201cEven the little resources that come in are not properly targeted, so, this workshop was to interact with MDAs, after producing the manual to say this is the best way, we can count your request from the authorities because the resources are very scarce and limited, so government or whoever is taking decision must find a very cogent reason why he should put money into Gender-Based Violence than for instance building a new road, and building schools.\n\n\u201cHow do you present your budget request so that it can become imperative and compelling for the authorities to listen to you? So that is the thrust of the discussion we have been having over the last two days,\u201d Onyekpere said.\n\nHe also said that the government is already doing some tangible things but what is lacking is that they have not been sharpened and people are not working collectively on it.\n\nAlso speaking at the close of the workshop, Onyekpere said the training was scheduled to coincide with the period of the International Women\u2019s Day (IWD), and that it has become necessary for government officials in gender-related units to present their budgets in a more convincing way.\n\nInternational Women\u2019s Day (March 8) is a global day celebrating the social, economic, cultural, and political achievements of women. The day also marks a call to action for accelerating women\u2019s equality.\n\nHe said, \u201cFor every policy and plan you have, you must put down money otherwise it will not be properly implemented. And we discovered that very few resources go to issues around gender discrimination and gender-based violence. Even the little resources that come in, are not properly targeted.\u201d\n\nAlso, in a follow-up training by CSJ, Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) in Nigeria agreed to spotlight the gender-friendly budgeting systems across government ministries, departments and agencies.\n\nThe training was aimed at presenting the developed manual on budgeting for the reduction of gender-based violence, reviewing the stages of the budgeting process, and strengthening the capacity of CSOs to effectively mainstream principles of gender-based violence prevention and redress in the budget, advocate and demand accountability in budget allocations, as well as releases and monitor utilization.\n\nThe workshop provided a relationship between the social contract theory and the state\u2019s obligation to attain the rights and needs of citizens and residents within its territory. This obligation flows from the basic necessities of life to more complex demands.\n\nIt reviewed both the legal and constitutional obligations of the state to not only provide and protect the rights of citizens but to also make a budget that shows the revenue expenditure estimates as well as the developmental priorities of the government in any given year.\n\nThe CSO participants at the training committed to budget analysis using previous or extant budgets with a view to extrapolating how they reflect on gender equity.\n\nThey will also be employing budget tracking and monitoring to ensure allocations are properly and effectively disbursed to the priority gender-based violence expenditure items.\n\nThey also agreed to use lobbying and participation in legislative hearings as a means to bring the challenges and needs of actual and potential survivors to the attention of lawmakers and convince them of the need to take action favourable to the rights holders.\n\nCSOs at the training generally work to promote budget awareness- improved understanding of budget data for legislators and other CSOs, budget transparency- independent scrutiny, dissemination and improved access to government data and participation in the budget process which involves improved legislative engagement.\n\nIntroducing gender budgeting at the federal government level is important because budgetary decisions on both revenue and expenditure are made at this level. At the same time, state and local governments\u2019 proximity to people\u2019s everyday lives means there is potential to respond more directly to women\u2019s and men\u2019s needs when it comes to public policy and service delivery. At these levels, there is great potential to use participatory gender budgeting approaches involving the local population.\n\nIndeed, the effective implementation of gender budgeting requires political commitment matched with a technical capacity for gender mainstreaming. Engaged leadership is of particular importance to ensure that gender equality is integrated into the planning and budgeting processes and that public budget revenues and expenditures benefit women and men equally.\n\nThere are several important principles underlying a high-quality budget process. Modern standards of public financial management include principles such as performance orientation, transparency, accountability, participation, etc., that can only be applied if a gender perspective is integrated.\n\nSince an important part of gender budgeting is analysing the impact of budgets on women and men, it is also considered to be an important part of monitoring how the budget is working towards meeting gender equality goals in a country. Researchers therefore consider gender budgeting to be \u2018a mechanism for establishing whether a Government\u2019s gender equality commitments translate into budgetary commitments\u2019.\n\nIf applied in a systematic manner, gender budgeting can contribute to increasing participation in the budget process and thereby also increase transparency. Increased participation in the budget process can be achieved by establishing a practice of public consultation and participation in budget preparation, or of public participation in monitoring the budget.\n\nMore so, a true performance-oriented approach to budgeting only happens when gender budgeting is integrated in performance budgeting. This is because gender budgeting provides evidence on performance from gender perspectives that will promote the most effective and efficient allocation of resources and implementation of policies.\n\nIn this direction, gender budget analysis contributes to improved information on the potentially different situations and needs of women and men, as well as on distributional effects and the impact of resources on women and men. Thus, gender budgeting provides the basis for better and more evidence-based decision-making. This in turn contributes to ensuring that public funds are being used more effectively.\n\nFrom all points of view, it is evident that gender equality is not just a fundamental human right because achieving gender equality also brings tremendous socioeconomic benefits. Several studies have shown that reducing gender inequality has many positive effects and leads to higher growth rates, healthier children, improved labour productivity and a more responsive government. Thus, gender responsive budgets, and related policies, will contribute towards achieving gender equality and will simultaneously improve the population\u2019s welfare and lead to more sustainable and inclusive growth and employment",

          "text": ".\n\nBy Chioma Obinna\n\nIn continuation of its sustained efforts towards creating awareness and sensitizing the public on health-related issues, the 5th edition 9mobile health talk series tagged: \u201cMental health; the myth, the challenge & recovery\u201d is calling for a fact-checked approach to mental health-related issues.\n\nThe session was live-streamed on the @healthertainer Instagram handle and featured Africa\u2019s leading mental health advocate and coach, Dr Maymunah Yusuf Kadiri as a facilitator.\n\nKadiri highlighted the myths around mental health challenges and more importantly, what the recovery process entails, describing mental health as the ability to be productive, fruitful and be able to give back to society.\n\nWhile dispelling some of the myths, she remarked that mental illness does not have any spiritual undertone as people are made to believe particularly in our clime. In her submission, mental health belongs to the category of non-communicable diseases.\n\nShe noted that 1 in every 5 persons in Nigeria has a mental illness; with data showing that mental illness starts before the age of 14 in some instances.\n\n\u201cEverybody has mental health but not everybody has a mental illness which is a medical condition as it were. It will therefore be correct to conclude that nobody has immunity against mental health disorder,\u201d she stated.\n\nEnumerating some of the stress factors that could trigger mental illness, she said, \u201cSome of the risk vulnerability factors include; death of one\u2019s parent or loved ones, divorce in families, domestic violence, positive history of mental illness and of course, societal pressure, which can be attributed to the harsh socio-economic realities in the country.\u201d\n\nShe appealed that: \u201cit is important to appreciate the fact that mental illness is real and therefore seek for ways to address the challenges than living in self-denial. There is good news and there is bad news about mental illness: The good news is that it is beatable, treatable and manageable with help readily available for quick recovery. While the bad news is that the longer it takes to seek medical help the more complicated it can become.\u201d\n\nSpeaking, on the session, Executive Director, Regulatory and Corporate Affairs, 9mobile, Abdulrahman Ado, who was represented by 9mobile\u2019s Public Relations Lead, Chineze Amanfo, reiterated that mental health challenges should be paid more attention, particularly among the productive population.\n\nHe said \u201cMental Health is a critical issue that needs attention. 9mobile will continue to bring the issue to the fore to promote a healthier and safer society for all. Therefore, we are excited that the health talk series for 2022 has kick-started on a very impactful note, with emphasis on mental well-being which is paramount for optimal productivity. This is one of the reasons why we focus on health as one of our strategic corporate social responsibility (CSR) pillars\u201d",

You can see a lot of leadership failure. A lack of direction in terms of government policies are the things that affect leadership.\n\n\u201cWhen there\u2019s no direction as to where we are going and what we are going to achieve within a certain framework and time at the end of the day we will just be pursuing the entire process without a concrete thing we can lay our hands on that in the next number of years we would have been able to achieve this aspect of the economy that would have strengthened other areas of the economy.\n\n\u201cFor that particular reason it is very imperative at this moment that Nigerians need to look very well to be able to elect leaders that have the ability to manage the economy, we need an expert as the President of this country at the moment.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in the same vein, Executive Director New Era for Sustainable Leadership and Accountability Initiative, Comrade Edwin Olorunfemi, lamented the pain Nigerians are currently passing through, saying that civil society organisations play major roles in helping policymakers ameliorate the burden peeving Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe feel the need to help the policymakers and MDAs to fulfil their mandates. We feel it is not good enough to leave it in the hands of managers. We as civil society practitioners feel we should be contributing to their mandates.\n\n\u201cAs it is Nigerians are crying, things are not moving well as expected and it seems as if there\u2019s no hope. But we feel the pain is too much and civil societies can come in to help ameliorate. We will invest any ideas that will help Nigerians out of these doldrums.\n\n\u201cAnd also it is not always about the leadership even the followers to have their own problems. Nigerians don\u2019t want to pay but they want to enjoy, so we have attitudes that are anti-development, that we ourselves have to change. The change we are looking for is not a one-person thing, it is a collective effort, it begins from the roots, our homes and values,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his part, Executive Director of the National Lottery Trust Fund, Bello Maigari, said, the Lottery Trust Fund remains an integral fragment in Nigeria\u2019s quest for economic development.",

The kingmakers and the local government officials are using this opportunity to enrich themselves and their plan is to announce the next Soun against the wishes of the teeming population of Ogbomoso sons and daughters.\n\n\u201cThere is another rumor making the rounds that the said Prince also bought a brand new car for the arrowhead of the Ogbomoso Kingmakers.\n\n\u201cHow true this claim is we can not say. But we are convinced beyond the least shadow of doubt that the fresh screening conducted for all the twenty-five aspirants by the Kingmakers and the local government officials when some of them were already out of the race was a confirmation that they were up to something and they were acting the script of some paid agents.\n\n\u201cAs an association of responsible indigenes of Ogbomosoland we will not fold our hands and allow this monumental daylight robbery and fraud to stand.\n\n\u201cWe want the whole process to stop now and be reviewed. The Oyo State Governor, Engr Oluseyi Makinde must intervene as done in the Olubadan issue. Our elders, because of money, are inviting the wrath of the ancestors.\n\n\u201cThey are turning our tradition into a money making venture. They want to set the whole town on fire. We are calling for full investigations into all these allegations and we want the state Governor to punish anyone found culpable of attempts to subjugate and sacrifice culture and traditions as well as uprightness at the altar of monetary gains and inducement\u201d.\n\nBut, the Aare Ago of Ogbomoso, High Chief Aare Ago when contacted, said that a letter has been sent to the state government to decide who to pick.\n\nAare Ago, in a telephone conversation with DAILY POST Saturday evening, noted that it is certain that one person would be chosen among the contenders.\n\nThe High Chief, who is one of the kingmakers, added that it is possible for those who could not make it to raise an alarm of being cheated.\n\n\u201cThey said that we want to favour a candidate. A letter has been sent to the government. Whether we want to favour anyone or not, the government will speak at the appropriate time.\n\n\u201cYou know in a contest when there are many contenders, anyone who fails will talk.\u201d",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari, Saturday night, admonished the new National Working Committee (NWC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) de-emphasise money politics and always allow the most popular candidates to emerge.\n\nThe President gave the admonition late Saturday while speaking at the National Convention of the APC, held at the Eagle Square, Abuja, even as he charged the party to espouse fairness and values of internal democracy.\n\nThe President, who spoke just before the commencement of the elections into party positions, also charged those who would be contesting for party and elective positions to learn to accept outcomes of contests with grace, without allowing discontent to affect the chances of the party.\n\nHe, however, charged the party to remain united and strong and also support the incoming leadership of the party.\n\n\u201cHowever, I wish to enjoin the incoming National Working Committee to as a matter of policy, promote internal democracy and always respect the wishes of the people. We must de-emphasize money politics, and subject party primary and elections into public offices, to the highest bidder syndrome.\n\n\u201cPopular and acceptable aspirants who remain the people\u2019s choice must be allowed to fly the party\u2019s flag in the 2023 elections. We will resist the imposition of candidates. We should also promote equal opportunities and respect for the laws guiding the elections to stand us out as Nigeria\u2019s ruling Party.\n\n\u201cIt is our hope that the new electoral act which l recently signed into law, would promote the process of election, enhance transparency, fill in existing gaps and add value to Nigeria\u2019s democracy. I, therefore, call on all the political parties, politicians and indeed the electorate, to be guided by the act and all other relevant laws for our democracy to thrive.\n\nHe noted that the Convention came at a very crucial period, being just a few months away from general elections, and charged that everything be done to keep the party together so it could take full advantage of its massive size to land victory in 2023.\n\n\u201cThis Convention is coming at a crucial time when we prepare for another round of a general election. Therefore, the need to remain strong and united for the Party to exploit the rich and abundant potentials at its disposal cannot be overemphasized. We appreciate the right to hold different opinions and aspirations, however, such differences must not be to the detriment of the Party.\n\n\u201cl passionately appeal to you all to support the incoming National Working Committee (NWC) to promote unity and avoid sentiments that are capable of causing disaffection and disunity. For those aspiring for party and public offices, your failure to realize such aspirations for Party offices or to fly the Party\u2019s flag, should not be a basis for a campaign of calumny against the party. We should have the spirit of sportsmanship and always support the party to succeed.\u201d\n\nHe commended the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee for steering the ship of the party this far including; reconciling aggrieved party members, purchasing a new party secretariat and launching an aggressive membership drive that saw three governors defecting into the APC, among others.\n\n\u201cI want to congratulate us all for being part of this history-making event and to specially appreciate the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) which has been on a rescue mission under the leadership of His Excellency, Mai Mala Buni, the Yobe State Governor, for successfully piloting the affairs of the Party in the last 18 months and organizing this Convention to elect a new National Working Committee that will take over from the Caretaker Committee.\n\n\u201cI am glad the Party under the Caretaker Committee has bounced back to life with the reconciliation of several key and critical stakeholders and groups who had hitherto left the party or were on the verge of leaving the Party. The reconciliation process gave the aggrieved stakeholders a true sense of belonging and assurance.\n\n\u201cIt is gratifying that the Party recorded massive and unprecedented defections under the Caretaker Committee administration. APC received three sitting Governors, a Deputy Governor, Senators, Members of the House of Representatives and State Assemblies, and other key officials from opposition parties who defected along with millions of their supporters.\n\n\u201cI am impressed to learn that the membership registration and revalidation exercise undertaken by the Caretaker Committee, has recorded over 41 million members. This has proved that we are indeed Nigeria\u2019s leading and largest political party. It also exhibits our numerical strength and the potential to win elections at all given times fairly and squarely.\u201d\n\nThe President who adduced reasons for his recent intervention in the affairs of the party, assured that it was not intended to muzzle dissenting voices.\n\n\u201cRecently, l had cause to intervene in the leadership crisis which was about to cause confusion in the Party. Such internal disputes are common in young democracies such as ours, but we must avoid overheating the polity and not allow our differences to tear and frustrate the Party.\n\n\u201cLike I said earlier, it does not do anybody or the Party any good, when we, as leaders, go down so low and resort to backstabbing and name-calling in the media.\n\n\u201cWe should learn how to resolve our differences without jeopardizing our personal relationships and the fate of the Party. I want to thank the Progressives Governors\u2019 Forum for heeding to my advice and suggestions in settling the leadership dispute,\u201d the President said.\n\nPresident Buhari called on all politicians and the electorate to abide by the new Electoral Act \u201c to promote the process of election, enhance transparency, fill in existing gaps and add value to Nigeria\u2019s democracy for our democracy to thrive.\u201d",

All the 6 other aspirants have consented in writing to the consensus arrangement. I think it\u2019s a step ahead.\n\n\u201cIt was an appeal. There was no pressure on anybody.

Sunday Frank Okputu, while speaking in Yenagoa on Saturday, argued that the decision not to allow all delegates of the party from Bayelsa State is right and has saved the party from any disaster that may arise from the subsisting litigation over the authenticity of the last ward, local government and state congresses.\n\nFrank-Okputu commended the caretaker leadership, the Reconciliation Committee and every member of the APC for upholding the agitations of those against impunity in Bayelsa APC.\n\n\u201cThey have saved the national leadership of the party from doom because the pending litigations could damage the outcome of the convention. It will ensure that there is sanity in the process.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe decision is worthy of emulation and will ensure that there is sanity in the way things are done within the party. You can not run into a house from the back door and claim to be right. The decision to exclude purported delegates from Bayelsa will ensure that the right things are done in line with the provisions of party rules and the Electoral Act as amended.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI thank all party faithful in Bayelsa that kept faith with the true progressives led by Sen. Heineken Lokpobiri. It shows we were on the right path and to ensure the right people are allowed to lead the party in the state.\u201d\n\nIt would be recalled that few hours to the National Convention of the party, the Secretary of the subcommittee of Accreditation, Alhaji Tijani Musa Tumsah, had announced that only statutory delegates from Sokoto, Bayelsa, Akwa-Ibom and Taraba States will be allowed to vote due to pending litigations.\n\n4:31pm\n\n2023: Youth Groups Storm APC Convention, Endorse Emefiele for President\n\n\n\nSunday Aborisade in Abuja\n\nVarious groups of youths across the country, in their hundreds, stormed the Eagles Square Convention ground of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abuja Saturday and demanded that the Central Bank Governor (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, should declare his ambition to contest the 2023 presidential election without further delay. The mammoth crowd consisted of women, young professionals and other Nigerians who wore Emefiele\u2019s branded colourful apparels.\n\nThey were led by the APC League of Young Professionals, Ethnic Youth Leaders\u2019 Council, and the Emefiele Support Group.\n\nThe groups overran the convention ground with calls on the CBN Governor, to contest the presidency in 2023. Addressing the media, the group reiterated the need for a worthy successor to President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nHe claimed that Nigeria cannot afford to miss the golden opportunity of electing a financial expert and globally renowned economist like Emefiele at this time in Nigeria\u2019s history.\n\nMallam Kabir Buba, who spoke on behalf of the group, explained the type a leader Nigeria deserves in 2023, added that: \u201cSuch a successor must be a professional, loyal to the president, a technocrat, a patriot and detribalised Nigerian.\n\n\u201cHe must be one who has been part of the progress recorded in this administration and a less controversial leader.\n\n\u201cMost importantly, he must be a unifier and peace builder, someone to douse the South-south quest for one more term and satisfy the Igbo agitations for the presidency.\u201d\n\nThe groups added that Emefiele fits the bill and is the man to continue to consolidate and expand the progressive legacies of President Buhari. The groups\u2019 leaders emphasised the CBN Governor\u2019s patriotism and his irrepressible commitment to the growth and development of the Nigerian economy.\n\nThey said his good character and attributes would make him a worthy successor to the president.\n\nThey said: \u201cAs an experienced economist with more than 26 years of commercial banking experience, Emefiele is well equipped to place Nigeria amongst developed and wealthy nations in the world.\u201d They insisted that his recorded achievements were too many to mention.\n\nThey re-emphasised that Emefiele, having worked in the two political divides, appointed by the Peoples Democratic Party government, and retained by the APC as the CBN Governor, has continued to show great dedication and commitment regardless of political alliances.\n\nAccording to the groups\u2019 spokesperson, \u201cOver seven years as the CBN Governor, he has saved Nigeria twice from economic recession and created initiatives that target job creation with over seven million jobs.\u201d\n\n4:14pm\n\nOshiomhole Arrives Convention Ground amid Cheers from APC Members\n\nEmameh Gabriel in Abuja\n\nFormer Governor of Edo State, Adams Oshiomhole, stole the show at the APC national convention when he walked into Eagle Square amid cheers by party faithful.\n\nThe former APC national chairman was seen dressed in his usual labour uniform, escorted by his supporters.\n\nOshiomhole danced to the admiration of delegates who chanted \u201cOshobaba\u201d, \u201cOshioquake\u201d and showered him with encomium.\n\nFielding questions from journalists, Oshiomhole said God had shamed few enemies of the party who wanted to cause confusion in the party.\n\nHe said that the convention was holding today, was a sign that God was at work.\n\n4:09pm\n\nSouth-South APC Consensus List Emerges\n\n*Delta gets national publicity secretary, Rivers settles for vice national chairman\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nSouth south zone has released the list of consensus candidates with Delta state picking the office of the National Publicity Secretary, while Rivers got the office of the national vice chairman for the South south.\n\nThe list of nominees as consensus candidates was signed by Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State, Secretary of the CECPC, Senator John Akpanudoudehe; Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Ameachi, and Minister of Niger-Delta, Godswill Akpabio.\n\nOthers who signed the list were the party\u2019s former Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole; a former Minister of State for Agriculture, Heineken Lokpobiri, and former Edo State Deputy Governor, Lucky Imasuen.\n\nAlso at the meeting where the decision was made was Mrs Stella Okotete, the representative of women in the Caretaker Extraordinary Committee; representative of the South-South in the CECPC, Mr David Lyon; Sen. Ita Enang, Sen. Magnus Abe, Mr Victor Giadom and Deputy Senate President, Sen. Ovie Omo-Agege.\n\nHowever, all the six states in the region were allocated at least an office as shown in the list.\n\nTop on the list of the beneficiaries is the former deputy National Secretary of the party, Victor Giadom, who is returning to the party as National Vice Chairman (South-South) and a member of the NWC.\n\nGiadom, a former commissioner of works in Rivers State, became popular when he pronounced himself the acting national chairman of the party, an action that finally led to the sacking of a former Governor of Edo State, Adams Oshiomhole as the party\u2019s national chairman almost two years ago.\n\nOther adopted candidates are Delta State Commissioner for Health, Dr Betta Edu (National Women Leader), and Mr Felix Morka (National Publicity Secretary).\n\nA statement issued by the stakeholders said that the three party members were adopted at the last meeting of the stakeholders held in Abuja.\n\nThe National Vice Chairman South-South is zoned to Rivers/Bayelsa states, National Women Leader to Akwa Ibom/Cross River states and National Publicity Secretary to Edo/ Delta States.\n\nWhile Governor Ayade picked Edu (Cross River) for the National Women Leader, Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, was said to have picked Giadom (Rivers State) for the position of National Vice Chairman.\n\nOmo-Agege was also said to have picked Morka (Delta State) for the National Publicity Secretary position.\n\nThe position of others who obtained the expression of interest and nomination forms to contest the positions was not clear as at press time.\n\n3:57pm\n\nStampede at Convention Venue, Police Deploy Dogs to Control Crowd\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nThere was stampede at the ongoing NationaI Convention of the All Progressive Congress, at the Eagles Square, Abuja. More than 30 people were injured, including a pregnant member of the party.\n\nPolice dogs were however deployed to control the large crowd of delegates.\n\nAccording to an eyewitness, police and Civil Defence Corps chased the delegates and the party supporters with dogs.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the delegates had stormed the venue waiting for clearance since 6:30am.\n\nDelegates and other party men and women lost their patience and started pushing themselves as they complained about the slow pace of the clearance.\n\nIt was gathered that the police had to use teargas as the crowd became uncontrollable and in the process, stampede ensued.\n\nThe policemen were seen beating people with batons as they tried to control of the crowd.\n\nSome were said to have sustained injuries at the entrance of the venue where the massive crowd was waiting to be screened by the security agents.\n\nIt was learnt that the screening pace was slow because of the large crowd, when the stampede occurred and the security agents at the gate were helpless.\n\nSome APC stalwarts and leaders were seen coming to the venue at about 12 noon.\n\nThe lateness was because of the various meetings to finalise arrangement for the consensus candidate.\n\n2:38pm\n\nGovernor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State and Femi Fani Kayode arriving the venue of the convention\n\n2:14p.m\n\nOsinbajo, Tinubu, Emefiele, Amaechi\u2019s Posters Flood Abuja\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nThe banners, poster and billboards of key political figures believed to have interest in picking the presidential ticket of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) have been placed in strategic places in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja ahead of the convention holds today.\n\nThe personalities whose pictures were displayed conspicuously in the banners, posters and billboards included Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, former Lagos Governor Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, and Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi.\n\nOne of the banners showing the minister along Umaru Musa Yar\u2019adua Expressway read: \u201cAmaechi: Our Hope 2023\u201d.\n\nThe billboards of Tinubu, Osinbajo, and Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State were also seen along the Airport Expressway.

position of the All Progressives Congress (APC) have withdrawn from the race.\n\nIn a letter dated 25th March, which was signed by Senator George Akume, the aspirants said their decision was premised

who were also caught in the web in efforts to enter the venue, were chased away.\n\nA THISDAY reporter also sustained a minor injury in the process from a police officer.\n\nAt a point, the police had deployed force and security dogs to deter delegates from forcing their way into the first gate and this sent the crowd scampering for safety.\n\nThe programme of events for the convention indicated that delegates were to arrive for screening at 10 am but over 70% of them were still battling to gain access to the venue as at 10am.\n\nAlthough security personnel have been able to manage the challenges, with only one entrance provided for thousands of delegates from the 36 states and FCT, it would be an impossible task to clear all of them today.\n\nFood vendors and small business owners at the venue are making brisk business selling snacks and drinks at the venue.\n\nSee photos\n\n7:44AM\n\nTight Security at Eagle Square, as APC Holds Convention Today\n\nEmameh Gabriel in Abuja\n\nThere is a heavy security presence at Eagle Square Abuja, venue of the national convention of the All Progressive Congress (APC).\n\nSecurity personnel are manning strategic locations and roads around the Eagle Square and Federal Secretariat, while armoured personnel carriers are stationed at the adjoining junctions.\n\nMeanwhile, the roads along the axis have been closed to traffic, resulting in gradual build up of gridlocks.\n\nSome APC supporters from across the country who arrived Abuja yesterday slept on roads at the Three Arms Zone to enable them gain easy access to the venue.\n\nSee photos\n\n7:00AM\n\nAfter Months of Rancour, APC Convenes to Endorse Abdullahi Adamu as Chairman\n\n*Few hours to voting, governors still struggling with Unity List for other NWC positions\n\nOur Correspondents\n\nAfter several months of intense fighting, over 5,000 delegates from across Nigeria will today gather at the Eagle Square, Abuja, to endorse former Nasarawa State Governor, Senator Abdullahi Adamu as the National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\n\n\nThe Abdullahi Adamu deal was concluded last Wednesday after President Muhammadu Buhari summoned the 22 governors of the party to a meeting and decreed the adoption of consensus candidates for all the offices of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party. Thereafter, he nominated Adamu for National Chairman.\n\nAs at last night, all the chairmanship aspirants had withdrawn from the race in line with Buhari\u2019s directives.\n\nThe Unity List for other NWC positions of the party was not decided during the governors\u2019 meeting with Buhari. The President told the governors to meet and agree on this; that refunds of money spent on purchasing forms be made to all the aspirants unable to make the Unity List.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, as at last night, just a few hours before voting began, the governors could still not agree on the Unity List. So, no list had been sent out.\n\nOne of the positions still in dispute is that of the party\u2019s National Secretary. Some governors want Iyiola Omisore, former deputy governor of Osun State, while some others want Ifeoluwa Oyedele, a 2020 governorship aspirant of the party in Ondo State.\n\n\n\nThe choice of Waziri Bulama (Borno State) as National Organsing Secretary by the governors is also in dispute. Some top party members, including Governor Babagana Zulum prefer Senator Abu Kyari for the job.\n\nThose looking good to make the Unity List are Ken Nnamani (Enugu State) as Deputy National Chairman, South and Adamu Farouk (Jigawa State)) as Deputy National Chairman, North.\n\n\n\nHowever, if the governors are able to resolve the Unity List and send it out this morning as indicated by another source, it means the election today would be a mere academic exercise.\n\n\n\nIt would also mean that any aspirant still bent on contesting is free to do so, but once outside the Unity List, it is surely going to be a losing game, as the governors control the delegates who will vote at the convention.\n\nGovernor of Nasarawa State Abdullahi Sule, who is Chairman Media and Publicity sub-committee for the National Convention, refused to comment on the delay in the release of the Unity List at a press briefing yesterday, but simply said the list would still be released and would be used today.\n\n\n\nOn the issue of political appointees voting at today\u2019s convention, Governor Sule said: \u201cOur delegates\u2019 list is actually statutory. So, if you have a former president as a political appointee, if you have a former Senator as a political appointee, these are already automatic delegates, you know. So, let us not confuse the two because being an appointee does not necessarily take you out of being a delegate, because our delegates are classified clearly.\n\n\u201cSo, most of the lists that we submitted, if you are talking of the ones who have submitted now, we don\u2019t have commissioners, we don\u2019t have advisors, we don\u2019t have all those unless if somebody particularly was a former this or former that, in that case, you know, just being an appointee doesn\u2019t completely exclude such a person from being a delegate.\u201d\n\nThe President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan on Thursday expressed optimism that most of the new NWC members of the APC today will emerge by consensus.\n\n\u201cThe next two days are so important to us that we must get everything spot on so that we don\u2019t allow anyone to cause any problem. Thank God we are reaching consensus all over the states and zones and by the time we go into the convention ground, I\u2019m sure there will be very few elective offices that will have to be voted for. Most would have been achieved through consensus,\u201d Lawan said.\n\n\n\nLawan adds: \u201cWe, as a party, feel that this is a moment that is so critical to the existence of APC in Nigeria. We need to get the convention right. We need to have a very successful, peaceful convention where we elect our leaders that will run the affairs of the party for the next four years. Therefore, every hand must be on deck and what we have done is to come and say our hands are available to be on deck as always.\n\n\n\nProgramme of Activities\n\n\n\nEagle Square, venue of today\u2019s convention, was sparkling yesterday, while virtually all the delegates had arrived.\n\nAccording to the convention programme released by the APC, accredited delegates are expected to start arriving at the Eagle Square by 10 am. Members of the National Caretaker and Extra-ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) will arrive by 1:30p.m.\n\n\n\nAPC state governors, National Assembly members, ministers and other party leaders are expected by 2:p.m. The President of the Senate and the Speaker, House of Representatives, will arrive between 2:10p.m and 2:20p.m.\n\nVice-President Yemi Osinbajo will arrive by 2:45p.m while President Buhari will arrive by 3:15p.m. The convention will then kick off.\n\n\n\nThere will be goodwill messages by Youth Wing, Women Wing, People Living with Disability (PLwD) and Diaspora Wing between 3:40 and 4:50p.m.\n\nRemarks by the Chairman, Progressives Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF) and Representatives of Governors\u2019 from each of the six geo-political zones will take place between 4:50 and 5:20p.m.\n\nRemarks by the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate will be between 5:25 and 5:35p.m.\n\n\n\nRemarks by the Vice-President follow between 5:35 and 5:40p.m, while Special Remarks by President Buhari will be between 5:40 and 5:55p.m\n\nAfter the welcome address by the CECPC Chairman, there will be a presentation of two motions.\n\nThese are the motion for the approval of Constitution as amended and the motion for the ratification of all activities carried out by CECPC.\n\n\n\nElections into Zonal and National Offices of the APC will then follow. Then, there will be the declaration of results and swearing in of the newly elected executives. The newly elected National Chairman is expected to make an acceptance speech.\n\nAltogether, 21 NWC positions and 33 non-NWC positions are expected to be filled today.\n\n\n\nAPC Governors, Ministers Present Scorecards\n\nGovernors and Ministers of the ruling APC yesterday in Abuja presented a seven years\u2019 scorecard to the party, to back their performance status over the former ruling PDP as they march towards 2023 campaigns.\n\nThe scorecard was presented at the party\u2019s Pre-Convention Conference with the theme: Consolidating Democratic Change: Scorecard, Impact and the Road Ahead at Shehu Musa Yar\u2019Adua Centre, Abuja.\n\n\n\nAt the event, governors and serving ministers on the platform of the APC took their time to chronicle the events leading to the formation of the party and the successes, challenges, and achievements made by the party, both at the state and national levels in the last seven years.\n\n\n\nPresent at the event were: Governors Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State, Babagana Zulum of Borno, Fayemi Kayode of Ekiti, Minister of Finance, Zainab Ahmed, Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola\n\nMinister of Finance, Zainab Ahmed, said the APC government social investment programme was yielding good results as Nigeria had emerged the nation with the fastest growing social investment programme in the world.\n\nZainab also disclosed that Nigeria\u2019s economy was now fully diversified due to different economic intervention strategies introduced by the Buhari-led APC government.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Infact Azma may have forgotten that they came to Kaduna\u201d, the Airport Manager said.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cWhat happened was that, whether they wanted to come into the airport, but they shot a security guard on runway 05.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately on their way to the hospital\u201d, he died.\n\n\u201cBehind the parameter fence is their route, they are always passing through that place.\n\nI don\u2019t know whether they wanted to come to the airport.\n\nUnfortunately they shot at the (runway), unfortunately their bullet hit the security guard on the head.\n\n\u201cBut the two flights we had, had taken off.\n\n\u201cThere are military personnel in the airport and they gave it to the terrorists. They seized some of their motorcycles. The military succeeded in chasing them away.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, terrorists reportedly attacked and killed about 50 people in nine villages in Giwa LGA.\n\nSeveral others were reportedly abducted by the terrorists during the attacks.\n\nSamuel Aruwan, the Kaduna state Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, who confirmed the attacks, however could not confirm the casualty figures, saying he was awaiting reports from security agencies.\n\n\u201cWe are expecting feedback from security operatives. I am still waiting to get the report from them.\n\n\u201cI cannot confirm any death figure until we receive security reports from security agencies because they are our source of information. Once they summit the report, I will issue a statement\u201d, Aruwan said in a telephone interview on Saturday.\n\nAccording to reports, the terrorists on Friday, invaded Dillalai, Zango Tama, Kaya, Barebari, Anguwan Bakko, Gidan Alhajin Kida, Kadanya and Durumi communities, among others, unleashing mayhem on the villagers.\n\nMany houses were also reportedly burnt while about 100 cows were said to have been rustled.\n\nReports quoting one Mansur Ibrahim, a resident of one of the communities said the affected villages include\n\n\u201cDillalai, Zango Tama, Kaya, Barebari, Anguwan Bakko, Gidan Alhajin Kida, Kadanya and Durumi among others.\u201d\n\nHe said, Dillalai was the worst affected as about 15 people were reportedly killed, while houses and five commercial trucks were burnt.\n\nAccording to him, the bandits also burnt a church at Zangon Tama village, also in Giwa LGA.\n\nThose who sustained injuries from gunshots were said to have been taken to the Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital (ABUTH), Shika, Zaria, for treatment.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Dangote Oil Refinery, which is reputed to be Africa\u2019s biggest oil refinery, may soon run into a deep financial crisis as a result of a $7 billion debt burden \u2013 a situation which indicates a possible takeover of the project by the Assets Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON).\n\nDangote Refinery is an oil refinery owned by the Dangote Group that is under construction in Lekki, Nigeria.\n\nDangote Group is a Nigerian multinational industrial conglomerate, founded by Aliko Dangote, Africa's richest man.\n\nThe Group's interests span a range of sectors in Nigeria and across Africa.\n\nAccording to an analysis by the Money Management Series, Dangote Oil Refinery, a 650,000-barrel per day (BPD) integrated refinery project under construction in the Lekki Free Zone, Lagos, Nigeria, was expected to commence production in 2016 with $3.3 billion financing secured in 2013.\n\nWith the refinery now projected to commence operations in 2025, Dangote Group\u2019s indebtedness to financial institutions is estimated to hit $8.4 billion by 2025.\n\nPresently, this debt burden has risen to $7 billion with debt servicing of almost $700 million per annum.\n\nThe completion date of the refinery has been moved eight times.\n\nWhilst some might say this is not in the character for Dangote Industries and their numerous projects across different sectors, the problem is deeply rooted.\n\nA contractor at the delayed refinery project, speaking under the condition of anonymity, said that poor planning, underpayment of contractors, and a lack of proper project management with over 40 contractors on site have led to most of the delays. He also added that of the 40, none is willing to commission as there is no clear delegation of duty and over-decentralisation leading to absolute chaos.\n\nWith these incessant delays, some financing banks are already calling in their loans amid fears of liquidity crisis, while others are elated by the guarantee of huge interests to be recouped as soon as the refinery comes on stream.\n\nDangote has been able to restructure the facilities from various local and international banks twice so far, but most banks have totally refused to restructure for the third time with principal repayment also falling due as well as the annual interest payments.\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has made available $3.8 billion as part of federal government\u2019s 20% equity in the project, providing $1 billion cash, while the remaining $2.8 billion will be in crude supply.\n\nHowever, analysts have pointed out that NNPC\u2019s 20% equity at $3.8 billion makes the Dangote refinery overvalued at $19 billion.\n\nWhen Aliko Dangote unveiled early plans for the refinery in September 2013 and announced that he had secured about $3.3 billion in financing for the project, the refinery was estimated to cost about $9 billion, of which $3 billion would be invested by the Dangote Group and the remainder via commercial loans, and begin production in 2016.\n\nHowever, after a change in location to Lekki, construction of the refinery did not begin until 2016 with excavation and infrastructure preparation, and the planned completion was pushed back to late 2018.\n\nIn July 2017, major structural construction began, and Dangote estimated that the refinery would be mechanically complete in late 2019 and commissioned in early 2020. Experts, however, posit that the construction would likely take at least twice as long as Dangote publicly stated, with refining capability not likely to be achieved until 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, last week the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, reiterated that Federal Executive Council (FEC) approved the acquisition of 20 per cent minority stakes by the NNPC in the Dangote Petroleum and Petro-Chemical Refinery.\n\nSylva, while briefing State House correspondents after the virtual FEC meeting presided by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo last Wednesday at the Presidential Villa, said the acquisition was in the sum of $2.76 billion.\n\n\u201cThe Executive Council also approved the acquisition of 20 percent minority stakes by the NNPC in the Dangote Petroleum and Petro-Chemical Refineries in the sum of $2.76 billion,\u201d he said.\n\nThis development has been described by industry observers as strange because $2.76 billion falls short of 20 percent of the Dangote project valued by the sponsor at $16 billion. Using the $16 billion value, 20 percent should be $3.2 billion and analysts have expressed dissatisfaction at the disparity in the project\u2019s value and NNPC\u2019s funding.\n\nSpeaking with MMS Plus on the complexities with funding Dangote refinery, the Managing Director of Cowry Assets Management, Mr. Johnson Chukwu, argued that the banks wouldn\u2019t have any challenge from the financing because Dangote would have to pay the interests.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see the banks being unable to meet their liquidity because of the monies tied down in the Dangote refinery. Ultimately, if the investment is economically viable, when it starts operation it should be able to meet up the arrears. I believe the banks that went into this project understood some of these constraints and didn\u2019t break their balance-sheets in the move to finance Dangote refinery. I don\u2019t envisage any bank having a liquidity challenge as a result of investing in Dangote refinery. If there is any challenge it would come from Dangote, but it should be resolved when the project takes off,\u201d he said.\n\nCommenting on the possibility that NNPC over-valued or under-valued the project in its 20% equity, Chukwu opined that NNPC may be looking at an enterprise valuation while the other value could be the net value.\n\n\u201cThe enterprise value could be higher than the amount Dangote has invested in the project. However, I wasn\u2019t involved in determining that, so anything I say will be purely speculative,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite the massive support of the Nigerian government on the refinery project, things have got so bad for the billionaire that even income from his other businesses may not be enough to cover the interest rates, let alone the principal.\n\nThe $8.4 billion debt represents 75% of Dangote\u2019s net worth at $11.1 billion and Africa\u2019s richest man has to seek innovative ways to prop up his business now as the refinery project continues to be consistently delayed.",

They were said to have assembled at the motion ground of the secretariat, dressed in all-white spiritual traditional attire, while chanting incantations as they performed rituals.\n\nOlanrewaju said it was impossible to engage the locals as they disregarded processes in tabling their grievances.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFor now, no protest on campus. People and vehicles have been allowed to come in and go out. Everything is calm for now, let\u2019s just put it at that. We\u2019re not supposed to engage anybody because we don\u2019t engage touts,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere are procedures for doing things. Do you expect us to reason with those who are bringing charms and sacrifices to the university? No, we don\u2019t do that. We won\u2019t do that. We\u2019re more enlightened than that.\u201d\n\nA students union executive at OAU, who also spoke with TheCable Lifestyle, confirmed that activities had returned to the campus.\n\n\u201cWe no longer have protests on campus and there\u2019s no longer any disruption. The protest stopped the day before yesterday at around 4:30 pm. The university has been on top of the matter,\u201d the source said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe school deployed security operatives, both the DSS and the police headquarters in Osogbo, to heighten the security on the campus. This is although they couldn\u2019t do much to totally stop the protest.\u201d\n\nThe tension in OAU had come after Eyitope Ogunbodede, the former VC, was said to have been attacked over the varsity\u2019s land-grabbing dispute with the host community.\n\n\u201cWe do not have any issue with the people of Ife. The group that came are the ones who decided to do what they were doing. Ask one of them. Ours is a global university highly recognised internationally,\u201d Olanrewaju had said.\n\n\u201cTheir forefathers gave the land to us. It\u2019s been there ever since. We cannot, on the alter on sentiments, jettison excellence and bring in mediocrity. Let\u2019s not even use the word community in relation to the hostility.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only a few selfish people in that community that are against the university. It would be unfair on others to lump all the people of Ife with the greedy but vocal few who have been causing the controversy.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2022 TheCable. All rights reserved.

          "title": "Digital Nomads: The pastor turned tech bro",
          "text": "\u201cEven if I have the call of God, it doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t have a career. I shouldn\u2019t have to rely on church offerings to survive. Here\u2019s where people have a problem with pastors: they believe that most pastors wait for tithes or offerings. But that\u2019s not me.\u201d\n\nWhen Jay*, a pastor-turned-data-scientist, was in his final year as a computer engineering student at the Oduduwa University in Osun state, Nigeria, he decided his final year project would focus on e-voting in Nigeria. \u201cBut that topic wasn\u2019t approved,\u201d he says. The reason, Jay says, was that the lecturers in charge, at the time, knew nothing about the applications of tech. \u201cThey told me to be realistic. This was 2018, mind you, but they said that tech wasn\u2019t that important in the country, and that I should research something else. I can\u2019t remember what I finally wrote about, but I know it had nothing to do with tech and its potential impact on our society.\u201d\n\nIf the impact of tech on voting would not be important in 2018, the year before Africa\u2019s most populous country conducted its last general elections, when would it ever be?\n\nFor Jay, this event pushed him towards putting his degree to good use and becoming an all-round tech bro. He doesn\u2019t think his lecturers meant any harm, but he believes their lack of knowledge on the impact of tech will have damning consequences on the students they teach.\n\nAlthough he\u2019d been studying computer engineering, Jay already had a first love: ministering. Born to a Muslim mother and Christian father, he believes he\u2019s been ordained by God to preach the gospel. \u201cMy father died early, so I had to live with my paternal grandmother, and that\u2019s where I got introduced to the word.\u201d\n\nFrom his university days, Jay had been working as a minister, teaching the bible under his own ministry. His only worry was how to make an income independent of the church\u2019s income. \u201cI knew I had to have a career outside ministering. The problem most people have with pastors is that a lot of us depend on the church\u2019s income. I didn\u2019t want that.\u201d\n\nSo, during his National Youth Service\u2014a mandatory 1\u2013year programme all Nigerians must participate in, in service of their country\u2014Jay branched out into tech. He developed design skills and worked as a graphics designer for 17 months before moving to another company to work as a user interface designer.\n\nMonths later, in 2020, Jay landed a hybrid role working as a data annotator for a US-based company that uses artificial intelligence to measure consumer needs.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering what a data annotator does, you\u2019re right to wonder. It\u2019s an unsung profession. \u201cAs a data annotator, my job is to collect and label data that the AIs will use to forecast how consumers will react to e-commerce products,\u201d Jay explains. \u201cFor example, we take the iPhone 13 and try to figure out its impact on users in the next few years.\u201d\n\nThink of data annotation as teaching or training a computer. Focus on AI increased significantly this decade with $77 billion getting invested in the sector, a 113% increase from 2020\u2019s $36 billion investment. In Africa, though, investment in the AI sector is low, accounting for only 3% of total startup investments. It\u2019s no surprise then that data annotators, whose work primarily focus on AI, are scarce on the continent.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t really hacked the importance of AI on the continent, and that\u2019s why there aren\u2019t many data annotators. Whenever I tell people about my job, there\u2019s a bit of scepticism and doubt. There are always questions about what I do, even from top professionals in the field.\u201d\n\nOn his experience with the job, Jay says he enjoys the process and hopes more Africans would get into the field. If there\u2019s any complaint he has, though, it\u2019s the pay gap between him and his non-Nigerian colleagues working for the same company. In the Nigerian context, the job pays fairly well, with Jay getting \u20a6250,000 ($600)/month plus benefits, including pension, HMO, and a work laptop. The benefits are the same with the company\u2019s non-Nigerian employees, except for one big difference.\n\n\u201cI know some of my US colleagues earn about \u20a62.5 million per month, even though we\u2019re doing the same job for the company.\u201d\n\nEven with the pay disparity, Jay is still pretty comfortable with his job. \u201cIt\u2019s better than nothing, and it helps me provide for my family without having to depend on the church\u2019s income.\u201d\n\nIn addition to his design, product, and data annotation skills, he\u2019s also learning software engineering to help him become an all-round tech bro.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not just doing this for me,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the same way I\u2019m teaching the word, I also want to teach tech, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m learning these skills.\u201d\n\nIn the near future, he hopes to bring more people to the altar of tech and preach to them the good news of how much tech can improve their lives.\n\n*Name has been changed to protect the owner\u2019s identity.\n\n\n\nDigital Nomads is a weekly column on TechCabal where we explore the everyday lives of Africans who leave their home countries to study or work elsewhere, and Africans who leave their conventional jobs for new professions in tech. A new episode drops every Wednesday. If you think your story fits the Digital Nomads bill, reach out to us here.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Okubanjo to step back from people decisions at Bento Africa",
          "text": "In an email circular that went out from Bento Africa\u2019s board of directors to the company\u2019s customers and partners on Wednesday evening, the board announced that Ebun Okubanjo will be taking \u201csome time off\u201d and handing over all people-related decisions to his co-founder and COO, Chidozie Okonkwo. Chidozie will lead people operations alongside the company\u2019s country directors.\n\nBento\u2019s board\u2019s decision comes a few days after TechCabal exposed the harrowing experiences of ex-employees of payroll startup Bento Africa and how Okubanjo had allegedly been the orchestrator of that through direct and indirect bullying, verbal abuse, and threats to employees.\n\nIn their email to Bento\u2019s customers and clients, the board condemned Ebun\u2019s initial reaction to the story, especially his tweets attacking the credibility of publication TechCabal.\n\n\u201cAs professional Investors and Operators, we were aghast at the defensive and escalatory first tweets of Ebun on the matter, which we quickly moved against. Our responsibility and charter is to the Company, not the founders we invest in,\u201d the board said in an email sent to all Bento employees, past and present.\n\nFurthermore, the board said that while Okubanjo is taking a back seat with immediate effect, an internal investigation into Bento\u2019s workplace culture has begun. It also announced that it would be reviewing Bento Africa\u2019s internal management practices and processes.\n\n\u201cWe are reviewing the HR and People practices and guidelines at Bento and will work with HR consultants and the company\u2019s in-house team to make sure that it is reflective of human values that drive sustainable performance,\u201d said the board in the email.\n\nThe board claimed to have \u201c\u2026ensured that the current team is safe and free to speak freely. We voided any NDA\u2019s that may have been in place and instructed Management to let the Team know they were free to speak to any journalist that contacted them.\u201d TechCabal reached out to current Bento Africa employees who confirmed that they had been granted permission to speak freely without worrying about consequences.\n\n\u201cI think not restricting us from talking to journalists and cancelling our NDAs is the right thing to do,\u201d said one of the 3 employees TechCabal reached out to for the expose.\u201d\n\nOkubanjo also published a personal apology to current and past employees of the company via his Medium page. In the post titled From ebun. With Love, Okubanjo admits to encouraging a work culture of \u201clong workdays and weeks\u201d and apologised for his abusive outbursts. He also confirmed the board\u2019s decision to appoint Chidozie to lead people operations at the company.\n\n\u201cI am sorry,\u201d Okubanjo writes. \u201cI have some work to do here and there is a lot of room for growth. It will [sic] be a lie if I say this is a switch I can make overnight, I would [sic] need to learn how to balance passion with empathy. I will step away from all people decisions in the company. Chidozie will take over along with our new Head of People \u2014 Her arrival could not have been more timely. The country leads will also be instrumental in helping shape a more humane people policy.\u201d\n\nIn a bid to repair broken bridges, the CEO also encouraged former and current employees who have \u201cfelt that fire that burns [sic] so hot when we are in the thick of it\u201d to reach out to him.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not in support of the way Ebun handled the situation, and we\u2019re currently running an internal investigation to quantify the scale of the damages his actions have brought to employees and the business,\u201d said board member and CEO at Zedcrest, Adedayo Hamza. \u201cWe\u2019re open to speaking to anyone about this process.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "\u201cBento took everything from me\u2014my sense of humanity, sanity, confidence, and trust,\u201d Pascal*, an ex-sales executive at Nigerian payroll startup Bento Africa, said about his time working there. \u201cWe worked around the clock. Ebun [CEO and co-founder of the company] would send you messages by 2 AM and expect a response asap. No rest. We went to bed every night praying our jobs would still be there when we woke up the next morning.\u201d\n\nOn March 18, 2021, Pascal\u2019s prayer, which had seemed to work for over a year, stopped working. He was abruptly fired from his job. He fell into a depressive state, and everything stopped making sense. He stopped going out, and his relationships with friends and family suffered. Even though he said working at Bento for over a year had been torture, it was all he had at the time.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBento Africa (formerly known as Verifi.ng) is the brainchild of Ebun Okubanjo and Chidozie Okonkwo, his friend, business partner, and Bento\u2019s Chief Operating Officer (COO). Headquartered in Lagos, Nigeria, Bento provides payroll management software to 900 businesses, including Hygeia, Paystack, Kobo360, Branch, and LORI Systems.\n\nOkubanjo and Okonkwo built, and still run, multiple businesses together. While both co-founders flock together, they aren\u2019t quite of the same feather. All ex-employees who spoke to us described Okubanjo as fire and Okonkwo as neither water nor fire; Okonkwo simply remains in the background, silent and rarely engaged in the company\u2019s day-to-day operations. These ex-employees therefore believe that Okonkwo\u2019s attitude outsources all authority to Okubanjo and enables his toxicity.\n\nIn Okubanjo\u2019s termination email to Pascal, he was fired because of a \u201clack of cultural fit and poor performance\u201d. But Pascal wondered: \u201cHow could I have been culturally unfit and incompetent after working for you for over a year? Why did it take you that long to clock my incompetence?\u201d\n\nOkubanjo\u2019s email terminating Pascal\u2019s contract\n\nThe termination letter\n\nHe said, despite the daily verbal assaults he endured in the hands of Okubanjo, all he wanted to do was to be the best salesperson in the company and make his employer proud. He hadn\u2019t done much work in sales prior to Bento, so he put in the work. Within 5 months, according to him, he had the second-highest number of clients on their sheets at the time. He closed some of the biggest clients\u2014some of them with over 1,000 employees and a monthly payroll worth \u20a615\u2013\u20a620 million (~$47,000).\n\nDespite his achievements, however, Pascal did not succeed in making his boss proud. \u201cThere was no free day from Ebun\u2019s verbal abuse. If he wasn\u2019t calling me a useless person, he was threatening to beat me up,\u201d Pascal said. At some point, while recounting his experience to TechCabal, he paused to catch his breath.\n\nPascal described his time at Bento as the darkest period of his life.\n\nPascal narrated how employees would weep during the sales team\u2019s check-in call at 8 AM every weekday. Okubanjo harshly criticised their work and threatened to fire them all at these meetings.\n\nEzekiel*, who had worked with the company\u2019s growth marketing team, shared his experience with TechCabal. He had joined one of the sales calls and heard Okubanjo calling them \u201cpussies and deadweights\u201d. He also heard Okubanjo tell the team that they smelled. \u201cEven though he never attacked me personally,\u201d Ezekiel said, \u201cI always wondered how anybody could go through that every morning and remain sane.\u201d\n\nBento Africa\u2019s cofounders: Ebun Okubanjo (left) and Chidozie Okonkwo (right)\n\nEx-employees also revealed gaps in Bento\u2019s employment contract, specifically where leave days and time off were concerned. Okubanjo promised employees that they could take time off when they needed it, but Bola*, another ex-employee from the company\u2019s sales team, dispelled that promise as a myth.\n\n\u201cI can count on one hand how many people took leave during my stay there. Ebun said breaks are for pussies and fuckers, and whoever takes time out of the office for a whole week is a weak member of the team and not needed in the organisation,\u201d said Bola.\n\n\u201cEbun scarred me,\u201d she said. \u201cI have spent money on therapy, yet, I still suffer from anxiety.\u201d\n\nIn her early days at the startup, Bola asked a lot of people to come work with her at Bento. At that time, she was ignorant of Okubanjo\u2019s \u201cterrifying personality\u201d. \u201cHad I known about it, I wouldn\u2019t have asked anybody to join Bento. Now, when a prospective Bento employee reaches out to me, I just tell them to run!\u201d\n\nAccording to the sources we spoke to, Okubanjo rarely welcomed alternative opinions and monopolised making key business decisions; the punishment for criticising his ideas was immediate termination of employment. For a number of Bento ex-employees, termination simply entailed deactivated Slack accounts and emails.\n\nTinu*, who had been poached from another company to come join Bento, woke up one day and found out she\u2019d been fired and logged out of her Slack and work email. She\u2019d only been with the company as Communication Lead for less than 3 weeks.\n\n\u201cIt was a nerve-wracking experience and the worst 5 months of my adult life,\u201d said Amaka*, who was excited to join a tech startup in Nigeria after finishing her studies in the US. She was fired after enduring Okubanjo\u2019s insults and unwarranted comments about her body.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a plus-size woman and Okubanjo would always have opinions about my dressing. He once told me to stop wearing dresses, that I need to wear jackets, trouser and suit all the time (presumably to cover my breast) after his girlfriend Alice commented that she liked my breast. What did I wear? Regular dresses that even my mother approved of.\u201d\n\nAmaka likened the day she was fired to a scene out of a movie. \u201cWe were on a sales call, and Ebun kept saying I wasted company resources while bringing in zero value.\u201d Okubanjo accused her of charging her personal Bolt ride on the company\u2019s debit card, unaware that Amaka had stopped using the card entirely and even ran the company\u2019s errands with her own car.\n\nFollowing Okubanjo\u2019s accusation, Amaka asked that the card be audited to ascertain whether she had indeed been wasting the company\u2019s money. Okubanjo checked the card and discovered that she hadn\u2019t been using the card for personal expenses. Rather than apologise to her, he changed tack and started accusing her of not working.\n\n\u201cHe called me useless and told me to f*ck off from the call. Next thing I knew, my colleagues were texting to inform me that he\u2019d fired me after I dropped off the call.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, when Kunle*, a lead engineer who worked for the company for over 2 years, was fired last November, he only found out about it when he couldn\u2019t access his Slack and work email the next morning. \u201cEbun fired me because he felt like I was trying to wrest authority from him,\u201d said Kunle.\n\n\n\nEbun Okubanjo announcing on the company\u2019s slack after firing Kunle\n\n\u201cLeave Ebun, that man can literally kill you and brag about it. He\u2019s that vindictive,\u201d Ezekiel had mentioned while speaking to TechCabal. Ada*, another ex-staff, had also specifically declined to speak to us because she was worried about her safety, fearing that her former employer, could hurt her.\n\nIn the images above, Okubanjo referred to himself as Marlo Stanfield on Bento\u2019s Slack. Who is that, you may ask?\n\nMarlo Stanfield is a fictional character on the HBO television drama The Wire. He is a young, ambitious, intelligent, and ruthless gangster. In the drama series, Stanfield demanded unconditional respect, which superseded all other concerns. He was murderously narcissistic, and frequently ordered the deaths of those who disrespected or undermined him. In 2016, Rolling Stone ranked him number 2 on their list of \u201c40 Greatest TV Villains of All Time\u201d.\n\nThe day before Kunle was fired, the company\u2019s CTO Lede Adeniyi was on leave, so Kunle stepped up to lead the engineering team. Kunle recalled that one of the account executives had told him that a customer wanted a feature that was not in Bento\u2019s product roadmap for the year. Kunle said he explained to the executive that the company had prioritised other fixes and features for the year and would include the requested feature on their first sprint in 2022. He, however, suggested that if the customer wanted the feature added quickly, he could talk to Okubanjo.\n\n\u201cI referred the executive to Ebun because Ebun had already accused me, previously, of setting priorities behind him. But even that was a crime,\u201d said Kunle. The executive went to Okubanjo with their request, as Kunle had suggested, and all hell broke loose.\n\n\u201cI remember how Ebun came to shout at me: \u2018Hey motherfucker, what did you say to a customer about their ask?\u2019 He shut me up before I could even answer and called me names, which was normal. I was his usual point of reference whenever he wanted to benchmark weaknesses and redundancy in the team. Imagine being disrespected in front of your team members every day.\u201d\n\nNow, before the November firing, Okubanjo had fired Kunle once before. It happened on a trip to Ghana. Kunle had asked Okubanjo to stop calling him a monkey. Okubanjo responded to that by firing him on the spot. \u201cHe told me to find my way back to Nigeria, and that he didn\u2019t care how I did it.\u201d But then, he called Kunle after a few hours to give him his job back, knowing he needed him to sort out the business operations they had come for in Ghana.\n\nOn November 22, when Okunbanjo fired Kunle for the second and final time, he refused to pay his November salary and severance pay. Kunle reached out to Adeniyi, the CTO, to help him speak to Okubanjo about his owed payments, but Adeniyi couldn\u2019t do anything about it. \u201cYou know Ebun does what he wants,\u201d Kunle recalled Adeniyi saying to him.\n\nWhen TechCabal reached out to Adeniyi for comment on the incident, he confirmed Kunle\u2019s report: \u201cYes, Kunle asked me to follow up with Ebun, which I did, and Ebun promised to pay him.\u201d It\u2019s been 4 months now and Okubanjo still hasn\u2019t paid Kunle.\n\nBut after Kunle got fired, it seemed his former boss wasn\u2019t done with him.\n\n\u201cLast month, just when my mental health was getting back in shape, Ebun popped up on my LinkedIn, offering me my old job back,\u201d Kunle said. \u201cI declined. Such effrontery! No form of apology. I haven\u2019t found a new job yet because I\u2019m scared of working in another Nigerian startup.\u201d\n\n\n\nEbun Okubanjo reached out to Kunle* 4 months after to offer him his job back\n\nKunle claimed that Ebun sacked his friend John*, a former member of Bento\u2019s design team, because John was talking a lot about web3 on social media. Okubanjo accused John of finding Bento \u201cless interesting\u201d. TechCabal reached out to John through Kunle but he hasn\u2019t replied.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t give Okubanjo notice period when you\u2019re leaving the company. He\u2019d fire you and tell you off,\u201d Ezekiel said. \u201cWhen Ebun fires you, he tells you to watch how he\u2019ll make sure you don\u2019t get a job anywhere else in the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nTare Johnson, Bento\u2019s ex-accountant and financial analyst, believes this was why he couldn\u2019t find a job for 6 months after leaving Bento in August 2020. When Johnson joined Bento in February 2020, his contract stated that he was coming in to lead the finance team. He would later find out that there was no team, and that he would be leading himself while reporting to a \u201cnarcissistic boss\u201d.\n\n\u201cI was basically the only one handling all the company\u2019s finances. I was also doing clerical jobs and running errands like a personal assistant, which was confusing and not even remotely close to my job description,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cMy initial thought was, \u2018It\u2019s a startup and things move around a lot.\u2019 But I was wrong. This place was designed to break employees. Ebun abused me verbally, which is standard behaviour for him with employees. He\u2019d call me a motherfucker, dullard, and every vulgar word in the dictionary. He even insulted my family.\u201d\n\nJohnson, running a one-man finance team, was stuck in a mess he hadn\u2019t bargained for. The pandemic lockdown hit barely a month after he got the job, locking him into the job at a time when companies were laying people off and not hiring. So he stuck around and took all the verbal abuse Okubanjo hurled at him. After 5 months, he figured he was coping, until an event on Monday, August 17, 2020 made him resign without notice.\n\nThe WhatsApp conversation between Johnson and Okubanjo\n\nThat Monday, Johnson\u2014like he had done every morning\u2014shared the company\u2019s daily bank statements to Okubanjo and Okonkwo on WhatsApp. Upon receiving them, Okubanjo replied with: \u201cBro, are you drunk???\u201d Johnson thought he must have made a mistake somewhere on the statements, so he quickly double-checked before re-sharing the statements with Bento\u2019s founding team. Okubanjo was still not satisfied with the statements. Apparently, some recent transaction hadn\u2019t reflected yet in the company\u2019s account at the time Johnson compiled the statement; there was no way Johnson could have included it in his report. But Okubanjo, \u201cin his usual fashion\u201d, asked Johnson to fix the spreadsheet or he\u2019d fire him. Finally fed up, Johnson resigned with a simple message: \u201cNo need, I quit\u201d and exited the WhatsApp group. An hour later, he sent in his resignation letter.\n\nFor Johnson, joining Bento Africa was \u201ca bad idea\u201d and leaving \u201cthe best thing he\u2019d ever done for himself\u201d.\n\nWhy were Okubanjo\u2019s red flags ignored?\n\nSome of the ex-employees said Okubanjo\u2019s ruthless leadership style was obvious from the first day they met him. \u201cThe day I met him for my interview, he told me he could read poverty all over my face,\u201d said Kunle.\n\n\u201cOn the first day we met,\u201d Johnson said, \u201cI witnessed an altercation that ended with Ebun threatening to punch a stranger in the face.\u201d\n\nAmaka, on her part, said she recognised Okubanjo from a video that had gone viral a year before, where he was in a heated argument with a female customer of Fitness Central, a gym he co-founded with Okonkwo. In the video, Okunbanjo\u2019s threatening personality was evident and on full-display.\n\nSo, why did these former Bento staff accept to work for the company after seeing these red flags from the CEO?\n\n\u201cI felt bad, but what could I do? I needed the job. I was just coming off the HNG Internship,\u201d said Kunle.\n\n\u201cThe money was good, for someone who hadn\u2019t even done the mandatory, one-year National Youth Service Corps (NYSC),\u201d said Amaka.\n\n\u201cI had already stayed about 7 months without a job, after NYSC, and was even planning to go back home [which is outside Lagos] when the job came. So, it was my best option at the time,\u201d said Adanma*, a former employee of the company.\n\nCulture shock after leaving Bento\n\nFormer employees who spoke to TechCabal confessed to experiencing culture shock at their subsequent jobs.\n\nAdanma \u201ccouldn\u2019t believe it when my current boss asked for my opinion on things. \u201cFor the first few months [at my current job], I was too scared to voice an opinion at meetings, for fear of being called stupid.\u201d\n\nBola \u201cwas surprised when my current boss said switching off Slack notifications is good to reduce anxiety, and that we should all try it.\u201d\n\nAccording to McKinsey, hundreds of experiments show that encounters with rude, insulting, and demeaning people undermine workers\u2019 performance, including their decision-making skills, productivity, creativity, and willingness to work harder and help coworkers.\n\nOkubanjo often claims that Bento is \u201ca mission and not a company\u201d hence his iron-fist leadership.\n\nBento is still toxic\n\nThree current Bento employees contacted by TechCabal were diplomatic about their responses, but they agreed that everything this publication has unearthed about Bento Africa\u2019s work culture \u201cis not false\u201d.\n\n\u201cOne minute it\u2019s silence; the next it\u2019s chaos. It\u2019s unstable here, and the pressure is too much,\u201d one of them said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not really bothered,\u201d the second employee said. \u201cMy former place of work was also toxic, so I\u2019m kinda used to it. At this point, I think all startups are the same.\u201d\n\nThe third employee wouldn\u2019t \u201cdeny that Bento can be toxic for some people but not in my personal experience. We work very hard, and we play harder. Most people on the team love their jobs. It\u2019s not for everyone, really.\u201d\n\nWhile several ex-Bento employees agree that the company has a great and important product, they believe both founders in charge of the startup are unfit for their roles. The company\u2019s Glassdoor reviews tell more stories of its unconducive work culture.\n\nIn December last year, Bento expanded into Ghana, Kenya, and Rwanda, with plans to set up operations in 6 other markets\u2014Egypt, South Africa, Uganda, Tanzania, Angola, and Ethiopia\u2014by the end of this year. The company also leveraged the influence of music veteran and record label boss Don Jazzy to push a campaign supporting the African entrepreneurship spirit\u2014a campaign that arguably boosted its pan-African brand equity. These strides mean that the company is growing to a stage where its apparent lack of structure, process, and attention to employee welfare can no longer be ignored.\n\nTechCabal reached out to Okubanjo and Okonkwo for comments. Okonkwo didn\u2019t respond, but Okubanjo did. In his response, he called our then-developing story \u201cfiction\u201d and posted our email request to Twitter, claiming our article was a \u201chit job\u201d. He has followed his tweets with a series of abusive personal messages to members of the TechCabal team.\n\nEbun Okubanjo posted our email request on Twitter, he has since deleted the tweet.\n\nWhile Johnson, Bola, Amaka, Kunle, Ezekiel, Adanma, and others still scared to speak up have licked their wounds and moved on, Pascal\u2019s family refuses to let the abuse he suffered at Bento slide. They have sued Okubanjo. \u201cI just want him to rescind the lies he told in the termination email to me, I have all the evidence to prove he lied,\u201d Pascal said.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: * Besides Tare Johnson who specifically asked not to be anonymous, other names have been changed to protect the identities of those involved. Furthermore, two current members of Big Cabal Media\u2019s team were former employees at Bento Africa (formerly known as Verifi.ng).\n\nUpdate: Amaka\u2019s account on Okubanjo\u2019s comment about her dressing was updated at 12:30 AM on March 22, 2020.\n\nUpdate: Tangerine Africa was removed from the Bento\u2019s client lists because the company said they have only provided insurance to Bento clients in the past, but never been a client themselves. This update was done 1:20 PM on March 23, 2022.\n\nTechCabal is working on a follow-up story exploring hostile work culture in African startups.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

She also became a professor of mathematical education.\n\nBorn in Warri, Alele-Williams attended Government School, Warri, and Queen\u2019s College, Lagos, graduating in 1949. As an undergraduate, every summer, Grace returned to Warri to teach mathematics at Hussey College, Warri. She obtained an Honours Degree in Mathematics in 1954 from the University of Ibadan, attended the University of Vermont, before receiving a Ph.D. in mathematics education from the University of Chicago in 1963.\n\nShe married Babatunde Abraham Williams, a political scientist in December 1963. By 1965, she was appointed as a Lecturer of Mathematics in the Faculty of Education, University of Lagos, where her husband also took up an appointment.\n\nBy 1968, she was promoted to Senior Lecturer at the University of Lagos and by 1974, she had become an Associate Professor of Mathematics, and later Professor of Mathematics at same university.\n\nFrom 1979 to 1985, she served as chairman of the Lagos State curriculum review committee and Lagos State examinations boards.\n\nRead also: Obaseki, UNIBEN mourn Grace Alele-Williams, Nigeria\u2019s first female Vice Chancellor\n\nShe became Vice-Chancellor of the University of Benin in 1985 and ended in 1992.\n\nWhen she left being Vice-Chancellor, she was on the Board of HIP Asset Management Company and Chevron-Texaco Nigeria.\n\nShe was also vice-president of the World Organisation for Early Childhood Education and later president of the Nigeria chapter.\n\nAlele-Williams became the first president of the African Mathematical Union Commission on Women in Mathematics.\n\nSome of Alele-Williams\u2019 publications include: Dynamics of Curriculum Change in Mathematics \u2013 Lagos State Modern Mathematics Project, Education and Government in Northern Nigeria. Others are: Science, Technology and Mathematics (STM) Education for all, Including Women and Girls in Africa, to mention a few.\n\nFor her distinctive achievements, she received awards in her honour. Some include the Order of the Niger in 1987, Merit Award of Bendel* State in Nigeria, and the centenary award. Grace was a Fellow of the Mathematical Association of Nigeria and the Nigerian Academy of Education.

          "title": "Putin And The Corruption Of Power \u2013 Nigerian Observer",
          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\n\u201c I sat at the back of a man\u201d, wrote the great Russian writer, Leo Tolstoy \u201cchoking him and making him to carry my weight; yet, I assured him and I assured myself that I wish I could lighten his burden\u201d.\n\nWhy not climb down the man\u2019s back if you are indeed concerned about mitigating the suffering you have inflicted.\n\nIn all of the modern history of human conflict, there has not been a war more unjust and more anchored on the power dynamics of tyranny as this nauseating invasion.\n\nYet, there are some persons who continue to see this tyranny-let-loosed as a fallout of NATO\u2019s alleged promise not to expand eastward.\n\nWe are all creatures of emotions, we are as regulated by primordial instincts and idiosyncratic biases as by reason. This is why some folks can, in all honesty, attempt to defend such immoral and barbaric invasion. Miguel de Unamuno , the Spanish existentialist philosopher was right when he argued that reason is not man\u2019s towering crown but emotion. The man who philosophizes is a man of flesh and blood who feels more than he thinks. Reason and logic can never cause him to stray a hair\u2019s breath from his biases no matter the soundness of the logic or the strength of the facts.\n\nThere are despots who would have us believe that the era of an open society with its democratic ethos is over. They insist, blindly, that the pace of modern states cannot allow for democratic debates and consensus choices in running a nation. That democracy is inherently weak, time consuming and structurally unsustainable. That is what the Xis and Putins of this world would have us believe.\n\nIt was the great Scottish psychiatrist, R.D. Laing that warned us that the \u201crange and extent of the things that we think and do is limited by what we fail to notice. That because we fail to notice that we are failing to notice, there is little we can do to change, until we notice how failing to notice shapes our thoughts and deeds.\u201d\n\nThe danger of liberal democracies today is that inhabitants of the West are failing to notice that the freedom they presently enjoy and the democracy that underpins it, is in grave danger. They fail to see that democracy is a fragile thing and that the condition upon which God has given liberty to men, is eternal vigilance.\n\nTrump assaulted democracy from within and Putin is now attacking it from without and yet , there are good-natured people who would make case for both men. The argument today is that democracy and freedom are out of sync with the realities of modern states. At least, that is the unspoken creed of Xi and Putin and it is sad that some otherwise reasonable folks would strenuously attempt to justify such a brazen bare-faced invasion by a brute on any grounds even when the groundlessness of Putin\u2019s invasion yearns deeper than Grand Canyon. The West may not be as saintly as they claim but I tell you a truth : should the light of democracy be extinguished by the likes of Putin, mankind would spiral back to the Hobbesian state of nature where life was solitary, nasty, brutish and short.\n\nIt is sad to notice that were Hitler alive today and undergoing his monstrous pogrom, some folks would still make case for him: blame international Jewry for their perceived greed or America for some perceived mischievous globalization or the Poles for not willingly genuflecting before the German war machines.\n\n\u201cRemove law and justice,\u201d warned St. Augustine, \u201cand what are states but gangs of criminals on a large scale\u201d. It is fidelity to a set of moral code and decency that largely defines a civilised society. President Biden was on point when he described Putin as a thug: is anything more thuggish than sending armed mob into your neighbour\u2019s house without any provocation?\n\nThe point here is that America, for its faults and failings, remains the beacon of freedom, justice and opportunity for the world. It is only a fool that throws the baby away with the bath water. Democracy may not be the elixir that transforms base metals into gold, but it is definitely the best platform that guarantees that the light of justice, freedom , opportunity is not extinguished from the midst of men.\n\nDoes it not portend universal danger that one man could rally a military power like Russia into war?\n\nDoes it not bother a sane man that there are no institutions inside Russia that can checkmate or even mildly regulate Putin?\n\nShould one man possess such powers?\n\nIs it not indicative of tyranny and a failed system that one man should wield such powers?\n\nIt is only the most naive amongst us that would readily equate the West with total moral rightness. Frantz Fanon may have his points when he said that anytime he searches for man in the technique of the West , he sees only a succession of the negations of man and a avalanche of murders. However, the institutional guardrails of Western democracies are the best indicators of the survival of the human species.\n\nAbsolute power, said Woodrow Wilson, is what precedes the destruction of human liberty. Putin is pure, unadulterated evil and trying to defend him amounts to demons in search of logic and trying cosmos out of chaos.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nOsazuwa Osahon Daniels, Esq.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

Nigeria has not witnessed this scale of oil palm cultivation since independence.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe placed the people at the center of our politics, which led to huge investment in human capital development, particularly across all tiers of the state\u2019s education system, starting with the Edo Basic Education Sector Transformation (EdoBEST) programme, which has transformed the lives of over 400,000 pupils across the state and improved learning outcomes.\n\n\u201cThere has been a deliberate emphasis on strengthening partnership with the private sector, from which we have reaped the immense benefit. We signed a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Ossiomo Power Company to provide stable power to government institutions and to also drive the state\u2019s industrial sector. Today, the company generates 95MW out of 550MW it has set out to provide, supported with a distribution infrastructure that has been developed to supply government offices, streetlights and the state\u2019s growing industrial sector with constant electricity.\u201d\n\nStating that the state has built a virile industrial sector, he said: \u201cWith the robust partnership with the private sector, the state government has succeeded in encouraging generation by attracting firms like Azura (450Mw), Ossiomo Power (95MW) is now proceeding to create its own electricity markets to encourage investments in the distribution of power within the state. Currently, there is stable electricity to power public institutions and infrastructure in metropolitan Benin City.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

Nothing wrong with that, but be honest and don\u2019t knock the nation-building imperative of having a competent Igbo as president in order to make the case for your preferred non-Igbo candidate.\n\nWhat you didn\u2019t say is that you\u2019re probably one of the Nigerians who, for reasons known only to them and God, have a thing against the Igbo or detest the idea of seeing an Igbo man lead Nigeria.\n\nNow that Peter Obi, a competent, credible Igbo politician with national appeal, has declared for the presidential contest, I wonder what your new talking points will be.\n\nMy bet is that you won\u2019t have new talking points but that you will go back to the old familiar talking points of 1) \u201cObi has no structure (meaning he doesn\u2019t have enough dollars to throw around)\u201d; 2) \u201cthe Igbo cannot be trusted\u201d; \u201cthe Igbo don\u2019t have the number,\u201d etc.\n\nDeep down, you know that the Igbo deserve the presidency more than any other major politico-ethnic bloc.\n\nDeep down, you know that Peter Obi is by far the best material of all the candidates that have declared their interest in the major parties so far, since he has no baggage of corruption, is relatively young, has demonstrated capacity by recording arguably the best gubernatorial tenure since 1999, and is self-aware and self-critical.\n\nYou say you don\u2019t just want an Igbo president but that you\u2019d be happy with a president of Igbo extraction who is competent. You have that in Peter Obi, but you can\u2019t bring yourself to support him because you\u2019re prejudiced against his ethnic community, a prejudice you hide behind the specious rhetoric of \u201cpolitics is a game of numbers\u201d and \u201cpower is taken, not given.\u201d\n\nYou know deep down that an Igbo presidency would be the best, most significant investment in nation-building in our fractured and extremely divided nation since independence, but you can\u2019t get past your prejudice or the suspicions you\u2019ve been socialized to harbor towards the Igbo.\n\nYou know that having a competent and proven Igbo as President could permanently address and satiate the legitimate complaints of political exclusion and its attendant separatist agitation, and that, as an added benefit, it could repair some of the economic and political damage and stagnancy of the past decade, but you somehow can\u2019t bring yourself to accept the fact that an Igbo person who checks all the boxes and meets your own declared criteria for the presidency is ready and available to serve in that role.\n\nThe next thing we may hear from you is \u201c2023 is not their time,\u201d or \u201clet the Igbo work with other groups to produce an Igbo president in the future.\u201d\n\nThis attitude is escapism, hypocrisy, self-contradiction, and duplicity rolled into one deceptive rhetoric that hides an Igbophobic mindset.\n\nAnd yes, Igbophobia is a thing (many of us are still fighting the civil war mentally), and unless we confront it and have an honest conversation about it as a nation, national cohesion will continue to elude us.\n\nMoses Ochonu is US-based Professor of History.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

We appreciate the right to hold different opinions and aspirations, however, such differences must not be to the detriment of the Party.\n\n\u201cl passionately appeal to you all to support the incoming National Working Committee (NWC) to promote unity and avoid sentiments that are capable of causing disaffection and disunity.

He commended the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee for steering the ship of the party this far including; reconciling aggrieved party members, purchasing a new party secretariat and launching an aggressive membership drive that saw three governors defecting into the APC, among others.\n\n\u201cI want to congratulate us all for being part of this history-making event and to specially appreciate the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) which has been on a rescue mission under the leadership of His Excellency, Mai Mala Buni, the Yobe State Governor, for successfully piloting the affairs of the Party in the last 18 months and organizing this Convention to elect a new National Working Committee that will take over from the Caretaker Committee.\n\n\u201cI am glad the Party under the Caretaker Committee has bounced back to life with the reconciliation of several key and critical stakeholders and groups who had hitherto left the party or were on the verge of leaving the Party.

          "text": "A Russian airstrike last week that blasted open a theater being used as a shelter in the suffering city of Mariupol killed about 300 people, Ukrainian authorities said, marking what could be the war\u2019s deadliest known attack on civilians yet.\n\nThe death toll announced Friday fueled allegations that Moscow is committing war crimes by killing civilians, whether deliberately or with indiscriminate fire.\n\nRussia, meanwhile, seemed to signal an important shift in its war objectives with an announcement that it plans to focus its forces on eastern Ukraine. U.S. officials said Russian troops appeared to have halted for now their ground offensive aimed at capturing the capital, Kyiv, and were concentrating more on gaining control of the Donbas region in the country\u2019s southeast.\n\nHowever, British defense officials reported Saturday that the Russian military continues to besiege a number of other major Ukrainian cities, including Kharkiv and Chernihiv in the north.\n\n\u201cIt is likely Russia will continue to use its heavy firepower on urban areas as it looks to limit its own already considerable losses, at the cost of further civilian casualties,\u201d the U.K. Ministry of Defense said in its latest intelligence briefing on the war.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy again appealed to Russia to negotiate an end to the war, but pointedly said he would not give up any Ukrainian territory for the sake of peace.\n\n\u201cThe territorial integrity of Ukraine should be guaranteed,\u201d he said in a nightly video address to the nation. \u201cThat is, the conditions must be fair, for the Ukrainian people will not accept them otherwise.\u201d\n\nMariupol, a strategically located port city in southeast Ukraine, has been under attack for almost the entire war. For days, the Mariupol government was unable to give a casualty count for the March 16 bombardment of the grand, columned Mariupol Drama Theater.\n\nIn an attempt to ward off an attack on the theater, where hundreds of people were sheltering, the word \u201cCHILDREN\u201d was printed in Russian in huge white letters on the ground outside.\n\nThe city government cited eyewitnesses when it announced the death toll on its Telegram channel. But it was not immediately clear how witnesses arrived at the figure or whether emergency workers had finished excavating the ruins.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said the theater bombing was an \u201cabsolute shock, particularly given the fact that it was so clearly a civilian target.\u201d He said it showed \u201ca brazen disregard for the lives of innocent people\u201d in the besieged port city.\n\nThe Ukrainian Parliament\u2019s human rights commissioner said soon after the attack that more than 1,300 people had taken shelter in the theater, many of them because their homes were destroyed. The building had a basement bomb shelter, and some survivors did emerge from the rubble after the attack.\n\n\u201cThis is a barbaric war, and according to international conventions, deliberate attacks on civilians are war crimes,\u201d said Mircea Geoana, NATO\u2019s deputy-secretary general.\n\nHe said Putin\u2019s efforts to break Ukraine\u2019s will to resist are having the opposite effect: \u201cWhat he\u2019s getting in response is an even more determined Ukrainian army and an ever more united West in supporting Ukraine.\u201d\n\nUkrainian officials continued to push for more military support. Zelenskyy\u2019s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, on Friday called for a lend-lease program, referring to U.S. policy of heavily supplying its World War II allies.\n\nUkraine needs real-time military intelligence and heavy weapons, Yermak said in an address.\n\nWhile the Russians continue to pound the capital from the air, they appear to have gone into a \u201cdefensive crouch\u201d outside Kyiv and are focused more on the Donbas, a senior U.S. defense official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the Pentagon\u2019s assessment.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t show any signs of being willing to move on Kyiv from the ground,\u201d the official said.\n\nIn comments that seemed to corroborate a change in Moscow\u2019s military goals, Col.-Gen Sergei Rudskoi, deputy chief of the Russian general staff, said the main objective of the first stage of the operation \u2014 reducing Ukraine\u2019s fighting capacity \u2014 has \u201cgenerally been accomplished,\u201d allowing Russian forces to focus on \u201cthe main goal, the liberation of Donbas.\u201d\n\nThe Donbas is the largely Russian-speaking eastern part of the country where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces since 2014 and where many residents desire close ties to Moscow.\n\nIts coal-mining and industrial Donetsk and Luhansk regions are recognized by Russia as independent. Mariupol is also in the Donbas, although outside of the territories controlled by separatists since 2014.\n\nBritain\u2019s Ministry of Defense said Ukrainian forces have been counterattacking and have been able to reoccupy towns and defensive positions up to 35 kilometers (22 miles) east of Kyiv as Russian troops fall back on their overextended supply lines. In the south, logistical problems and Ukrainian resistance are slowing the Russians as they look to drive west toward the port of Odesa, the ministry said.\n\nIn fact, the Russians are no longer in full control of Kherson, the first major city to fall to Moscow\u2019s forces, the senior U.S. defense official said. The official said the southern city is being contested by the Ukrainians in heavy fighting. The Kremlin denied it had lost full control.\n\nThe Russian military said 1,351 of its soldiers have died in Ukraine and 3,825 have been wounded, though it was not immediately clear if that included the separatists in the east or others not part of the Defense Ministry, such as the National Guard. Earlier this week, NATO estimated that 7,000 to 15,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in four weeks of fighting.\n\nFor civilians, the misery is growing more severe in Ukrainian towns and cities, which increasingly resemble the ruins that Russian forces left behind in their campaigns in Syria and Chechnya.\n\nIn the village of Yasnohorodka, some 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of Kyiv, Russian troops who occupied it earlier in the week appeared to have been pushed out as part of a counteroffensive by Ukrainian forces.\n\nThe village church\u2019s tower was damaged by a blast, and houses on the main crossroads lay in ruins.\n\n\u201cYou can see for yourself what happened here. People were killed here. Our soldiers were killed here,\u201d said Yasnohorodka resident Valeriy Puzakov.\n\nIn Kyiv, ashes of the dead are piling up at the main crematorium because so many relatives have left, leaving urns unclaimed. And the northern city of Chernihiv is all but cut off after Russian forces destroyed bridges, leaving people without power, water and heat, authorities said.\n\nFor the vulnerable \u2014 the elderly, children and others unable to join millions fleeing westward \u2014 food shortages are mounting in a country once known as the breadbasket for the world.\n\nIn relentlessly shelled Kharkiv, hundreds of panicked people took shelter in the subway. A hospital emergency room filled with wounded soldiers and civilians",

          "text": "The cross-examination of the first defence witness, Jude Igbanoi, in the libel case filed by Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State against THISDAY Newspapers and three others, continued on Friday at the Rivers State High Court, Port Harcourt, with the claimant\u2019s lead counsel, Emmanuel Ukala (SAN), questioning Igbanoi on the interview Wike granted ARISE News last year.\n\nThe governor had filed a N7 billion libel suit claiming that the newspaper\u2019s publication of June 23, 2020, with caption: \u201cWith a Friend Like Wike, Obaseki Meets His PDP\u2019s Waterloo; Almost,\u201d was intended to damage his character.\n\nOn Friday, Ukala said that in the ARISE video clips on the Edo election campaign, Wike was very passionate in his speech for the victory of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and then asked Igbanoi if in the interview, the governor displayed any sign of betrayal in his responses.\n\nThe witness said he was not in the position to say so; but that the claimant had shown by his character and antecedents that he could not be taken seriously for whatever he says \u201cas he has a tendency to change positions randomly and unpredictably.\u201d\n\nUkala further asked the witness if the said report in THISDAY insinuated that Wike influenced the case in the Federal High Court on who was to be the flag bearer of the PDP in the 2020 Edo gubernatorial election.\n\nIn response, the witness said: \u201cSince it concerns the party, the court, if within his domain, although a federal high court, the governor would not have a passing interest but committed to the victory of the party. Since the cases concerned his party, and in the heat of the governorship election campaign, he (Wike) would be expected to have more than a passing interest in the cases.\u201d\n\nUkala further tendered a letter to the court, where he said the governor had asked THISDAY to retract the said report and publish an apology.\n\nThe cross examination of the defense witness was later adjourned by the presiding Judge, Justice Adolphus Enebeli to April 25 and 27.\n\nSpeaking with journalists outside the courtroom, counsel to THISDAY, Tuduru Edeh (SAN), explained: \u201cThe matter is continuing, the witness has adopted his position in respect of which he has made several comments or at least sustained his defense; all that is before the Honourable presiding justice.\n\n\u201cWe are not here to prejudge what both parties have said until when the court comes to a conclusion. That is the minimum of respect we need to the court.\n\n\u201cToday, the witness was cross examined again by the counsel to the claimant. There were two videos that couldn\u2019t play yesterday but the transcripts are available. So, we have taken a date to bring them forward, play them again so the counsel can continue and conclude the cross-examination.\n\n\u201cWe are returning to the court on April 25 and 27 for them to conclude.\u201d\n\nIn the video clips presented last Thursday by the defense witness, as evidence to the said report, Igbanoi in a heated argument informed the court that Wike\u2019s various public statements open his character and integrity to public scrutiny and fair comments.\n\nHe further stressed that Wike\u2019s character since coming into public office had shown him to be such that he would say certain things about someone one day and turn 360 degrees a few months or years later to say the contrary.\n\nIn the video clips, Wike was sighted in a campaign speaking about Obaseki as televised on Channels and TVC News.\n\nThe court also watched a video clip during an interview with the Governor, televised by Arise News titled, \u201cThe politics and issues in PDP.\u201d\n\nA video clip of Wike praising Amaechi over his performance in Rivers State, when he was the Director of Amaechi Campaign Organisation was also played.\n\nHowever, during cross examination, Ukala told the defendant witness (Igbanoi) that the publication was intended to smear the integrity of the governor.\n\nBut in defense, the witness stated that the story was gathered from speeches made by Wike from different occasions of campaign and interviews.\n\nIgbanoi also told the court that the publication had no intention to damage the image of the governor but was only being professional.\n\nHe stressed that the newspaper was only fulfilling its constitutional duty of informing the public and making a fair comment on the situation during the Edo State governorship election in the said publication.\n\nWhile responding to some of the questions during the cross-examination, he further pointed out to the court that Wike has been a public servant in the past two decades.\n\nThat his life, therefore, was an open book that was open to members of the public and therefore the media was free to comment on his utterances and actions, whether positive or perceived negative. He cited examples of his televised statements as the Director General of the Rotimi Amaechi Campaign Organisation where he praised Amaechi to high heavens and turned round a few years after to lampoon, castigate and lambast him at every given occasion.\n\nHe also pointed out that Edo State Governor Godwin Obaseki, whose campaign organisation he chaired, was now his number one enemy to the dismay of the public.\n\nHe stated that Wike has since been apologising to the former Edo State Governor and former APC National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole openly in the media.\n\nThe governor claimed during his appearance in court that the publication portrayed him as a deceitful, untrustworthy person.\n\nWike also claimed that THISDAY accused him of undemocratically exerting influence on the primaries\u2019 process of PDP in Edo State in aid of his ally, Omoregie Ogbeide-Ihama, who was the beneficiary of the court order restraining Obaseki from participating in the PDP primaries.\n\nWike had also told the court that the defendants denigrated him before the entire world as a fake democrat, who engages in meddling in the internal affairs of All Progressives Congress, in order to get at his political enemy, the Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi.\n\nBlessing Ibunge in Port Harcourt",
