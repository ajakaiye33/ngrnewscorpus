          "text": ".\n\nBy Olasunkanmi Akoni\n\nSocio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project, SERAP, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to urgently review and rescind his reported approval for security agencies to access subscribers\u2019 personal details via NIN-SIM linkage without due process of law.\n\nSERAP also urged the president to send executive bills to the National Assembly to repeal and reform all laws, which are inconsistent and incompatible with Nigerians\u2019 rights to privacy, dignity and liberty.\n\nSERAP made the request in a letter to President Buhari, dated February 5, 2022, by SERAP Deputy Director, Kolawole Oluwadare and made available to Vanguard on Sunday.\n\nThe letter was copied to Mr Abubakar Malami, SAN, Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, and Mr Isa Pantami, Minister of Communications and Digital Economy.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nSERAP\u2019s letter followed reports that some security agencies have received presidential approval to access people\u2019s personal details via the database of the National Identity Management Commission in the course of carrying out their duties.\n\nThe organisation stated: \u201cIf your reported approval is not rescinded, millions of law-abiding Nigerians may feel that their private lives are the subject of constant surveillance.\n\n\u201cThe interference entailed by unlawfully or arbitrarily accessing people\u2019s personal details is far-reaching and must be considered to be particularly serious.\n\n\u201cInterference with an individual\u2019s right to privacy is not permissible if it is unlawful or arbitrary.\u201d\n\nThe letter, read in part: \u201cThe power to access individual\u2019s details raises serious concerns as to their arbitrary use by the authorities responsible for applying them in a manner that reduces human rights and democratic principles by the monitoring and surveillance of millions of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIt is crucial to rescind the approval, and respect the autonomy of individuals to receive and share information of a personal nature without interference from the authorities, if unintended adverse consequences are to be avoided.\n\n\u201cAccording to reports, some security agencies have received your approval to access people\u2019s personal details via the database of the National Identity Management Commission in the course of carrying out their duties. The Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami reportedly conveyed the approval to the relevant security agencies.\n\n\u201cMr Pantami also reportedly stated that the approval would enhance security as it would help security operatives to go after kidnappers and other criminals.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe approval would now allow security agencies to access the data of the over 73 million Nigerians who have linked their National Identity Number with their SIM, and other people who may do so.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile the effectiveness of the fight against serious crime may depend to a great extent on the use of modern investigation techniques, such an objective of general interest, however fundamental it may be, cannot in itself justify the unlawful or arbitrary interference with the right to privacy.\n\n\u201cUnlawful or arbitrary access to people\u2019s personal details would contravene section 37 of the Nigerian Constitution 1999 (as amended), article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and article 5 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights, which protect against arbitrary or unlawful interference with one\u2019s privacy.\n\n\u201cAny constraints upon the right to privacy must strictly comply with the principles of legality, necessity and proportionality. These requirements are included in the Nigerian Constitution and the human rights treaties to which Nigeria is a state party.\n\n\u201cWe would be grateful if the recommended measures are taken within 7 days of the receipt and/or publication of this letter. If we have not heard from you by then, SERAP shall take all appropriate legal actions to compel your government to comply with our request in the public interest.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Civil Society Organisation, Niger Delta Elders\u2019 Forum (NDEF) has flayed Mr. Femi Adesina, Special Adviser on Media and Publicity to President Muhammadu Buhari, for his flawed position on NDDC which \u201cexposes the administration\u2019s continued disdain for the Niger Delta people.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn a statement by Chief Tonye Ogbogbula, National President of NDEF, the group stated that Adesina in his piece, \u201cPMB and NDDC\u201d offered nothing new on why President Buhari is yet to inaugurate a board for the NDDC over the past two years.\n\n\n\nREAD THE FULL STATEMENT BELOW\n\n\n\nThe submissions made by Mr Femi Adesina, Special Adviser on Media and Publicity to President Muhammadu Buhari on the Niger Delta Development Commission in an article published on Friday, February 4, 2022, in some Nigerian news media exposes the administration\u2019s continued disdain for the Niger Delta people.\n\n\n\nIn the article, a vacuous commentary bereft of substance, Adesina offered nothing new on why President Buhari is yet to inaugurate a board for the NDDC over the past two years. Rather, he mouthed the same empty statements on forensic audit under which guise the NDDC has been hijacked by a cabal in the last 2 years.\n\n\n\nAccording to Mr Adesina, \u201ca forensic audit was necessary. Some powerful forces mounted robust resistance, but they didn\u2019t reckon with the iron will of the President. The audit was done, and a report submitted.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe truth is that nobody was against the conduct of a forensic audit in the NDDC. The issue was that everybody agreed that the NDDC Act should be complied with in the Governance of the Commission during the period of the forensic audit. It was illegal to have contraptions of interim management committees / sole administrator to begin to administer the NDDC and arbitrarily utilise the monthly sums due to the NDDC.\n\n\n\nAll that was needed was for the Federal Government to appoint a credible forensic auditor to conduct the forensic audit of the NDDC, like the Federal Government did in the NNPC, while having a Governing Board in place for the Commission in line with the law. No other part of this country has been so badly treated in such a manner where the forensic audit of its development Commission becomes a basis for setting aside the law setting up the Commission, which provides for a Governing Board to ensure fairness, inclusion and representation of the nine constituent states in the region.\n\n\n\nInstitutions such as the NNPC, NPA and others are audited regularly, including forensic audits. However, their governing Laws were not set aside and their Governing Boards were not put on hold. The North East Development Commission is operating in line with its Governing Act with a Governing Board and duly constituted Management in place. However, in the case of the Niger Delta, the NDDC Act is being breached / flouted for illegal interim contraptions / sole administrator to operate and administer its funds arbitrarily!\n\n\n\nThe Federal Government weaponed the excuse of the conduct of a forensic audit on the NDDC\u2019s past operations to delay the inauguration of a board for the Commission since November 2019.\n\n\n\nAfter initially committing to conclude the forensic audit in three months, the goal post was shifted severally until the report was finally submitted in September 2021 (after 2 years), yet no action has been taken to inaugurate a Governing Board for the Commission in compliance with the NDDC Act.\n\n\n\nOn the 24th of June 2021, while receiving the leadership of the Ijaw National Congress in Aso Rock, Abuja, President Buhari promised that the NDDC Board will be inaugurated once the forensic audit report was submitted.\n\n\n\nThe President said: \u2018\u2018Based on the mismanagement that had previously bedeviled the NDDC, a forensic audit was set up and the result is expected by the end of July, 2021. I want to assure you that as soon as the forensic audit report is submitted and accepted, the NDDC Board will be inaugurated.\u201d That report has been submitted to the President since five months ago, on September 2, 2021. However the President is yet to fulfil his promise \u2013 the NDDC Board is yet to be inaugurated.\n\n\n\nThe question to ask Mr Adesina and the government is, what is the excuse for not inaugurating the board after the delays of over two years?\n\n\n\nIn the last two and a half years, under the cover of conducting a forensic audit, the huge funds due to the NDDC has been frittered and this period has witnessed some of the most brazen incidences of corruption, fraud, financial recklessness, extra-budgetary spending and gross mismanagement of several billions of naira, with very little to show for it.\n\n\n\nNeed we also recall the Senate probe of NDDC Interim Management Committee (IMC) in June/July of 2020 which revealed how the IMC blew N81.5 billion in just a couple of months on fictitious contracts, frivolities, and in breach of extant financial and public procurement laws. The Senate therefore recommended that the IMC should refund the sum of N4.923 Billion to the Federation Account, and that the IMC should be disbanded, while the substantive board should be inaugurated to manage the Commission in accordance with the law.\n\n\n\nWhile Adesina rightly stated that it is \u201cinexorable that it (inauguration of a board) would come,\u201d he engages in using propaganda and half-truths to mask the failure of Government.\n\n\n\nIt is even more disgusting to hear a presidential spokesman reduce the serious issues of governance failure at the NDDC to spurious statements such as \u201cOrder is better than speed, and we will get there\u201d in the board inauguration as if the government does not understand its duty to comply with the Law at all times. Niger Deltans have continued to condemn the continued desecration of the NDDC Act, which makes clear provisions for the appointment of its management / Governing Board.\n\n\n\nUnder the NDDC Act, each of the nine constituent states has a representative on the board. In addition, there is a representative of oil producing companies, all of whom are part time directors. The executive management has a Managing Director and two Executive Directors, who are the only full-time members of the Governing Board.\n\n\n\nThe salient issues that all stakeholders of the Niger Delta have consistently demanded, and which the President had promised and made commitments on are: (1) To make public the entire report of the forensic audit, which he received on September 2, 2021; and (2) To end the illegal Interim Management / sole administratorship at the NDDC and inaugurate the Board of the Commission, in compliance with the law, and which promise he made to the nation on June 24, 2021 when he received the leadership of Ijaw National Congress (INC) in Aso Rock, Abuja.\n\n\n\nPresident Buhari\u2019s silence on his commitment to make public the entire report of the forensic audit, and also inaugurate the NDDC Board in accordance with the law, and in fulfilment of his own promise of June 24, 2021, is of grave concern to Niger Deltans as it indicates a continued disregard by this government for the region as well as unwillingness to submit to transparency in administering the NDDC.\n\n\n\nThe point has been made by Niger Delta stakeholders, and needs to be restated, that President Buhari needs to redeem himself now that the Forensic audit report has been submitted to him since September 2, 2021. The President should do well to heed the call of Niger Delta leaders, governors, youths, women, traditional rulers, civil society organisations, and other stakeholders, comply with the law setting up NDDC, and also fulfill his own promise of June 24, 2021, and inaugurate the board to manage the Commission for the benefit of the people of the nine Niger Delta States\n\n\n\nAccording to Godspower Tamunosusi, in an article published in ThisDay Newspaper of December 17, 2021, \u201cwhat has happened at the NDDC under the President\u2019s watch is clearly the Capture of the Commission by a cabal, who are deploying its resources to whatever pleases them. Niger Deltans are disillusioned and angry. A broad assemblage of prominent leaders of the Niger Delta including statesmen, top lawyers, civil society organisations, sociopolitical groups and ethnic groups have condemned the continued occupation of the NDDC by these illegal managements.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn tandem with the legitimate demands of stakeholders across the Niger Delta region, on November 13, 2021, the Conference of Presidents-General of Niger Delta Ethnic Nationalities (CPGNDEN) met in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State and in the Communique issued after its meeting called on President Muhammadu Buhari \u201cto keep his promise and inaugurate a substantive board for NDDC following the submission of the forensic report, and in line with the law establishing the agency,\u201d noting that the Niger Delta was in dire need of development which the absence of the board has so far stalled.\n\n\n\nIn the Communique which was read by its President, Professor Benjamin Okaba, CPGNDEN also contended that the running of the NDDC by a sole administrator was contrary to the law establishing the Commission. Okaba who is also the President of Ijaw National Congress (INC) stated that \u201cthe general feeling is that the region has been auctioned off to one man to do with it as he pleases.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe NDDC Act has no provision for the ongoing illegality in the Commission\u2019s administration. The NDDC Act only provides that the Board and Management of the NDDC at any point in time should follow the provisions of the law which states that the Board and management is to be appointed by the President, subject to confirmation by the Senate. In effect, nobody is supposed to begin to administer the NDDC and utilise the huge funds accruing to it on a monthly basis without passing through this legal requirement as stipulated in the NDDC Act. To the detriment of the entire region, the illegal interim contraptions/sole administrator have been used to fleece the NDDC of its funds in the last two years.\n\n\n\nThe Federal Government\u2019s illegal actions in the NDDC in the last two years in breach of the NDDC Act has been de-marketing the APC and the Federal Government. Niger Deltans are very upset with the disdainful manner the region has been treated. There is increasing anger against the Federal Government and the APC in the Niger Delta region as a result of the very poor, biased and illegal actions of the Federal Government in the handling of these matters in the Niger Delta region.\n\n\n\nThe situation currently in NDDC which has subsisted for over two years is that we have an illegal sole administrator who is both Managing Director, Executive Director of Finance, and Executive Director Projects, in clear breach of NDDC Act which ensures separation of these duties to ensure checks and balances.\n\n\n\nThe continued administration of the NDDC by Interim management committee / sole administrator is illegal because the NDDC Act has no provision for this as the NDDC Act only provides that the Board and Management of the NDDC at any point in time should follow the provisions of the law which states that the Board and management is to be appointed by the President, subject to confirmation by the Senate. In effect, nobody is supposed to begin to administer the NDDC and utilise the huge funds accruing to it on a monthly basis without passing through this legal requirement as stipulated in the NDDC Act.\n\n\n\nTo the detriment of the entire region illegal interim contraptions/sole administrator have been used to fleece the NDDC of its funds in the last two years.\n\n\n\nUnder the illegal interim managements/sole administrator contraptions, the combined two-year budget for 2019 and 2020, as approved by the National Assembly was N799 Billion. Yet, as pointed out by Professor Benjamin Okaba, President of Ijaw National Congress (INC), under the interim management/sole administrator contraptions, billions have been paid out for questionable \u201cemergency contracts; over 1,000 persons have been allegedly employed in the NDDC between January and July, 2020 without due process; the 2020 budget was passed in December 2020 and N400bn was voted for the NDDC but the commission had spent over N190bn before the budget was passed, thereby violating the Procurement Act.\u201d\n\n\n\nPresident Buhari should be concerned about the disdain of the Niger Delta people over the manner he has handled the NDDC, most especially administering the Commission with illegal interim management/sole administrator contraptions for four and a half years in his six and a half year in office, and therefore needs to end the ongoing illegality in NDDC if he is to be remembered for good in the Niger Delta.\n\n\n\nWhereas the North East Development Commission (NEDC) has been allowed to function with its duly constituted Board in place in line with its NEDC Act thereby ensuring proper corporate governance, accountability, checks and balances and fair representation of its constituent states, the NDDC on the other hand has been run arbitrarily in the last two years by Interim committees/sole administrator in breach of the NDDC Act.\n\n\n\nIn summary, Niger Deltans demand the following:\n\n\n\n1. Ending the illegal Interim Management/sole administratorship at the NDDC.\n\n\n\nInauguration of the NDDC Governing Board in line with the NDDC Act to represent the nine constituent states.\n\n\n\n3. Publication of the Forensic Audit report for all Nigerians to see. (The report cannot be hidden because it is supposed to be a public document)\n\nProsecution of any indicted persons.\n\n\n\nChief Tonye Ogbogbula, National President, Niger Delta Elders\u2019 Forum\n\n\n\n",

We need to get our justice system right from the top.\n\n\u201cWhile the Minister of Justice deals with policy and administrative issues, the AGF as the Chief Law Officer of the Federation will oversee dispensation of justice without fear or favour.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have anyone in mind, but combining the two offices in Nigeria is becoming complex. We need a drastic reform in this respect.\u201d\n\nOn independent candidacy, the source said: \u201cThis will enable the system to produce leaders on merit. The prevalent direct, indirect and consensus clauses promote mediocrity and imposition of candidates by state governors.\n\n\u201cOutside of party structure, a good candidate should be able to emerge and win elections.\n\n\u201cBut the National Assembly is adding a proviso that at least 20 per cent of voters in a constituency or district must endorse the nomination of an independent candidate.\u201d\n\nRead Also: BREAKING: 1999 Constitution is Nigeria\u2019s glorified death certificate \u2013 Bakare\n\nThe source said the constitutional provision for special allocation of seats for some elective offices is to\u201d promote gender balance and Affirmative Action. \u201d\n\nOn the fate of criminal suspects or those with cases, the proposed amendment \u201cseeks to outlaw parade of suspects before their arraignment in court. But once a suspect is put on trial, he can be paraded.\n\n\u201cThis alteration is in line with international best practices. The law says a suspect is innocent until proven guilty.\n\n\u201cLook at some of those arrested and paraded for economic and financial crimes; they have been set free. They have however lost their reputation.\n\n\u201cThis amendment will affect the police, EFCC, ICPC, NDLEA, NSCDC and other agencies. It will also guarantee citizens\u2019 access to fair hearing.\u201d\n\nAll the proposals have to be considered and approved by the two chambers of the National Assembly and the 36 state Houses of Assembly before the constitution can be amended.\n\nA member of the House of Representatives Committee on Constitution Review said: \u201cAll these are proposals by the Joint Committee. The two chambers would have to ratify before we pass the amendments to the State Houses of Assembly.\n\n\u201cGoing by Section 9(2 and 3) of the 1999 Constitution, the Joint Committee, the National Assembly cannot alter the 1999 Constitution without the backing of the State Houses of Assembly.\n\n\u201cSo, we need to build consensus with the executive at the federal and state levels and the Conference of Speakers of the State Houses of Assembly.\n\nSection 9(2) of the 1999 Constitution says: \u201cAn Act of the National Assembly for the alteration of this Constitution, not being an act to which Section 8 of this Constitution applies, shall not be passed by either House of the National Assembly unless the proposal is supported by the votes of not less than two-thirds majority of all the members of that House and approved by the resolution of the Houses of Assembly of not less than two-thirds of all the states.\n\nSection 9(3) reads: \u201cAn Act of the National Assembly for the purposes of altering the provisions of this section, Section 8 or Chapter IV of this Constitution shall not be passed by either House of the National Assembly unless the proposal is supported by the votes of not less than two-thirds majority of all the members of that House and approved by the resolution of the Houses of Assembly of not less than two-thirds of all the states.\u201d\n\nDeputy Senate President Ovie Omo-Agege announced on Friday that the report of the National Assembly Joint Committee on Review of the 1999 Constitution would be presented to both chambers for consideration by the end of this month.\n\nOmo-Agege, who doubles as co-chairman of the panel, spoke during the joint retreat of the Senate and House of Representatives Committees on Constitution review.\n\nHe said the recommendations for 55 amendments stemmed from hearings and memos submitted by the public.",

Every Monday people sit at home in what they call \u2018Holy Monday\u2019. What is holy in making people suffer like this?\n\n\u201cIPOB has said countless times that they are not the ones enforcing the order. We don\u2019t know who is enforcing it neither does it seem like we have a way to solve it.\n\n\u201cI went with Ike Ekweremadu and two bishops to the DSS to see Nnamdi Kanu and he told us \u2018I have never said people should sit at home\u2019. I told him that nobody believes you outside. Because people have said they don\u2019t like it but they keep sitting at home.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cThere is no way we are going to survive like this. You are sitting at home and the people who you are doing these things for are in Lagos and in Abuja and everywhere and they don\u2019t care. And you are here killing your own.\n\n\u201cAba is known for bringing and opening containers of imported goods on Mondays. So, the problems we\u2019re having today is that because of the sit-at-home, people now go to Port Harcourt, Uyo and Calabar to open their containers. They\u2019re leaving Southeast and moving out to Lagos. When we all leave, who will you blame? The captains of industries are no longer there\u201d, Abaribe said.\n\nHe lamented that the insecurity of the Southeast had assumed the biggest problem of the region.\n\n\u201cInsecurity in the Southeast is the biggest problem we are facing now. And the sooner we tackle it the better for us. Even if you are seeking a separate country, why would you destroy your own place with your hands? You need to have a viable country and not a scattered one\u201d, he said.\n\nHe called on Ndigbo to concentrate on making the Southeast as the economic hub of Nigeria irrespective of the outcome of their 2023 presidential quest.\n\nAbaribe also bemoaned the negative effect of Mondays\u2019 sit-at-home on the economy of the region, saying rather than achieve anything good, the exercise had ended up chasing businessmen away from the region.\n\nSpeaking during the investiture of the 16th President of Enugu Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture(ECCIMA), Barr. Jasper Nduagwuike on Saturday, the senator urged the businessmen, industrialists and all stakeholders in the Southeast to emulate the people of Bavaria in Germany and Catalonia in Spain for jettisoning everything about ruling the countries but concentrated on making their regions the economic hub of their countries.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe want to turn the Southeast into the Catalonia of Spain, the biggest industrial area in that country. It doesn\u2019t matter that they are seeking for their own self-sufficiency. They still become the industrial hub of that place so that at the end, even if you are going anywhere, you are going to become a viable country.\n\n\u201cIf you destroy your place, where are you going to be when everything is destroyed.\n\n\u201cWe want to turn the Southeast into the Bavaria of Nigeria. Bavaria is the industrial hub of Germany today. No Bavarian has been made president of Germany because they are the people that are holding the economy.\n\n\u201cI want to task each and every one of us, especially the chamber of commerce that our job is cut out for us.\u201d\n\nHe urged Ndigbo to make Southeast to become more attractive to businesses, adding that giving in to Mondays\u2019sit-at-home could succeed in destroying the economy of the region.\n\n\u201cWhat we need in the southeast is to turn the zone to a place that attracts people, not the place that people are running away from. We cannot grow as region if we don\u2019t work 24 hours daily to uplift our standard of living\u201d\n\nIn an opening remark, Jasper Nduagwuike who pledged to work for the repositioning of the chamber said that his administration will ensure the construction of a befitting Trade Fair Complex in Enugu.",

          "text": "By Dare Odufowokan, Assistant Editor/Jide Orintunsin, Abuja/ Damian Duruiheoma, Enugu\n\nWith only 21 days to its national convention in Abuja, the All Progressives Congress (APC) seems to be racing against time to put its house in order and resolve the crises sparked by the last state congresses.\n\nDespite the Thursday inauguration of 34 of the state chairmen in Abuja and the recent efforts of the party\u2019s national secretariat to reconcile feuding interest groups, The Nation can now report that factionalism persists and constitutes a potential threat to the success of the convention.\n\nAn example is Enugu State where Dr. Ben Nwoye is laying claim to the position of state chairman against Chief Ugochukwu Agballah who returned to a tumultuous reception in Enugu from Abuja.\n\nEfforts are still ongoing to unite the party factions in Sokoto and Kano, the two states whose chairmen were absent at the Thursday event.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe Chairman of the APC Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State, met with the two factions of the party in Kano State in Abuja on Friday night.\n\nLeading one faction is Governor Abdullahi Ganduje while Senator Ibrahim Shekarau leads the other.\n\nAggrieved chieftains and factions of the party in some other states continue to kick against the recognition of rival factions, claiming that the issues at stake have not been resolved.\n\nSources in Sokoto and Kano State told The Nation that the battle for the control of the party intensified following the failure of the APC national leadership to give its nod to either of the two factional chairmen being paraded in the states.\n\nIn the case of Kano State, leaders of the two factions had gone to Abuja on Thursday hoping to be recognised only to be disappointed.\n\nA source said: \u201cWhile Shekarau and his people were banking on the court judgment that affirmed the chairman-elect that emerged from their factional state congress to clinch the position, Ganduje was banking on his position as a member of the Governors\u2019 Forum, as well as the report of the State Congress committee sent to monitor the congress held by his faction last year.\n\n\u201cIt came as a surprise to us all as politicians that neither of the two chairmen-elect got inaugurated.\n\n\u201cThe implication is that the crisis here in Kano is not anywhere near the end. In fact, fresh twists are daily being introduced into the crisis by the gladiators, leaving party members more confused.\u201d\n\nLast month, the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) in Abuja dismissed two motions filed by the Ganduje-led faction. This came on the heels of earlier rulings of the court on November 30 and December 17, 2021, affirming Haruna Danzago of Shekarau\u2019s faction as state chairman-elect.\n\nIn Rivers State, the Senator Magnus Abe faction of the APC has vowed not to recognise Chief Emeka Beke, a staunch supporter of the Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi, as the state chairman of the party.\n\nIn the case of Kano State, leaders of the two factions had gone to Abuja on Thursday hoping to be recognised only to be disappointed.\n\nA source said: \u201cWhile Shekarau and his people were banking on the court judgment that affirmed the chairman-elect that emerged from their factional state congress to clinch the position, Ganduje was banking on his position as a member of the Governors\u2019 Forum, as well as the report of the State Congress committee sent to monitor the congress held by his faction last year.\n\n\u201cIt came as a surprise to us all as politicians that neither of the two chairmen-elect got inaugurated.\n\n\u201cThe implication is that the crisis here in Kano is not anywhere near the end.

Since there was no ward congress in Rivers, there can\u2019t be a valid state congress for the state.\n\n\u201cI and others petitioned the National Secretariat.\n\n\u201cAt a point, the party then stated how things should be resolved. Those things were not resolved. A faction hacked everything.\n\n\u201cWe petitioned the National Secretariat and a delegation was sent to verify our petition. They found out that our petition and complaints were genuine and right.\n\n\u201cSo, we were waiting for the National Secretariat to take a position on that, then we heard of the inauguration of someone as state chairman. That also will not stand as we will continue to challenge it.\u201d\n\nLast October, the Abe-led faction inaugurated a parallel executive. The move was made four days after Amaechi\u2019s group announced its new state executive.\n\nBefore the APC state congresses held in October 2021, chieftains and members of the party had warned of a looming crisis, especially after the Supreme Court, in a ruling, sacked the Abe faction caretaker committee chairman, Igo Aguma, from office.\n\nParty sources added that the inauguration of Beke has opened old wounds in the party.\n\nMum has been the word from the former Governor Ibikunle Amosun-led faction of the APC in Ogun State following the recognition of Chief Yemi Sanusi, a loyalist of Governor Dapo Abiodun, as the state chairman of the party on Thursday.\n\nBut The Nation learnt that leaders of Amosun\u2019s faction of the party in the state have met to discuss the faction\u2019s next line of action ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\nThe two sides have been locked in a fierce battle for the control of the party since 2018.\n\nBut the recognition of Sanusi appears to have taken the initiative away from Amosun and his men. With the 2023 elections fast approaching, it is unlikely that the crisis rocking the state chapter of the party will abate.\n\n\u201cWe are politicians and we will respond appropriately very soon. For now, we are meeting to decide what should be done next. Senator Ibikunle Amosun remains a leader of the APC in Ogun State,\u201d a source close to the former governor said.\n\nThe situation in Abia State has taken a turn for the worse following the recognition of Dr. Kingsley Ononogbu as state chairman.\n\nA few hours to the Thursday event in Abuja, an Abia State High Court sitting in Ukwa refused to grant an interim ex parte order to stop him from being inaugurated.\n\nOnonogbu emerged at a special congress held on January 8, 2022. He belongs to the group loyal to the Secretary of APC Contact and Strategy Committee, Chief Ikechi Emenike.\n\nBut a faction in the party, which has continued to fight for the control of the leadership structure even after losing out in the congress, went to court and filed a suit to stop the scheduled inauguration.\n\nThe faction, led by Donatus Nwankpa, enjoys the backing of Senate Chief Whip, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu.\n\n\u201cThe Nwankpa faction has as usual rejected the inauguration of Onionogbu. They have vowed to take over the party and we are ready to face them,\u201d our source said.\n\nThe party in Enugu State is facing a fresh challenge after Dr. Ben Nwoye declared that he remains state chairman against the Abuja-recognised Chief Ugochukwu Agballah.\n\nMoments after Agballah returned to the state to a tumultuous reception by members of the party, Nwoye addressed a press conference, claiming that he is still in charge of the party as chairman.\n\nAgballah, on the other hand, told his supporters at the Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu that he was set to turn around the fortunes of the party in the state.\n\nHe said the APC has come with vigour to break the 24-year-old political monopoly of the state by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\n\u201cToday marks the end of monopoly. Today marks the end of senatocracy. Godfatherism is dead,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, speaking with journalists in Enugu, Nwoye dismissed the claim made by Agballah, insisting that nobody was sworn in on Thursday in Abuja as Enugu State Chairman.\n\nHe stated that the caretaker committee under his leadership was still in charge of the party in the state at the moment. He insisted that the crisis rocking the party in the state would be amicably resolved soon.\n\nHe said: \u201cAPC is a restored party. There\u2019s no victor, there\u2019s no vanquished. APC in Enugu is united.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, since nobody has been inaugurated as Enugu chairman, he remained the Caretaker Committee Chairman of the party in the state.\n\nIn Zamfara, Senator Kabiru Marafa\u2019s faction of the party dismissed the recognition of Governor Bello Matawalle\u2019s factional executive of the party as a charade.\n\nSpokesman for Marafa\u2019s faction, Bello Bakyasuwa Maradun, said the recognition of Matawalle\u2019s faction negated all principles of strategic thinking for building an enduring party that can weather the storm of 2023.\n\nHe said: \u201cOur faction followed due process in conducting congresses at all levels that led to the emergence of a complete structure with Sirajo Garba Maikatako as state chairman.\n\n\u201cWe also went to court to contest the legality of the congresses conducted by the government\u2019s faction because of the breaches associated with them, including the questionable stand of their party\u2019s membership and relevant notice enshrined in the APC constitution.\n\n\u201cUntil the court decides on this, we consider the government faction as illegal and sustain loyalty to our legitimate factional structure. Henceforth, we will continue to enjoy watching this act of madness.\u201d\n\nThe situation is not different in Kwara State where Ibrahim Sharafadeen, the Publicity Secretary of the APC faction loyal to Information and Culture Minister Lai Mohammed, said the crisis in the state chapter was far from over.\n\nHis words: \u201cWe are still at a loss as to how the chairman of the APC Caretaker Committee came to the conclusion that all the aggrieved party members in Kwara State have been reconciled.\n\n\u201cThe claim, therefore, by Mai Mala Buni-led committee that the protracted crisis in Kwara APC was resolved is a lie from the pit of hell, which could be likened to an offensive odour of fart from a lift.\n\n\u201cIt might be true that the crisis in Gombe, Ogun, Osun and other states as claimed, but certainly not that of Kwara State.\u201d\n\nThe Andy Uba faction of the party in Anambra State is still savouring the recognition of Basil Ejidike as chairman by the national secretariat while the faction led by Labour and Employment Minister Chris Ngige insists that Ejidike has been sacked from the position.\n\nThe factional publicity secretary, Okelo Madukaife, in a statement, hailed the national leadership of the ruling APC for not swearing in Ejidike.\n\nHe said: \u201cOur dynamic chapter of APC congratulates the National Leadership of our great party for the wisdom contained in the decision not to swear in anybody as Chairman of Anambra State Chapter of APC.\n\n\u201cThis noble decision validates the position of the mainstream of our party in Anambra State that 2018 officials remain in charge of our affairs until congresses can hold, as leadership abhors a vacuum.\u201d\n\nState Chairmen to take the oath of office before convention\n\nThe new state chairmen of the APC who were issued with certificates of return last Thursday by the party\u2019s Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) are now to take their oath of office and oath of allegiance before the February 26 national convention of the party.\n\nThe Nation gathered yesterday that but for the crises in Enugu, Kano and Sokoto state chapters of the party, the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) would have administered the oath on the state chairmen on Thursday.\n\nDuring the Thursday event, the names of the chairmen of Kano and Sokoto states were conspicuously missing on the list of chairmen issued with a certificate of return while that of Enugu State had his certificate withdrawn.\n\nBut a well placed party source told The Nation last night that \u201dthere is no cause for all the hues and cries over what happened on Thursday. I can tell you that within the next 10 days, the oath of office will be administered on the state chairmen.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that they will take their oaths of office before the convention.\n\n\u201cWe delayed the exercise due to the challenges we have in Kano, Sokoto and Enugu states, and I can assure our party members in the affected states and all our state chairmen that we shall resolve the differences and conduct the oath-taking before the convention.\n\n\u201dThe newly elected State chairmen will be sworn in before convention and they will lead their state\u2019s delegates to the convention in Abuja come February 26.\n\n\u201cThe caretaker committee is committed to the convention and we want to ensure that the exercise is hitch-free. Quote me, the state chairmen will be sworn in or if you like inaugurated before the convention.\u201d\n\nAsked to be specific on the date, the CECPC member said, \u201creconciliation is not a tea party. A lot of considerations, bargaining and negotiations will have to come to play and all these take time. All I know is that the swearing-in of the state chairmen will hold before the convention.\u201d",

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nThere are strong indications that the All Progressives Congress (APC) may have concluded arrangements to micro-zone its 2023 presidential ticket to the South-south geopolitical zone, thereby foreclosing the possibility of the Southeast zone getting the ticket.\n\nThis is coming on the heels of looming fresh crisis in the party following the decision of the leaders and stakeholders to endorse former governor of Nasarawa State, Alhaji Tanko Al-Makura, as the consensus candidate for the national chairman of the ruling party in the forthcoming February 26 national convention.\n\nA credible source in the ruling party who craved anonymity told Sunday Sun that after the northern leaders of the party conceded the presidential ticket to the South, the likelihood that the party would micro-zone the presidential ticket to the South-south emerged last weekend.\n\nThe source maintained that the fate of presidential aspirants like Owelle Rochas Okorocha, Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu, Senator Orji Uzor-Kalu, and others from the South that have declared their interest for the plum job under APC may have been sealed.\n\nThe source revealed that going by the current dynamics in the party, the South-south will likely get the ticket.\n\nReacting to the zoning arrangement the ruling party may opt for, the source said: \u201cThe possibility of zoning the APC presidential ticket to the Southeast is almost a forgone conclusion. The possibility of the North getting the ticket is also a forgone conclusion. What I can confidently tell you is that APC will not certainly throw the ticket open because the party leaders are unanimous and in agreement that the ticket will be zoned to the South.\n\n\u201cI can also inform you, on good authority, that the most likely beneficiary of the micro-zoning option is not even Southwest as many envisaged, judging by the interest it is generating, but will likely be the South-south. And I can also inform you again that for now, the lot may fall on two persons from that zone.\u201d\n\nOn the possibility of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) zoning its presidential ticket to the North affecting the APC zoning arrangement, the source argued: \u201cWe have told the party leaders that the North must sacrifice their presidential ambition regardless of the permutation of the opposition party. It will be a negation of equity, fairness and justice for the North to contest again after ruling eight years under Muhammadu Buhari. They have to sacrifice that ambition regardless of PDP\u2019s zoning arrangement.\u201d\n\nThe source equally dismissed the speculation that the crises rocking many state chapters of the party will pose serious threat to the proposed February 26 primary, arguing that once a consensus candidate for the national chairmanship emerges, statutory delegates may be used during the convention especially the states riddled with crisis.\n\n\u201cOrdinarily, the convention would have been delayed more to enable the party more time to conclude some reconciliation moves, however, Governor Buni and his committee members have tried. They also know that diminishing returns can set in if they continue to hang on to power more than necessary.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cYes, I have heard that the state chairmen want to endorse the continuation of the Governor Buni-led Caretaker Committee especially to enable the party more time to reconcile more aggrieved members. However, we can conduct the convention in the states rocked by crisis by using statutory delegates to vote.\n\n\u201cWe can no longer take chances because we know that the PDP is lurking around the corner to wrestle power from us. With the new election technology like the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) that may be our greatest undoing. As I said, we cannot wait again especially as the APC leadership can use the statutory delegates to replace those states where there are crises,\u201d the source argued.\n\nMeanwhile, the choice of the former Nasarawa governor as the consensus candidate for the national chairmanship position ahead of other aspirants for the post has continued to generate tension and acrimony.\n\nWhile the stakeholders hinged their choice of Al-Makura on product of the legacy parties, the Congress of Progressives Change (CPC) which has not presided over the ruling party since formation, others claimed that the party leaders have since discouraged the possibility of electing any former governor with a sitting APC governor after the lamentable incidence in Edo State between Comrade Adams Oshiomhole and Governor Godwin Obaseki.\n\nOur source further claimed that former Governor Al-Makura did not only win the endorsement of party leaders and major stakeholders, but also many APC governors and more importantly President Muhammadu Buhari, declaring that; \u201cit is 80 per cent certain that Al-Makura will emerge a consensus national chairman of the APC.\u201d\n\nReacting to the plans ahead of the party\u2019s convention, our source said: \u201cWe are still exploring the option of a consensus candidate for the chairmanship of our party because apart from other reasons, it will even reduce the current tension within the party.\n\n\u201cFrom all indications, the former Nasarawa State governor, Al-Makura, may emerge as a consensus candidate, especially as he is of the CPC stock that has not yet produced the national chairman of our party. I can confirm to you that President Buhari and even many of the progressive governors have not only endorsed him, but are also rooting for him too.\n\n\u201cI can equally confirm to you that it is even 80 per cent certain that a consensus candidate may emerge ahead of the convention and once we achieve that, the controversial issue of state delegates to vote during the convention would be circumvented.\u201d\n\nDismissing the claim, Ray Murphy, an adviser to former National Chairman of the party, Chief Odigie-Oyegun, told Sunday Sun that if there is any person to be fronted as a consensus candidate, the former governor of Benue State, George Akume stands at a more vantage position to be so endorsed.\n\n\u201cAkume has the experience as a two-term governor and the network. Don\u2019t forget that he is a serving Minister with unrestrained access to Mr President and if there is any of the aspirants to get such favour, Akume who attends the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting should be considered before others. From all indications, the party may have zoned the ticket to the North-central and it favours all of them coming from that zone and Akume stands the chance of winning the position,\u201d he argued.",

          "text": "From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja\n\nAt the moment, there is unease in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) over the zoning of the opposition party\u2019s 2023 presidential ticket.\n\nIn recent times, there have been concerns in the polity over which part of the country will produce the 2023 PDP presidential candidate, with party stalwarts from the different geo-political zones laying claim to the ticket.\n\nHowever, the PDP national leadership is yet to take a decision on the issue. Nevertheless, party leaders had at different fora given conflicting opinions over the zoning of the opposition\u2019s party presidential ticket for the next general election.\n\nA top source at the PDP national secretariat, in Abuja, told Sunday Sun, that party\u2019s leadership is considering setting up a panel to decide the issue of zoning of elective offices in the 2023 polls.\n\nSunday Sun gathered that the issue of zoning of the 2023 PDP presidential ticket is likely to dominate discourse at the party\u2019s NEC, which sources said might hold within the next three weeks.\n\nIt was further gathered that the PDP would be exploring three options \u2013 consensus, throwing the contest open to all qualified persons or zoning to either the Southeast or the Northeast.\n\nThe source stated that \u201cyou know PDP going to election without the Southeast will be very suicidal. But in a worse case scenario, PDP will ask everybody to go and contest.\u201d\n\nHe added \u201ceverybody is interested on how to win election. This has nothing to do with morality. Even the Igbo man in PDP wants PDP to win the election. Because, it is clear for the people of the Southeast that the zone has no stake in the APC.\u201d\n\nSo far, seven persons are known to be aspiring to contest the 2023 presidential election on the platform of the PDP.\n\nThey include Sokoto State governor, Aminu Tambuwal; former Vice President Atiku Abubakar; former Secretary to Government of the Federation ( SGF), Anyim Pius Anyim and former Senate President, Bukola Saraki.\n\nOthers are Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State; Mazi Sam Ohuabunwa and Chief Dele Momodu.\n\nHowever, pressure has been mounting on former Anambra State governor, Peter Obi, to join the presidential race.\n\nFollowing the zoning of the position of national chairman to the North, it was taken that the presidential ticket would be ceded to the South. However, this has been trailed with discordant tunes among party leaders.\n\nSunday Sun gathered that it was this disagreement that made it impossible for the party to take a decision on the zoning of elective offices, alongside party offices, before the convention.\n\nThe PDP National Executive Committee (NEC) which ratified the zoning of the national chairmanship to the North, at its 94th meeting, deferred decision on the zoning of its presidential ticket.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nNevertheless, the NEC, which is the second highest party organ, had at that meeting held on October 7 opened discussion on the the report of the Governor Bala Mohammed Committee, which dealt with zoning of the 2023 presidential ticket.\n\nThe Bala Committee, which reviewed the party\u2019s performance in the 2019 general elections, had said that the party should be guided by merit in deciding its 2023 presidential ticket.\n\nConsequently, it noted that ordinarily the the Southeast and Northeast, which are yet to produce a president for the country should be given special consideration on the presidential ticket for the sake of equity. Nevertheless, it advised that the ticket should be thrown open to all interested aspirants.\n\nA PDP leader from the North, confirming to Sunday Sun, that there is anxiety in the opposition party over zoning, disclosed that the party is faced with two choices going by the Bala Mohammed\u2019s committee report.\n\nAccording to him, the choices are whether to zone to either the Southeast or Northeast or throw it open.\n\n\u201cThe suggestion in the Bala Committee are in two folds. The first one is that we should look at the Northeast and the Southeast. The second option is that going by the current trend in our nation, we should use merit and throw it open. It was raised at the last NEC. It was resolved that let us first sort out the zoning of party offices. Then we come back to it,\u201d he stated.\n\nBut, the party leader added, that the Southern governors in PDP, in pushing for the national chairmanship to be ceded to the North were united in the demand that the presidential ticket should be zoned to the South.\n\nHe said :\u201dI know that Southern governors were united that the Presidency should come to the South. The original agenda was to get the President zoned to the South.\u201d\n\nHowever, hopes that a Southerner would get to fly the PDP flag in the next general election may be fading as three South-south governors elected on the platform are angling to be running mate to any of the Northern presidential aspirants.\n\nA member of the PDP NEC from the South, who does not want his name on print, told Sunday Sun, that some of the governors had at a meeting with one of the northern presidential aspirants, given him a list of three South-south governors, from which he should choose his running mate, as a condition for their support.\n\nHe explained that when one the governors on the list discovered he might not be favoured, he pulled out of the arrangement.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe governors are not together. We might have a NEC meeting within the next three weeks. I am sure the zoning of the presidential ticket will part of the major agenda.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the body language of the party, you will discover that the Southeast is not pushing strongly enough. Our best person is Peter Obi. But he is not forthcoming. If Peter declares, and Anyim Pius Anyim declares, it will be difficult for the PDP to say throw it open.\u201d\n\nEfforts to reach the the PDP National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, for reaction, was unsuccessful, as he did not respond to repeated calls to his mobile line at the time of filing this report.",

          "text": "From Tony John, Port Harcourt\n\nRivers State governor, Nyesom Wike, has said the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) will not give its presidential ticket to any candidate who will serve only the interest of the wealthy few in the country.\n\nThe governor said some desperate politicians were already scheming for a candidate who will not serve the interest of the many, rather the interest of just those of the wealthy few.\n\nGovernor Wike made the assertion at a grand reception organised in his honour by the people of Kalabari ethnic nationality at the Abalama School field in Asari Toru Local Government Area, yesterday, during which the Amanyanabo of Abonnema, King Gboko Desreal Bob-manuel conferred him with the traditional title of Se-Ibidokubo of Kalabari land (he who does good things for Kalabari people).\n\nIn his remarks after the conferment, Governor said: \u201cNo amount of gang up can make PDP to give somebody who will want to run election for the interest of some big men, and not for all Nigerians. Anybody who wants to be candidate of PDP must be candidate for the interest of Nigerians.\u201d\n\nHe expressed concern over the fact that some companies in the country have continued to post annual financial profits regularly in a downing national economy to the detriment of the poor.\n\nWike opined that such profits, invariably shared only by the rich, make them to get richer, while the majority of the population of the country, who are poor, get poorer.\n\nHe reiterated that the stakeholders in the southern part of the country will soon make a declarative statement concerning 2023 presidential election.\n\n\u201cThe day the South will speak, Nigeria will shake. We believe in the unity of this country, but nobody can threaten us. Nobody should threaten us. We believe in the unity of Nigeria and unity of Nigeria must continue.\u201d\n\nThe governor lampooned Rivers politicians serving in the President Muhammadu Buhari administration for their gross inability to attract federal government projects to the state.\n\nConcerning the next Rivers\u2019 governor, Wike said everybody was entitled to aspire to be the next governor, but such person must show capacity for that office and be well disposed to protect the interest of the state.\n\nThe governor announced the extension of deadline for completion of the Trans-Kalabari road phase one project by two months owing to the lost period when workmen were kidnapped on site.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nHe disclosed that if the finances of the state improve, his administration might award the second phase of the Trans-Kalabari road before he leaves office next year.\n\nThe governor, while cancelling the contract for the reconstruction of Kalabari National College due to unforeseen politics, announced the release of more funds for the Maryhood Girls Secondary School in the area to speed up its completion.\n\nIn his welcome address, Chairman of Rivers State Elders Forum, Ferdinand Anabraba, explained that the grand reception was significant for two reasons: its critical importance to them as a people and also because of the unity of purpose engendered among them under the Wike administration\n\nHe said it was that kind of reception organised for prominent sons and friends who have impacted the Kalabari people.\n\nAnabraba noted that Governor Wike has systematically fulfilled all promises made to them including those of development projects and appointment of Kalabari people into his administration.\n\nHe listed some of the projects completed or ongoing to include the phase one of Trans-Kalabari road project other administration promised but failed to execute for over 17 years, the rehabilitation and equipping of zonal and general hospitals, secondary schools, Abonnema Ring road, sandfilling in Obonoma, Abonnema, Bakana and Oboama, Abalama communities.\n\nAlso speaking, the former Vice Chancellor of the University of Port Harcourt, Prof. Nimi Briggs, opined that Kalabari people had enthusiastically and with relentless vigor, contributed to the growth and development of Rivers State and Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, it was appropriate, and should be considered right thing for the Kalabari people to expect return for the dues that they had paid.\n\nOn his part, Dumo Lulu-Briggs said the Kalabari people were expecting Governor Wike to also ensure that Kalabari people are brought out from the political wilderness in 2023.\n\nA human rights activist, AnnKio Briggs, noted that Rivers State, though a complex place to govern, does not mean that the people do not love each other.\n\nShe, however, harped on greater unity among the people while urging Governor Wike not to relent in what he is doing for the Kalabari people, the state and the region.",

          "text": "By Damilola Fatunmise\n\nFast rising star, Marytonette Awhobiwom Okudare aka Biwom is a singer cum songwriter, who hails from Calabar, Cross River State.\n\nA graduate of law, Biwom relocated to Lagos to pursue her dream as a musician. In 2018, she debuted with a single, Faya and followed it with G-Wagon in 2019. That same year, Biwom took her craft a notch higher when she performed at the house party, and the finale of Big Brother Naija realty TV show.\n\nIn this interview, she opens up on her journey from law to music. Please enjoy it.\n\nWhat type of music did you grow up listening to?\n\nI listened to a lot of R&B including Westlife and Backstreet Boys back then when I was in school. I used to buy their CDs and would beg my driver to play them on my way to school.\n\nOkay, at what point did you realise you wanted to do music?\n\nI realised I wanted to do music when I was much younger. I also wanted to do movies because I loved acting. I started playing drums when I was seven and I started playing the keyboard at 14. But then, I discovered music when my mom sent me away from home to go stay with my aunt. I auditioned for a movie role, which I was given but I couldn\u2019t take it because I was grounded in my aunt\u2019s house. This was when I just finished my secondary school. However, one day, I was singing while fetching water at my aunt\u2019s place; a man who heard me singing stopped by and asked me if I have recorded a song before. I told him \u2018no\u2019, he then asked me to come to his studio where for the first time I saw a musical set up.\n\nSo, what actually motivated your choice of music over movies?\n\nAny time I sleep I see people screaming my name. In fact, I always wanted to do music but my parents didn\u2019t want that for me because I was the first child. I wouldn\u2019t blame them because African parents want their children to do something more realistic.\n\nThe urge to play music made you relocate from Calabar to Lagos?\n\nComing to Lagos, I didn\u2019t have any set plan at all, because I didn\u2019t have any relative to stay with. But I came and went ahead to live with Femi, a friend residing in Ikorodu; he allowed me live in his family house for three months. I came to Lagos because all I wanted to do was to be around music.\n\nWho are your role models in the industry?\n\nI like Kiss Dainiel; he inspires me a lot. Teni is also one artiste I look up to because people didn\u2019t expect her to blow the way she did. No one thought she would be in the limelight especially now that female artistes are being stereotyped. It\u2019s harder for female artistes especially if you\u2019re not sexy. I said to myself that I will be the next person that will do well the way Teni did.\n\nNow, how would you describe your relationship with your parents, especially your dad?\n\nMy dad and I didn\u2019t have a strong relationship; he only stood as a father figure. He was there to attend to my needs but I was not able to communicate properly with him. My dad was barely around; it was my mom that was more in my space, making more of the decisions, most of which were influenced by her sisters.\n\nYou\u2019re a lawyer, how do you combine law with music?\n\nI am not practising law now that I am in the music scene. But I can see how law can be helpful, especially with copyright issues, when artistes get their songs stolen. So, yeah, I will combine both music and law along that line. But it was obvious I was not interested in law at all. So, I don\u2019t mind giving up law for music.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nYou look tomboyish with your dressing; did you grow up around boys?\n\nNo, I am actually the first child. My tomboy look came from my fashion style. I actually feel naked whenever I am wearing a dress.\n\nAre you in a relationship?\n\nYes, I am in a relationship.\n\nWhat do you look for in a man?\n\nI look at the intellectual propensity of a guy.\n\nWhat if your guy tells you to drop music?\n\nI\u2019ll rather choose music.\n\nYou\u2019ll choose music over your lover?\n\nIf I could choose music over my family then what else can I not compromise? I lived in Calabar like I didn\u2019t have a family. I was depressed; I was given a job at the Ministry of Justice in Calabar but I rejected it. So what?\n\nWhat\u2019s your greatest moment as a musician?\n\n2019 was my biggest year when I performed in Wizkid and Davido\u2019s shows. I also performed at the Big Brother Naija house party alongside DJ Obi and equally at the finale. These are my biggest performances to date.\n\nWhat are you currently working on?\n\nI have released two official singles alongside videos. My first single was Faya and it was released in mid-2018. That was followed by G-Wagon released in 2019. Krizbeat produced the song and Clarence Peters directed the video. My first body of work, Confessions Of A Rebel features Skales. I\u2019m still promoting the EP and working on more songs.\n\nWhere do you see yourself in the next five years?\n\nI see myself touring the world; I see my songs on everyone\u2019s lips.",

          "text": "*Lai Mohammed, Ngige, Okorocha, Wamakko, Abe\u2019s factions spit fire\n\nOur Correspondents\n\nDespite last Thursday\u2019s inauguration of the state chairmen of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in 34 states at the party\u2019s national headquarters in Abuja, the tussles over the control of the party structures have remained unabated in no fewer than 13 states, THISDAY investigation has revealed.\n\nThe affected states include Zamfara, Sokoto, Delta, Rivers, Anambra, Imo, Enugu, Ogun and Kwara.\n\nOthers include Osun, Kano, Bauchi and Kebbi states.\n\nVarious factions of the party led by the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed; Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige; former Governor of Imo State, Senator Rochas Okorocha; former Governor of Sokoto State, Senator Aliyu Magartada Wamakko; former Governor of Kebbi State, Senator Adamu Aliero, and Senator Magnus Abe, have faulted the action of the national leadership of the party.\n\nAbe\u2019s faction in Rivers State has warned that the division in the party and the recognition of the faction led by the Minister of Transportation, Mr Rotimi Amaechi could lead to the exclusion of the party in the 2023 general election like in 2019.\n\nThe ruling party did not inaugurate the leadership of the party in Sokoto State, which is being contested by three factions led by a former governor of the state, Senator Wamakko; a member of the House of Representatives representing Illela/ Gwadabawa Federal Constituency, Hon. Balarabe Salame, Speaker of the Sokoto State House of Assembly, Hon. Muhammad Aminu Achida; and Senator Abubukar Gada, who leads his faction.\n\nWhile Wamakko leads one faction, Salame and Achida are in one faction.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that Wamakko has six National Assembly members, a senator, and 13 members of the state House of Assembly in his faction.\n\nBut Salame, Achida and Gada\u2019s factions have the backing of chieftains of the party based in Abuja.\n\nWhen contacted, the Chairman of Wamakko\u2019s faction, Alhaji Isa Sadiq Achida told THISDAY that nobody can truncate the will of the people of the state.\n\nHe further explained that those ranting that Wamakko has hijacked the party cannot win even an electoral ward for the party.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that if you remove Wamakko from APC in Sokoto, the party is dead because Wamakko is the party and the party is Wamakko,\u201d he stated.\n\nOn his part, another factional leader of the party in the state, Salame alleged that Wamakko sat down in his house and wrote the names of the executives and submitted it to the party headquarters.\n\nHe further alleged that the party lost the governorship election in 2019 \u201cbecause of Wamakko\u2019s handedness. He imposed an unpopular candidate, which made us lose the governorship seat.\u201d\n\nIn Zamfara State, the APC faction led by Senator Kabir Garba Marafa had described the recognition of the faction led by Governor Bello Matawalle as an act of impunity by the national leadership of the party.\n\nIn a statement issued by the factional Publicity Secretary, Mr Bello Bakkyasuwa Maradun titled: \u2018We enjoy watching APC\u2019s parade of madness,\u2019 the faction stated that the action of the party\u2019s caretaker and extraordinary convention planning committee would cause chaos in the party.\n\nHe predicted that APC would soon collapse because of impunity thriving in it.\n\n\u201cThe saying \u2018the wages of sin is death\u2019 applies perfectly in the most recent action of the APC Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of presenting certificates to their selected chairpersons of state chapters of the party. As one of the many factions across the country with legitimate grounds for agitation, the Senator Marafa-led faction of APC in Zamfara State sees this action as desperate and negates all principles of strategic thinking for building an enduring party that can weather the storm of 2023 as President Buhari rightly warned.\u201d\n\nIn Delta State, members of the party opposed to the faction led by the Deputy Senate President, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, have also kicked against the inauguration of Mr Omeni Sobotie as the state chairman.\n\nAccording to them, the so-called inauguration ceremony that took place in Abuja on Thursday was merely a sham as it did not follow due process, including the proper administration of the oath of office and oath of allegiance before competent officials.\n\nEminent chieftains of the party allegedly \u201cshut out\u201d of the process of the different party congresses by the Omo-Agege group include Dr Cairo Ojougboh; the 2019 APC governorship candidate, Chief Great Ogboru; former Speaker of the Delta State House of Assembly and Executive Director at NIMASA, Chief Victor Ochei; and the National Women Leader, Dr Mariam Alli.\n\nThe (factional) state Deputy Chairman of the anti-Omo-Agege faction, Hon. Elvis Ayomanor told THISDAY in Asaba that the national secretariat of the party Abuja has not confirmed Sobotie as the authentic chairman of the state chapter of the APC because the appropriate Oath of Office was not administered to him and his counterparts from other states.\n\nA factional chairman of the party in Rivers State, Golden Chioma, has also faulted the inauguration of the chairman of the faction loyal to the Minister of Transportation, Mr Rotimi Amaechi.\n\nChioma said what APC needed was an inclusive party and not a divisive party.\n\nThe APC chieftain told THISDAY that the party leadership at the national level ignored a faction to protect the interest of the other faction, stressing that one individual cannot continue to control party structure in the state.\n\nChioma who belongs to Senator Magnus Abe-led faction further urged the party leadership to avoid making the same mistake that led to the experience of 2019 where APC was removed from the electoral process over the internal crisis.\n\n\u201cWe are not asking for anything, but an inclusive party. The division in my APC in Rivers State is the oldest in the country.\n\n\u201cIf you remember, in 2019, the party did not present any candidate based on this same division. So, we need to do something different. We need to be more inclusive and not divisive,\u201d Chioma added.\n\nA faction of the APC in Anambra State led by the Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige, has also rejected the inauguration of Mr Basil Ejidike as the state chairman.\n\nThe state secretary of the party, Mr Chukwuma Agufugo, who belongs to Ngige\u2019s faction, has dismissed Ejidike\u2019s executive, saying it would not stand.\n\nAgufugo said Ejidike and his co-travellers have violated the order of the court, describing it as contempt, and vowed that they must pay for it.\n\nAlso, the factional Publicity Secretary, Mr Okelo Madukaife insisted that Ejidike and his executives remained rejected.\n\nHe said it was not true that the executives of the Anambra State chapter of the party had been inaugurated.\n\nHe said: \u201cOur dynamic chapter of APC congratulates the national leadership of our great party for the wisdom contained in the decision not to swear in anybody as Chairman of Anambra State chapter of All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\n\u201cThis noble decision validates the position of the mainstream of our party in Anambra State that 2018 officials remain in charge of our affairs until congresses can hold as leadership abhors a vacuum.\u201d\n\nIn Imo State, a faction of the APC led by Senator Rochas Okorocha said it would rely heavily on the ruling of the Appeal Court of November 6, 2020.\n\nThe chairman of the faction, Mr Dan Nwafor told THISDAY that the recognition of the Governor Hope Uzodimma\u2019s faction, which has Macdonald Ebere as chairman was contempt of court.\n\nA former Caretaker Committee Chairman of the party in Enugu State, Mr Ben Nwoye, has also argued that Mr Ude Agaballa, another factional chairman, who was inaugurated in Abuja, was not sworn in.\n\nIn an interview with THISDAY, Nwoye who said he monitored the inauguration, explained that the Senator Abdullahi Adamu-led reconciliation committee had listened to the complaints, reports, and petitions of aggrieved party members, adding that when Agballa\u2019s name was mentioned in Abuja, he was directed to go back because he did not win any congress.\n\nNwoye noted that Agballa was a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), who only came in August 2021 and expressed his interest to join the APC.\n\nThe Chairman of APC faction loyal to a former Governor of Ogun State Senator Ibikunle Amosun, Chief Derin Adebiyi, told THISDAY that his faction would hold a meeting to determine the next line of action.\n\nThe APC had sworn in Chief Yemi Sanusi, Chairman of a faction loyal to the state Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun.\n\nDeputy Chairman of the faction led by the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, in Kwara State, Hon. Sunday Oyebiyi told THISDAY that the inauguration of Prince Sunday Fagbemi was an exercise in futility, which would not take the party anywhere during the next elections.\n\n\u201cIt is a kangaroo outing that would not bring out the result to the party leadership both at the national secretariat and state chapter of APC.\n\n\u201cThe development shows that the national leadership of APC is unserious one and when the time comes, all of them will see it.\n\n\u201cI know it is not only in Kwara State but some other states where injustice is greatly pervaded by the governors over the control of the party and when the time comes, they will all see the outcome of their actions,\u201d he explained.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that in Kebbi State, a faction of the party led by Senator Adamu Aliero, representing Kebbi Central, which lost out during the inauguration, has vowed to resist the alleged imposition of party leadership in the state.\n\nA faction of the party loyal to the Minister of Interior, Mr Rauf Aregbesola, in Osun State, has also refused to recognise the new leadership of the party in the state.\n\nMeanwhile, efforts by the national caretaker committee led by Governor Mai Mala Buni to reconcile and put an end to the crisis rocking the Kano chapter of the party has hit another brick wall last week.\n\nTHISDAY investigation revealed that the peace meeting was the second in one week brokered at the instance of Buni-led APC to reach a compromise on the leadership of the APC in Kano.\n\nHowever, the peace meeting which was held on Friday night in Abuja ended in a stalemate as the leadership tussle rocking the Kano State chapter of the party continues.\n\nThe peace meeting could not resolve the leadership tussle as the Ibrahim Shekarau faction insisted that it should be accorded recognition having been pronounced as the valid leadership by a court judgment.\n\nInvestigation further revealed that efforts to prevail on the Shekarau faction already accorded recognition a court to accept the harmonisation deal by the Governor Abdullahi Ganduje faction was rebuffed by Shekarau\u2019s team.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Gowon, Jonathan, Boss Mustapha also present as former Head of ING is buried in Lagos\n\nOur Correspondents\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo yesterday described the former Head of Interim Government (ING) the late Ernest Shonekan as a man of destiny who was chosen for his time.\n\nSpeaking at the State funeral service, organised in honour of the departed national leader, held at the Cathedral Church of Christ, Marina, Lagos, Osinbajo said Shonekan proved by his life \u201cthat destiny for one or for a nation is the manifest result of small choices made every day by ordinary people doing the best they can and persevering in goodness.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President said Shonekan lived an extraordinary and selfless life while on earth and left a lesson behind for all Nigerians to follow.\n\n\u201cThat Chief Shonekan lived an extraordinary life is self-evident. His accomplishments as a businessman, political figure, and bridge builder are already the stuff of legend and will be talked about for generations. But perhaps what deserves greater attention is the way he carried himself through life and the high values he exemplified, that genuine respect he had for people of all classes, religion, tribe or gender.\n\n\u201cHis unflinching belief in the inherent goodness of everyone; his love and generosity not just to his family, but to all, the knowledge and experience driven leadership and counsel he provided, always with unfailing humility and courteousness, were all the unique virtues that underpinned his extraordinary achievements.\n\n\u201cErnest Shonekan leaves a life lesson for the nation he leaves behind. What might that be? We would be right to think of Ernest Shonekan as a man of destiny, a man chosen for his time.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo said what deserved great attention was the way Shonekan carried himself through life and the high values he exemplified during his time on earth.\n\nHe said that Shonekan had a genuine respect for all and would not be forgotten in the sands of time and history.\n\n\u201cHis love and generosity, not just to his family but to all, was felt by all. His counsels are always with unfailing humility and courteousness. These are unique virtues that underpinned his selflessness.\n\n\u201cChief Shonekan lived his life always conscious of, and motivated by a burden of duty, as a citizen of considerable privilege, to give back, either in his many philanthropic and civic pursuits or in public service.\n\n\u201cToday, we stand in the light of this great man. The inevitable transition of the people that we love gives us a sombre opportunity to look into the life that they led, and in that light, checkmate our own lives,\u201d Osinbajo said.\n\nSpeaking on his tenure as Head of ING, Osinbajo said: \u201cShonekan had a position in Nigeria that few had before him or have now. But none could have written the script of the dramatic series of occurrences that thrust upon him the role of the Head of State and Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Forces of Nigeria, in one of the most turbulent chapters of our nation\u2019s history and it became his lot to steer the ship of state in those extremely stormy waters.\n\n\u201cHe was in his own words compelled by a sense of duty and responsibility to accept the role and to give his best in shepherding his country through an experience unknown and unprecedented in our history.\n\n\u201cHe once said in an interview shortly after he was named Chairman of the Transitional Council and Head of Government, \u201cIf your country needs you, leave everything that you are doing to go and help.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of Shonekan\u2019s last days, the VP said: \u201cIn the last chapter of his life, Chief Shonekan assumed the mantle of an elder statesman. He was supportive of all governments and gave his advice far above the trenches of partisanship. He was consistently calm and dignified. He was a steady voice of national counsel to all who sought him out.\u201d\n\nDignitaries at the event include former Head of State, General Yakubu Gowon (retd.); former President Goodluck Jonathan; Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha; Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu; Ogun State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun; and Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki.\n\nAt the Ebony Vaults and Garden, Ikoyi, Lagos State, where Shonekan was interred, the Nigerian Army, 81 Division, honoured him with a 21-artillery-gun salute.\n\nShonekan died on January 11, aged 85. He served as Head of the ING from August 26, 1993 to November 17, 1993.\n\nNight of Tribute\n\nEarlier on Thursday night, President Muhammadu Buhari and other dignitaries paid tributes to Shonekan during A Night of Tributes in Lagos.\n\nBoss Mustapha represented the President at the event.\n\nBuhari said: \u201cChief Shonekan was a man I respect so much because of his passion for the development of Nigeria. He was a patriot and a father of the nation. I knew that at the time he was beckoned to lead the country, no faint-hearted man would do that. No man will offer himself as a sacrificial lamb in the manner of Chief Shonekan.\n\n\u201cAs a member of the Council of State, Chief Shonekan attended all meetings until his demise because of his passion to see Nigeria grow. In the last four years, there was hardly any state event that he was invited to that he ever missed.\n\n\u201cHe was a successful lawyer and businessman who rose through the ranks of UAC before he became the Head of Interim Government.\u201d\n\nThe Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, said Shonekan demonstrated leadership in every facet of life.\n\nHe said, \u201cHe was a respected industrialist, a first class boardroom guru. He was in his early 40s when he rose to become the Chairman of UAC. By this single deed, he became a role model to many Nigerians. He laid the foundation of many things we enjoy today.\n\n\u201cAfter reaching the zenith of his private sector life, faith made him the Head of the ING. It was a turbulent time in the life of our country. He led the country with all sense of courage and sacrifice.\n\n\u201cNigeria has indeed lost a true leader; he was a kind human being and his wealth of experience will be sorely missed. We will continue to cherish his memory.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Ogun State Governor, Mr. Dapo Abiodun, said Shonekan lived a life of humility.\n\n\u201cBaba\u2019s life and time are inspiring narratives of events and achievements. His transition has left a void and it is the end of an era. He was a colossus whose feat will be difficult to replicate.\n\n\u201cBeyond business, our nation remains grateful to him for his role during the trying periods. He was a loving husband, an embodiment of humility. His selfless service will be sorely missed,\u201d Abiodun said.\n\nHis brother, Chief Tunji Shonekan, described the deceased as a peacemaker, a family man and a core Egba man.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Peter Uzoho\n\nNigeria\u2019s daily power generation has fallen by an alarming 630 megawatts (MW) since Wednesday following a fire outbreak at Egbin Power Plant in Ikorodu, Lagos State and the resultant shut down of generation by the company.\n\nThis development, coupled with the load reduction mechanism adopted by the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) to prevent system collapse, has worsened the power supply situation in Lagos State. Electricity consumers in the state and its environs have been witnessing constant power outages for several weeks.\n\nEgbin Power had, in a statement issued to its stakeholders and the general public yesterday, reported the fire incident at its power plant on Wednesday, February 2, 2022, at about 4.20pm, leading to blackout in Lagos State.\n\nThe thermal plant has an installed capacity of 1,320MW consisting of six turbines of 220MW each, while its actual average generating capacity is about 800MW.\n\nEgbin said the fire outbreak was successfully contained by a team of its firefighters in collaboration with firefighters from the Nigeria Gas Company (NGC) in Egbin.\n\nThe company said it had set out a process to determine the cause of the fire incident as it had temporarily suspended its operations in line with the plant\u2019s safety procedures.\n\n\u201cEgbin has since activated its emergency response mechanism to determine the cause of the incident, while operations at the plant have been temporarily suspended in line with the plant\u2019s safety procedures. Egbin is also working with the Federal Fire Service, the Federal Ministry of Power and other stakeholders to review the incident,\u201d the management of the power plant said in the statement.\n\nConfirming the fire incident and its technical implications, TCN\u2019s spokesperson, Mrs. Ndidi Mba, told THISDAY yesterday that it had led to the removal of a total of 630MW from the national grid.\n\nMba said, \u201cWe know that there was a fire outbreak and the total generation of 630MW was removed from the grid because of that.\n\n\u201cYou know, when a fire outbreak happens, even if it doesn\u2019t affect the entire units, the tendency is that, to protect the other ones, you shut them down.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, as I said, 630mw was removed from the grid on that day (Wednesday).\u201d\n\nNigeria generates an average of 8,000mw of electricity daily, out of the installed 13,800mw capacity, transmits an average of 5,000mw, while distribution hovers between 3,000 and 2,500mw.\n\nMeanwhile, electricity consumers in Lagos and its environs have recently been witnessing constant power outages.\n\nThe two distribution companies serving Lagos \u2013 Ikeja Electric (IE) and Eko Electricity Distribution Company (EKEDC) -attributed the outages under their networks to a drop in power generation in the country.\n\nIn a recent statement for its customers, IE blamed the power outage experienced in certain parts of its network on load shedding by the TCN as a result of a drop in power generation.\n\nEKEDC had also attributed the reduction in supply to the drop in power generation from an average of 3,700MW to 2,000MW.\n\nThe Disco said this was caused by gas limitations arising from vandalism and more recently an issue affecting the TCN line from the Egbin Power Plant.\n\nExplaining the constant power outages in Lagos State in recent times, the TCN spokesperson stated that the state was a high consumption area and that the agency had to reduce the load to avoid overloading 330kv lines within the state and to achieve load balance.\n\nMeanwhile, Egbin has assured the public that its technical team is working assiduously to restore operations.\n\n\u201cAs the foremost power plant in the nation, Egbin remains committed to providing power innovatively and responsibly in compliance with good health, safety and environmental standards,\u201d she added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "US Identifies Bad Governance, Corruption as Motivations for Coups in Africa",
          "text": "Ahamefula Ogbu\n\nThe United States of America has condemned as unacceptable and out of vogue, any change of government in Africa except as constitutionally enshrined through elections and popular ballot as coups undermine democracy and development.\n\nThe US, apparently responding to the four recent coups in the continent, assured therefore that any regime which gains power through coups would not enjoy the support and recognition of the United States seen as the bastion of democracy.\n\nThis was disclosed by the Commander of the United States Africa Command, AFRICOM, General Stephen Townsend who while expressing surprise at the recent upsurge in spate of military coups in Africa, opined that bad governance and corruption may have been responsible for the putsches.\n\nIn the last 18 months, the military has seized power in Mali, Chad, Sudan and Burkina Faso.\n\nTownsend had in a virtual briefing on Thursday, where he took questions from journalists, explained that the United States frowns at irregular or unconstitutional change in government as they do not agree with their understanding of governance which has to be democratic and the free choice of the people.\n\nHe added that it was difficult to state emphatically why nearly after 20 years of democratic governance with low military interventions, there suddenly has been an upsurge.\n\n\u201cSo I don\u2019t know why all that is, but my guess is that it has to do with insufficient governance, a lack of good governance, and corruption. I think that\u2019s probably the most of it. And so as you know, as I said in my opening statement, the U.S. does not support or condone these unconstitutional changes of government and the broader effect they have on democracy and the progress of democracy. But I think that corruption and a lack of good governance is probably behind much of that,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe Africom Commander deflected insinuations that a contest of super powers for influence in Africa was responsible for the coups and insisted that neither China nor Russia was largely responsible for the coups except where Russia was mentioned in Sudan. Russia and China appear to be contending for influences in the continent.\n\nHe said, \u201cYou asked about the involvement of the Russians and the Chinese in these coups generally. We have not seen that \u2013 have not seen any involvement by the Chinese in any of these coups. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re doing that, furthering that or promoting those. With Russia, I think it\u2019s a little less clear. I think I have received reports of Russian involvement at least in Sudan in the not too distant past.\u201d\n\nOn the rising cases of violent crimes mostly tagged banditry by some governments, the AFRICOM boss said: \u201cSo I would use a different term. I think the term \u2018bandits\u2019 is the wrong term. That makes it sound like a criminal problem. And my assessment is what\u2019s expanding and causing the majority of the problem are terrorists. So I use a different term than bandits. Terrorists are expanding. We\u2019ve seen ISIS and al-Qaida affiliates expanding in West Africa from Mali into Burkina Faso, and now we\u2019re starting to see attacks in the neighbours of Ghana, Benin, Togo, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. So, I\u2019m very concerned about that.\u201d\n\nTownsend assured that collaboration by member countries in affiliation with the United States, added to consistent dialogue and information, as well as strategy sharing would yield better and faster results in taming the spread of terrorism.\n\nOn the rising influence of China in Africa and the concerns of the United States of America, he admitted that they were expanding into West Africa and the Gulf of Guinea where he suspects they want to have a naval base. He said they had some positive influences in development in the region but assured that where traps or exploitation of African partners were seen, they would raise the red flag.\n\nAccording to him, the plan to have a naval base in the Gulf of Guinea was to check piracy and illegal fishing but alleged that most of the illegal fishing activities were carried out by Chinese vessels.\n\n\u201cAnother topic that we discussed is China\u2019s role in the world. And they\u2019re a power on the rise, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019d begrudge them their ability to rise as a power in the world. But they also have a view to expand into Africa, particularly into West Africa and the Gulf of Guinea. And where they\u2019re \u2013 where they\u2019re helping African partners in a useful and positive way, I\u2019m happy to see that and happy to see our African partners benefit from that.\n\n\u201cBut where they\u2019re exploiting our African partners, I think we ought to shine a spotlight on that. And there are some places where that is going on. And one area that concerns me is the Gulf of Guinea. The Chinese, I think, aspire to have a naval base in that area. And I think they aspire to have a maritime task force in that area, all for the purpose of preventing piracy and illegal fishing. But all the studies that I have seen say that the number one purveyor of illegal fishing in the Gulf of Guinea are Chinese fishing fleets. So, I think we ought to keep shining a spotlight on that kind of unhelpful involvement in the African continent,\u201d he explained.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "An Abuja multi-billion-naira International Cancer Centre (ICC) is yet to take off 12 years after the project was established.\n\n\n\nMrs Turai Yar\u2019Adua, the wife of the late former president, Umaru Yar\u2019Adua, was the brains behind the establishment of the centre that is located on Nnamdi Azikiwe Airport Road in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nIt was said that her aim was to build a cancer centre in the nation\u2019s capital that would cater for people, especially the poor.\n\n\n\nThe project was designed to be fully private driven and meant to provide comprehensive cancer diagnosis, management, treatment and care, as well as promote excellence in cancer education, training and research.\n\n\n\nHowever, funds were raised for the project on July 18, 2009, in Abuja, where financial pledges were made by the rich and powerful to actualise her dream amounting to N6.8 billion, hence the ICC was born.\n\n\n\nTwelve years after, the centre has been abandoned, with the multi-billion-naira equipment and mini-buses already procured for the project rusting away, The Guardian reports.\n\n\n\nIt was learnt that no fewer than 200 mini-buses parked at the open space in the middle of the compound were moved to a hidden side of the premises.\n\n\n\nThe Guardian reports that there was no sign of activity there except one white utility vehicle, Hilux, seen driving into the facility when the location was visited.\n\n\n\nThe entrance gate was said to be locked, noting that it took several knocks before a policeman guarding the place opened to find out who the visitor was and what their mission was.\n\n\n\nAfter exchanging greetings, the correspondent told the officer that she was there to find out whether the centre was already accepting patients and would like to see any of the staff who could provide information on procedures for booking an appointment, to which the policeman replied: \u201cOh, they have not started, but I believe they will start soon.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Guardian gathered that the centre\u2019s inability to take off is a concern, not only to Nigerians but also to the government.\n\n\n\nThe report also revealed that the Federal Ministry of Health had reached out to the former First Lady through the Director-General that would be in charge of the facility to have a meeting with her but the plan never worked out.\n\n\n\nA reliable source close to the health ministry who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: \u201cWe were made to understand that the centre belongs to her NGO. At a point, the government tried to get across to her but it didn\u2019t work out. Even now, the legal department has been directed to find out how she acquired the land and whom the land was allocated to, let\u2019s start from the basis.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe raised a memo, we want to know about the land allocation but it seems they are having problems sorting it out. Even the Abuja Geographic Information Systems (AGIS) couldn\u2019t verify the land too. The concern has been coming from the public on why the centre has not become fully functional. Most Nigerians think it belongs to the Federal Government.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn September 2017, the former First Lady had told Nigerian students in Uganda, led by their president, Mubarak Yahaya Adamu, who presented her with a merit award, that the cancer centre had not commenced operations because those who made big financial pledges during its fundraising absconded after the death of her husband.\n\n\n\nShe said: \u201cBefore my husband died, I intended to have a hospital. We had a launching, some people made pledges but after my husband died, they just vanished.

          "text": "BY SAMAD UTHMAN AND JAMES OJO\n\nMany Nigerians were dumbfounded on January 29, 2022, when Majekodunmi Balogun, a 20-year-old, confessed that he killed Sofiat Kehinde, an 18-year-old girl, for money ritual.\n\nBalogun was arrested and grilled alongside three other suspect-teenagers: Wariz Oladeinde (17), Lukman Gafar (19), and Soliu Majekodunmi (18) \u2014 the boyfriend of the deceased.\n\nDuring interrogation at the Ogun state police command headquarters, Balogun said they got tips on money ritual from a Facebook group.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said he typed \u2018how to make money ritual\u2019 on Facebook, and the result of his search instructed him to behead and burn a female skull in a local pot.\n\n\u201cI screenshot the steps for doing money rituals on Facebook. I saw the steps on a Facebook page. They usually post the steps in the group. I don\u2019t know who created the group,\u201d he had said.\n\nThe development had elicited varied reactions and heated debates on social media platforms about the brash quest for money by the youths.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTHE QUEST FOR QUICK WEALTH\n\nCybercrime, popularly called \u2018yahoo yahoo\u2019, is a common phenomenon among youths in Nigeria \u2014 adjudged to be the poverty capital of the world.\n\n\u2018Yahoo boys\u2019, as they are called, rely on their computer dexterity to victimise unsuspecting persons in cyberspace. In some cases, they go a step further to indulge in \u2018yahoo plus\u2019 \u2014 another dimension of cybercrime that involves using traditional charms and mystical powers to swindle victims.\n\nWhile the practice is strongly condemned by religious groups and several stakeholders, it has been a major societal ill in Nigeria for years. Quite recently, a video of three teenagers searching for where to learn internet fraud in Edo state surfaced online.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Sofiat\u2019s death further reawakened conversation around the menace, TheCable sought to establish the veracity of Majekodunmi\u2019s claim of getting tips on Facebook. Using the same keywords as the suspect, TheCable found several public Facebook groups \u2014 with thousands of followers \u2014 offering tips on cybercrime and money ritual.\n\nOne of the groups is named \u2018Ogun omo Yahoo to confirm\u2018 \u2014 which in English means \u2018authentic charms for Yahoo boys\u2019. The group has over 48,000 members while a similar group has a membership of over 38,000. Some of the groups can be found here, here, here, and here.\n\nTheCable\u2019s reporter joined a group named \u2018Ogun Owo ati osole todaju\u2019 \u2014 and one of the latest posts was by a certain Ogunlana Babolosanin Osanin Gbemi who was advertising a charm that he claims attracts good fortune. He shared his phone number \u2014 08169396780 \u2014 asking interested persons to call him for a private discussion.\n\nOgunlana boasted of his craft, claiming that he had prepared the charm for over 10 persons who confirmed the efficacy. Ogunlana \u2014 who claimed one could make N500,000 weekly with his charm \u2014 sounded like an expert.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDisguising as a potential \u2018yahoo\u2019 boy, TheCable\u2019s reporter put a call across to him and the first question he asked was: \u201cDo you want to tie down a particular client or the one that would bring you clients?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOgunlana: Do you want the one of N500,000 weekly?\n\nTheCable\u2019s reporter: Yes sir.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOgunlana: How old are you? Because we mustn\u2019t do it for those below the age of 20.\n\nTheCable\u2019s reporter: 25 years sir.\n\nOgunlana later told the reporter to call out his mother\u2019s name so as to determine if he is destined to attain wealth through the charm.\n\n\u201cThe first step is to drop, your name and that of your mother\u2026 with that, we will establish if you\u2019re destined to succeed through that or not,\u201d Ogunlana calmly explained.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not like others, all you need to drop for now is N2,000 for Schnapps (dry gin) which I\u2019ll use to appease the gods. That first step is key, I don\u2019t just use drop the charm for anyone.\u201d\n\nAt this point, TheCable\u2019s reporter decided to pull out of the conversation after obtaining sufficient information.\n\nMOTHER\u2019S MAIDEN NAME, PAY BEFORE SERVICE\u2026 THE \u2018MONEY-MAKING PROCESS\u2019\n\nTheCable also made efforts to contact the numbers on other pages discovered offering charms \u2014 and from conversations with two self-acclaimed Babalawos (herbalists), it was discovered that there is a template they follow.\n\nFirst, they ask for the maiden name of the client\u2019s mother, after which they will request the payment of a certain amount of money. Subsequently, they will ask the client to pick up the prepared \u2018package\u2019 physically.\n\nBabawoifayemi Ifayemi took TheCable reporter through the process of using a luck/success-eliciting soap.\n\n\u201cThe soap you\u2019re talking about, you\u2019ll bathe with it every morning while you\u2019re pressing your phone,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs you\u2019re doing that, anyone that sees your picture online \u2014 either a white man black, just initiate a conversation with them and ask them whatever you want from them and they will do them spontaneously.\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re done preparing the soap, you\u2019ll also need to prepare another batch. What you requested for is usually a two-in-one package.\u201d\n\n\u2018HUMAN SACRIFICE DOESN\u2019T BRING MONEY\u2019\n\nCommenting on the phenomenon of money ritual, Baba Adigun Olosun, an Ifa priest and Olosun of Osogbo land, said the use of human body parts for sacrifice does not directly result in wealth.\n\nThe herbalist spoke on Thursday when he featured on TheCable\u2019s Twitter Space which had over 8,000 listeners.\n\nThe Ifa priest said the idea of using human parts for money ritual is alien to Yoruba tradition.\n\n\u201cUsing human part for money is imported to Yoruba tradition from Cotonou. Though there are spiritual powers that mandate you using bones of the dead,\u201d he said.\n\nFACEBOOK \u2018URGENTLY INVESTIGATING\u2019 THE GROUPS\n\nOn February 3, 2022, TheCable reached out to Facebook to ascertain efforts taken to de-platform groups offering charms and money ritual services.\n\nMeta, the parent company of Facebook, said the organisation is appalled by TheCable\u2019s findings and promised to investigate the pages \u201cwith urgency\u201d.\n\nThe company said it has \u201ccommunity standards which set out what is and isn\u2019t allowed on Facebook, and we remove anything that violates them as soon as we become aware of it. These standards include strict rules on inciting or facilitating violence, and coordinating harm\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are investigating these groups as a matter of urgency and will remove any content that violates our rules,\u201d the statement added.\n\nThe company also said it has removed some of the groups identified by TheCable.\n\n\u201cThese standards include strict rules around fraud and deception, and in this specific case we have taken action and removed a number of these groups for violating this policy, and will continue to investigate as a matter of urgency,\u201d the company said.\n\nFurther checks by TheCable, however, revealed that some of the pages are still active.",

          "text": "For Africans, sports \u2014 and football in particular \u2014 represent a sort of common ground. It is a leveller that does not consider social standing or status. During the 90 minutes of a football match, everyone becomes the same: a supporter. This is what to expect on Sunday evening as the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) comes down to the last two teams in Yaounde, Cameroon.\n\nHaving weathered storms and surmounted encumbrances to get to this point, Senegal and Egypt are set to face off to decide who wears the African crown \u2014 and enjoys bragging rights \u2014 for the next couple of years.\n\nTo several pundits, Senegal seem like the favourites, given the country\u2019s golden generation of players like Sadio Mane, Kalidou Koulibaly, Edouard Mendy, Idrissa Gueye and Ismaila Sarr. They are expected to make an impact at the international level \u2014 and winning their first AFCON title is the start.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut expectations don\u2019t always graduate into reality and their journey to this point hasn\u2019t been smooth sailing.\n\nTHE LIONS\u2019 JOURNEY TO THE FINAL\n\nThe Teranga Lions had to pick a hard-earned 1-0 victory over a determined Zimbabwe side in their opening game on January 10, with Mane opening his account with a last-gasp penalty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite failing to win their final two group games, where they were held to consecutive goalless draws by Guinea and Malawi, Aliou Cisse\u2019s men finished atop Group B and secured a place in the knockout stages.\n\nAfter their somewhat unconvincing group stage run, Senegal found their magic touch in the round of 16 as they put two past Cape Verde on January 25, courtesy of second-half goals from Mane and Ahmadou Bamba Dieng.\n\nCisse\u2019s side continued their sensational run in the quarter-finals where they claimed a comprehensive 3-1 victory over Equatorial Guinea at the Ahmadou Ahidjo Stadium to set up a last-four clash with Burkina Faso on January 2.\n\nWith confidence and belief high in the Senegalese camp, Abdou Diallo and Dieng scored in a six-minute spell as they placed one foot firmly in the final, and after Ibrahim Blati Toure pulled one back in the 82nd minute, Mane stepped up to restore his side\u2019s two-goal advantage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHOW DO THE PHARAOHS STAND?\n\nThe Pharaohs were unexpectedly humbled in their opening game on January 11, when they suffered a 1-0 loss at the hands of the Super Eagles of Nigeria, courtesy of Kelechi Iheanacho\u2019s 30th-minute strike.\n\nEgypt got their campaign up and running four days later, when they secured a hard-earned 1-0 victory over a dogged Guinea-Bissau side before wrapping things up in the group stage with another 1-0 win over Sudan on January 19.\n\nFinishing as runners-up in Group D with six points from the nine available, the North Africans progressed to the last 16 where they saw off tournament favourites Ivory Coast on penalties, following a goalless 120 minutes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEgypt delivered a performance of the highest quality in the quarter-finals when they locked horns with regional rivals Morocco on January 30, as Salah scored in the 53rd minute to cancel out Sofiane Boufal\u2019s seventh-minute penalty and force extra time, during which Trezeguet came up with a 100th-minute winner.\n\nThe Pharaohs then stunned tournament hosts Cameroon when they claimed a 3-1 victory on penalties to secure a place in the final following a goalless 120 minutes at the Paul Biya Stadium.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoing into the final, the Egyptians are chasing a record-extending eighth African crown and Carlos Queiroz has the likes of Mohamed Salah, Trezeguet, Mohamed Abdelmoneim, and Mohamed Elneny in his arsenal.\n\nWHO\u2019S YOUR MONEY ON?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn paper, Senegal has the stronger squad, hence Egypt will go into the game with a few betting on them, but surely, finals are a different kettle of fish, where desire sometimes trumps talent and preparation.\n\nFor the people of Senegal and Egypt, it will definitely be a tense day and a nerve-wracking 90 minutes.\n\nBut for the neutrals, it is much more than that. It is an entertainment buffet and an escape. One that breaks away from social, economical and political barriers \u2014 an hour and a half of equality, something many Africans have never felt.\n\nAt the final whistle, a winner will be crowned \u2014 but will it be the best team or that which desires it more?",

          "title": "Saudi Arabia: A new home for Nigerian startups?",
          "text": "For Nigerians who want to start or already run their businesses, there\u2019s a constant concern about access to supporting infrastructure, funding, and talent. These concerns are the primary causes of high failure among startups on the continent.\n\nThe startup failure rate in Nigeria reportedly stood at 61% in 2021, meaning only 39% survive. This is similar across Africa where startup failure rates range from 75% in Ethiopia and 74% in Ghana to 58.3% in Senegal and 58.7% in Kenya.\n\nIn a bid to increase the success rate and accelerate the transition to a digital economy, the Saudi Arabian government is partnering with Nigerian authorities to provide Nigerian entrepreneurs with expedited entry and support via Digital Cooperation Organization (DCO) Startup Passport.\n\nThe Startup Passport initiative, which will ultimately be between the 8-member DCO countries, rolled out initially in Saudi Arabia and Nigeria. This announcement implies that Nigerian startups building products that primarily serve the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region are invited to build their companies from Saudi Arabia with support from the government.\n\nThis initiative was launched at LEAP, a global event for future technologies being held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, from February 1 to 3 and attended by leading technology corporations, global start-up pioneers, and venture capitalists.\n\nFaris AlSaqabi, Saudi Deputy Minister for Future Jobs and Capabilities, explained that the bond between Saudi Arabia and Nigeria is fueled by the country\u2019s movement to a digital economy.\n\n\u201cNigeria is one of the key players in the digital economy. We\u2019ve noticed you cannot do it alone, so we have to partner with other countries.\u201d\n\nAt LEAP, \u201cThe Garage\u201d, a world-class innovation hub to support emerging and disruptive technology-based startups was also announced. The name is inspired by the origin stories of many of the world\u2019s top tech companies that famously started from inside garages.\n\nAlongside other business leaders who were present at the event, Nigerian Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Pantami; Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Communications Commission, Umar Danbatta, and other delegates were attendees.\n\nNigerian Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Pantami in conversation with a representative of the Digital Cooperation Organization. Source: DCO\n\n\u201cOne lesson we can pick from Saudi Arabia\u2019s success is that we should take away the word impossible. We should be optimistic about any plans we have for transforming Nigeria,\u201d Pantami told TechCabal. \u201cWhoever comes to Saudi for the first time after some years and sees the changes will appreciate what\u2019s going on in the digital economy. Their institutions are no longer obsolete. They\u2019re not just advanced but proactive.\u201d\n\nHe further said that his presence at the conference is to connect with potential investors, government officials, tech giants, and even startups. \u201cWe\u2019ve been having a series of meetings with investors on how they can come to Nigeria and invest. Some of the global tech giants are willing to come to Nigeria and establish their manufacturing plants.\u201d\n\nPantami pointed out that Nigeria\u2019s large economy, youthful population, and its exit from the recent recession are some reasons why investors are excited about the country, despite there also being a few areas to improve on.\n\n\u201cThe first meeting I had, they were surprised that Nigeria has 6 successful unicorns and still many are coming. The fastest-growing economy is the digital sector, which played a pivotal role in exiting the country out of recession.\u201d\n\nAlongside the Nigerian delegation, Domineum, Tanadi, Rice Afrika and 7 other Nigerian startups were also present at the event.\n\nAll roads lead to Vision 2030\n\nSo far, investments worth about $10 billion in technology and startups were announced at LEAP.\n\nThe investments and initiatives include the launch of Aramco Venture\u2019s Prosperity7 fund with $1 billion, and a billion dollar investment from NEOM Tech & Digital Company with a focus on future technologies. The Saudi Telecom Company announced MENA HUB, a $1 billion investment in regional connectivity and infrastructure.\n\nIgnite, a $1.1 billion investment targeted at the creative industry, was also launched. This new program is expected to transform Saudi Arabia into a leading digital entertainment and media production hub.\n\nTo provide better internet service, WiFi 6E was launched, supported by the largest amount of spectrum available for WiFi of any country worldwide. This is accompanied by other connectivity-boosting initiatives, including the first regional trial of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite technology to extend reliable coverage to remote areas of the Kingdom.\n\nThese announcements are all connected to Saudi Arabia\u2019s Vision 2030, a drive to reduce dependence on oil and diversify its economy.\n\nSince the drive to achieve the Vision 2030 began in 2016, there\u2019s been considerable changes in Saudi Arabia, notably the liberalisation of its entertainment sector, provision of tourism visas and relaxing its rules for tourists as well as lifting the ban for women to drive in 2018\u2014the last country in the world to do so.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thinking about the emerging technologies and the future of jobs for our people because soon millions of current jobs will be replaced by technology,\u201d AlSaqabi said. \u201cThis means we\u2019ll lose millions of dollars if we don\u2019t adopt emerging technologies. There is no excuse to wait for the future to come, we have to go to it.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "TechCabal is surging ahead in 2022 and beyond \ud83d\ude80",
          "text": "Hello everyone, welcome to February.\n\nYou probably already know this \u2014 because we\u2019ve mentioned it a few times \u2014 but TechCabal started off in a small room in Lagos many years ago. 2013 to be specific. It is safe to say that, nearly 9 years later, TechCabal has grown to become much more than a predictable technology blog or website. We\u2019ve gone from reviewing gadgets to talking to Meta\u2019s VP MEA and Turkey about facebook\u2019s plans to transition into the metaverse. We are still optimistic about Nigerian founders and the Nigerian tech ecosystem. Still, we\u2019ve covered high-impact entrepreneurs from other regions like Sudan, Egypt, Morocco, Senegal, and The Gambia in the last two years.\n\nAnd we have no plans of slowing down. This year, we are hyper-focused on fine-tuning our editorial standards and establishing TechCabal as one of Africa\u2019s most reputable technology and media publication. We will lead compelling conversations on hot-button topics such as decentralized communities, digital nomads, remote work, talent migration, and the new internet. Furthermore, expect us to spotlight more African founders innovating around draconian policies, internet shutdowns, and social media bans. Our coverage will expand into lesser-known regions, cities, and startup hubs.\n\nFor us, 2022 is about executing our goals, delighting our readers, and putting Africa\u2019s technology ecosystem on the global stage. We hope we can count on you to support us along the way.\n\nWhat is new?\n\nAdegoke \u201cGoke\u201d Oyeniyi is no longer TechCabal\u2019s editor-in-chief and has moved on to pursue some personal goals and interests. Goke joined the newsroom in January 2021 and hit the ground running almost immediately. He provided high-level oversight of TechCabal\u2019s objectives, worked closely with our senior reporters, and drove editorial training weekly. He also contributed some well-researched articles to the newsroom; read his insight into rising Nigerian fintech startup, TeamApt.\n\nFollowing Goke\u2019s exit from the newsroom, I am stepping up to become TechCabal\u2019s acting editor-in-chief, reporting directly to Tomiwa Aladekomo, CEO, Big Cabal Media. My new role comes with many responsibilities, but I am motivated by my team and goals this year. I also know I have the full support of Big Cabal Media\u2019s leadership team and the entire organization.\n\nAbraham Augustine is the most recent addition to our newsroom. He resumed on January 17th as a senior reporter. Abraham is a growth marketing specialist and creator who operates at the intersection of growth, marketing & startup enablement in Africa. Abraham manages a Substack newsletter called Money Myths Africa.\n\nWhat has changed?\n\nLast year, we brought in our first East Africa correspondent. Alexandria Williams joined the newsroom as a remote contract reporter. She wrote about Uber\u2019s showdown against Kenya\u2019s high court and a Kenyan comedian\u2019s rise to digital fame during her time with us. Alexandria was accepted into one of DW\u2019s journalism traineeship programs in December, so she will not be continuing as our East Africa reporter this year.\n\nFor your information:\n\nKelechi Njoku joined the newsroom as senior editor in November 2021. He\u2019s an experienced editor with a literary and fine arts background. One of his most significant achievements was fine-tuning TechCabal\u2019s style guide.\n\nMuyiwa Olowogboyega joined Lemonade Finance as their content manager in October 2021. He was a senior staff writer at TechCabal for 1 year and 8 months. Muyiwa co-authored TC Daily with Daniel Adeyemi.\n\nAlexander Onukwue joined Quartz Africa as their West Africa correspondent. He was a staff writer at TechCabal for almost 2 years. He also wrote TechCabal\u2019s Next Wave newsletter for an extended period.\n\nStorytelling and coverage (TechCabal 3.0)\n\nOn storytelling and reporting, TechCabal is still committed to capturing the players, human impact and business of technology on the continent. We are even more dedicated to covering more regions, including North Africa, South Africa, and francophone Africa. TechCabal Insights team will continue to provide up-to-date content, reports, data, events, and context to help the world understand how technology is changing Africa. We will publish deep dives on cryptocurrency, the metaverse, DAOs, decentralization, policy, regulation, and big tech operators in Africa.\n\nWhat is coming soon?\n\nNewsletters\n\nTechCabal has plans to launch some new newsletter products. Sadly, we cannot reveal the details, but keep your eyes peeled for more information in TC Daily or Next Wave.\n\nFlagships\n\nKelechi Njoku will revive My Life in Tech (MLIT) in the coming weeks. MLIT is a flagship launched by Kay Uguwede, a former TechCabal staff writer. After Kay\u2019s exit from the newsroom, Edwin Madu took over MLIT during his time as senior editor in the newsroom. He is currently Zikoko\u2019s editor-in-chief.\n\nSultan Quadri and Timi Odueso will revive Digital Nomads by the end of February this year. Digital Nomads was launched and exclusively written by Olumuyiwa, a former senior staff writer at TechCabal.\n\nExtra hands\n\nIn 2022, we will recruit senior editors, reporters, and regional correspondents. In addition, we will report on more countries outside Nigeria, Ghana, and West Africa. Nigeria has quickly become the poster child for fast-growing startups and the top recipient of foreign investments. But Kenya, Egypt, and South Africa are following closely behind. Egypt is home to the most accelerated startups and founders on the continent. By bringing in analytical thinkers and on-the-ground reporters, we\u2019ll be able to tell more compelling stories about the impact of technology in these newer regions.\n\nThank you!\n\nWell, that\u2019s about it from the newsroom. As always, we are immensely grateful for supporting and betting on us through the years. Thank you for falling in love with our newsletters, reviews, flagships, columns, tweets, and contributions. We hope to delight you even more in 2022 and beyond.\n\nTechCabal is a pan-Africa media and technology publication. We cover the human impact of technology in Africa and how innovation is changing the business landscape on the continent. Our current coverage areas include West, East, and North Africa.\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Facebook. Say hello, and we\u2019ll share a fun article with you \ud83d\ude04\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Detty December: New data identifies Lekki Phase 1 as Lagos\u2019s COVID-19 hotspot",
          "text": "Adaobi* is a 24-year-old software engineer living with her 49-year-old mother Oge* at Lekki Phase 1, in Lagos, Nigeria. On the morning of January 1 this year, she complained of a sore throat and took some Strepsils for it. By the next morning, however, her sore throat got worse\u2014and her mother began to feel an itch in hers as well.\n\nBoth women went to the hospital and there tested positive for COVID-19. They were then placed on medication and advised to self-isolate. Now, their gateman Bosun*, who must have caught the virus from them, thought he had malaria and got on antimalarial medications. But, after a week, his symptoms persisted, so he decided to switch medicines to honey, ginger, and turmeric mixed in hot water, as advised by a friend.\n\nAccording to the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Nigeria entered the 4th wave of COVID-19 in December, reporting 223,887 cases and 2,985 deaths in its 36 states and federal capital Abuja. This is an over-500% increase.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe surge in COVID-19 cases during the December festive period may be attributed to 2 major factors: the mass of unquarantined people that came into Nigeria from abroad, especially into Lagos; and the several crowded gatherings where social distancing practices were not observed.\n\nIn the case of Adaobi and her mother, Adaobi had attended several crowded outdoor activities in December and her mother had just returned from a business trip in Europe, so it\u2019s difficult to determine who infected who.\n\nLike Bosun, many Nigerians are ignorant of the symptoms of COVID-19. On top of that, many people do not see a doctor whenever they feel sick, preferring instead to self-medicate, with the belief that they have \u201cordinary malaria\u201d. This is what\u2019s currently happening in Lagos and, according to Remedial Health, a healthtech startup that improves access to original medicines by creating a direct supply chain between retailers and manufacturers or registered distributors, Lekki Phase 1\u2014one of the highbrow areas of Lagos\u2014is at the center of it all.\n\nRemedial Health founder and CEO, Samuel Okwuada, told TechCabal over a call that their company saw a 250% increase in orders for anti-malarial drugs in December last year from pharmacies and chemists in Lekki Phase 1.\n\n\u201cIt started around November but peaked in December. We noticed that customers in Lekki Phase 1 that would normally order 20 packs of antimalarial drugs for sale within 3\u20134 days were now ordering 60\u201370 packs every 1\u20132 days,\u201d said Okwuada. \u201cWhen we asked the manufacturers for more products and they told us they\u2019d reached their production limit, we realised this is more serious than we thought.\u201d\n\nDrugs like Artemether & Lumefantrine and Vitamin C saw about 250% and 130% increase, respectively, in demand. This continual spike in demand of antimalarial drugs\u2014which is still happening\u2014led Remedial Health to investigate the cause. Their conversations with pharmacists on the frontline suggests that some of the symptoms reported by customers are more consistent with COVID-19 than malaria.\n\n\n\n\n\nA sore throat is not indicative of malaria but it is one of the major symptoms of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cThe number of COVID-19 cases in Lekki is overwhelming. When these people come to the clinic, they always complain of malaria but test positive for COVID-19,\u201d said a lab scientist who works at a testing centre in Lekki and who spoke to TechCabal anonymously.\n\nAnother resident of Lekki Phase 1 jokingly said he suspects everybody in Lekki has the virus already. \u201cThat\u2019s an old story now. It\u2019s just another malaria symptom,\u201d he said.\n\nThe importance of data in combating the virus\n\nIt\u2019s no more news that healthcare institutions around the globe are using data to design better pandemic responses and train frontline staff. Without appropriate data, misinformation and conspiracy theories about the virus will flood the media and undermine efforts to sensitise the public.\n\nThe World Health Organisation\u2019s director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, once said, \u201cWe\u2019re not just fighting a pandemic; we\u2019re fighting an infodemic.\u201d\n\nGovernments across the world are using data to drive COVID-19 innovation to mend the economic stress, misinformation, and division the virus has unleashed on the world. In Nigeria, the Global Partnership UNECA worked with the country\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) to create a comprehensive data hub to show where cases of COVID-19 were occurring and what support might be needed.\n\nIn Togo, the government is using artificial intelligence, via GiveDirect-Novissi COVID-19 Aid, to collect and collate data of the poorest communities in order to provide them with contactless financial aid through mobile money.\n\nAccording to a Reuter data, COVID-19 infections are decreasing in Nigeria, with 94 new infections reported on average each day. That\u2019s 5% of the peak\u2014the highest daily average reported on December 27. Okwuada, the lab scientist and some Lekki residents that spoke to TechCabal believes that these numbers are underreported and that is evident from the case of people like Bosun. Where\u2019s their own number? However, even though data is not a direct antidote to the virus and not always correct, Okwuada believes it\u2019s a strong fighting instrument. He said data is essential to curbing the spread of the virus and, possibly, ending the disease altogether.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAfrobeats is the movement; it\u2019s the underdog, a mongrel that had no home and somehow, has managed to use global platforms to manoeuvre and invade the world with that melody that comes from our music.\u201d \u2014 Obi Asika.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObi Asika, Founder of Storm 360 Records and Co-founder of Social Media Week Lagos\n\nThere is no doubt that African music, especially Afrobeats \u2014 the melting pot of West African music styles blended with American Jazz \u2014 has gone global. It has become a norm to see non-Africans identifying with Afrobeats and enjoying the African rhythm.\n\nHowever, it didn\u2019t happen overnight. With the help of media companies focused on music and the Internet, Afrobeats has travelled across the globe as an internationally recognised sound.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoey Akan, Founder and CEO Afrobeat Intelligence. Moderator of the Afrobeats session\n\nTechnology has played an outstanding role in the popularity of Afrobeats. From tools that create the melody Obi Asika describes as the \u2018sweet spot\u2019 to the platforms that have pushed those melodies across hemispheres and into the hearts of people with no ties with Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe early days\n\nObi Asika has been in the Nigerian music industry for several decades; he has watched the industry mature from the homeless mongrel to the behemoth that it is now. He is the Founder of Storm 360 Records and Co-founder of Social Media Week Lagos, one of the most significant new media and technology conferences in Africa.\n\nSpeaking at Techpoint Build 2021, during the panel session themed: Afrobeats to the World: Nigerian Domination, Asika explained the journey of Afrobeats from the beginning to where it is now and the opportunities that artistes and everyone in the music business should be leveraging.\n\n\u201cI remember then when you tell people in the West, \u2018I\u2019ve got some guys in Lagos that can rap better than anyone in the world,\u2019 they\u2019ll look at you like you\u2019re mad and ask who is interested in whatever young Africans have to say or do?\u201d Asika said.\n\nAccording to him, people in the West imagined Afrobeats as traditional music. Still, the sound has evolved through the years, retaining its African origins while mixed with sounds from different parts of the world.\n\nAmerican online education platform, MasterClass, traces the history of Afrobeats to the early 20th Century when Ghanaian musicians merged West African regional music with Western Jazz and Calypso to create highlife music. This was then fused with Western influences to create Afrobeats.\n\nAfrobeats continued to evolve, but its power was still unknown, not just to the West but to the Africans wielding it. A problem, Asika said, was solved by Channel O, a South Africa-based music channel.\n\n\u201cIn the mid-90s, young Africans were seeing people that looked like them on Channel O, doing amazing things. That generated a spur of energy for the next decade.\u201d\n\nAfter Channel O opened the eyes of Africans and the world of what was possible with Afrobeats, MTV Base Africa, a 24-hour music channel, continued the spur of energy. Social media took on from there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMTV Base Africa changed the level in terms of quality. By the late 2000s, we had Myspace, then Facebook, followed by YouTube,\u201d Asika noted.\n\nMusic streaming platforms changed everything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddy Awofisayo, Head of Music, Sub-Saharan Africa at YouTube,\n\nAddy Awofisayo, Head of Music, Sub-Saharan Africa at YouTube, agreed with Asika on how these platforms have helped Afrobeats.\n\nShe said, \u201cWhen people ask me the reason why Afrobeats is going global, I say it\u2019s the platforms. Not just YouTube, but Spotify, Apple Music, and TikTok.\n\n\u201cBack in the days, if you didn\u2019t live in Nigeria and wanted to listen to 2Face, you\u2019d need someone from Nigeria to bring you a CD. But now, you just go on YouTube and search for it.\u201d\n\nAwofisayo also added that platforms such as hers \u2014 YouTube \u2014 try to create initiatives that can amplify the voices and talents created in Africa. An example is Foundry, a programme that helps artistes grow their presence on YouTube and \u201cbreak them outside of their market.\u201d\n\nHowever, artistes are not the only ones who need support. Awofisayo pointed out that \u201cfor an artiste to be successful, they need an army of people around them. A great producer, songwriter and manager.\u201d\n\nIn light of this, YouTube also created a programme to support songwriters and producers. It was through this program Awofisayo got to know P.Priime, the producer behind the hit song, Infinity.\n\nThe importance of music platforms can also be exemplified through the amount of money they generate. Streaming services, for example, generated about $300 million for African artistes in 2021. This number is estimated to reach $500 million by 2025.\n\nWhile Asika believes that several platforms played a significant role in making Afrobeats go global, the talents that create the music play the biggest part.\n\n\u201cThat melody from our music is what drives everything!\u201d\n\nThe future of Afrobeats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictor Okpala. Spotify\u2019s West African Artist and Label Partnerships Manager\n\nSeeing music beyond art but as a product is what Victor Okpala, Spotify\u2019s West African Artist and Label Partnerships Manager, projects for African and Nigerian music.\n\n\u201cMusic is not just art; it\u2019s a product. It goes through a life-cycle as most products.\u201d\n\nThe reason Okpala wants music to be seen as a product is to see more investors coming into the space. Despite the growth that has been seen in the Nigerian music industry, there are still a lot of issues when it comes to funding.\n\nAccording to Okpala, the cost of producing high-quality videos is skyrocketing, and as Nigerian music goes global, it has to deliver world-class content. As it becomes increasingly challenging to create content that can compete internationally, we \u201cneed people to come into the space and fund the product called music.\u201d\n\nFor Henry Cocobassey, a Nigerian music executive and NFT collector, the future of Afrobeats is on the blockchain. Cocobassey told a story of how he collaborated with a Nigerian music artist, Challex D\u2019 Boss, to sell 10 thousand copies of minted non-fungible token (NFT) music in two weeks.\n\nHe said NFTs are like \u201ca new revolution where the artiste isn\u2019t the only one earning money off music but the fans too.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHenry Cocobassey is a Nigerian music executive, NFT collector, and CEO of Unique Sirius.\n\nThis is only the beginning\n\nWith a 51.44% Internet penetration rate in Nigeria, Awofisayo believes Afrobeats has barely begun to scratch the surface of what it is capable of.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot more people out there that are not able to access the Internet and able to consume music on platforms like YouTube and Spotify,\u201d Awofisayo submitted.\n\n\u201cOnce we see the Internet no longer becoming a barrier, we\u2019re truly going to see how African music will blow up. Though we\u2019re going global, there\u2019s still so much opportunity on the continent that is unrealised, and I think the Internet is the barrier and once that goes away, what we\u2019re going to see will completely blow our minds!\u201d She added.\n\nObi Asika\u2019s future for Afrobeats lies in the home of Afrobeats \u2014 Nigeria. To him, the conversation about Afrobeats in the future will be based on who did the most in the \u201chome market.\u201d which is the most important market.\n\n\u201cThere are global moments, but the biggest opportunity is Nigeria!\u201d He said emphatically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA close look at the numbers from 2021 reveals something that even casual observers must have noticed \u2014 the fintech industry keeps on pulling in the most money ($2.3 billion) of all sectors in the African tech ecosystem. In addition to that, it has significantly more startups compared to the others. Nigeria alone has 144 fintech startups, per Statista. In contrast, there are only 22 commercial banks in Nigeria.\n\nAn underdeveloped financial system, difficulty accessing credit, and a growing number of smartphone users present a huge opportunity for new and existing fintech players in Africa. However, this also means that there will be several startups offering similar services.\n\nJust like it is common to see Nigerians open accounts with more than one bank, we now see customers doing the same with fintech startups.\n\nMarking this register is another fact: these startups compete among themselves for a fraction of the market as there are still barriers to using these services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPreparing for competition\n\nOluwatobi Boshoro, CEO of Infinitetiks, believes that fintech startups can expect to see competition from startups on the fringes of the financial services sector. This, she says, is because consumers are getting tired of having to use too many services for their financial needs.\n\n\u201cIn Africa, a lot of the digital natives are becoming fatigued with the proliferation of apps, particularly with the kind of services that we have seen on the apps in recent times. And so you\u2019re beginning to find more and more organisations who are service champions who are beginning to come into financial services such as OPay and Safeboda,\u201d she said while speaking at Techpoint Build 2021 on the topic, Business model innovation: the rise of ecosystems and platforms based on changing customer attitudes.\n\nWhat does this mean for fintech companies?\n\nWith this increased competition for customers, Boshoro believes that fintech startups need to start offering the whole gamut of financial services rather than focusing on core banking services.\n\nCurrently, most fintech startups in Africa are focused on one financial service. This could be payments, lending, insurance, or banking. However, the same cannot be said of some of their counterparts in other sectors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake Safeboda, for example; after launching its ride-hailing service in Ibadan, the startup has since added airtime payments to its suite of services. eCommerce giant, Jumia has done the same, launching Jumia Pay in 2016 to allow users to buy airtime, take loans, and pay for products on the platform.\n\nSo what does this mean for fintech startups?\n\nBoshoro believes that this would drive consolidation in the ecosystem as startups either get acquired by bigger players or merge to get access to a larger customer base. This is a view echoed by Abdul Hassan, CEO and Founder of Mono, in his predictions for fintech developments.\n\n\u201cI think there will be a lot of mergers and acquisitions coming up next year because I feel like there are a lot of companies doing similar things. And it doesn\u2019t really make sense to have about 20 companies doing the same thing when they can all put together the demand power, the resources, and the talent to build something that is really massive out of Africa.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to consolidation, Boshoro believes that partnerships will become critical for survival. Companies, she says, will have to \u201cpartner with strengths as the focus to lead the market.\u201d\n\nEven with the current players in the fintech space, there is still room for more companies capable of effectively serving previously excluded groups. However, in all this, the African customer looks set to win.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

Other digital currencies have suffered just as much, if not more, with Ethereum and meme coins seeing a similar dip.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiven the uncertainty surrounding the crypto market\u2019s recovery, GIG Logistics (GIGL) seems to be taking a considerable risk integrating a crypto wallet into its proprietary delivery app, GIGGO.\n\nWhat does this mean? It means users can now perform basic crypto transactions like buying, selling, \u2018hodling\u2019, and transferring crypto right on the app.\n\nBefore the integration is made public, it will go through two beta phases. The crypto wallet will be available to 2,000 users in the first beta phase, and then 10,000 users will be onboarded in the second phase.\n\nThe wallet integration is made possible through a collaboration with XPAD, a platform that allows users to store, invest, and stake in real-world assets using cryptocurrency. XPAD users can import their wallets into the GIGGO crypto wallet. Those who do not have an XPAD wallet can create one on GIGGO.\n\nWith several crypto exchanges providing similar services as XPAD, GIGGO introduces an innovative way to onboard users to the platform.\n\nWhile the crypto space has been inundated with scams since Bitcoin\u2019s inception \u2014 making crypto users wary of the crypto platforms they use \u2014 linking XPAD, a new platform, with GIGL, a reputable company, creates a sense of trust.\n\nTo learn more about how GIGL is building a sense of trust to users, please read: Merging crypto with logistics: How GIGL is preparing for the future of payments\n\nLAMI acquires Bluewave to reach more Africans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLami Technology Team.\n\nDue to the traditional distribution of insurance policies by individual insurance agents, Africa has low insurance coverage. Add to this Africans relying on traditional channels for trade and policy implementation, and we\u2019ve seen customer satisfaction suffer, distribution costs rise, and the processing cycle lengthen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis then affects how premiums are paid. So, in 2018, Jihan Abass founded Lami Technologies to make insurance products available to all Kenyans.\n\nAlthough selling insurance directly can be challenging, they adopted a B2B2C strategy to capitalise on the trust that had already been established through channels that communicate with customers regularly.\n\nThrough an API, Lami enables businesses to provide digital insurance products to their users. Partner businesses can also use this to manage their insurance needs.\n\nTo make insurance coverage available to more people in Africa on a larger scale, the company has acquired Bluewave Insurance Agency for an undisclosed sum. Adelaide Odhiambo, who now works as the head of commercial partnerships at Lami, founded Bluewave Insurance, another Kenyan startup.\n\nSince its launch in 2016, Bluewave has developed an online platform that enables clients to access micro-insurance products via various channels like USSD, SMS, WhatsApp chatbots, and web applications.\n\nAs part of the agreement, Lami will integrate Bluewave\u2019s technology into its core platform, enhancing its B2B2C capabilities.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, this acquisition will allow Lami to enter new markets like Malawi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where Bluewave already has a presence. Consequently, the startup will reach more customers in these respective countries.\n\nLami, already present in Uganda and Tanzania through partnerships outside of Kenya, plans to expand into Nigeria and several North African countries in 2022.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nWhat are mental health difficulties and when to seek help.

          "text": "Nigeria in its proposed budget intends to borrow N2.57 trillion from international sources but the cost of the debt may be a major source of concern, considering that global interest rates are likely to rise.\n\nTop economies have seen their inflation rate increase the highest in the past few months, which has led to an increase in global rates as they try to manage inflation and move away from the pandemic-induced low-rate environment.\n\nFor instance, the Bank of England last Thursday imposed back-to-back interest rate hikes for the first time since 2004, and began the process of quantitative tightening.\n\nMarkets had broadly expected the 25 basis point rate increase that the Monetary Policy Committee voted for 5-4, and which takes the main Bank Rate to 0.5 percent, as the central bank strives to contain soaring inflation. Four members voted to increase rates by 50 basis points to 0.75% percent.\n\nThe US Fed is also predicted to hike rates at least three times this year. Investors in the US and UK are among the top targets when Nigerian government officials go on roadshows to raise Eurobonds.\n\nThe rise in global interest rates, which may however elude the Eurozone, means Nigeria with debt service to revenue ratio of 70 percent last year would have to pay more on borrowing.\n\n\u201cIf global rates are rising then we must brace for higher debt service costs,\u201d said Bismarck Rewane, an economist and CEO of Financial Derivatives Company (FDC).\n\n\u201cThe implication of this is that the government must find a way to either reduce borrowing or at least spend on revenue-generating projects that will soften the cost of the loans,\u201d Rewane said.\n\nThe US, UK and Europe inflation rate soared to 7 percent, 5.4 percent, and 5.3 percent, respectively, last December, the most for these economies in more than three decades.\n\nAssistant Vice President and Senior Portfolio Manager at Chapel Hill Denham, Omotola Abimbola, said, \u201cWhen Global monetary policy is tightened, we will see upward pricing of interest rate and government policy rate. The cost of you raising new loans and servicing debts will also be higher.\n\n\u201cWhen we are in a global monetary tightening period, there are capital flow reversals in emerging and developing countries. However, for Nigeria, perhaps the good thing is that foreigners are not so heavily invested in local assets at the moment and that could reduce the impact of the increased global interest rates on the exchange rate.\u201d\n\nRead also: Debt burden will interrupt Africa\u2019s growth trajectory \u2013 Robertson\n\nIn 2022, the Federal Government with a budget deficit of N6.39 trillion intends to borrow N2.57 trillion a piece from domestic and international sources.\n\nThe bulk of the funds will be used to service recurrent expenditure, which has drawn criticism from analysts who think the bulk of the dent should go to funding genuine capital expenditure that can generate revenues for the government.\n\nThe 2022 Appropriation Act shows that out of the proposed 2022 budget of N17.126 trillion, N3.6 trillion was budgeted to service outstanding local and foreign loans, N6.9 trillion on recurrent expenditure, and N5.96 trillion on capital expenditure.\n\nRecently, the president of the African Development Bank (AfDB), Akinwunmi Adesina, and some prominent Nigerians expressed worry about Nigeria\u2019s debt servicing. Although, Adesina agreed that the country\u2019s debt to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) ratio was considered moderate and within acceptable limits at 33 percent.\n\nBut the big question economists are asking is how the country services its debt and the implication for domestic debts, which is needed to stimulate faster economic growth. This, according to the AfDB president, leaves Nigeria\u2019s economy in a vulnerable situation.",

          "title": "New payment system to allow naira across Africa",
          "text": "Nigerians can now use naira to buy goods and services from other African countries without the hurdle of converting to the dollar, thanks to the new African payment system \u2013 Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS).\n\nAfrican countries with 42 different currencies lose $5 billion annually as the cost of currency convertibility.\n\nThe new African payment system will enable Africans to transact in real-time on a digital platform with somebody or entity in other parts of the continent using their local currency, \u201cso you will not have to worry about converting to a dollar, or Euro or any other currency,\u201d notes Wamkele Mene, the secretary-general of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Secretariat.\n\nSpeaking on the first day of BusinessDay\u2019s African Business Conference (ABC) in Lagos, Kunle Elebute, CEO of KPMG, explained how the payment platform will work, saying the central banks of 54 African countries will agree on a single currency, e.g. the dollar, which their currencies will exchange for on the platform managed by either Mastercard or Visa.\n\nBefore the launch of the new African payment system, Mene said, \u201cIf you want to trade between South Africa and Kenya, you have to convert the South African Rand into the dollar, transact with somebody with a business in Kenya and receive that United States dollar, convert it into the Kenyan Shillings and then you can conclude the transaction.\u201d\n\nIntra-African trade is constrained; the lack of expeditious conclusion of transactions are the very challenges the Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) encounter as a result of 42 currencies in the continent, Mene said.\n\nThe new African payment system was officially launched on January 13, 2022, in Accra, Ghana.\n\nAccording to Afreximbank, PAPSS provides the solution to the disconnected and fragmented nature of payment and settlement systems that have long impeded intra-African trade.\n\nPrior to the introduction of the new African payment system, over 80 percent of African cross-border payment transactions originating from African banks had to be routed offshore for clearing and settlement using international banking relationships.\n\nThat posed multiple challenges, ranging from payment delays to operational inefficiencies and compliance concerns for the disparate regional payment systems.\n\nPAPSS is expected to reduce dependence on third currency such as dollar, Euro, Pounds, for intra-African transactions, Godwin Emefiele, governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), said.\n\nSettlement for intra-African trade used to require a third currency and a non-African correspondent bank. But Emefiele said with PAPSS the need for correspondent banks will reduce, and that will amplify intra-African trade significantly.\n\n\u201cThough intra-African trade is projected to surge following the successful implantation of the AfCFTA agreement, the launch of PAPSS provides a fresh vista of opportunity and aspiration for the African continent,\u201d Emefiele said at the official launch of PAPSS in Ghana.\n\nNigeria, Africa\u2019s largest economy, signed the AfCFTA on July 7, 2019, becoming the 34th member of the trading bloc.\n\nUnder the AfCFTA, Nigeria is said to gain from increased access to cheaper goods and services from other African countries, as its intra-African trade is low.\n\nIn 2018, Nigeria\u2019s imports from the African region relative to total imports, was put at 3.2 percent while the share of the county\u2019s exports to the African region relative to total exports was 13.2 percent.\n\nAs a percentage of total trade, intra-African trade is expected to increase to 35 percent from 15 percent over a five-year period with the infrastructure provided by PAPSS as payments and settlement bottlenecks are resolved, Emefiele said.\n\nWith the growing pace of digitisation of financial services, which has been accelerated by the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, he said PAPSS can serve as a veritable platform for supporting e-commerce within Africa.\n\nRead also: AfCFTA\u2019s slow take-off exposes Africa\u2019s value addition loopholes\n\nAn originator issues a payment instruction in their local currency to their bank or payment service provider.\n\nThe payment instruction is sent to PAPSS. PAPSS carries out all necessary validation checks on the payment instruction.\n\nThe payment instruction is forwarded to the beneficiary\u2019s bank or payment service provider. The beneficiary\u2019s bank clears the funds to the beneficiary in their local currency.\n\nWith instant payment, participants no longer need to convert local currencies into hard currencies which then entailed the funds leaving Africa to be converted before being sent back again to the beneficiary bank \u2013 adding days to the transaction time. In addition, compliance, legal and sanctions checks are performed instantly within the system. Near-instant payments process within 120 seconds.\n\nPAPSS \u2013 enables the efficient flow of money securely across African borders, minimising risk and contributing to financial integration across the regions.\n\nWhether shopping, transferring money, paying salaries, dealing in stocks and shares or making high-value business transactions, PAPSS\u2019 real-time infrastructure provides a reliable, cost-effective answer for instant payments.\n\nPAPSS works in collaboration with Africa\u2019s central banks to provide a payment and settlement service to which commercial banks, payment service providers and fintechs across the region can connect as \u2018Participants\u2019.",

          "title": "Anger swirls around Buhari over Electoral Bill",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari may be in for civil disobedience if he fails to assent to, any time soon, the Electoral Bill amended recently and sent to him by the National Assembly.\n\nBuhari has, since 2015, refused to assent to the document for a number of times, fuelling the belief by many observers that his promise to leave behind a legacy of robust electoral process may be a pipe smoke.\n\nEne Obi, convener, Nigeria Civil Society Situation Room and Country director, ActionAids Nigeria, while speaking on Channels Television Wednesday, said President Buhari was toying with the lives of Nigerians and future of Nigeria.\n\nObi wondered if the President was playing pranks or gimmick.\n\n\u201cAre we going to wait for him again? Time is running out. In 2018, he rejected it about three to four times and we had to fall back on the Act that had lasted for years. We urge him to sign the bill. We cannot wait again. The Independent National Electoral Commission is ready to move; timetable for the elections beginning from February next year has already been drawn.\n\n\u201cBefore then, we have the off-season gubernatorial elections in Ekiti and Osun. The INEC needs the document to make adequate preparations, but here we are waiting for the President.\n\n\u201cAgain, the National Assembly spent a lot of time towards the end of last year working on the document; they were able to send it to the President for assent, yet nothing is happening and time is going,\u201d she said, rather angrily.\n\nShe also wondered what is difficult in signing the Electoral Bill, saying that if the President could sign the Appropriation and the Petroleum Industry Bills despite the issues raised in them, the Electoral bill should also not be an issue.\n\n\u201cIt is like toying with the lives of Nigerians. We have elections coming and you are tying our hands,\u201d she further said.\n\nBy the same token, Sam Onuigbo, member representing Ikwuano/Umuahia North/Umuahia Federal Constituency for Abia State and member of the APC, blamed some bad elements for frustrating the efforts of Nigerians to have credible elections.\n\n\u201cThe laws that we have are more than enough to have credible elections, but there are some individuals that have a mindset to spoil things. Let us have a level-playing field in our electoral process,\u201d Onuigbo said.\n\nThe federal lawmaker wondered why Nigeria has continued to be described as a nascent and fledgling democracy after 24 unbroken years of civil rule.\n\n\u201cAfter 24 years, we should be able to lay a solid foundation for democracy. It is not right that we are still being described in flowering words- fledgling and nascent democracy,\u201d he said.\n\nA few days ago, opposition federal lawmakers asked President Buhari to assent to the reworked Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2022 without delay.\n\nThe lawmakers, under the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) National Assembly caucus, made the demand, at their meeting with the leadership of the Board of Trustees (BoT) of the major opposition party.\n\nAt the meeting, Enyinnaya Abaribe, Senate Minority Leader, said: \u201cWe are asking President Buhari to sign the Electoral Act, which we have passed. We made sure that everything he complained about has been given to him.\n\n\u201cNow that we have bent backwards, no excuse or reason should be given again. Provisions of the bill are very critical for expected credibility of the 2023 general elections,\u201d he said.\n\nNdudi Elumelu, Minority Leader, House of Representatives, alleged that some APC governors were again plotting to stop the President from assenting to the reworked bill. He, however, urged President Buhari not to yield to the request of the governors but sign the bill because of its importance in strengthening the country\u2019s electoral process.\n\n\u201cWe met them; they said they want direct primary. We said okay, if it will mean giving Nigerians a very sound electoral reform, we will accept it,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThey came back again and said, oh, we have rejected it, we now want indirect primary. We said we agree, but give Nigerians electoral reform. They came back again and said; we want consensus. We have added consensus to the amendment.\n\n\u201cAgain, I am hearing that, among them, those APC governors, with their \u2018wuru-wuru,\u2019 are still plotting for the president not to sign. Nigerians are tired of APC. We promise not to let the people down. That is why we are asking APC and President Buhari to sign the Electoral Act. Sign it, Nigerians want it signed. No more delay.\u201d\n\nA former member of the House of Representatives and chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Moshood Salvador advised the President to urgently sign the amended Electoral Act into law to help sanitise the electoral process, because time was running out.\n\nSalvador said the Electoral Act was the solution to the problems bedeviling the conduct of credible elections in Nigeria, which had worsened in recent years.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIf the President doesn\u2019t sign it, it means, he has his agenda and it would affect the APC. That amendment is the way out of the problem bedeviling our electoral system. I mean the way forward for ballot box snatching, double voting, violence and all sorts of manipulations that have characterised elections in Nigeria in recent decades.\n\n\u201cThey are playing with us and they claim not to have money, but this thing would save the country a lot of money and human efforts that would give ultimately credibility to our elections.\n\n\u201cThis is the only thing you can do to protect our votes, make them count. Is like they are playing with time, so that the INEC people would say time has run out and even if he signs it cannot be used again. It appears some people are deceiving the President to do what would favour them and their constituencies.\u201d\n\nEddy Olafeso, former national vice chairman South-West of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), said time was running out for the President Buhari to do the needful, while expressing concerns about the state of the country and the ability of Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to conduct a free and fair election next year.\n\nHe however, implored public office holders to prepare ground for INEC to conduct a free and fair election next year.\n\n\u201cTime is running out for this signing to be done, there is really nothing I can say again about the country and the Electoral Act, but it is obvious all is not right with Nigeria now. All I want to tell the lawmakers, Governors and other public office holders is for them to prepare ground for INEC to do their duty next year; which is to conduct elections.\n\n\u201cAll this game they are playing would not help us. Nigeria is on the precipice now and they are just playing to the gallery,\u201d Olafeso said.\n\nAlso speaking in a similar vein, public affair analyst, Tope Musowo, said it was obvious some influential politicians in the country and in the APC are not happy with the Electoral Act and are putting pressure on the President not to sign it into law, urging Nigerians to stand and speak with one voice on the issue.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cSome governors are trying to lobby him not to sign, they know that if we have free elections some of them may not win. Some people said last time that it was electronic transmission of results that they were against and not direct primaries which was the excuse President Buhari was giving to us.\n\n\u201cHe may have something in his slip, the Governors are there, he may not sign. Nigerians should put pressure on the President to sign, we can\u2019t be docile now. Democracy is about the will of the people and not about what few people want.\u201d\n\nIf the Electoral Act Amended Bill had been assented to by President Muhammadu Buhari since 2015 when the National Assembly sent the bill to him, many believe that Nigerian elections would have been more credible, particularly the 2019 election, and politicians checked because of the provisions of the bill.\n\nRead also: Buhari\u2019s APC has ruined nation\u2019s economy \u2013 NASS member\n\nSadly, it baffles many that the bill, which many think should be a legacy Mr. President, should leave behind against the criticisms, hardship and maladministration leveled against his administration, is likely not going to sail through, even when the ball is on Mr. President\u2019s court.\n\nIt also worries many concerned citizens why President Buhari has refused to give his assent to the amended bill, and also forcing people to ask the National Assembly to look for other means to pass the bill into law.\n\nChijioke Umelahi, a former Abia lawmaker and an Abuja-based lawyer, assured that President Buhari will not assent to the bill. He decried the development, saying that the President has deliberately refused to give his assent to the electoral bill since 2015 because of the crop of legislators at the National Assembly who are merely rubber stamps.\n\n\u201cIf the legislative arm is what it should be, we cannot be borrowing from every country, and it would have forced the president to give assent to the bill. The senate president keeps saying there is cordial relationship between the presidency and legislature, that is compromise and it is not good for democracy. They need to disagree on many issues, lobby and settle in favour of the masses,\u201d Umelahi said.\n\nThe angry lawyer noted further that in democracy the executive can always be checked by the legislature and judiciary arms, but that the reverse is the case in Nigeria because the senators and members of House of Representatives are not interested in fighting for the masses, but for their positions and pockets, hence money can always change hands for the executive to have its ways as President Buhari has done since 2015.\n\nToeing the same line with Umelahi, Terfa Ngusa, a Benue State politician, said the president will likely not give his assent to the bill because the National Assembly is not strong enough to compel him to do so, despite that giving the assent is his constitutional responsibility.\n\nThe Political Science lecturer turned politician said that the amended bill is for the good of Nigerians, but the political parties are kicking against it, hence the president is toeing party lines rather than national interest, which makes it more difficult.\n\nReviewing some of the new contents of the bill, which is part of the reason for the delay, Ngusa disclosed that the amended bill provides for direct primaries, which many party bigwigs kicked against, they prefer indirect and consensus primaries.\n\nAnother reason for the delay by the president is the electronic transmission of results, which, according to Ngusa, will curtail rigging by 80 percent.\n\n\u201cPoliticians are aware that the masses are suffering and are unhappy with them. They know that the masses can stop them with their votes, especially with electronic transmission of results, which makes it difficult for rigging. So, the delay is supported by those who fear that the new system will turn against them\u201d, he said.\n\nLooking at the Section 57 of the amended bill, which says, \u201cNo voter shall record his vote otherwise than by personally attending at the polling unit or voting centres and recording his vote in the manner prescribed by the Commission\u201d, the Political Science lecturer said that some selfish interests are contesting it because it will deny many people, especially in the north opportunity to cast their votes.\n\nBut Sam Onikoyi, a Nigerian researcher in Brussels, thinks that the president may not assent the bill for obvious reasons and the only way to get it done is by veto, which is allowed by the constitution.\n\n\u201cThe provisions of the amended bill seem good for sustainable democracy, amid expectant dividends for the masses, if not, it will not be contested by the executive the way it has been since 2015. I think the legislators should act in the interest of Nigerians, look for a way to compel the president to assent the bill, hold on requests from him, and sit on loan requests and approvals\u201d, he said.\n\nHowever, most observers think that there are many other critical issues, which the president has treated with levity and that the assent to the amended electoral bill may be given by the coming president.\n\nMr. President has refused to give assent to anything that will make Nigerians happy. He has not fought corruption, which he promised to fight, insecurity is at its peak despite his assurances, and Nigerians are poorer today all because of his policies. So, the amended bill is one of the least of his problems, if he has any,\u201d an aggrieved observer decried.\n\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\n\nBuhari rejects Electoral bill six times in 7 years\n\nBuhari rejected the amendment bill for the first time in February 2018 due to provisions that reordered the sequence of elections.\n\nA second amendment bill passed by both chambers of the National Assembly and sent to Buhari in June 2018 was not given any consideration.\n\nIn July 2018, Buhari refused to sign another version of the amendment bill passed and transmitted to him by the National Assembly for the third time, citing concerns about the increased cost of conducting elections, among other issues.\n\nBuhari declined assent to the amendment bill for the fourth time in December 2018, after the National Assembly addressed all of his previous reasons for refusing to sign.\n\nBuhari stated in a letter dated December 6, 2018, addressed to then Senate President Bukola Saraki and Speaker of the House of Representatives Yakubu Dogara, that he would not sign the electoral bill while the country was preparing for the 2019 elections because doing so would cause confusion and uncertainty in the polity.\n\nBuhari promised in the letter that he would sign the bill after the 2019 elections, but when presented with the opportunity in December 2021, he declined once more. Buhari refused to sign the electoral bill into law for the fifth time in December 2021.\n\nThe amended electoral bill was passed by the National Assembly on January 25, 2022, and it provided political parties with three models of primary elections: direct, indirect, and consensus.\n\nThe most recent transmission of the electoral bill to Buhari marks the sixth time he (Buhari) will be tasked with signing legislation aimed at reforming the country\u2019s electoral system.\n\nThe amended electoral bill included strict guidelines for implementing the various primary election models. These guidelines are intended to prevent political parties from being forced to accept candidates.\n\nThe presidency issued a statement on January 31 titled \u2018Transmission of the Electoral Bill 2022\u2019 to acknowledge the transmission of the electoral bill to Buhari.\n\nNigerians are hoping that Buhari will sign the electoral bill into law as soon as possible so that INEC can begin planning for the 2023 general election.\n\nINEC had previously stated that the timetable for the 2023 general election would not be released until the electoral bill was signed into law.\n\nINEC Chairman, Mahmood Yakubu stated at a consultative meeting with political parties in Abuja on January 19 that \u201cas soon as it (the electoral bill) is signed into law, the Commission would quickly release the timetable and schedule of activities for the 2023 general election based on the new law.\u201d",

Osaigbovo Iyoha, who led stakeholders to the meeting, reassured the government\u2019s support for the CVR exercise, charging INEC to increase awareness for the exercise so as to increase registration at the grassroots.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere is a lot of work on ground that INEC needs to do, but we must commend you in some areas that you have done well.

          "title": "OLAYIWOLA AFOLABI UPLIFTS THE LEGAL PROFESSION \u2013 Nigerian Observer",
          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBarr. Olayiwola Afolabi is an indigene of Ekiti State. He grew up in Lagos State but now plies his trade as a lawyer as well as a notary public with positive bias for human rights activism in Benin City, capital of Edo State.\n\nHis name resonates not only in Edo State but across Nigeria because of a charitable heart that is a critical component of his legal practice and life in general. At the end of the day, he has ended up doing so much to uplift the legal profession and the judiciary. How?\n\nFor instance, he has an award scheme for honouring honest, disciplined and diligent junior staff of Edo State judiciary. Messrs Akpitoyim, Isibor and Johnson Aneto, among others, have won this award since 2010 till date. Each one of them went home with gifts of deep freezers and bags of rice.\n\nIcons of the bench and bar have equally been honoured by Olayiwola Afolabi in one way or the other. On September 10, 2016 the incumbent Chief Judge of Edo State, Justice Esohe Ikponmwen, was given the rare privilege of cutting the tape to officially open his house on Yoruba Street, Benin City.\n\nIn 2018, Olayiwola Afolabi hosted the new executive members of NBA, Edo State Chapter to a dinner. On the occasion, he made a profound declaration. He said: \u201dI want to tell lawyers to read\u2026\u2026. Lawyers should read their books and also read their bibles because it is God that will help you.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the chapter\u2019s NBA chairman \u2013 Barr Collins Ogiegbaen- thanked Olayiwola Afolabi for his immense support to the Edo NBA executive and his act of mentoring young lawyers in and out of his chambers.\n\nIn 2020, Olayiwola Afolabi officially institutionalized this mentoring process with the establishment of AFOLABI ANNUAL LEGAL CLINIC AND COACHING LECTURE SERIES. During the second edition of this initiative, Olayiwola Afolabi honoured Barr Austin Alegie, former NBA chairman of Edo State Branch for his dogged war to stamp out fake lawyers in the state. Also, he organised a reception for the Lion Bar of Edo NBA at the event.\n\nBesides mentoring young lawyers to hone their skills, Olayiwola Afolabi donates gifts to them that enhance their practice. Specifically, he has given out countless numbers of wigs and gowns to the best graduating students of the law faculties of UNIBEN and AAU, Ekpoma as at 2020.\n\nIn May 2021, during the outgone year, Olayiwola Afolabi again gifted wigs and gowns to three female AAU students in honour of and support for the Justice Esther Edigin Foundation set up by then Chief Judge of Edo State to empower female lawyers.\n\nOlayiwola Afolabi also gave each one of them half a bag of rice since in these hard times lawyers don\u2019t live on wigs and gowns alone. They also need some stomach infrastructure.\n\nFour months later in September 2021 at the event to mark the second edition of OLAYIWOLA AFOLABI ANNUAL LEGAL CLINIC AND COACHING LECTURE SERIES, Afolabi again donated wigs and gowns to several young lawyers.\n\nTo round up the year 2021, Olayiwola Afolabi was at the valedictory court session held in honour of retiring Justice Stephen Omonuwa at Edo High Court Complex on December 14, 2012. He spoke glowingly of the retiree: \u201cJustice Omonuwa is an asset to Edo State Judiciary. When people say Edo State judiciary is one of the best in Nigeria, it is because you have people like Justice Omonuwa in mind. Whether you are his brother or friend, he will always give fair judgement. He doesn\u2019t care. What he knows is justice\u201d.\n\nAlso in line with his tradition of honouring icons in the judiciary, Olayiwola Afolabi has instituted Stephen Omonuwa Transparency Award. It will go to the winner of an essay competition open only to young lawyers. The award has a prize tag of N100,000.\n\nBy locus, Afolabi is a member of Oredo LGA Branch of NBA in Edo State, In July 2016, he threw a party for its members to honour them for contributing to the development of the judiciary and Edo State.\n\nAll former chief judges and attorney-generals of the state attended the event. Indeed, charity should find resonance at home, also.\n\nMuch more, Olayiwola Afolabi is a human rights activist who is allergic to injustice whether in the bar, bench or judiciary. In 2013, he embarked on a solo campaign which resulted in official vehicles being given to magistrates, customary court judges and judges of high courts in Edo State to enhance their dignity, safety, security and performance.\n\n2016 was a busy year for his human rights/legal activism. During this year, Olayiwola Afolabi embarked on a one-man protest march at Edo High Court and Ministry of Justice premises. He called on Edo State Government to pay the over 8 months salary arrears of about 2000. JUSUN staff in the state seized because they embarked on strike demanding financial autonomy for Edo Judiciary as affirmed by a high court ruling. Also, in the same year, Olayiwola Afolabi queried Edo State Government for unexplained delay in paying the June salaries of magistrates in the state. His action brought their silent plight to the public domain resulting in the government quickly paying the wages. Similarly, Olayiwola Afolabi fought to ensure lawyers in Edo State judiciary were sponsored to the 2016 Annual General Meeting/ Conference of the NBA when the state government was not in the mood to do so.\n\nLest one forgets, but for Olayiwola Afolabi in 2016 one wonders if Edo State Government would have been stampeded into paying the terminal benefits of retired Justices Isibor and Aigboke neglected vindictively by government earlier on.\n\n2022 is still young. Nevertheless Olayiwola Afolabi has continued with his charitable gestures. At the 85th birthday of Dr. Kola Okeaya-Inneh in Benin, Olayiwola Afolabi donated two wigs and gowns in honour of the celebrant and Yakubu Maikyau (SAN) aspiring to be NBA next president. Ooops, Olayiwola Afolabi never tires in up lifting the bar, bench and judiciary. That is the gospel truth.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nMichael A.

These victims have been detained incommunicado in their custody for two years and they have been ordered to be taken to secret locations in Kaduna.\n\n\u201cIt is only the authorities of the Nigeria Army that knows what that order and instruction meant, but any attempt to execute or extra-judicially kill them, they will regret their actions. Such barbarity will be costly and a blunder Nigeria will ever live to regret.\n\n\u201cWe also want to remind the army and the Federal Government that we are monitoring them.

          "text": "The Indigenous People of Biafra has alleged that the Nigerian Army had received a secret instruction to move all Obigbo youths held in the military cell in Kaduna to unknown locations in Northern Nigeria for possible execution.\n\nThe group said the over 500 Obigbo youths had been held in different detention facilities under inhuman conditions since two years when they were unlawfully arrested during the infamous Obigbo massacre in 2020.\n\nIn a statement on Saturday, the group\u2019s Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, said IPOB Intelligence unit intercepted secret instruction by the Nigeria Army high command to move the detainees to unknown locations for possible execution and extra-judicial killing.\n\nThe group, therefore, cautioned the Army and other federal agencies against secretly executing the innocent youths.\n\nPowerful added that If anything untoward happened to those people arrested illegally, the Army should be held responsible.\n\nThe statement reads in part, \u201cWe are aware that over 500 innocent Biafrans were unlawfully arrested and abducted by the military and evacuated to different secret cells in Abuja and Kaduna Army cells where they are daily tortured, raped and maltreated as animals because they are Igbos.\n\n\u201cThese youths were arrested in Rivers State by the Federal Government and Governor Nyesom Wike, at the heat of the #EndSARS protest because of their hatred against the Igbo Nation in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWith great efforts by our legal teams, some of them were released last year but many are still in custody for two years for committing no crime but being Igbo.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, want to place the world on notice over this wicked plot by the Nigeria Army and its plots to silence these innocent Biafrans without trace. These victims have been detained incommunicado in their custody for two years and they have been ordered to be taken to secret locations in Kaduna.\n\n\u201cIt is only the authorities of the Nigeria Army that knows what that order and instruction meant, but any attempt to execute or extra-judicially kill them, they will regret their actions. Such barbarity will be costly and a blunder Nigeria will ever live to regret.\n\n\u201cWe also want to remind the army and the Federal Government that we are monitoring them. Should anything untoward happen to these innocent Biafrans, those behind their fate will not escape judgement!\n\n\u201cWe demand unconditional release of these youths because they committed no crime and must therefore be released, they have unjustly suffered enough and deserve to be released unconditionally.\n\n\u201cThe Obigbo genocide must be remembered in history against Nyesom Wike and Nigeria security agents including the Federal Government of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe world should not maintain criminal silence when the same federal government that has been freeing Fulani bandits and mass murderers including terrorists rampaging and ravaging Nigeria for the past ten years contine to keep innocent Biafrans in detention under inhuman condition.\u201d Punch\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

You do not know what I encountered in the hands of Abba Kyari and his boys. I saw hell.\n\n\u201cIt was what they told me to be doing that I was doing,\u201d Evans said.",

          "text": "Rev John Hayab, the Chairman of the Christian Association in Kaduna State, has expressed concern about the kidnapping of one of his members who was supposed to deliver the ransom for the release of the remaining kidnapped Bethel Baptist High School student by terrorists.\n\nHayab, who is also the Vice Chairman of CAN in the northern states and Abuja, reportedly revealed that the remaining pupil, who is said to be the youngest of the abductees, turned down the militants\u2019 offer of freedom.\n\n121 kids were kidnapped by bandits in the early hours of July 5, 2021, at the school premises along the Kaduna-Kachia highway, Damishi, in the Chikun Local Government Area of the state, according to the President of the Baptist Conference, Rev Ishaya Jangado.\n\nThe bandits had freed 120 students in groups.\n\nThe CAN chairman, on the other hand, stated that the teen opted to remain with the bandits, a situation that perplexed the entire Baptist family, as well as CAN.\n\nThe robbers were alleged to be showering the youngster with presents every time they went out and returned from operations, causing him to refuse the option of freedom, according to Hayab.\n\nThe CAN leader, who spoke to Saturday PUNCH in Kaduna on Thursday, said, \u201cOnly one pupil of the Bethel Baptist High School is remaining with the terrorists. The reason is that this young boy \u2013 because we have to be clear with the story so that we don\u2019t get misquoted \u2013 is the smallest among them.\n\n\u201cI think the kidnappers were smart. They worked and changed his mind that he even said he wants to stay with them. They (terrorists) gave him meat, good things. Anytime they go out and come back, they pick him among the rest and give him so many things and then he starts acting funny.\n\n\u201cIf they (terrorists) tell him to go home, he would say he was not going and gave some flimsy excuses that his parents used to beat him at home. But we also made findings and we don\u2019t want to expose his parents to any noise but that is what he (the pupil) said. We are confused too.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I understand they (terrorists) are playing mind games with him by giving him gifts and convincing him to talk that way. But last week, they (terrorists) asked us to bring some money (ransom) to come and take him. The person who took the money to them was kidnapped. The person is with them as I speak now (on Thursday).\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s a very complicated situation that we are praying and managing with care. The man who has been helping us to deliver the money (ransom) all this while went to deliver the money to free this boy they were confusing and they kidnapped him.

          "text": "Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to use his good offices and leadership position to urgently review and rescind the reported approval for security agencies to access people\u2019s personal details via NIN-SIM linkage without due process of law.\n\nThe appeal was contained in a letter dated February 5, 2022, and signed by the SERAP Deputy Director Kolawole Oluwadare.\n\nThe organisation urged the President to \u201csend executive bills to the National Assembly to repeal and reform all laws, which are inconsistent and incompatible with Nigerians\u2019 rights to privacy, dignity and liberty.\u201d\n\nThe development followed reports that some security agencies have received presidential approval to access people\u2019s personal details via the database of the National Identity Management Commission in the course of carrying out their duties.\n\nSERAP believes that the reported approval to allow security agencies to access people\u2019s personal details via NIN-SIM linkage without due process of law directly interferes with the privacy, dignity and liberty of individuals.\n\nIt also believes that a failure to rescinded the reported approval may cause millions of law-abiding Nigerians to feel that their private lives are the subject of constant surveillance.\n\n\u201cThe interference entailed by unlawfully or arbitrarily accessing people\u2019s personal details is far-reaching and must be considered to be particularly serious,\u201d the statement read in part, adding: \u201cInterference with an individual\u2019s right to privacy is not permissible if it is unlawful or arbitrary\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe power to access individual\u2019s details raises serious concerns as to their arbitrary use by the authorities responsible for applying them in a manner that reduces human rights and democratic principles by the monitoring and surveillance of millions of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIt is crucial to rescind the approval, and respect the autonomy of individuals to receive and share information of a personal nature without interference from the authorities, if unintended adverse consequences are to be avoided.\n\n\u201cThe risk of arbitrary or abusive interference shows the importance for your government to comply fully with the requirements of legality, necessity, and proportionality.\n\n\u201cThe right to privacy allows Nigerians to hold opinions and exercise freedom of expression without arbitrary or illegal interference and attacks.\n\n\u201cPrivate conversations of individuals \u2013 which belong to their intimate sphere and contribute to their personal development \u2013 also enjoy strong legal protection and can only be limited based on the principles of legality, necessity and proportionality.\n\n\u201cThe reported presidential approval to security agencies does not align with the principle that any restriction on human rights capable of limitation should be the least intrusive means possible, and shall be necessary and proportionate to the benefit sought.\n\n\u201cViolations or abuses of the right to privacy might affect the enjoyment of other human rights, including the right to freedom of expression and to hold opinions without interference.\n\n\u201cSERAP notes that the right to privacy can enable the enjoyment of other rights and the free development of an individual\u2019s personality and identity, and an individual\u2019s ability to participate in political, economic, social and cultural life.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn relation to the requirement of legality, any limitation must be expressly, exhaustively, precisely, and clearly provided for in a law in the formal and material sense. It is not enough that the restrictions be formally approved by the president or by any other competent body: they must also be sufficiently clear, accessible and predictable.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, measures restricting enjoyment of the right to privacy must comply with the principle of proportionality, meaning that they must not unduly interfere with other rights of the persons targeted.\n\n\u201cIn the digital age, protecting the right to privacy requires exceptional attention. While acknowledging the challenging issues that your approval may seek to address, SERAP is seriously concerned that this may be used as a pretext by security agencies to violate Nigerians\u2019 right to privacy and other related human rights.\n\n\u201cThe undermining of the universality of fundamental human rights, alongside the potential encroachment upon the enjoyment of the right to privacy raised by the presidential approval, suggests the urgent need to review the matter, and rescind your approval, consistent with constitutional and international standards.\n\n\u201cSERAP notes that the relationship between data principals and the authorities involves a power imbalance. Nigeria ought to provide the leadership in developing a data protection framework that is fully consistent and compatible with the protection of the fundamental and inalienable right to privacy.\n\n\u201cAccording to reports, some security agencies have received your approval to access people\u2019s personal details via the database of the National Identity Management Commission in the course of carrying out their duties. The Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami reportedly conveyed the approval to the relevant security agencies.\n\n\u201cMr Pantami also reportedly stated that the approval would enhance security as it would help security operatives to go after kidnappers and other criminals.\n\n\u201cThe approval would now allow security agencies to access the data of the over 73 million Nigerians who have linked their National Identity Number with their SIM, and other people who may do so.\n\n\u201cWhile the effectiveness of the fight against serious crime may depend to a great extent on the use of modern investigation techniques, such an objective of general interest, however fundamental it may be, cannot in itself justify the unlawful or arbitrary interference with the right to privacy.\n\n\u201cUnlawful or arbitrary access to people\u2019s personal details would contravene section 37 of the Nigerian Constitution 1999 (as amended), article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and article 5 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights, which protect against arbitrary or unlawful interference with one\u2019s privacy.\n\n\u201cAny constraints upon the right to privacy must strictly comply with the principles of legality, necessity and proportionality. These requirements are included in the Nigerian Constitution and the human rights treaties to which Nigeria is a state party.\n\n\u201cWe would be grateful if the recommended measures are taken within 7 days of the receipt and/or publication of this letter. If we have not heard from you by then, SERAP shall take all appropriate legal actions to compel your government to comply with our request in the public interest\u201d.\n\nThe letter was copied to Mr Abubakar Malami, SAN, Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, and Mr Isa Pantami, Minister of Communications and Digital Economy.",

I want to announce to all Nigerians and everybody here that this emirate doesn\u2019t give chieftaincy titles because of money or any position.\n\n\u201cI had never given chieftaincy titles because of money, fear of somebody or position. We give chieftaincy titles based on merit and to help our masses who God will ask us hereafter,\u201d the monarch explained.\n\n\u201cI call on Nigerians to continue to support and pray for President Muhammadu Buhari as he governs our nation in the phase of numerous changes to achieve peace, economic revitalisation, development and progress of the country,\u201d he added.\n\nHe reiterated that the emirate conferred the traditional title on Amaechi to reciprocate his kind gestures in Daura and for initiating the establishment of the University of Transportation, saying the varsity would boost the education and the economy of northern states.\n\nHe added that a rail station with necessary facilities would soon be constructed in Daura for the benefit of traders, particularly those associated with import and export businesses.\n\nSome of the dignitaries at the event include Minister for Sports and Social Development, Mr Sunday Dare; Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Mr Festus Keyamo; Governor of Katsina State, Hon.

          "text": "Oil prices continued their surge on Saturday, sending one of Nigeria\u2019s most valued grades, Bonny Light to $95 and Algeria\u2019s Sahara Blend to $97.48, in an obvious push towards the $100 mark.\n\nThe increase represented a 3.70 per cent for the Nigerian grade and 4.29 per cent for the North African grade, the highest level they have attained since 2014.\n\nThis is coming as the federal government through the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC), in collaboration with other relevant stakeholders, yesterday embarked on a Joint Investigation Visit (JIV) to the facility of the Shebah Exploration & Production Company Limited (SEPCOL), which exploded on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO), Trinity Spirit, located at Ukpokiti field in Oil Mining Lease (OML) 108 in Warri, Delta State, was engulfed by fire during the incident, with 10 members of the crew still missing.\n\nOther grades of Nigeria\u2019s oil, which experienced a significant rise were the Brass River, which was selling for $94.13, an addition of 3.53 per cent and Qua Iboe, which hit $94.13 as at 6 pm Nigerian time.\n\nNigeria\u2019s most popular oil and the country\u2019s benchmark, Brent Crude was going for $93.27, a rise of 2.87 per cent while the United States crude benchmark settled at $93.27 a barrel.\n\nThis is happening for the first time since October 2014 due to ongoing supply worries and as frigid weather cascades across the US.\n\nThe latest rally was attributed to growing concerns that extended cold weather could hit production in the US, exacerbating the tightness in world crude markets.\n\nThe market was also watching developments between Russia and the West over the former\u2019s aggressive posture towards Ukraine.\n\nCrude benchmarks have been pointing upward for weeks on expectations that supply would tighten further even after the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers (OPEC+) stuck to planned moderate output increases.\n\nDemand remains on the upswing, with the Omicron coronavirus variant only temporarily denting consumption in major economies in recent times.\n\nOPEC and allies led by Russia, known as OPEC+, during the week agreed to stick to a monthly increase of 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) in output despite pressure from consumers to raise supplies more quickly.\n\nIn addition, Goldman Sachs has forecast Brent topping $100 a barrel in the third quarter, but that might come even earlier though insinuations are rife that OPEC+ may consider a faster unwinding of its production cuts.\n\nSeveral OPEC members, like Nigeria, are struggling to pump more despite prices being at seven-year highs, with the country unable to meet expected levels due to sabotage, waning upstream infrastructure and outright theft.\n\nNigeria was unable to meet its oil production allocation by OPEC in January, as it was only able to pump 1.46 million barrels per day of the expected 1.683 million bpd for the month.\n\nMoreover, the Group Managing Director, Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC), Mr Mele Kyari, had said that NNPC\u2019s joint venture partners were unable to restart oil wells shut down in the heat of the COVID-19 pandemic. His promise of a 1.8 million barrels target by December 2021 had earlier faltered.\n\nThe surge in the price of Bonny Light indicates that Nigeria now has as much as $33 above the $62 per barrel 2022 budget benchmark.\n\nThe budget was based on the production of 1.8 million barrels per day, including about 400,000 barrels of condensate that Nigeria produces daily.\n\nIronically, Nigeria\u2019s external reserve at the weekend fell below the $40 billion thresholds it had maintained in over three months. This was according to data from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nThe reserve had endured a continuous decline in recent months, owing to the intervention of the apex bank in the official FX market and sustained forex crunch in the economy.\n\nNotably, the reserve level had fallen to $39.98 billion as of Thursday, February 3, 2022.\n\nDespite the rising oil prices, the country\u2019s excess crude account had been depleted, while the foreign reserve dipped by $481.4 million in January 2022, following a $66.17 million decline recorded in December 2021.\n\nThe federal government had explained recently that the fund depleted from $72.4 million to $35milion in a space of one year, despite crude oil averaging higher than Nigeria\u2019s benchmark for the year.\n\nFG, Others Embark on Joint Probe of SEPCOL FPSO Explosion\n\nMeanwhile, the NUPRC, in collaboration with other relevant stakeholders yesterday embarked on a Joint Investigation Visit (JIV) to the facility of SEPCOL, which exploded on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe FPSO, Trinity Spirit, located at Ukpokiti field (OML 108) in Warri, Delta State, was engulfed by fire during the incident.\n\nIn a statement issued yesterday by the NUPRC, providing an update, the commission said the fire had been successfully extinguished.\n\n\u201cThe commission will commence JIV with relevant stakeholders immediately in line with our regulatory oversight function for upstream operations.\n\n\u201cThe commission will further deploy its incident management strategy while also ensuring that the removal of the FPSO is carried out professionally to prevent an escalation of the incident.\n\n\u201cThe commission will continue to ensure that all safety and environmental measures are strictly adhered to in the management of the incident,\u201d the statement said.\n\nSimilarly, a release signed by the Chief Executive Officer, SEPCOL (in receivership), Mr Ikemefuna Okafor, owners of the vessel, confirmed that the JIV with relevant stakeholders and experts was fixed for yesterday (Saturday).\n\nThe vessel with a capacity to process up to 22,000 barrels of oil per day, inject up to 40,000 barrels of water per day and store 2 million barrels of oil, had exploded and sunk at the Ukpokiti Terminal, around Excravos.\n\nTHISDAY checks showed that the huge facility, TRINITY SPIRIT, was built in 1976 (46 years ago).\n\nThe asset is owned by SEPCOL, which in 2004 acquired all of 40 per cent of ConocoPhillips\u2019 equity interest in OML 108.\n\nThe vessel had broken into two and partially submerged but there was no evidence of spilled crude, sources said, adding that there could have been problems with the vessel\u2019s boilers, which they said kept no more than 20,000 barrels of crude.\n\nAn update provided yesterday by the company confirmed that the fire had been extinguished, while the search for the whereabouts of the crew on board was ongoing.\n\n\u201cThe management of Shebah Exploration & Production Company Limited (SEPCOL) in receivership, hereby provides an update on the explosion and subsequent fire that engulfed the FPSO Trinity Spirit located at the Ukpokiti Terminal, in the early hours of Wednesday, February 2, 2022.\n\n\u201cWe have been working with the relevant authorities and stakeholders to contain the situation and an investigation has been launched to establish the cause of the explosion.\n\n\u201cWe can confirm that the fire burnt out completely as of Thursday afternoon, February 3, 2022, and this has enabled closer inspection of the vessel. With this development, a Joint Investigation Visit (JIV) has been scheduled for Saturday, February 5, 2022, with the relevant authorities, stakeholders, and expert organisations.\n\n\u201cCurrently, there are still no reported fatalities, and we continue prioritising investigations concerning establishing the whereabouts, safety, and security of the 10 crew members who were on board the vessel before the incident,\u201d the statement explained.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",
