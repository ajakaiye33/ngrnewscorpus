          "title": "N408.5/litre proposal: Nigerians may pay N588bn monthly for petrol",
          "text": "\u2022 NLC meets Tuesday to take decision on govs\u2019 proposal\n\nNigerians may be spending N588.24bn monthly for Premium Motor Spirit, popularly called petrol, should the Federal Government implement the recommendation of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum that the cost of the commodity be increased.\n\nA committee set up by the Nigeria Governor\u2019s Forum had last Wednesday recommended that petrol price should be between N380/litre and N408.5/litre. They also called for the immediate removal of petrol subsidy.\n\nAlthough the Federal Government on Friday said it would not increase petrol price in June despite the recommendation of the NGF, it had repeatedly said there was no going back on the imminent removal of petrol subsidy.\n\nOn several occasions, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, had stated that subsidy on petrol could not be sustained, describing it as a huge burden on the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation.\n\nNNPC is the sole importer of petrol into Nigeria and has maintained this position for more than three years running.\n\nShould the Federal Government decide to shift the burden of petrol subsidy by implementing the full deregulation of the downstream oil sector, as canvassed by the governors, consumers of petrol would have to pay humongous sums monthly.\n\nFigures obtained from the latest financial and operations report of the NNPC showed that Nigerians consumed 1.44 billion litres of petrol in January 2021, translating to 46.3 million litres daily.\n\n\u201cTo ensure continuous increased PMS supply and effective distribution across the country, a total of 1.44 billion litres of PMS translating to 46.3 million litres/day were supplied for the month (January 2021) in the downstream sector,\u201d the oil firm stated.\n\nIt added, \u201cThe corporation has continued to diligently monitor the daily stock of Premium Motor Spirit to achieve smooth distribution of petroleum products and zero fuel queue across the nation.\u201d\n\nGoing by the above figures, it, therefore, implies that at the current rate of N165/litre, Nigerians are paying a total of N237.6bn for the 1.44 billion litres of petrol consumed across the country monthly.\n\nBut at an increased rate of N408.5/litre, users of petrol would have to pay N588.24bn, meaning Nigerians would be paying an additional sum of N350.64bn on the purchase of petrol.\n\nFuel subsidy has continued to generate controversy by successive governments in the country. Attempts by previous governments, including that of ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, to stop it were resisted vehemently by Nigerians.\n\nHowever, the regime of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd), has insisted that Nigerians should brace up for an increment in the pump price of petrol, in light of the current economic situation in the country.\n\nIn early May, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, said fuel subsidy was only benefitting a cross-section of businessmen in the country and not the citizens.\n\nWe\u2019ll decide on N408.5/litre petrol price proposal, others on Tuesday \u2013NLC\n\nMeanwhile, the Nigeria Labour Congress on Saturday said it had decided to meet on Tuesday to decide on its position as regards the recommendation by governors that the price of Premium Motor Spirit be raised from N162/litre to N408.5/litre.\n\nIt also stated that Tuesday\u2019s meeting would discuss other issues such as the sacking of workers by the Kaduna State Government and the need to amend the country\u2019s constitution.\n\nNLC had on Thursday stated that it would meet on Friday to decide on the matter of petrol price increase proposed by the governors.\n\nIt eventually rescheduled the meeting following some last-minute changes.\n\nWhen contacted the Deputy President NLC, Joe Ajaero, said, \u201cThe meeting is now scheduled for Tuesday. It was rescheduled due to some adjustments.\n\n\u201cWe shall be looking at three major agenda: the proposal for petrol price increase by governors, the sacking of workers by the Kaduna State Government, and the issue with the country\u2019s constitution.\u201d\n\nAjaero stated that it was the hope of the union that its positions on the three issues would be made public after Tuesday\u2019s meeting, as the NLC would also be meeting with the Federal Government representatives on some of the concerns.\n\nSmall businesses merely surviving, will soon fail \u2013ASBON\n\nIn an interview with Sunday PUNCH, the President of the Association of Small Business Owners of Nigeria, Dr Femi Egbesola, said if fuel subsidy was finally removed, it would lead to a big crisis for small businesses.\n\nEgbesola said at the moment, only about 10 per cent of small businesses were surviving, adding that many had closed shops because they didn\u2019t have the wherewithal to produce again. He also said the capital of many small businesses had been eroded by inflation and high exchange rate.\n\nHe said, \u201cA lot of small businesses will be affected. In fact, I\u2019m also thinking of closing one of my factories. When we have fuel subsidy removed, I can\u2019t imagine what would happen.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think fuel subsidy removal is what the government should be talking about now.\u2019\u2019\n\nIn a similar vein, the National Association of Nigerian Students on Friday took a swipe at the governors over their support for total fuel subsidy removal.\n\nNANS claimed that the governors agreed to fuel subsidy removal only because they saw it as an avenue for an increase in the allocation accruable to them from the Federation Account.\n\nNANS President, Sunday Asefon, who described any proposed hike in fuel price as irresponsible and wicked, said Nigerian students would resist the \u201cunpopular decision\u201d of fuel subsidy removal because it would further impoverish Nigerians.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "The Northern Youth Leaders Forum has blamed the pervading insecurity in the country on former President Goodluck Jonathan.\n\nThe NLYF, a coalition of northern socio-political groups, argued that the country would have been spared the current security challenges if Jonathan had respected the agreement he reached with northern state governors and leaders of thought to only serve one term, following the death of the late President Musa Yar\u2019Adua.\n\nThe NLYF Chairman, Elliot Afiyo, said this while speaking with journalists in Yola on Saturday.\n\nAfiyo said though the coalition had been championing rotational presidency, it had now changed its mind as the country needed to look beyond the regions to get a President capable of dealing with the current security challenges.\n\nAccording to him, a \u201ccoalition or cabal is behind the current security situation being faced by the country.\u201d\n\nThe NLYF chairman said, \u201cWith what is going on in this country, we need to bring anybody from anywhere in this country to deal with the situation.\n\n\u201cIf you flash back to the Jonathan regime, you will observe that Jonathan was ready and willing to deal with the security situation, but some people, especially from the North (undermined him) \u2013 we have evidence. A coalition or cabal benefitting from the insecurity is causing the insecurity in this country. And you need somebody with a lion heart to deal with it.

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\n\u2026 Awards three participants 1,750 dollars\n\nBy Gabriel Olawale\n\nDetermined to close the knowledge gap in financial market, a brokerage firm that offers Forex, TigerWit Africa, has trained over 840 Nigerians in a two-week workshop in Port-Harcourt, the Rivers State capital.\n\nThe two weeks training, facilitated by the Head of Education, TigerWit Africa, Mr. Davies Babalola and his team through the TigerWit Academy, was on the mission to save Nigerians from losing income in this time of bleeding economy and global pandemic.\n\nIn an interview with newsmen, Babalola noted that TigerWit Academy has been passionate about helping people after it noticed a knowledge gap in the industry.\n\n\u201cA lot of people lose money blindly which is unnecessary. If we can help them trade longer, we can be guaranteed a sustained client-base in the long run, a win-win situation,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, one good thing is in times like this, COVID-19 has taught \u201cUs that you can\u2019t depend on one source of income; you need a source of income that is not dependent on the economy of your nation\u201d.\n\nThe forex expert also lamented how naira is degrading while conceding that \u201cwe are in a very tough situation. That naira is degrading doesn\u2019t mean the whole world is also.\n\n\u201cSo can we take advantage of technology? COVID-19 taught us that what if the whole world is on lockdown everybody can\u2019t go out how do you make money and feed\u201d?\n\nDuring the heat of the chaotic lockdown, Babalola confirmed that Forex trading had the largest Google search keywords. \u201cSearch like Forex trading online business, home trading, digital marketing. That was what everybody was doing.\u201d\n\nHe, however, listed some advantages of the forex business. \u201cYou don\u2019t have any overhead. The only thing you need is to set up an account with your broker, then put in 100 or 200 dollars.\u201d\n\nTo begin the business, the expert said one needs a laptop, mobile phone you use for WhatsApp, and must be above 18.\n\n\u201cWe have been able to channel them to alternate way of making income with no risk of entry, no barrier, no unnecessary overhead, no staff payment,\u201d hinting that some of them are even doing much better than what banks can give them in a year.\u201d\n\nIn his views, it is known that the interest rates on fixed deposits from banks are not enticing enough. \u201cThat is not so in Forex; you become profitable from the start.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, we dissuaded beginners from going for big profits. Two, three or five percent on a monthly basis is okay for you, not going for 20 or 30 percent. Let it compound for six months or one year, you will see a whole game change.\u201d\n\nWith half of the total participants as female, the head of education described women as very enterprising. Others included retirees, pensioners, and students.\n\nTigerWit Academy did not only equip the beneficiaries and packed up, it went ahead to establish a social media account as a follow-up mechanism.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\nIn his words: \u201cWe have been doing webinars for them; we have an online academy fully set up so we give them login access that they can plug in to and continue to study at their convenience.\n\nBabalola, however, inspired confidence in beginners that when they try it themselves, they can grow. \u201cYou will fall and rise up but with the knowledge you have gained.\u201d\n\nThe firm also gave out 1,750 dollars to three attendees to encourage them to start out trading. While the first runner up got 1,000 dollars, the second and third received 500 and 250 dollars respectively.\n\n\u201cThey won a raffle draw. This is a clear indication that tigerwit is intentionally committed to seeing Nigerians succeed\u201d, he expressed.\n\nAccording to Babalola, TigerWit Academy had eyes on Port-Harcourt following a recent ponzi scheme fallout. \u201cA lot of people have lost tons of money, people are in pain and yet they believe they can still do this business.\u201d\n\nThe Academy, therefore, empowered participants with knowledge of trading by themselves rather than hand their money over to people who defrauded them. \u201cThat is the paradigm shift we gave them.\u201d\n\nWith two weeks of knowledge sharing, Babalola affirmed that they stayed back. \u201cWe continued training people morning and evening, holding two sessions daily; morning time for the non-working class, evening was for those working.\n\nWhile acknowledging that the programme was impactful, Babalola is excited about taking it across the country. \u201cWe have set up a system that will make it sort of auto run. That is why we set up the online academy, which we are leveraging on to go round.\u201d\n\nHaving empowered residents of Port-Harcourt, TigerWit Academy replicate the same in Abuja, then Uyo the Akwa-Ibom state capital.\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

He died as a soldier 53 years ago in the struggle to keep Nigeria one. \u201cThis celebration is a yearly ritual which has come to stay among the Ijaw, Niger Delta and Nigerian people.\n\n\u201cThis is the spirit of the struggle of resource control and Isaac Boro believed in resource control.\n\n\u201cThis is a reminder for the Ijaw to keep the struggle alive.\n\n\u201cThe era of armed struggle is fading away as the society is changing. It is time the Ijaw youths place themselves strategically so as to peacefully achieve their goals.\u201d\n\nThe Ijaw youth leader called on lawmakers from Niger Delta to move a motion towards the restructuring of Nigeria.\n\nHis words: \u201cWe are calling on lawmakers representing the Niger Delta at the national level to move a motion to restructure Nigeria so that all regions can manage their resources and contribute to the federal purse.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the essence of what we\u2019re doing today.

          "title": "El-Rufai vs NLC: Kaduna Governor comes under scrutiny in aftermath of faceoff with Labour",
          "text": "The Governor of Kaduna State, Nasir el-Rufai has increasingly being in the news lately, as Nigerians continue to scrutinise his claims of being a democrat.\n\nThough Kaduna has always been in the news largely due to insecurity that pervades the State, resulting in mass abduction of students and killings especially in the Southern part of the State, the events of last week, seem to have more than ever, put the former FCT Minister under the spotlight.\n\nThe Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) had mobilized workers in Kaduna State for a five-day warning strike to protest the mass sacking of workers by the el-Rufai administration, especially the planned sacking of seven thousand workers from the state\u2019s local government areas workforce.\n\nThough planned by labour to be a total strike that will completely lock down both social and economic activities in the State, Governor el-Rufai did not know how effective and crippling the strike could be until it took off.\n\nTrue to labour\u2019s plan, Kaduna was shut down! Electricity was gone, banking stopped, transportation both by air and rail halted while workers from every other sector, including health and education stayed away from work, both in the private and public institutions.\n\nAlarmed by the crippling effect of the strike, Governor el-Rufai, though pretending to be unruffled, tagged the NLC and its leaders economic saboteurs and declaring them wanted. He went a step further to order the blanket sack of all nurses in the state from grade level 13 downwards and also threatened to sack lecturers of the state university if they failed to show up for work, among other workers in the state.\n\nFor many Nigerians, el-Rufai was simply power-drunk and behaving like an emperor over a conquered territory in a democracy. His actions and utterances before and during the strike, many believed, brought to the fore, his real nature and disposition to governance, wondering how a governor can unilaterally declare leaders of the NLC, especially its President, Ayuba Wabba wanted, and declaring that he would be tried under the Miscellaneous Offences Act.\n\nThe Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) was especially piqued by the attack on the protesting workers by hoodlums, who wielded weapons to disrupt a peaceful protest embarked upon by the workers.\n\nSERAP, in a statement on Tuesday by its Deputy Director, Kolawole Oluwadare, called for an immediate end to the growing crackdown on the protesting workers.\n\n\u201cKaduna authorities must respect the human rights of Nigerian workers, and ensure the safety and security of the leaders of the Nigeria Labour Congress.\n\n\u201cDeclaring NLC leaders \u2018wanted\u2019 simply for peacefully exercising their human rights is antithetical to the Nigerian Constitution of 1999 [as amended] and the country\u2019s international obligations.\n\n\u201cAuthorities ought to protect workers from attacks by thugs. Allowing thugs to disrupt peaceful protest by workers is illegal and unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cUsing thugs to attack peaceful protesters is a crime against humanity. Authorities need to find out who was responsible for the assaults and punish them appropriately.\n\n\u201cKaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai should immediately reinstate Kaduna State University lecturers and nurses unlawfully dismissed for allegedly joining the strike in the State.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll hold Governor Nasir El-Rufai and Kaduna authorities to account for the blatant violations of human rights.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see in court if the lecturers and nurses are not immediately reinstated.\n\n\u201cWe urge the UN human rights special rapporteurs to put pressure on Governor Nasir El-Rufai and Kaduna State to immediately end brutal crackdown on peaceful protesters.\u201d\n\nFor the former Chairman of the National Human Rights Commission, Chidi Odinkalu, the Kaduna State Governor does not have the power he purported to have exercised in declaring labour leaders wanted.\n\nOdinkalu further stated that the actions and inability of the Governor to govern Kaduna peacefully, has shown that he cannot rule Nigeria, adding that el-Rufai has failed in his primary responsibility of protecting the people of Kaduna, declaring that he has been operating as a lawless entity.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe law that deals with economic sabotage is a federal law, state governors don\u2019t enforce federal laws except they have the permission of the Federal Attorney General to do so.\n\n\u201cSecondly, governors don\u2019t have the power to declare people wanted, only security agents can do that. Thirdly, in most cases, to declare people wanted, you need court authorization. The courts have been on strike for almost two months.\n\n\u201cIt takes a lawless person to take laws into their hands and declare people wanted. The NLC president is in Kaduna and he is not hiding.\n\n\u201cEl-Rufai is not the military, he cannot rule by edict. He cannot operate as a lawless entity. He is endangering Kaduna and the entire country.\n\n\u201cThe real tragedy is that he has the ambition to rule Nigeria. El-Rufai cannot manage this country. Woes beget Nigeria if El-Rufai has the opportunity to rule this country.\n\n\u201cHis occupying public office should end in Kaduna State. We are going to make sure that his presidential ambition fails.\u201d\n\nAlso, in his reaction, human rights lawyer, Femi Falana, mocked el-Rufai, describing as laughable declaring the labour leaders wanted and saying he would try them under the Miscellaneous Offences Act.\n\nAccording to Falana, Wabba and other labour leaders have the right under the Nigerian Constitution and the Trade Union Act to participate in the peaceful warning strike and mass protests.\n\nDeclaring that the Governor lacks the power to declare any alleged offender wanted under the Act or any other law whatsoever, Falana called on the Nigeria Police Force and other security agencies to ignore El-Rufai\u2019s declaration as it is not tenable in law.\n\nIn his reaction, a former Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, faulted Governor el-Rufai for not engaging labour constructively before things degenerated. He also frowned at the attacks on workers and called on other labour unions in the country to join hands with labour in order to show the people of Kaduna solidarity.\n\nHe said: \u201cNow that it is turning violent, this is the time for other associated labour unions to get involved to show solidarity to the labour people in Kaduna such that the government will now be forced to engage labour in a manner that is constructive.\n\n\u201cSending thugs to start harassing labour unions\u2019 leaders and their members is completely unacceptable. It shows that we are not actually in the 21st century. As leaders, sometimes we have to take responsibilities, we also have to show restraint in the face of provocation, that is what leadership is all about.\n\n\u201cWe should not be behaving like thugs or sending thugs to go and dispatch people who are protesting, especially when it is not violent.\u201d\n\nFor the Medical and Health Workers\u2019 Union of Nigeria, Governor el-Rufai is nothing but an anarchist for allegedly sending thugs after protesting workers.\n\nIn a statement issued on Tuesday by the National President of the MHWU, Dr Biobelemoye Josiah, the union called for the reinstatement of the sacked nurses and a public apology to labour. It also called on the people of Kaduna State to note that day, Tuesday as a black day in the history of the State so as to deny Governor el-Rufai any further opportunity to hold an elective post.\n\nThe union said: \u201cSo, for Mal. El-Rufai to sack workers whose only offence is that they chose to serve their fatherland faithfully and diligently with all man-made inconveniences is most unfortunate. We are, therefore, angered that even in the face of this deprivation, we are being provoked and humiliated.\n\n\u201cLet it be known to members of the public that peaceful picketing is guaranteed under section 43 of Trade Union ACT CAP T14 LFN 2004. This position of the law has been affirmed severally by the superior courts of record up to the Supreme Court of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe particularly call on all workers and citizens of Kaduna State to tag Tuesday, 18th May, 2021 as a sad day for democracy and a day of mourning when an elected governor threw away the constitution he swore to uphold and embraced thuggery.\n\n\u201cWe call on the entire citizens of Kaduna State to particularly remember this day so that when this same man comes calling to beg for votes to go to the retirement home of former governors \u2013 the senate or for any other elective position, he should be rejected outrightly as there is no room for anarchist in a democratic society.\u201d\n\nFrom several reactions, Nigerians tend to agree that the Kaduna State Governor has behaved more like a dictator than he has shown any democratic qualities. For many, even his handling of the security situation puts him out as a man set only in his ways that cannot be bothered by anything else.\n\nA Lagos based Public Affairs Commentator, Chidi John, believes that whatever traits the governor has shown during the now suspended warning strike, has always been his nature since his days as the FCT Minister. According to John, el-Rufai has always shown his tendencies for dictatorship, just as he believes only his own views are right!\n\n\u201cGovernor el-Rufai has remained constant, he has not changed. What has only happened is that he has come full circle by showing his true colours. He has displayed his person, which many of us have always known, especially those who followed his activities during his days at the FCT.\n\n\u201cNigerians must also remember that in 2008, the Nigerian Senate declared him unfit to hold public office, but somehow, the same man is in his second term as governor and even aspiring to be President. Imagine if he is President and labour or even ASUU decides to go on strike and shut down the country the way Oshiomhole did as NLC President under former President, Olusegun Obasanjo. Imagine the kind of flow of blood we would have. Imagine how the prisons will be filled to the brim. Imagine the highhandedness he will display. But for some of us, it will not be new, he has always been like that,\u201d, John said.",

          "title": "Gale of defections, exuberant APC and worried PDP",
          "text": "BY ADEKUNLE ADE-ADELEYE\n\nWhen two-term governor of Ebonyi State David Umahi defected from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC) in November 2020, the opposition PDP was unaccustomed to being spurned, let alone be capable of expressing the pain of rejection. On Thursday, the party suffered a similar blow when Cross River State governor Ben Ayade, another two-term PDP governor, defected to the ruling APC. He took along with him half of the state\u2019s lawmakers. Again, the scorned opposition has kept a brave, quizzical face. Last year, responding to Mr Umahi\u2019s defection, the PDP Board of Trustees (BoT) chairman, Walid Jubrin, had counseled his party to try to assuage feuding party leaders. Discussions, he admonished, would not hurt anyone. He has not yet spoken about the new blow, nor is it clear that PDP leaders and party chairman Uche Secondus have learnt anything from what is rising to be a gale.\n\nNeither Mr Umahi nor Professor Ayade defected without first exhibiting their frustrations with their party. Whether those frustrations were tangible enough to trigger defection is not clear. But because they are both two-term governors, it is suspected that their decisions were probably prompted by post-2023 politics. As governors, they automatically become valuable to the APC, especially on account of the strong-arm politics Nigerians play during elections. By extrapolation, and regardless of their indifference to their losses, the PDP will be right to suspect that the defections of two governors would either complicate or weaken their chances in the next elections, particularly at the state level. But for the defectors to become assets on the scale envisaged by the APC, the ruling party will have to dexterously manage the complications certain to be introduced into the politics of their state chapters.\n\nLast year, Sen Jubrin expressed some optimism about the fortunes of the PDP, notwithstanding the defection of Mr Umahi. He had said: \u201cToday, the entire South-south zone belongs to the PDP. We are happy about it. In the same way, we must ensure that we do all that is necessary to listen to the Igbo and discuss with them as a family. It is not politically right to keep quiet, while other political parties are making overtures to them. They are humans and have interest to protect.\u201d If he feared that the Ebonyi setback would be replicated less than a year later, he did not betray it. It was sufficient that he basked in the euphoria of keeping the entire South-South homogenously PDP. But the reasons given by Mr Umahi for his defection should have alarmed the party, particularly because no one could make head or tail of his arguments. It was like clutching at a straw, any straw. For a party that had done so well for Mr Umahi, it is hard to justify his complaints.\n\nMr Umahi rationalised his defection with circumlocutionary glee: \u201cI want to clear the air that I never sought (for) PDP presidential ticket and I will not. So whoever said that I moved to APC because they refused to zone the ticket to me is being very mischievous. Even if PDP promises somebody presidential ticket how does it work where over 8000 delegates will be voting?\u2026There are a lot of qualified persons from Southeast. Some people say I was promised lots of things by the APC, there was no such discussion. APC never promised me any position; they never promised Southeast any position. However, I (use) this defection as a protest to injustice being done to Southeast by the PDP \u2026 It is absurd that since 1999 going to 2023, the Southeast will never be considered to run for presidency under the PDP.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nProf Ayade\u2019s defection also came with circumlocutionary ease. He claims that his state has been \u201creduced to want in body, spirit and in soul, and a state whose revenue and resources had been taken \u2026 and territorial boundaries \u2026 tampered with.\u201d Then he argues that it is his \u201cresponsibility to re-link Cross River State to the centre.\u201d Finally, leaving his audience flummoxed, he adds the clincher: \u201cHaving seen the commitment and the sincerity of Mr. President; having seen the progress made so far and the tension created by social media manipulation; and having recognised the issues and challenges in the state and nation; it is my responsibility as the leader of the people in Cross River State, to do the needful, to assist Mr. President to succeed.\u201d It is pointless interrogating Mr Umahi\u2019s excuses and Prof Ayade\u2019s angst. They wanted a new political husband; now they have him. Let them enjoy their romp.\n\nTheir problem, it seems, is their former husband, the PDP. At the moment, the opposition party is virtually leaderless, and whatever goes for its ideology remains indistinguishable from that of the APC. Lacking in charisma, seduced by querulous governors like Rivers State\u2019s Nyesom Wike, abandoned by its former presidential candidate Abubakar Atiku, unable to come to terms with its loss in the last presidential election, and chary of embarking on the soul-searching and purges needed to remould the party and ready it for the next elections, it is not surprising that some of its leading lights are jumping ship and clambering onto the decks of the equally decrepit APC ship whose tattered sail cannot fetch any wind. Perhaps next year the PDP will snap awake and hope that the talisman with which it mesmerized the electorate back in the day would prove potent again against the clumsy foot-dragging and ebbing legitimacy of the APC.\n\nOf loans, ransom bill and ISWAP\n\nThree quick takes. President Muhammadu Buhari has written to the National Assembly to ask for their approval for a $6.18bn (N2.3trn) loan to finance part of the N5.6trn 2021 budget deficit. They will oblige him; for apart from being supinely acquiescent to his wishes, by assenting the 2021 budget months ago, they also invariably committed themselves to whatever plans the government will propose to finance the deficit. By January 2021, Nigeria already owed close to $32bn, much of it procured in less than 15 years, with the current administration relying virtually on dizzying amount of loans to work its razzmatazz. They do not think of any other way to achieve anything except by loans, and they justify its ratio as a percentage of GDP as well as ignore every argument against what is building up into debt peonage. This burdensome point was roughly where Nigeria was in 2005 when ex-president Olusegun Obasanjo secured $18bn debt relief for the country.\n\nLast Wednesday, the Senate began considering a bill to criminalise payment and receipt of ransom for the release of anyone abducted or kidnapped, imprisoned, and wrongfully confined. Sponsored by Ezenwa Francis Onyewuchi, the bill seeks to amend the Terrorism (Prevention) Act, 2013, and has scaled second reading. It is naturally silent on criminalising the government for failing to perform its most important and sacred function \u2014 the security and welfare of the people. The government has failed woefully in its responsibility to protect the people, and the victims, who do not have control of the security forces, are now to be criminalised for standing in the yawning gap created by an awkward government. Having read too much economics, the senate seeks to attack the problem of kidnapping from the supply side. It should instead seek to criminalise legislative folly.\n\nNigerians seem to be heaving a great sigh of relief that Boko Haram leader, Abubakar Shekau, has probably been done in by the rival Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP), a feat the Nigerian military was unable to accomplish in about 12 years since Mohammed Yusuf, the founder of the sect, was murdered in custody. ISWAP is deadlier, more ideological, deliberately more refined, and infinitely more implacable. Not only did ISWAP unhorse its rival with vastly less ordnance than the Nigerian military boasts of, it also proved tactically adept in that bloodied region. Now, with the inconvenience of Boko Haram out of the way, the ISIS-backed, better funded, and well equipped ISWAP can focus on Nigeria. Nigerian political elite, some of whom have flirted foolishly with religious politics or theocracy for decades, are going to have the battle of their lives.",

          "text": "A federal judge in New York has ruled that Abidemi Rufai, the suspended aide of Ogun State Governor Dapo Abiodun, can be released from detention before his trial for unemployment fraud.\n\nHowever, Federal Magistrate Judge Ramon Reyes delayed the release to let federal prosecutors appeal, according to the London Daily Mail.\n\nRufai, 42, was arrested on May 14 as he tried to travel from New York to Nigeria. He was initially denied bail after his brother, a New York attorney, declined to post a $300,000 surety bond.\n\nHe is accused of using stolen identities to take more than $350,000 in jobless benefits from the Washington State Employment Security Department last year.\n\nProsecutors had argued that Rufai was an extreme flight risk, but Reyes ruled that a New York state resident and family friend of Rufai could post the bond and serve as Rufai\u00b4s custodian until his trial in Tacoma.\n\nNekpen Soyemi, a registered nurse whose family comes from the same region of Nigeria as Rufai, told Reyes she would guarantee a $300,000 bond and allow Rufai to stay at her home pending trial.\n\nRufai also would be restricted in travel in New York City and Western Washington and would be monitored with electronic surveillance.\n\nOn Thursday, federal prosecutors in Seattle sent a letter to Reyes raising questions, including one about money allegedly deposited into a bank account in Soyemi\u00b4s name.\n\nSoyemi told the judge that her father had opened the account for her when she was in college. Soyemi said she had no knowledge of the transaction referred to by prosecutors.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nReyes delayed Rufai\u00b4s release until Tuesday. He also noted that Rufai would need to address an immigration detainer issued against him Sunday by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\n\nUnder that detainer, Rufai could be picked up by Immigration and Customs enforcement officers after his release and potentially held for deportation.\n\nMichael Barrows, Rufai\u00b4s attorney, said the conditions of his bail \u201cwere appropriate to secure his future attendance in court.\u201d\n\nFederal prosecutors said they were preparing their appeal.",

          "title": "Why my first marriage crashed \u2013Yeni Kuti",
          "text": "By Christy Anyanwu\n\nTomorrow May 24, Yeni Kuti will hit a milestone. The first child of Afrobeat legend, Fela Anikulapo- Kuti and choreographer per excellence will on that day turn 60.\n\nIn this exclusive interview, YK Power as Yeni is fondly called, opened up on her life journey to the Elders Club. Enjoy it.\n\nYou\u2019ll turn 60 this week Thursday, but you don\u2019t look it, what is the secret of your ever looking young?\n\nThere is no secret to it. I just like to live happily. I don\u2019t hold grudges; I like to be happy with myself. I like to smile and laugh a lot. Those that know me know that I love fun. If you say I look young, maybe, that is the reason.\n\nDoes it have anything to do with your genes?\n\nThat could be a very good factor as well. That probably has a major factor.\n\nGenes from your dad or mum?\n\nGenes from both of them. My grandmother passed away at 95 and she didn\u2019t really look it except when she got ill. She was smart and outgoing. I remember when she turned 70; Fela said: \u2018mum, you are not looking a day older.\u2019 My father too was quite younger than his age.\n\nHow was your growing up, coming from an influential family, were you a spoilt child?\n\nWho wants to spoil you in my family? Nobody! You will only get correct slap. I started to fend for myself at a very early age. At 18 or 19 years, I\u2019ve started fending for myself.\n\nDoing what?\n\nTrying to survive. Working and paying house rents.\n\nWere you not staying in your parents\u2019 house?\n\nMy father\u2019s house was burnt. He didn\u2019t have a house. My mother didn\u2019t have a house either. We (children) stayed with our mother and we had to pay rents. My siblings and I contributed money to pay rent. We never even had any house help growing up. We had to fetch water, wash our clothes by ourselves. We lived in Ikate, Surulere then and Ikate was known for not having running water, and nothing like house help to help fetch water.\n\nWhat lessons have you learnt about life?\n\nLife is transient. Do what you have to do when you have to do it and enjoy what you have. Try to give a good account of yourself so that when you go, you will be remembered for what you do.\n\nIn your teenage years, what was the perception like being Fela\u2019s daughter?\n\nA lot of people didn\u2019t want to be our friend because were Fela\u2019s children. A lot of people looked down on us because we\u2019re Fela\u2019s children. It\u2019s a totally different ball game now. Growing up, it wasn\u2019t like that. If you went to your friends house and they knew you\u2019re Fela\u2019s child, the children will be warned not to mingle with you. That is if they didn\u2019t tell it to your face there and then. Even now at 60, I still remember the incident that happened one day. My uncle, Prof Olukoye\u2019s son introduced me to a girl, Bisola, and there and then she snapped into anger, telling my cousin never in his life should he introduce her to such people again. It\u2019s an experience that stuck with me for a very long time. I was 17 then and I\u2019m 60 now, but I still remember that episode very well.\n\nWas it the same perception that also affected your first marriage?\n\nNo, not at all. It\u2019s just irreconcilable differences between my husband and me. It\u2019s not about being Fela\u2019s daughter.\n\nYou used to teach ladies how to dance Afrobeat. Do you still dance?\n\nOf course yes, I still dance. But you know, we have been on lockdown, so that part remains hazy for now.\n\nAre you saying you still have stamina to dance?\n\nYes. I\u2019m even going to do a video of the old Positive Bands dances. I am going to do a short video to show that I can still dance. I would post it on Instagram soon.\n\nA few years ago, you reportedly got married, what happened to the relationship?\n\nWe are married spiritually not legally. I think spiritual marriage is more important than legal, because we are tied together spiritually.\n\nWere you married in a church or mosque?\n\nThat one is just on paper! We didn\u2019t need church or mosque to get married. Our spirits are married. We are fully committed to each other. You don\u2019t need any church, mosque or registry to join you together. Just to let you know, we are driving out of town for the weekend.\n\nHow did you cope during the COVID-19 lockdown?\n\nVery badly! It was terrible. We lost a lot of money. But that is life; we have ups and downs. I thank God we are no longer in lockdown. I think the Lagos State government felt our pain and so they eased the lockdown. You lock people up and they don\u2019t have palliatives like that of abroad. How are they going to survive? In Nigeria, people make money daily, how are they going to survive without going out on a daily basis? I think we shouldn\u2019t be copying Oyinbo people. But I\u2019m glad that Lagos State government took the initiative to open up.\n\nWho influenced you more growing up, your dad or your mum?\n\nBoth. They both had values that I emulated and live for today. My father was more political. My mother was on the home front. She loved us unconditionally. For my mum, it\u2019s her children first. She sacrificed for us her children. That was why when she died, I gave up dancing so that I could take care of my daughter. My political belief and the way I think as an African woman is what I took from my father. My grandmother too influenced me a lot, in the way I think and act.",

          "title": "2023: Why APC won\u2019t ignore zoning \u2014Odigie-Oyegun",
          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nFormer National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, is an asset and embodiment of everything rolled into one. He is a quintessential public servant, an astute political party administrator, a political icon and many more.\n\nFielding questions from Sunday Sun in this no-hold-barred interview on the state of the nation held in Abuja, he touched virtually on every aspect of national life.\n\nFrom the controversial zoning arrangement in the ruling party ahead of the 2023 presidential poll, the peace of the graveyard in the APC household in his home state, Edo, the kind of president he wants in 2023 to the worrisome, disturbing spate of insecurity in the country.\n\nHis straightforwardness, brazenness and courage in tackling the issues actually left no one in doubt that he is still a delight any day anytime. In fact, it is Chief Oyegun at his best.\n\nSome people that were surprised when you attended the Edo APC dialogue meeting recently asked whether you are still a member of the APC?\n\nThis is the real deep problem we have in this country. It is a pity that people think that way especially that you cannot have a deep, but very sincere difference of opinion because you are on the same platform. We were not charging the APC, but only saying that the decision that was about to be taken was wrong. We only have a difference of opinion, but did not differ as to the quality of the APC and the desirability of the APC, no, not at all. We both wanted the APC to win in Edo State, but unfortunately some of us felt that it was taken wrongly. I have never at any point announced that I have left the APC because if I did, the media will know. I did not do that and I don\u2019t intend to do that. While the issue that created the problem was resolved by the people, we just moved on. In this country, we must get used to misinterpreting difference of opinion to mean disloyalty. They are entirely two different things and if that is not allowed to happen, that is if you can\u2019t have different opinions, then you cannot have people of principle in the party who will tell you things as they really are not as you want it. As for the meeting, when you do something based on principle, there will be no regret and I suppose the same thing happened on the other side. They also strongly believe that what they were doing was right. It was a simple difference in opinion and principle strongly felt and pursued to a logical conclusion. The people became the arbiters as to who was right and who was wrong. There was nothing personal attached to it at all. It was not a personal quarrel and once the struggle was over, we moved on.\n\nWill it be right to conclude that the APC in Edo is now peacefully united under one umbrella?\n\nYes, it is under one united umbrella, but you cannot at any stage in any human organisation or grouping claim that there is total unanimity of opinions and direction. It is impossible for that to happen and that never happens. The reality, of course, will be that those who felt that they have lost something because of the way the election went will continue to feel residue of either regret for doing what they did or bitterness that somebody else, a third party, was the cause of their misfortune. That will always happen, but it is residual and will disappear over time. We have the future ahead of us and if we continue to live in the past, we will never arrive in the future. Yes, it is over and it is over, but that bitterness will naturally be there especially in a human organisation as I said earlier.\n\nWith what happened to Governor Obaseki, will you still say that this is the APC of your dream?\n\nIt could not have been the APC of my dream. The decision taken against Obaseki was not based on principle. There was too much of personal bitterness and that was the way it looked. You want a particular result at all costs and it is wrong to do politics like that. You must take your person out of it and deal with principle, deal with what is right and what is wrong not because somebody offended you or did not offend you that made you prefer something else. The truth is that we have a sitting governor and you must have a provable, incontrovertible disloyalty to the party before you treat a sitting governor in that manner, but there was no such thing on the table. As I said before, I hope the country and the whole political parties must have learnt from that experience, especially that the people are not as reverent as they used to be. We underestimate them to our own peril or detriment. They think, they know what is right and wrong and an individual or group should not force things willy-nilly down their throat. It can\u2019t just work. You can see all over the place that the issue of godfatherism is creating problems for virtually every political party and we are hoping that the Edo experience will make lots of people learn that there are limits to the perceived or so-called exaggerated influence of godfathers. This relationship has failed in many cases unfortunately to the detriment of the people. You can have mentors, but when you have mentored somebody and he has become an adult, please allow him to make his own mistakes and learn. You cannot continue to carry him on your back because his weight will even be too much for you. If you mentor somebody, step back and let him make mistakes and if he does, give him advice, but don\u2019t decapitate him because you mentored him.\n\nWill it be right to say that the Edo saga kept the APC in its present condition of having a Caretaker Committee arrangement as its national leadership?\n\nIt was not just an Edo experience. There were lots of other issues, but I don\u2019t want to go into that because I am somebody who looks at the future not the past in the hope that we have learnt from the past and will not be repeating the mistakes later in the future. Inasmuch as I don\u2019t want to go back to what happened, you know very well that there were lots of issues from all sides before the situation became untenable and what happened happened. It was very unfortunate, but I don\u2019t think going into the past will help matters.\n\nWill you encourage Governor Obaseki to return to the APC?\n\nObaseki was chased out of the party and if he decides to come back, what is surprising in that. I don\u2019t know if he wants to come back and I am not telling you he wants to come back. But, if he decides to, there is nothing wrong with it. How many people have gone to one party and come back. It is a daily occurrence. When we formed the party, how many governors came from the PDP, there were lots of them, but today many have returned to the PDP. If he decides of his own accord to come back, I am very sure he will be well received very warmly.\n\nDo you share the apprehension in many quarters that the APC is facing a bleak future ahead of 2023 with the divisions within the party?\n\nTell me the political party who does not have disagreement within its fold now. We all have disagreements, but if what you are saying is that the nation under the governing party is going through difficult times, there is no question about that. We are certainly going through difficult and challenging times. We must find answers to the security problem in the country because things cannot just continue the way they are. It is obvious, but the solution does not rest in condemning. The solution to this difficulty must be found because the people are unhappy and hungry and APC as the party in power must find the solution to all of these.\n\nWill you say that the APC government has failed Nigerians?\n\nOf course, the party has not failed Nigerians. Yes, there are issues and they must find answers to those issues, yes things are difficult and lots of nations go through difficulties, but that does not automatically become a failure or total failure. Yes, we made some promises but you should remember what the economists use to say, that all things being equal and things cannot be equal because the world economy tumbled, oil price tumbled and lots of things happened totally outside the control of the party. Yes, I totally agree that we probably could have handled things better and I am not going to be the one who will say that everything is going on well 100 per cent, but to say that the APC government has failed is an unfair judgment. Yes, we would have done better but we still have time to correct it. God help us if we don\u2019t succeed in correcting or ameliorating the situation then we will have a bit of trouble.\n\nJudging by the situation now, will it be a mission possible for the APC to retain the power beyond 2023?\n\nHow will I know, we don\u2019t know who the candidate will be. He could turn out to be a charismatic person. Anything can happen and we should not start playing God between now and 2023. Let us leave judgmental politics of 2023 for now and concentrate on the future of this country and how we are going to get out of our present predicaments.\n\nCan you re-emphasis your stand on the ragging issue of restructuring?\n\nWell, we have made our submission and recommendations on restructuring. It is very clear and has been accepted as APC policy, but I am not in the system directly now and may not be able to tell you what is holding it back. Restructuring is part of the APC until it is rescinded and it has not been rescinded to the best of my knowledge. We have a booklet on restructuring which deals with every single aspect of it. It defines restructuring from confederation to devolution of powers to the state and people, even wanting the geopolitical zones to become the confederating units. So, we decided to define what restructuring meant to the APC and went on to make recommendations how it can be handled. It is clear there. The report was approved by the NEC of the party and it is just the implementation that we are looking for. We will continue to wait hoping that one day it will have to be implemented. We can\u2019t run away from it.\n\nWhat do you advise the APC Caretaker Committee on the controversy in conducting the national convention?\n\nWhat is the controversy in conducting a national convention when they are preparing to do it? They have said they are proposing a committee of 70 members to conduct the convention. As far as I am concerned, there is no controversy in organising the convention. They will do it.\n\nHow best can the government handle the spate of secessionist agitations across the country?\n\nIt is something that must be brought under control otherwise all sorts of characters and interests will start exploiting the situation from their own end. And the different groups have different objections whether it is Boko Haram, IPOB or the rest. The fact that there is relative instability is giving that urge to exploit the situation. It is something that the government must have to bring under control. And the earlier we do that the better for the country. One point I must make is the horror with which I view the seeming methodical attacks on our national police. It is becoming something of worry and it is an institution that must be defended. It needs lots of reorganising, but it should not become targets of attack for all and sundry. That totally is not in the national interest, it is not acceptable and whatever needs to be done to protect the Nigerian police must be done with all the issues and problems that they have. This is because without the police, we will have anarchy. So, they must be protected and preserved.\n\nWhat is your take on the controversial issue of zoning of the 2023 presidential ticket in the APC?\n\nIt is the media that are making zoning a serious issue and problem. First and foremost, one thing clear is that it is the responsibility of the person interested in an office to make his intention very clear and work towards it because nobody is going to bring that office on a platter to say congratulations, it is your turn. The person must struggle for it. Otherwise, zoning is not an issue because it happens in everyday life all over the world. It comes with various names like balancing, gender equality or anything, targeted at giving a sense of belonging to disadvantaged areas or persons. In USA, they call it the industrial, agricultural, urban or rural bed. In choosing people, they take votes from these areas into consideration. In Nigeria, it is an existential problem. The situation is such that you must make everybody feel a sense of belonging, sense of participation, sense of equal access even up to ward level. In my ward, we have large rural areas. You cannot take all the representatives from Benin City because it is where the elite and knowledgeable people are. It is simple common sense and I don\u2019t understand why we make all these noise over zoning when it is part of our everyday life. As for the APC arrangement, zoning does not have to be in the constitution even though it is there with all the balancing and federal character. It is only a very stupid party that will continuously take its candidate from a particular zone. Any party that wishes itself out of existence can say that there is no zoning. We will continue arguing over it and the media will continue feasting on it. When they want extremists to make a statement that will shake the whole place they will go to them. But at the end of the day, the parties are not stupid and they don\u2019t wish themselves out of existence. They will still do the balancing required to convince the nation of the need to stay together and tell people that they belong and have equal access. It is inevitable.\n\nIs it possible for the youths to constitute themselves into a third force and take over power from your generation?\n\nIt must happen. The youths must take over whether my generation likes it or not because if we don\u2019t leave, nature will send us away. Of course, we will not live forever. But who do you call youths? List all the serving governors and tell me their ages. Are they old men? No. Go to the National Assembly and tell me how many of the lawmakers are moving with walking sticks. It is the samething at the State Assembly and local government areas, the youths are there. They can take over everywhere but they have to work for it just like I said about zoning. There is no alternative to that. There is no way the elders at 80 or 70 years will voluntarily handover the mantle of leadership to the youths and move away. It does not work that way. Nature arranges it. But, it is how well the youths present themselves to even the voters, not just the leaders of the nation, at that material time that matters.\n\nIs it over for you in any elective position?\n\nIt is very, very much over for me. We just talked about the youths taking over and I am no longer a youth by any stretch of imagination. I am on extra time now. You amuse me when you say what if Nigerians clamour for me to contest for president. Nobody will do that because at my age it is totally and completely out of the question.\n\nWhat are those things you will consider your unfulfilled dreams?\n\nThat should be a question for another day. There are so many and very difficult to list them and I will rather say what I was hoping will be my situation today and that is that I will say, thank you Lord because our country is finally on the path to greatness, but I cannot say that now and that is one regret I have. So, I am thanking God for what I have been able to achieve personally rather than where our nation is currently. As far as personal achievements are concerned, I am fulfilled. I only went into politics because I want to do my bit to help place Nigeria squarely by the time I am on my deathbed. I will have that complete conviction that we are now on the path to greatness. We are the largest black nation in the world. I am not thinking of my personal achievements because God has been absolutely kind to me and I have absolutely no reason to complain about that. The sole motivation for being in politics and public service is to see Nigeria on the path to greatness. I joined politics reluctantly. It is a mission not a job.\n\nWhat is your advice to the electorate and candidates ahead of 2023?\n\nI don\u2019t have any advice for them until I know who and who that are coming out to aspire to lead us. I cannot even advise myself now until I know who and who wants to lead us. We need a very strong candidate, a candidate of character, who understands governance and who can deliver on the hopes of the people of the country.\n\nWhat is your dream president for Nigeria in 2023?\n\nI kept telling people that the next Nigeria president must be slightly crazy because Nigeria is a difficult country.\n\nDid it surprise you hearing the PDP governors describe the APC government as incompetent and rudderless?\n\nWell, that is PDP and they are the opposition and I didn\u2019t expect them to do anything differently. This is what we did to them to get them out of office and they are just paying us in our own coins. They are opposition party and it is when we have such reactions within the party that such issues will be of any concern.",

          "text": "By Enyeribe Ejiogu, Desmond Mgboh (Kano), Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Molly Kilete, Romanus Ugwu, Ndubuisi Orji (Abuja), Rose Ejembi (Makurdi), John Adams (Minna), Sola Ojo (Kaduna), Priscilla Ediare (Ado-Ekiti), Stanley Uzoaru (Owerri), Paul Osuyi (Asaba), Chijioke Agwu (Abakaliki), Laide Raheem (Abeokuta),\n\nThe body of late Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lt. General Ibrahim Attahiru, who perished in the ill-fated Nigerian Air Force plane, which crashed in Kaduna on Friday, was laid to rest yesterday in Abuja. He was buried at exactly 4:45 pm.\n\nAlso buried were the bodies of the three Brigadier-Generals, namely, Ahmed Kuliya, O.L Olayinka and M.I Abdulkadir, two Majors N. Hamza and L.A Hayat, two Flight Lieutenants, two Sergeants and one Aircraft Man, who died in the same crash.\n\nThe bodies of the deceased were conveyed from Kaduna to the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, in a C-130 aircraft and were received by Service Chiefs and top military officers. The bodies were then conveyed to the church and mosque respectively for the Christian and Muslim for funeral prayers.\n\nAfter the funeral services, the bodies were then moved to the National Military Cemetery.\n\nBurial ceremony started with the arrival of the Minister of Defence, Major General Bashir Magashi, who represented President Muhammadu Buhari; the Senate President, Ahmed Lawan; Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha; Chief of Staff to the President, Prof Ibrahim Gambari, very senior retired and serving officers and former Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General ubuike Ihejirika. Others who were present were Chief of Defence Staff, General Lucky Irabor; Minister for Information, Alhaji Lai Mohammed and the Inspector General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba. Also in attendance were Lt. General Dambazau; Kaduna State governor Nasir el-Rufai, presidents of the Defence and Police Officers Wives Association (DEPOWA), Nigerian Officers Wives Association (NAFOWA) and Naval Officers Wives Association (NOWA).\n\nIn his address on the occasion, the Chief of Defence Staff, General Irabor, said the officers died as a result of their love for the country. He said their deaths would not be in vain. He assured that the war on insecurity must be won. He described the late COAS as \u201cnot just a fine officer but one with passion, very professional, had love for the job and a very dependable colleague.\u201d\n\nHe assured the families of the deceased that the armed forces, the Federal Government and the Nigerian nation would not abandon them.\n\nAlso speaking, the Minister of Defence, Magashi, said the demise of the COAS and the other officers was a huge blow to the nation, but assured of government\u2019s continuous support to the officers and men of the military and their families.\n\nMeanwhile, a torrent of condolence messages have continued to pour in as governors and other notable Nigerians expressed shock and grief over the tragic demise of COAS Attahiru and the other members of his entourage and the four-man crew of the military aircraft.\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo, expressed sadness over the death of the Lt. General Ibrahim Attahiru, and the other military officers in an air crash.\n\nHis words: \u201cTheir death while in active service in the defense of our country reflects the depth of sacrifice our military officers, men and women of the other ranks are often prepared to make.\n\n\u201cWe honour the service of the Army Chief and all those involved in this unfortunate accident even as we continue to demonstrate our profound appreciation to all in our military services and in harm\u2019s way. The gallantry of these heroes would always be remembered.\n\n\u201cI join the President and Commander-in-Chief of the Nigerian Armed Forces to commiserate with families, friends and colleagues of these gallant officers and men who died in the crash. I pray that God grants them the fortitude to bear the loss. May the memories of the departed remain ever blessed.\u201d\n\nThe Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mustapha, and members of the Federal Executive Council (FEC), have described death of Lt. Gen. Attahiru and 10 other senior military officers and service member, as shocking.\n\nIn a statement by the Director, Information, Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Willie Bassey, the cabinet members noted that COAS was passionate and professional in the discharge of the responsibilities of his office especially the prosecution of internal security operations across the country, since his appointment in January 2021.\n\nImo State governor Hope Uzodimma in a condolence letter to President Muhammadu Buhari, described the late COAS as among the best, a true officer and gentleman who epitomised the finest qualities of the Nigerian Army.\n\n\u201cIndeed to lose such a gallant general whose services to the nation had just reached its peak is most disheartening. It is even more heartrending, when he was tragically sent to the world beyond with other officers on the same day,\u201d Uzodimma said.\n\nSimilarly, former military administrator of Delta State (rtd), Air Commodore Luke Ochulor, noted that the late COAS died when he was mostly needed, adding that the nation would miss him.\n\nGovernor of the State of Osun, Mr. Adegboyega Oyetola, on his verified Twitter handle and Facebook page commiserated with President Buhari and the families of the deceased and urged Nigerians not to mourn like unbelievers.\n\nGovernor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State who also commiserated with President Buhari and the Nigerian Army, described the tragic death of Attahiru as \u201cdeeply saddening.\u201d\n\nThe governor also condoled with the deceased\u2019s Doka community, the people of Kaduna North Local Government Area and Kaduna State government over the tragedy.\n\nChairman of the South East Governors Forum and Ebonyi State governor Dave Umahi described the COAS\u2019s death as not only a colossal loss, but a national calamity. He called on Nigerians to pray for the repose of the souls of the late Army Chief and other gallant members of the Armed Forces who died in the plane crash. He urged the Federal Government to immediately commence investigation into the matter.\n\nSimilarly, Rivers State governor, Nyesom Wike, said he was saddened by catastrophic crash that claimed the lives of Lt. General Attahiru and the other members of his entourage, saying their demise was a colossal loss to the nation.\n\nHe recalled how Attahiru visited the Government House, Port Harcourt, and with clarity articulated his vision and strategy to end insurgency in the country.\n\nIn his condolence message, Benue State governor, Samuel Ortom, said the death of the COAS and the other very senior officers was a major setback to the fight against insecurity in the country. Ortom posited that the late COAS demonstrated commitment to tackling the wave of insecurity since his assumption of office earlier this year.\n\nThe All Progressives Congress (APC) described Attahiru as a \u201cgallant soldier that served Nigeria with honour and dignity. The party in a statement signed by the National Secretary, Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, James Akpanudoedehe, said that it was in deep shock over the demise of the COAS, which it described as a great national loss.\n\nThe People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday, demanded an extensive probe into the plane crash that killed, Lt General Attahiru and 10 others, as well as other air mishaps involving military officers, in recent times.\n\nThe PDP, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said it was grieved by the death of the COAS and other officers in the military plane crash on Friday.\n\nThe party described \u201cAttahiru and the other officers as heroes who gave their lives for the security of our nation,\u201d adding that the tragic incident was a huge blow to Nigeria.\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA, Brig. General Mohamed Buba Marwa (retd), in a statement by NDLEA\u2019s Director, Media and Advocacy, Femi Babafemi, said that the death of Attahiru was a great loss to the country. Marwa, who sent his condolence message from Vienna, Austria, where he is attending a meeting of the United Nations Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, recalled his recent meeting with Gen. Attahiru, saying that he was impressed with the late army chief\u2019s plans for tackling the security challenges confronting the country.\n\nAlso grieving over the death of Attahiru and members of his entourage, the National Rescue Movement (NRM), said: \u201cThe death of these gallant soldiers is most regrettable, especially considering the height of insecurity in the land and ongoing efforts of the Lt. General Attahiru\u2019s led army, to contain same, since his assumption of office a few months ago as the Chief of Army Staff.\u201d\n\nNRM called for a thorough investigation into the incident, to unravel the circumstances that resulted in the painful national disaster in order to forestall future occurrence.\n\nThe North Central Governor\u2019s Forum in a statement by the chairman of the forum and Governor of Niger State, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, described the plane crash which claimed the lives of Attahiru and the other senior officers who perished with him as \u201cnot only worrisome but a great set back to the nation at this trying moment of security challenges bedeviling the nation.\u201d\n\nOgun State governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, while condoling the President Buhari, and the bereaved families, said: \u201cThese accomplished officers died while their services were most needed in the nation\u2019s search for peace and security. They served meritoriously in the military and their untimely exit is very painful.\u201d\n\nEkiti State governor, Kayode Fayemi, who also condoled the family of Attahiru, described him as a \u201cpatriotic and fearless officer who was always ready to go the extra mile to protect the sovereignty of his beloved country, a quality that was the hallmark of his military career.\u201d\n\nMembers of the House of Representatives called for a thorough probe of the air crash that claimed the life Attahiru, while urging the government to immortalise him by intensifying the war against insurgency.\n\nThe minority caucus, in a statement by the minority leader, Ndudi Elumelu, described the late Attahiru and the other officers involved in the crash as \u201cvery courageous and patriotic soldiers, who gave all in the defence of our dear fatherland. Our caucus calls for a system-wide investigation into the cause of the crash as well as the last two crashes of our military planes which also led to the loss of lives of our gallant and promising officers.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the Chairman, House Committee on Defence, Babajimi Benson, said the demise of the officers was a colossal loss to the country while the Chairman, House Committee on Army, Abdulrasak Namdas, described the deceased COAS as \u201can energetic officer, who was committed to improving the security of the country, especially prosecuting the war against insurgency.\u201d",

General Ibrahim Attahiru, for his gallantry in the war against insurgency and described him as a military chief, who led from the front.\n\nSpeaking at the burial of the fallen officers and men, President Buhari, who said it was a sad day for Nigeria, hinted that the late army chief was appointed as successor to Lt. Gen. Tukur Buratai, because of his bravery.\n\nIn the same vein, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, who joined millions of people across the world to mourn the passing of Attahiru and others said, their deaths in service reflected the depth of their sacrifice.\n\nThis is as former President Goodluck Jonathan, in a message of condolence to the families of the deceased officers, described them as patriots, who died with their boots on.\n\nBut the Borno State Governor, Professor Babangana Zulum, said the late chief of army staff was evidently committed to the fight against Boko Haram and was determined to significantly contribute to ending the insurgency.\n\nIn his remarks, the Chief of Defence Staff, General Lucky Irabor, who said the death of the army chief and other personnel was a sad day for the military, however, promised that sacrifices of the deceased would not be in vain.\n\nThe late army chief and ten other military officers, who died in an air crash in Kaduna, while on official assignment, were laid to rest at the National Military Cemetery, Abuja, at a ceremony attended by the Senate President, Dr. Ahmed Lawan; Governor of Kaduna State, Mallam Nasir el-Rufai and the Chief of Staff to the President, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari.\n\nOthers were the Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni; Minister of Defence, Bashir Magashi; the Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammadu Sa\u2019ad Abubakar; Inspector General of Police, Usman Alkali baba and the Comptroller General of Immigration, Muhammed Babandede, amongst other serving and former public office holders, top military officers, families, friends and associates of the deceased.\n\nThe senior military officers, who died in the crash include the army chief, Attahiru, Brig-General Idris Abdulkadir, Brig Gen Olayinka, Brigadier-General Kuliya, ADC to the late COAS, Major LA Hayat, Major Hamza and Sergeant Umar.\n\nThe list of the crew members are Flight. Lt. T.O Asaniyi, Flt. Lt. AA Olufade, Sgt Adesina and ACM Oyedepo.\n\nBuhari, who was represented by the Minister of Defence, Major General Bashir Magashi (rtd), said the army chief and the officers served the nation gallantly.\n\n\u201cLieutenant General Attahiru was an epitome of gallantry and bravery which culminated in his being appointed the chief of army staff.\n\n\u201cHe led the Nigerian Army from the front and was emulated by others. He will be remembered for his landmark contributions to the unity of the nation\u201d, he said, expressing his heartfelt condolences to the families of the departed officers and men and all Nigerians.\n\nIrabor, who said the death of the army chief and other personnel was a sad day for the military, described the late army chief as a reliable, professional colleague. He recalled the time both of them served at the army\u2019s Training and Doctrine Command in Minna.\n\n\u201cI called him my second in command. We had dreams to take the military to greater heights. This is what we were doing when we were called by the defence minister to report to Abuja. He has left at a time he was needed most\u201d, he said.\n\nThe defence chief said the military establishment mourned with the families of the army chief and others.\n\n\u201cWe say to you, weep not for the sacrifices of our colleagues will not be in vain\u201d, he said, assuring them that the president and the military would continue to support them, adding that the the military remained undaunted by the development with regards to its fight against criminal elements.\n\n\u201cThe armed forces remained undaunted. The war against insecurity must be won. For the military, let\u2019s march to defend the country from all forms of security threats\u201d, he said.\n\nEarlier in his remarks at the funeral service held at the the Nigerian Airforce Protestant Church, Bill Clinton Drive, Airport Road, Abuja, Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr. Boss Mustapha, spoke in tandem with the Chaplain of the church, Group Captain Dogo Gani, whose sermon was on the topic: \u201cConfidence in God\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe chaplain said that our confidence is domicille in God. We urge the families to have confidence in God. The God in heaven that watched this happen will be with you and keep you\u201d, he said.\n\nHe also told the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Oladayo Amao, who had earlier expressed sadness on the loss of the officers, to be confident.\n\n\u201cI know that CAS will be asking himself, why is this happening under my watch. Be confident in God. Don\u2019t doubt God\u201d, he said.\n\nDirector, Chaplaincy Protestant Church, Nigerian Air Force, Group Capt. Gani, who spoke at the funeral service for the fallen officers, warned Nigerians against undue confidence in riches and position, which he said could lead to disappointment.\n\nGani, who anchored his sermon on Psalm 23, warned against undue confidence in riches and position,which could lead to disappointment. He urged the families of the departed, the armed forces and Nigerians to put their confidence in the Lord.\n\n\u201cNo matter the challenge, the situation, don\u2019t give up. Our Lord is willing and able\u201d, he reassured.\n\nOsinbajo, who was said to have received the news of the mishap with great sadness, however, said the gallantry of the deceased officers would always be remembered.\n\nIn a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Laolu Akande, Osinbajo said,\u201dTheir death while in active service in the defense of our country reflects the depth of sacrifice our military officers, men and women of the other ranks are often prepared to make.\u201d\n\nHis three-paragraph statement stated further: \u201cI received with great sadness the news of an air crash involving the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. General Ibrahim Attahiru, and other officers of the Nigerian military yesterday.\n\n\u201cWe honour the service of the Army Chief and all those involved in this unfortunate accident even as we continue to demonstrate our profound appreciation to all in our military services and in harm\u2019s way. The gallantry of this heroes would always be remembered.\n\n\u201cI join the President and Commander-in-Chief of the Nigerian Armed Forces to commiserate with families, friends and colleagues of these gallant officers and men, who died in the crash. I pray that God grants them the fortitude to bear the loss. May the memories of the departed remain ever blessed.\u201d\n\nJonathan, in his message of condolence to the families of the deceased said, \u201cI extend my condolences to the Commander-in-Chief, President Muhammadu Buhari, Nigerian Armed Forces and the families of Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru, the late Chief of Army Staff and other military officers, who died on Friday in an air crash in Kaduna State.\n\n\u201cThe death of these officers is a national tragedy, as the victims were patriots, who died with their boots on, in our collective quest for peace and security. May God console the families of all the bereaved and restore unto them strength and peace.\u201d\n\nIn his comment, Zulum said Attahiru was evidently committed to the fight against Boko Haram and was determined to significantly contribute to ending the insurgency.\n\n\u201cThe commitment of the late chief of army staff to the fight against Boko Haram was very obvious. Within the short time he served, he had been to Borno on multiple occasions, meeting operational commanders and troops at battle fronts. In all his interactions, he regularly motivated troops. The people of Borno thank him and all our gallant fallen heroes for their unquantifiable service to Borno and rest of Nigeria\u201d Zulum said.\n\nZulum was however joined by his predecessor, Senator Kashim Shettima, Senator Abubakar Kyari and other top dignitaries and hundreds of sympathizers for the jana\u2019iza (funeral prayers) in honour ofAttahiru.\n\nBodies of the late COAS and five others were brought by military ambulances to the national mosque for the funeral prayers that took place immediately after zuhr prayers.\n\nThe fallen officers were given the traditional 21-gun salute, amidst a mammoth crowd of sympathisers, before the interment which took place at 4:15pm. Each fallen personnel including the late army chief were buried by their course mates and service chiefs.\n\nThe late chief of army staff had since his appointment, been to Borno state more than six times, to supervise ongoing military operations against Boko Haram. He had visited different army formations, mobilised and motivated troops in front lines in peace building efforts.\n\nSanwo-Olu: A Dutiful, Committed Soldier Is Gone\n\nLagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has described the late Chief of Army Staff, Lt.

          "text": "\u2022As party leadership accuses gov of undue complacency\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nNew facts have shown that economic factors far more outweighed the political reasons that necessitated the recent defection of the Cross River State governor, Ben Ayade, from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nEven more, the governor\u2019s alleged complacent attitude also contributed to why members of the National Assembly outplayed him in the wards, local and state congresses elections in the state.\n\nA top source within the National Working Committee (NWC) of the PDP said the economic issue played out more than the governor losing the PDP structures in the state.\n\nTHISDAY gathered a bait of returning some, at least 20 oil wells out of the 76 that were ceded to Akwa Ibom by federal government, largely informed why Ayade left the PDP.\n\nAccording to the source, \u201cSince the APC lost the bids to have a foothold in Bayelsa and later Edo States, out of the desperation to have the APC in the South-south, the ruling shifted attention to Cross River State, using the bait of returning some of the 76 oil ceded to Akwa Ibom State to Cross River.\u201d\n\nThe source explained that Governor Ayade had since 2019 sought return of some of the 76 oil wells ceded to Akwa Ibom following the ruling of the Supreme Court in 2012, saying the ceding of the oil-rich peninsula was illegal and therefore maintained that the loss of the oil wells was an \u201cact of gross injustice and the APC jump to it as a working tool.\u201d\n\nAyade had alleged unconscionable injustices meted out to the state by the federal government, regretting the takeover of Bakassi Peninsula by Cameroun as well as the non-reimbursement of funds spent on federal roads, which forced him to call for a political solution.\n\n\u201cThis was one of the reasons that Senator Ita Giwa has thrown her support for the defection\u201d, the source said, explaining that Mama Bakassi as she was called, believed that the offer could help the economic development of the state.\n\n\u201cSo, the defection was imminent as the APC-led federal government want to ensure a control of a state in the South-south,\u201d the source stressed\n\nIta-Giwa had told newsmen shortly after Ayade defected to the APC that the governor was the political leader in the state and she would always go where he leads.\n\n\u201cWe have a leader in the state and wherever he moves to my loyalty is with him\u201d.\n\nIta-Giwa, who was a founding member of All Nigeria People\u2019 Party, ANPP has moved between PDP and APC four times since 1999.\n\nGiving reasons for his defection, Ayade said injustice and meddling in the affairs of his state led him to move to APC\n\n\u201cIt is my responsibility to bring back Cross River to the center to enhance our fortune. We need to work ahead with our President for the future of our country\u201d, he said, noting that the territorial integrity of the state has been interfered with and that it was his responsibility to \u201cresocket\u2019 the state back to its proper disposition.\n\nHowever, the national leadership of the PDP, a source claimed, believed that Ayade lost the control of the party structures in the state due to his complacent attitude to party issues.\n\nThe source said it has always been the party policy that governors control political party structures in their state, but \u201cthe governor was very complacent and members of the National Assembly in the state moved and took the party structures from him.\n\n\u201cIt was after this slumber that he woke up and demanded that the NWC should intervene and restore the party structures to him. He was the architect of himself missing out in the power structures to members of the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cAs a governor, he ought to have moved to take full charge of affairs in the state.

          "text": "\u2022 Global Rights accuses govs of paying criminals to buy peace\n\n\u2022 Says impunity now motivation for criminal activities\n\nGboyega Akinsanmi\n\nNo fewer than 340 operatives of the defence and security services died during separate armed attacks that took place nationwide between January and April 2021, Global Rights, an international human rights organisation based in Washington D.C., has revealed in a new report.The report, which covered the violent incidents nationwide, also revealed that the numbers of lives lost between January and April, painted a dreary picture of the declining state of security and increase in human rights infractions across the federation.\n\nThe incidents were revealed in the Mass Atrocities Casualties Tracking Report, a publication of Global Rights, obtained by THISDAY at the weekend, signposting unprecedented deterioration in the state of security when compared with the previous year.\n\nIn its 2020 report, for instance, Global Rights claimed that Nigeria\u2019s sub-national governments had lost confidence in the capacity of the federal government to provide security amid rising cases of mass atrocities that claimed 4,558 lives nationwide in 2020.\n\nIt had also claimed that the reported cases of mass atrocities in 2020 represented a 42.9% increase above 3,188 incidents recorded nationwide in 2019, thereby making 2020 a brutal year for most Nigerians amid the outbreaks of COVID-19 and the eruption of #EndSARS protests\n\nIt had revealed that mass atrocities-related killings by region affected no fewer than 1527 (33.5%) in the Northwest with Katsina, the home state of President Muhammadu Buhari, recording second highest after Kaduna; 1508 (33.08%) in the Northeast, 685 (15.03%) in the North-central, 443 (9.72%) in the South-south, 231 (5.07%) in the South-west and 162 (3.55%) in the South-east\n\nHowever, according to the update released to THISDAY by the organisation, the country\u2019s defence and security services incurred loss of 340 security personnel fatalities nationwide between January and April 2021 alone.\n\nOf the 340 security personnel fatalities, the report revealed that the Nigerian Army lost 193 officers to violent incidents; the Nigeria Police 131; the Nigeria Navy four; the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) three; the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) three and the Nigerian Correctional Service two and Civilian JTF four.\n\nWhile the report put the security personnel fatalities at 340 between January and April 2021, it revealed that violent killings claimed 2,260 lives nationwide within the same timeframe equivalent to 50.4% of total fatalities that occurred in 2020.\n\nBased on geo-political zones, according to the report, 989 violent fatalities were recorded in Northwest; 332 in Northeast; 331 in North Central; 256 in Southeast; 191 in Southwest and 161 South-south.\n\nGlobal Rights, in a remark by its Executive Director, Abiodun Baiyewu, concluded that Nigeria \u201cis clearly a fragile state, and remains vulnerable to combustion from several forms of atrocities. The question to ask is: what are its government and citizens doing to stem the tide?\u201d\n\nWith the huge records of unresolved crimes, the organisation observed that Nigeria\u2019s penchant of covering multitudes of crimes with the blanket of impunity and amnesty does not augur well for the country.\n\nRather, according to the Washington-based rights organisation, the reign of impunity has emboldened perpetrators to increase their activities and serves as a motivation for other actors to cash in on the monopoly of violence.\n\nIt, therefore, noted that lack of trust in the government to ensure justice \u201cis a motivation for reprisal attacks by aggrieved persons and communities.\n\n\u201cIn spite of the hundreds of armed pillages that have occurred in the North, security agents have barely been able to make arrests. There have been no prosecutions for these crimes. The same lens would apply to kidnaps, and communal conflicts.\u201d\n\nIn spite of its continued denial, the organisation noted that several sources \u201chave documented attempts by some state governors to placate organized criminal groups \u2013 paying fat ransoms to kidnappers and offering cashback to bandits in exchange for their weapons and assurance of security.\u201d\n\nIt, however, warned that huge ransoms paid \u201cto kidnappers by the government sets a dangerous precedent that will encourage criminality rather than quell it.\n\n\u201cOrganised criminal groups who maim people, rape women, destroy properties and cause severe humanitarian crises should be made to face the wrath of the law rather than be mollycoddled,\u201d the organisation recommended.\n\nIt added that the latest mass kidnapping from schools in recent weeks called to question the implementation of the \u201cSafe School Initiative\u201d which was launched with millions of Naira invested, after the Chibok girls were abducted to bolster security in schools in the Northeast.\n\nIt said Nigeria\u2019s perpetual battle against insecurity \u201cis at a high cost, with both security operatives and civilians paying with their lives. That cost continues to be too high.\n\n\u201cAccording to S 14(2)(b) of the 1999 Constitution, the primary objective of the government is to ensure the security and welfare of citizens.\n\n\u201cDespite the government\u2019s claim of being on top of the security situation in the country, the spread and context of insecurity have metastasized and shown no signs of abating, blackholing the enormous budgetary allocation to security.\u201d\n\nThe organisation, therefore, observed that it would take more than security hardware to end insecurity across the country.\n\n\u201cAt the core of the various forms of mass atrocities in Nigeria is impunity and at the core of impunity is the failure of state institutions to ensure the safety and security of all Nigerians, as well as justice for crimes perpetrated\u201d, the group added.\n\nOn these grounds, the organisation recommended that Nigeria would need \u201can effective long-term investment in a holistic security architecture that should comprise the efficiency of all aspects of governance and the promotion of human rights.\n\n\u201cThe state\u2019s continued failure to proactively fulfil and respect human rights has led to mass grievances that are compounding the nation\u2019s insecurity and jeopardizing its peace and security,\u201d the organisation suggested.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Two weeks after the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) said it had issued 54 million people their national identity numbers, it is in the process of deploying a Device Management System (DMS).\n\nThe NCC said in a statement, \u201cTo curtail the counterfeit mobile phone market, discourage mobile phone theft, enhance national security, protect consumer interest, increase revenue generation for the government, reduce the rate of kidnapping, mitigate the use of stolen phones for crime, and facilitate blocking or tracing of stolen mobile phones and other smart devices, one of the means to achieve this is through the deployment of Device Management System.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe implementation of a Centralised Equipment Identity Register otherwise known as Device Management System will serve as a repository for keeping records of all registered mobile phones\u2019 International Mobile Equipment Identity and owners of such devices.\u201d\n\nDespite the government hinging the policy on fighting insecurity, there are privacy concerns that the government can easily abuse access to such data.\n\nDoes this new requirement infringe on privacy?\n\nAs of March 2020, Nigeria was one of eleven countries with mandatory biometric SIM registration laws. One of the arguments against compulsory registration is that it allows the government to track SIM card owners and makes it easier to track calls and messages.\n\nA Device Management System will take this step even further, allowing the government even more access to what should be private information. While the argument from the government is that it improves security, there\u2019s the risk that the government can spy on its citizens.\n\nGeneralized surveillance in countries like Nigeria with weak security agencies controlled by the executive can become police states where opposition leaders can be tracked and arrested. But with the rise in crime in Nigeria in the past year, it is easy to understand the government\u2019s argument.\n\nDoes the government\u2019s argument make sense?\n\nIn a 2016 paper, \u201ccomplete mobile phone registration has many generalised benefits to the society especially in combating crime.\u201d\n\nWith increasing reports of kidnappings taking place around the country, a centralised registry may help to find bad actors even quicker, and it could help combat the sale of stolen phones. When there\u2019s a central registry for IMEI, the police could identify the owners of lost and stolen phones thousands of times daily.\n\nA critical part of this paper argues for a central database of mobile phones that law enforcement agencies presumably can access. Yet, it is this central assumption that still provides a problem.\n\nWhether Nigerians trust that the government will not abuse access to such critical information remains to be seen.\n\n*An earlier version of this report stated that the NCC asked telcos to register the IMEI numbers of their subscribers; the NCC has now clarified its position",

          "text": "Exceptional results require a high-performance team but how do you build one?\n\nIn what can be termed a mini-MBA session, Seni Sulyman and Chichi Offodile in an edition of TechCabal Live shared expert advice on how to build high-performance teams.\n\nSeni Sulyman is the founder and community manager of Black Ops, a network of top African operators building great companies and cultures across the world. Before starting Black Ops, Seni helped scale Andela\u2019s operations from series B to series D with over 1,000 team members across US and Africa offices.\n\nChichi Offodile is the COO of Helium Health. She has over 15 years of experience working at EMC/Dell and Deloitte.\n\nTheir Journey at Helium Health and Andela\n\nThe conversation begins with Chichi and Seni talking about their journeys at Helium Health and Andela respectively. They both stepped in when each company had a viable product/service, some traction, and funding.\n\nFor Chichi, she was brought in when Helium Health had figured out what it was doing but was uncertain about how to move forward. Her strength lies in figuring out how to build a sustainable company and that\u2019s what she set out to do via a transformation plan.\n\nSeni joined Andela in 2016 when the company was in only two markets \u2013 Nigeria and Kenya. At that time there had been a few leadership exits and the general employee morale was low. His mandate was to stabilize the ship. Which he did before focusing on operational expansion.\n\nHow do you begin the transformation process?\n\nFor Seni, he believes the transformation process should start with the why\u2014 otherwise known as communicating a vision that galvanises everything. At Andela, he had to create a modified version of the vision that was more compelling to the team.\n\nAfter clearly articulating the vision, decide on the steps to take to achieve the vision. This involves setting performance indicators and reviews, so it\u2019s clear what the goals are and whether people are hitting them.\n\nHow does a high achiever culture permeate a company?\n\nBoth Seni and Chichi believe that it starts with hiring people with the potential to be high achievers and then setting a good example as a leader.\n\nGiving people room to execute the tasks they\u2019ve set out to do is also an important factor.\n\n\u201cI make sure that leadership allows people to be creative. Allow people to execute. If you don\u2019t give people the opportunity to succeed, you\u2019ll be stifling them. I motivate people by allowing them to set their goals and fix a timeline to achieve it,\u201d Chichi said.\n\nBuilding cohesiveness within the team\n\nGreat things are rarely ever done by one person. How do we ensure that the team sticks together?\n\nSeni believes the people have to align on the why. This alignment has to start from the top, there has to be a unified strategy at the top level.\n\n\u201cStrategy is a lot more of what you\u2019re saying No to than what you\u2019re saying Yes to,\u201d he said.\n\nCiting an example of when he had to build cohesiveness within a team, he said that during his time at Bristow he noticed that two senior executives weren\u2019t aligned on the company\u2019s direction. One person wanted a high-end airline, while the other person wanted a low-cost airline.\n\nTo resolve this issue, he had to call both of them together to iron out their differences before the company could move forward.\n\nHow do you get teams to keep going without burning out\n\nA common challenge high-performance teams face is that they experience burnout due to the intense and fast-paced nature of work.\n\nSeni responded to this question by stating that he thinks that the issue with the pandemic and people experiencing burnout is that a lot of people were thrown into remote work without warning.\n\nThe solution to this is to encourage people to take time off work since the line between work and rest can be blurry. As a leader, you have to practice what you preach.\n\nIn order to encourage people to take some time off work, he often schedules his emails sent in the middle of the night to go out by the next morning to avoid creating unnecessary work or a sense of urgency.\n\nAnother activity that helps is social gatherings, it\u2019s important for companies to have occasional fun hours. One-on-one sessions are also helpful. These are open-ended meetings with employees, where the manager finds out how they\u2019re doing as human beings and what\u2019s going on in their lives.\n\nHe ends with a caveat \u2013 it\u2019s a little difficult to build a high-performing team without working really hard.\n\n\u201cYou cannot work 80 hours a week every week, you\u2019ll burn. You also can\u2019t work 40 hours every week and materially change the world.\u201d\n\nYou have to be thoughtful and deliberate in getting work done.\n\nChichi adds that she believes companies also need to do two things.\n\nThey have to be deliberate with capacity planning. If you\u2019re growing as a company, you can\u2019t expect to have the same set of people working at the same level while the company is expanding. You need to hire more people or adjust people\u2019s roles.\n\nBe open about flex working. The output is the most important thing, let people work in ways that work for them.\n\nAt what point should a company hire an operations lead?\n\nChichi\u2019s response to this question is that the first thing to do is to have a thought process to manage operations but as soon as you have funds for it, please hire.\n\nWatch the full conversation here",

          "title": "Stax wants you to enjoy USSD with better design, without ever dialling codes again",
          "text": "The BackEnd explores how tech products are built in Africa, highlighting uniqueness, user behaviour assumptions, pilots, pivots and challenges during the product cycle. A new edition every other Thursday.\n\n\u2014\n\nMost people who started using mobile phones in the 2000s became familiar with USSD through loading and checking airtime balance. With time, mobile banking became a major use case; again for airtime transactions, but also for buying internet data, sending money and paying bills.\n\nUnlike mobile apps that need to be downloaded and installed, USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data, if you insist) is lightweight and straightforward to use.\n\nDial the code for the desired service, follow the instructions e.g. \u201cpress 1 to Check Balance\u201d on each page and, provided there isn\u2019t some \u201cconnection failure\u201d or \u201centry error\u201d, your wishes will come true.\n\nA misconception is that USSD is for people who use basic phones but the feature has become mainstream even among smartphone users in Africa. A study of smartphone users in Bangladesh, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa showed that 87% of all financial-related transactions were conducted via USSD, with only 13% via mobile app.\n\nSo, USSD works well. But it still has its fair share of frustrating glitches that you normally wouldn\u2019t encounter on an app. For one, you need to memorise the code for each service you want to access. You could minimise an app to get information from, say, your notes app. But you mostly can\u2019t minimise a USSD session once it\u2019s started.\n\nUSSD\u2019s original design did not foresee \u201chow the introduction of smartphones would bridge the worlds of computing and telecommunications to form an entirely new industry,\u201d Wiza Jalakasi explains.\n\nBut that\u2019s not to say we should throw it away. On the contrary, some companies recognise that USSD is here to stay in Africa. As such, they are merging the best of both worlds: stacking the visual appeal and interactivity of smartphones on top of USSD\u2019s simple and efficient backend.\n\nOne such company is Hover, a US-based company, and their solution is called Stax.\n\nMaking USSD smart\n\nStax is a mobile app currently available only to Android users in 10 countries, including Nigeria, Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. It has three use cases: buy airtime, send money, and request money. All without ever dialling any USSD code.\n\nStax\u2019s main promise is that users never have to dial a code again\u2026 while enjoying USSD.\n\nIt\u2019s not a digital wallet or account, so it doesn\u2019t ask for an email address or phone number. But \u2013 and this is an important but \u2013 Stax needs certain phone permissions.\n\nWhat permissions? Three precisely: to make and manage phone calls; send and view messages; and access your contacts.\n\nWith those enabled, you can input how much airtime you want to buy, choose the bank or fintech-powered account you want to debit and input the phone number to credit or select from your phonebook.\n\nIt would be great if this is where it ends but \u2013 somewhat unfortunately \u2013 Stax asks for two other permissions to complete this task of buying airtime. Permission to display on top of other apps on your phone and another to connect with mobile money and telecom services on your behalf.\n\nThis gave me pause and maybe it is because of the copy: \u201cAllow Stax to have full control of your device?\u201d\n\nThree paragraphs beneath that question describe why the permission is needed. But all the bad news I have absorbed about privacy risks over the past four years flashed before my eyes, discouraging me from clicking \u201cAllow.\u201d\n\nJess Shorland, co-founder of Hover, agrees that some work needs to be done to make users more comfortable with the permissions. But she has an explanation for why they are necessary:\n\n\u201cIt allows us to automate the USSD session on behalf of the user. We\u2019ve basically built a different interface for USSD. The user interacts with that interface in a way that is a lot more screen-reader friendly.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s one big permission request\n\nIn other words, the accessibility permission is what enables Stax to do these things on the user\u2019s behalf.\n\nWhen a user gives Stax access, the app activates a screen reading functionality and acts as a web browser. USSD is still happening in the background but instead of presenting those USSD screens, Stax\u2019s SDK reads the USSD dialog, runs the functions and shows the user a familiar app interface.\n\nBut what are the risks? Because there is no way to convince a user that giving up control doesn\u2019t somehow make them a little vulnerable. Shorland says Stax only takes the information needed to enable the user complete their transaction.\n\n\u201cEverything happens client side, not on our servers. It\u2019s also what enables us to be offline,\u201d she says, emphasizing that the app is open-source as a sign of transparency.\n\nWho in Africa needs Stax?\n\nI guess it\u2019s kind of cool that Stax, a fintech app, works offline like regular USSD. But with the internet being more central to the digital and financial services space today, why should we cheer for Stax?\n\nHover CEO and co-founder Ben Lyon says they are \u201cbuilding for the world as it is today so that we can bridge it to where it ought to go.\u201d\n\nIn 2020, there were 159 million monthly active mobile money accounts in Africa, according to the GSM Association. Africa represents more than half of the global mobile money usage.\n\nLyon thinks such numbers and smartphone usage \u2013 expected to double to 678 million by the end of 2025 \u2013 will make USSD even more mainstream. \u201cIt is a standard view of the tech industry that USSD is a bygone thing. It is actually just categorically wrong.\u201d\n\nIf that view is wrong as he insists and if USSD\u2019s user experience needs to be modernised for the smartphone age, then solutions like Stax would seem right on time.\n\nStax wants the app to be under 10MB so that it will work easily on every (Android) phone. Average transaction time is supposed to be 12 seconds.\n\nMy airtime purchase this morning took a bit longer. It showed a transaction failure message at the end and my bank debited me two seconds later. But I got the airtime.\n\nStax is\u2026 a work in progress\n\nAs of today, Stax currently supports transactions for eight banks (Access, First, Guaranty, Keystone, Sterling, UBA, Wema, Zenith), OPay and Paga.\n\nBeing in the USSD business in Nigeria means getting into the CBN (banks) vs NCC (telcos) scuffle around who pays for USSD services. What does Hover think about this debate?\n\n\u201cBecause we believe that USSD is about accessibility and inclusion, I believe strongly that consumers should not pay to access the channel,\u201d Lyon says.\n\n\u201cI hope NCC and other players come around to this view that consumers should not pay.\u201d\n\nOutside of that and other potential headaches, Stax\u2019s focus will be on convincing individuals and businesses that the app is reliable for all seasons and geographies, regardless of internet connection, says Peace Itimi, who leads growth for the product.\n\n\u201cWe are not monetizing Stax yet and it\u2019s not on the near term roadmap to monetize it,\u201d Lyon says. \u201cThere is a WhatsApp sized opportunity here and our first priority is to make sure we can seize the opportunity at the appropriate time.\u201d\n\nBen also name-drops WeChat as a possible inspiration for monetization. With a large user base, Stax could begin enabling discovery and access to third party services, in what could make Stax a super app of sorts.\n\n\u201cWhen people understand what the product can do, they will fall in love with it,\u201d Itimi says.\n\nThat depends: on how they fix those curious accessibility permissions, and if people really feel the need to switch from basic USSD \u2013 which works okay \u2013 to a shinier, app-enabled life.",

In most cases, you even pay more on annoying charges. The good news is that savings has evolved. It\u2019s no longer enough to just keep money anywhere and call it savings. Financial apps like Branch, PiggyVest and Kuda have shown that your savings can be an investment which allows you to earn actual interest, no matter how small. People hardly have enough to money to meet their financial needs and this clearly influences the service features on majority of these financial apps.\n\nHowever, they all differ in the interest they offer on their platforms. If you\u2019re familiar with all the top ones, a quick research will show you that while several savings and investment apps offer sumptuous interest rates with up to 15% per annum being the highest, Branch sets the pace with 20% interest rate per annum. Branch is also the only financial app so far that offers flexible withdrawals, which means your money doesn\u2019t have to be locked for any minimum duration. Afterall, we save for rainy days, don\u2019t we? So if the rainy day comes you should have access to your money.\n\nAll the things your bank won\u2019t do.\n\nHere are a few more things that sets Branch apart from both your regular banking and other financial apps.\n\nAt your beck and call, for a cost: Trust your bank to be on top of their game when they send you notifications but obviously at a cost. Branch has no such thing as SMS alert fees.\n\nPay, to pay bills: Every month, you pay all sorts of bills like DSTV and PHCN on your regular financial apps and banking apps. But of course, it always comes at a cost \u2013 N100 here, N50 there. Some banks even say this cost is negligible, but everyone knows if you stack up enough N100 notes, you\u2019ll eventually have enough to do something that is not negligible. Again, with Branch, this service is free!\n\nTransfer fees: How many transfers have you made in the last month alone? How many did you make last year? If you add up all the charges you pay for making transfers in a month, you can at least buy airtime or data with it. If you add up all the cost for a year, who knows what you can buy with it. The point is, in the end, all these costs and charges add up to something. So if you can make unlimited transfers for free, why would you rather pay for it? Branch doesn\u2019t think you should pay for it though.\n\nAnybody home? \u2013 Customer service with most banks would leave a sour taste in your mouth. They will put you hold. They will tell you the problem can\u2019t be solved remotely and you should go to a branch near you. When you get to the bank branch, you\u2019ll be in a queue, then you\u2019ll fill forms. Finally, they\u2019ll tell you to go wait at home that it will be done in a few days. That doesn\u2019t happen with Branch. Branch customer service team is available 24/7 and all problems are resolved in-app.\n\nBonus programs: Most financial apps have some form of bonus program but none of them is like Branch. Branch has a second-generation referral system that makes referrals a win-win for all parties. Whereas other financial apps pay one-time bonuses for referrals, Branch pays you N500 when friends you refer pay up their first loan. The friends you invited also earn N500. In addition, you earn N50 for every deposit of N300 and above. How cool is that?\n\nThe money part: Branch gives you up to N500,000 in loans within seconds of applying on the app. No collateral or paperwork required. Start with small loan amounts and get higher amounts the more you repay.\n\nClearly, Branch offers you more flexibility and a lot more profit than other financial apps. So if you\u2019ve been suffering from poor financial services, it\u2019s time to make a switch. Branch can be downloaded on the Google Play Store",

          "text": "Fast-growing retail distribution platform in Africa joins the leading global entrepreneur support organization\n\nLagos, May 20 \u2014 Endeavor Nigeria has welcomed three new entrepreneurs into its global network. Onyekachi Izukanne, Michael Ukpong, and Ruke Awaritefe, the co-founders of TradeDepot, were selected as Endeavor Entrepreneurs on May 18, 2021, at the 15th Virtual International Selection Panel (v-ISP #15). TradeDepot is a B2B eCommerce platform that allows retailers to order inventory through multiple channels (Mobile, USSD, and WhatsApp) and have it delivered the next day.\n\nWith a mission to build strong entrepreneurship ecosystems in high-growth markets including Africa, Latin America, Asia, Europe & North America, Endeavor selects, mentors and accelerates the best high-impact entrepreneurs behind some of the world\u2019s most exciting scale-up companies, supporting them to scale their companies as well as drive economic growth and job creation.

The Endeavor network includes some of the world\u2019s most exciting scale-up entrepreneurs and most experienced mentors and investors. TradeDepot, a Factory-to-Retail distribution platform for Consumer Goods companies, is solving an important problem by organizing and digitizing an industry that affects the lives of millions of Nigerians. We\u2019re excited to support Onyekachi, Michael and Ruke with their mission of connecting retailers to manufacturers with mentorship and guidance as they continue to grow as leaders and scale TradeDepot.\u201d, said Tosin Faniro-Dada, the Managing Director & CEO of Endeavor in Nigeria.\n\nEndeavor Entrepreneur candidates go through a rigorous selection process which culminates in an International Selection Panel (ISP) where candidates are vetted by trusted mentors, drawn from Endeavor\u2019s extensive network of over 4,000 mentors across the world. As part of the process, TradeDepot was presented at the 15th v-ISP and was successfully selected in a unanimous decision by the panelists as part of a cohort of 13 entrepreneurs from 9 markets.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to welcome Kachi, Michael, and Ruke to the Endeavor Entrepreneur network!

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nGhanaians to re-register SIMs | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "title": "App review \u2013 How does Bitnob work?",
          "text": "This article is a Brand Press post. Brand Press is a paid service for brands that want to reach Techpoint Africa's audience directly. Techpoint Africa's editorial team doesn't write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email [email protected]\n\nBitnob is a Nigerian startup that lets users buy, save and invest in bitcoin. Users can access these features and much more through the mobile app that\u2019s available for Android iOS.\n\nBitnob offers a ton of other options, like loans, Dollar-Cost-Averaging plans, and many much more. At first glance, the Bitnob app feels fantastic, with a simple UI and easy-to-find functions. But how does it handle the functions that truly matter, like buying BTC and saving?\n\nWe\u2019re about to find out.\n\nGetting started with Bitnob\n\nLet\u2019s begin with the onboarding process\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCreating a new account on Bitnob\n\nSetting up your Bitnob app begins with installing it from your app store. When you open it for the first time, you\u2019ll need to create an account. Unlike many other apps, Bitnob doesn\u2019t let you just sign up with an email and get on with it.\n\nInstead, you\u2019ll need to supply your first name and last name. Your first name will be used to create a username that\u2019s unique to you (more on the username later.)\n\nYou\u2019ll also provide your phone number and receive an OTP for verification. Once that\u2019s clear, you can create a secure password and five-number transaction pin.\n\nI love this part because the app makes you choose something secure and up to 8 characters. Once you have all this dialed-in, you can get to the fun part.\n\nDepositing money on Bitnob\n\nAs an app for savings and investment, I expected Bitnob\u2019s deposit system to be as simple as inputting debit card information. Unfortunately, I was wrong.\n\nIf you remember, the topic has been complicated in Nigeria since the CBN has ordered banks to close accounts of crypto traders back in February. To protect its users, Bitnob doesn\u2019t let you buy BTC straight from your bank account.\n\nInstead, you\u2019ll first buy a recharge voucher from Ovarr. One thing I love is that the cards are sold in bundles ranging from $10 to $500. This way, users can buy within their financial limits.\n\nTo buy the voucher, you have to fill in your user information and then pay using a debit card.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter buying the voucher, you\u2019ll get a pin that you can paste into Bitnob to activate your purchase.\n\nSo while the process is slightly longer than I expected, it works all the same.\n\nWithdrawals on Bitnob\n\nWithdrawals aren\u2019t quite as tedious, and you can complete them in a few short steps.\n\nTo get started, you\u2019ll need to select \u2018withdraw\u2019 in the plan of your choice. You can withdraw to a BTC wallet or a USD wallet. To get cash in my local bank account, I had to first select a USD wallet and then send the cash to my local account.\n\nYou can send BTC to your blockchain wallet by selecting \u2018send\u2019 and pasting the BTC address in the provided field. You can also use the QR code scanner instead of pasting the BTC address.\n\nSending BTC to another user follows this same procedure. You simply paste their address or scan their Bitnob BTC wallet address.\n\nCustomization options\n\nYou can make changes to your Bitnob account through the \u2018account\u2019 icon. From here, you can change your name and user name, and fill in next of kin details,\n\nYou can also add your bank accounts and mobile money accounts here. I love that you get to choose between the two options.\n\nBitnob Features\n\nNow we get into the staple features of Bitnob\n\nAccessing loans\n\nBitnob offers Nobcredit, which is an awesome way for users to get quick cash while still HODLing their BTC. You can access Nobcredit from the app\u2019s home page, and the process is quite quick.\n\nThe loan amount you get depends on how much BTC you have as collateral. You can then pay back before the tenure expires to reclaim your BTC.\n\nYour interest rate is calculated based on your loan-to-value ratio, or the amount of collateral you have. Average rates are between 16 and 17.2%, and loan tenures range between 3 and 12 months.\n\nI love that you can check your interest rate and collateral volume using the in-app loan calculator. This makes sure that you have all the information you need before moving forward.\n\nPlans\n\nOne of Bitnob\u2019s main features is that you can create a savings plan for your BTC. You can name the plan, choose the amount you want to save in USD, and pick the frequency of savings. The available options are daily, weekly, and monthly.\n\nYou can also select a maximum duration for the lock. WIthdrawing before the maturity date will earn you a 3% penalty. The penalty is one more reason to keep saving.\n\nThe plans work based on the concept of Dollar-Cost-Averaging, which simply allows you to invest large sums over a period. The longer your investment tenure and the more often you make deposits, the bigger your overall portfolio.\n\nUnfortunately, you can only fund your plan with money from your USD wallet, which means you\u2019ll have to buy vouchers that cover your savings amount.\n\nUsers can create as many plans as they need, and adjust the deposit amount, frequency, and maturity date for a bigger payout.\n\nReferrals\n\nBitnob allows you to earn up to $1,000 via referrals alone. And it\u2019s quite easy to get started because you get a referral code immediately when you sign up. You can copy the code right from the home screen.\n\nWhen a new user signs up with your referral code, you get a small USD reward based on how much your referral deposits. I love the referral system because it\u2019s as easy as sending your code to whoever you invite.\n\nSecurity and Support\n\nHow does Bitnob handle security and customer care?\n\nReaching customer care\n\nHave you ever tried to reach customer care only to be kept on hold for an unreasonable amount of time? I loved that Bitnob went a different route by allowing you to live chat with customer care right in the app.\n\nI got a response within 2 minutes (I actually checked) of sending the message which was quite impressive. You can also access the FAQs section from within the app.\n\nSecurity features\n\nIf you have trouble remembering your passwords don\u2019t worry. Bitnob automatically activates fingerprint login for every user with a biometric-enabled device. If you\u2019d rather log in old school, you can turn this feature off in the accounts tab.\n\nOne cool but annoying security feature is that the app logs you out every time your screen goes to sleep. I found this quite irritating because I use the app a lot and I have to log in every few seconds.\n\nBut I also can\u2019t stay mad because it protects my BTC even more. Once my screen turns off, no one can access or even see my funds, which makes me feel good.\n\nOther standard security features also apply. For example, you can\u2019t change passwords unless you provide the old password.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nOverall, the Bitnob app delivers an impressive performance. My only reservation is the convoluted process associated with depositing. However, it\u2019s completely understandable given the current financial laws.\n\nBefore you go, I wanted to tell you one quirky thing I found about the app. It displays these short but interesting messages on the login page and your dashboard, and they really add character to the app. Two of my favourite are \u2018we care about you,\u2019 and \u2018my favorite human, cheer up.\u2019 Be sure to look out for these when you download the app.\n\nGhanaians to re-register SIMs | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email [email protected]\n\nBitnob is a Nigerian startup that lets users buy, save and invest in bitcoin. Users can access these features and much more through the mobile app that\u2019s available for Android iOS.\n\nBitnob offers a ton of other options, like loans, Dollar-Cost-Averaging plans, and many much more. At first glance, the Bitnob app feels fantastic, with a simple UI and easy-to-find functions. But how does it handle the functions that truly matter, like buying BTC and saving?\n\nWe\u2019re about to find out.\n\nGetting started with Bitnob\n\nLet\u2019s begin with the onboarding process\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCreating a new account on Bitnob\n\nSetting up your Bitnob app begins with installing it from your app store. When you open it for the first time, you\u2019ll need to create an account. Unlike many other apps, Bitnob doesn\u2019t let you just sign up with an email and get on with it.\n\nInstead, you\u2019ll need to supply your first name and last name. Your first name will be used to create a username that\u2019s unique to you (more on the username later.)\n\nYou\u2019ll also provide your phone number and receive an OTP for verification. Once that\u2019s clear, you can create a secure password and five-number transaction pin.\n\nI love this part because the app makes you choose something secure and up to 8 characters. Once you have all this dialed-in, you can get to the fun part.\n\nDepositing money on Bitnob\n\nAs an app for savings and investment, I expected Bitnob\u2019s deposit system to be as simple as inputting debit card information. Unfortunately, I was wrong.\n\nIf you remember, the topic has been complicated in Nigeria since the CBN has ordered banks to close accounts of crypto traders back in February. To protect its users, Bitnob doesn\u2019t let you buy BTC straight from your bank account.\n\nInstead, you\u2019ll first buy a recharge voucher from Ovarr. One thing I love is that the cards are sold in bundles ranging from $10 to $500. This way, users can buy within their financial limits.\n\nTo buy the voucher, you have to fill in your user information and then pay using a debit card.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter buying the voucher, you\u2019ll get a pin that you can paste into Bitnob to activate your purchase.\n\nSo while the process is slightly longer than I expected, it works all the same.\n\nWithdrawals on Bitnob\n\nWithdrawals aren\u2019t quite as tedious, and you can complete them in a few short steps.\n\nTo get started, you\u2019ll need to select \u2018withdraw\u2019 in the plan of your choice. You can withdraw to a BTC wallet or a USD wallet. To get cash in my local bank account, I had to first select a USD wallet and then send the cash to my local account.\n\nYou can send BTC to your blockchain wallet by selecting \u2018send\u2019 and pasting the BTC address in the provided field. You can also use the QR code scanner instead of pasting the BTC address.\n\nSending BTC to another user follows this same procedure. You simply paste their address or scan their Bitnob BTC wallet address.\n\nCustomization options\n\nYou can make changes to your Bitnob account through the \u2018account\u2019 icon. From here, you can change your name and user name, and fill in next of kin details,\n\nYou can also add your bank accounts and mobile money accounts here. I love that you get to choose between the two options.\n\nBitnob Features\n\nNow we get into the staple features of Bitnob\n\nAccessing loans\n\nBitnob offers Nobcredit, which is an awesome way for users to get quick cash while still HODLing their BTC. You can access Nobcredit from the app\u2019s home page, and the process is quite quick.\n\nThe loan amount you get depends on how much BTC you have as collateral. You can then pay back before the tenure expires to reclaim your BTC.\n\nYour interest rate is calculated based on your loan-to-value ratio, or the amount of collateral you have. Average rates are between 16 and 17.2%, and loan tenures range between 3 and 12 months.\n\nI love that you can check your interest rate and collateral volume using the in-app loan calculator. This makes sure that you have all the information you need before moving forward.\n\nPlans\n\nOne of Bitnob\u2019s main features is that you can create a savings plan for your BTC. You can name the plan, choose the amount you want to save in USD, and pick the frequency of savings. The available options are daily, weekly, and monthly.\n\nYou can also select a maximum duration for the lock. WIthdrawing before the maturity date will earn you a 3% penalty. The penalty is one more reason to keep saving.\n\nThe plans work based on the concept of Dollar-Cost-Averaging, which simply allows you to invest large sums over a period. The longer your investment tenure and the more often you make deposits, the bigger your overall portfolio.\n\nUnfortunately, you can only fund your plan with money from your USD wallet, which means you\u2019ll have to buy vouchers that cover your savings amount.\n\nUsers can create as many plans as they need, and adjust the deposit amount, frequency, and maturity date for a bigger payout.\n\nReferrals\n\nBitnob allows you to earn up to $1,000 via referrals alone. And it\u2019s quite easy to get started because you get a referral code immediately when you sign up. You can copy the code right from the home screen.\n\nWhen a new user signs up with your referral code, you get a small USD reward based on how much your referral deposits. I love the referral system because it\u2019s as easy as sending your code to whoever you invite.\n\nSecurity and Support\n\nHow does Bitnob handle security and customer care?\n\nReaching customer care\n\nHave you ever tried to reach customer care only to be kept on hold for an unreasonable amount of time? I loved that Bitnob went a different route by allowing you to live chat with customer care right in the app.\n\nI got a response within 2 minutes (I actually checked) of sending the message which was quite impressive. You can also access the FAQs section from within the app.\n\nSecurity features\n\nIf you have trouble remembering your passwords don\u2019t worry.

          "title": "Does the Nigerian government want safety or surveillance with its new IMEI policy?",
          "text": "From July 2021, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) will require Nigerians to submit their IMEI numbers to a Centralised Equipment Identity Register.\n\nIn May 2021, the Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy released a Revised National Identity Policy for SIM Registration (PDF) that requires Nigerians to submit their IMEI numbers to a Centralized Equipment Identity Register (CEIR), otherwise known as Device Management System (DMS), which the NCC would manage.\n\nSome of the reasons given for the Ministry\u2019s action include curtailing the counterfeit mobile phone market, discouraging mobile phone theft, enhancing national security, protecting consumer interest, increasing revenue generation for the government, reducing the rate of kidnapping, mitigating the use of stolen phones for crime, and facilitating the blocking or tracing of stolen mobile phones and other smart devices.\n\nThis move follows the Nigerian government\u2019s previous initiatives for digital identities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecall that in December 2020, the Nigerian government released a statement mandating all Nigerians to obtain their National Identification Number (NIN). Predictably, there was a rush as Nigerians all over the country attempted to get their NIN before the deadline at the end of 2020.\n\nThe directive caused a massive uproar among Nigerians because it was given in the heat of the COVID-19 pandemic. Perhaps as a result of that, the deadline was moved to February 2021. Since then, it has been moved thrice, with the new deadline now June 30, 2021.\n\nThe NCC\u2019s IMEI policy will definitely have major implications for the entire nation if implemented.\n\nWhat does this mean for you?\n\nThe International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) is a unique number used to identify a mobile phone. It is usually found inside the battery compartment of most phones but can also be gotten by dialling *#06#. With an IMEI number, a phone can be tracked, but more than that, it can also be used for identity theft and even cloning a phone.\n\nEver since the news broke, there has been an understandable outcry, with IMEI and Isa Pantami trending on Twitter.\n\nHowever, while the government requires Nigerians to share this data, they do not have to, as your IMEI is part of the data transmitted to your network operator as soon as you make a call, use data, or send a text.\n\nThis information is rarely ever used beyond providing the details that your phone needs to work. However, security operatives can use it in the case of theft or while tracking terrorist activity.\n\nA few countries, including Azerbaijan, India, Cambodia, Chile, Columbia, Ecuador, Indonesia, Iran, Pakistan, Thailand, Turkey, and Lebanon, already have some form of this database.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf a phone owner possesses their IMEI number, they could provide law enforcement agencies with this information to track these phones if they are stolen.\n\nWhile the reasons given by the government for this new policy appear genuine at first glance, Nigerians are bothered about the possible ways the government can exploit this data.\n\nAn article on The Insider details how the Saudi government uses IMEI numbers to track the location of women who have run away from abusive partners. Most of the doubts expressed regarding the use of this information for surveillance.\n\nIt has not always been used negatively. The ITU reports that implementing this in Great Britain and Turkey resulted in a reduction in mobile phone theft while it increased the number of legally imported mobile devices in Ukraine by 95%, as well as increasing revenues from the import of mobile devices\n\nAccording to a data privacy expert, some of the questions that should be asked include whether there are sufficient safeguards in the absence of a comprehensive data protection law. Also, is the government going to be transparent about its use of this data and what happens in the case of a violation?\n\nOne must remember that with the government mandating Nigerians to link their SIM cards to the NIN, the government already has rich insights into the activities of its citizens. Adding IMEI data to this would mean that they can also get real-time location data on anyone.\n\nWith Nigeria\u2019s poor human rights history, Nigerians may be right to be suspicious about the motives behind this policy.\n\nGhanaians to re-register SIMs | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "title": "How National Assembly\u2019s blind loyalty to presidency destroys separation of powers",
          "text": "The sing song in Nigeria nowadays is the call for implementation of separation of powers as enshrined in the Nigerian Constitution.\n\nMany observers say that it appears that the Executive arm has swallowed up the judiciary and legislative arms, a sad development which has continued to frustrate governance.\n\nPerhaps, at no other time since the return of the country to civil rule in 1999 has Nigerians experienced a total absence of the legislature in governance than now.\n\nThe bicameral National Assembly, made up of 109 Senate members and 360 members of the House of Representatives, has sold itself to the Executive under the control of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nAt best, it can be said that the federal legislature is non-existent in Nigeria as the 9th Assembly has proven to be a rubber stamp of the Executive.\n\nThe legislative house is now ruled by primordial sentiment. Religion, ethnicity, and party affiliation have ruined the chambers.\n\nIn the United States of America, where Nigeria copied its version of presidential system, the Senate president and Speaker of the House of Representatives work independent of the executive arm. None is subservient to the other. They all work in harmony for the good of the country.\n\nIf it were not for strong institutions in place, the general election in the US last year would have flopped. But National Assembly played their role; the electoral body played its role appropriately and the country was saved from going into crisis.\n\nIn Nigeria\u2019s case, the nation\u2019s Judiciary and National Assembly are extension of the Executive. They are tied to the apron string of the Executive. They have no mind of their own.\n\nWhen the Senate President or Speaker goes to see the President and they kneel down to greet the President, almost fidgeting, it means they do not know their job and their powers. There is nothing like father-son relationship when it comes to separation of powers. They are supposed to be a check on the Executive.\n\nOn a number of occasions, the National Assembly had discussed the seriousness of the insecurity situation in the country. Suggestions had also been made to summon the President, but that has not happened, because a greater number of the legislature, because they are of the same party, religion or ethnic leaning with the President, they shut down the plan.\n\nSome members of the National Assembly had also called for the impeachment of the president on the ground of incompetence, but that has also been shut down.\n\nRecently, Senator Smart Adeyemi (APC-Kogi) cried on the floor of the Senate while speaking on the worsening security situation in the country, and he urged his colleagues to take a drastic action by calling the President\u2019s attention to a menace that he noted was threatening the lives of every citizen. But he was not taken seriously by fellow party members.\n\nA National Assembly that worth its salt protects the interest of the masses by prevailing on the Executive to do what is right. But Nigeria\u2019s case is different as the federal legislators collude with the Executive to drive long nail into the head of citizens, as it were.\n\nThe National Assembly allows the Executive to run rough shod over the citizens. Incessant increase in pump price of fuel amid biting poverty in the land is part of government\u2019s insensitivity. Increasing electricity tariff without commensurate supply of power is insensitive. Many companies are not functioning optimally; the healthcare system has collapsed, unemployment rate has become scandalous, and government pays deaf ear to people\u2019s plight. In all of these, the federal legislators are not restraining the Executive even with the level of hardship in the country.\n\nThe Federal Government is not complete without the National Assembly. In other words, the executive, and the judicial arms, whose powers are vested by the Constitution of Nigeria in the National Assembly, cannot function well without the check and balances provided by the legislature. But this is missing, in the real sense of the word.\n\nA clear instance of primordial sentiment featured on the floor of the House of Representatives Thursday, when Idris Wase, deputy speaker of the House, who presided over the plenary, shut down a motion by Solomon Bob (PDP, Rivers) to call the Attorney-General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami to order over his comments on the ban on open grazing by Southern Governors.\n\nWase, who was intolerant of the motion, was said to have shouted down his colleague who was irked by Malami\u2019s comments and raised a point of order (Order 6 of House Rules Book) at the plenary, accusing the Attorney-General of the Federation of making inciting comments.\n\nWase reportedly shouted: \u201dThe order which you are bringing this matter is wrong. It\u2019s either you bring it as a full motion but coming under matters of privilege is wrong so take your seat.\u201d\n\nIt was the same Wase who resisted Mark Gbillah, a Tiv lawmaker from Benue State in March from raising a motion on behalf of Tiv indigenes in the diaspora, who were condemning the rate of killing in their state and displacement of their people from their ancestral land.\n\nWase vehemently resisted Gbillah and rejected their petition against the Federal Government of the alleged takeover of their ancestral lands.\n\nSuch actions by Wase do not convey that elected members have the right to air their views in the chambers, just because the principal officers are being sentimental or trying to please some individuals or groups.\n\nAdelaja Adeoye, a politician and political analyst, decried the rubber stamp status of the legislature in the country.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cFor Nigeria to effectively function as a country, there must be full separation of powers, amongst the Executive, Legislators and the Judiciary as demanded by the 1999 constitution, which is still subject to review and amendment.\n\n\u201cThe Executive arm both at the Federal and State has formed the habit of using the legislators as rubber stamp in carrying out their agenda, which in most cases do not reflect the wishes of their constituencies.\u201d\n\nA number of issues of national importance that affected the lives of Nigerians have been glossed over by the National Assembly.\n\nNigerians are expecting that there should be total independence of the National Assembly, but that is not the case as their refusal to play their oversight role on the Executive, has worsened the bad governance by the Buhari administration, leaving the nation\u2019s economy in tatters.\n\n\u201cNigerians have the right to think that there is a predetermined position on the proposed constitution amendment process for instance, because the federal legislators have not acted like they have the mind of their own since they came into power,\u201d Adeoye said.\n\n\u201cVery worrisome is the fact that, they tend to do esprit de corps as APC members than to show loyalty and concern for the Nigerian people.\n\n\u201cThis is where I will call on all opposition Senators and Reps members in the PDP and others to stand to be counted and not allow anything that will further polarise the country,\u201d he added.\n\nHe further urged Nigerian voters to work hard in 2023, to ensure that credible people and of robust knowledge are voted from all the constituencies across Nigeria to the National Assembly to avoid a situation where loyalty will be to the President rather than to the country.\n\nKunle Okunola, a political analyst, said it was quite unfortunate that the National Assembly that ought to seriously serve as a check on the President and the entire executive operates like a rubber stamp arm of the government.\n\n\u201cAlthough the NASS in a presidential system work in harmony with the Executive for the progress of the country, that should not be taken to a level that it becomes unhealthy for the development of the country. The separation of powers provision must be adhered to,\u201d Okunola said.\n\nHe further said that, \u201cBlind loyalty to the president is immoral, unconstitutional and illegitimate because their loyalty should be to the people who elected them to represent their interest.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly\u2019s excessive loyalty to the President is inimical to the development of the country and so, they need to work more for people\u2019s interest than the president\u2019s interest.\u201d\n\nBut Ahmed Lawan, Senate president, does not believe the 9th Assembly under his leadership has missed the mark.\n\nSpeaking at an event recently, Lawan said: \u201cThis relationship is misunderstood by many. Some, out of mischief, describe the National Assembly as a rubber stamp, some out of misunderstanding. For us, what is utmost in our minds in the ninth Assembly is: how do we work with the executive to make Nigeria better? If the price to pay is the names that we get, then let it be the price, because we believe that Nigerians deserve better service, better infrastructure development in the country and it is difficult if not impossible in this country or indeed in any democracy without understanding and harmony in the way and manner the two arms of government work.\u201d",
          "summary": "But National Assembly played their role; the electoral body played its role appropriately and the country was saved from going into crisis.\nIn Nigeria\u2019s case, the nation\u2019s Judiciary and National Assembly are extension of the Executive.\nOn a number of occasions, the National Assembly had discussed the seriousness of the insecurity situation in the country.\nA National Assembly that worth its salt protects the interest of the masses by prevailing on the Executive to do what is right.\nSome, out of mischief, describe the National Assembly as a rubber stamp, some out of misunderstanding.",

          "text": "That Nigeria\u2019s economy is in the doldrums is no longer news. The Federal Government has announced to the federating units that share revenues at the end of every month that it was finding things very difficult. The central government has also announced its plans to cut salaries of civil servants in its employ.\n\nThe states are not faring better, compelling many of them to be considering some options to live within their means.\n\nUnfortunately, many of the states have also refused to pay the mandatory N30,000 minimum wage.\n\nAs part of the measures, some states have elected to carry out retrenchment of some staff. This is the crux of the impasse between the Kaduna State government and the leadership of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC).\n\nIn recent times, there has been a seeming tug of war between Nasir El-Rufai, governor of Kaduna State and the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC).\n\nIn the last one week, Labour occupied the state, protesting the \u201cunlawful\u201d retrenchment of thousands of civil servants in the state by the governor.\n\nDespite NLC\u2019s threats and strike, the governor is insisting that there is no going back on the \u2018rightsizing,\u2019, while lamenting that over 90 percent of the state\u2019s federal allocation is currently being spent on civil servants; an issue many think relevant authorities should probe.\n\nWhile El-Rufai is taking retrenchment approach in tackling the dwindling revenue to the state, many of his colleagues prefer owing salaries, apart from Lagos, which depends less on the monthly federal allocation because of its ever-increasing internally generated revenue.\n\nFrom Abia, Imo, Ekiti, Jigawa, Niger to many others, the cry has been the same, while the implementation of the minimum wage is out of it.\n\nRecently, Nyesom Wike, governor of Rivers State, was under attack for promising N10 million each to Damini Ogulu (Burna Boy), Grammy award-winning artiste, and others who performed at a homecoming party for the music star, just a week after public school teachers protested over five years non-payment of salaries by the state government.\n\nConsidering the way the Kaduna State case is going, observers fear that if Governor El-Rufai succeeds in sacking the workers, other governors who are crying over lack of funds to pay salaries may follow Kaduna\u2019s bad example.\n\nMagnus Orjiako, a labour leader in FCT, Abuja, decried the El-Rufai example, saying it is inhuman, and should be challenged, as no government has sacked workers in such massive swoop before now and not to talk of thousands as done by El-Rufai.\n\n\u201cGovernment is blaming large scale unemployment in the country for the high rate insecurity and the same government wants to sack those engaged. If El-Rufai succeeds, his action will boost the number of unemployed out there and insecurity too. But the grave danger is that other state governors may copy the bad example,\u201d Orjiako said.\n\nInstead of sacking the workers, Inua Yakubu, a Minna, Niger State-based lawyer, advised that the governors and politicians should reduce the huge number of personal aides, unnecessary appointments and curb inflation of contract fees.\n\n\u201cGovernor El-Rufai is talking of rightsizing, but he has been sacking workers since assuming office. If he is serious about rightsizing, he should start by sacking all his aides and political appointees,\u201d Yakubu said.\n\nBut looking at the facts and data, Bode Anjorin, a Lagos-based economist and economic analyst, queried how state governors use the funds from the monthly federal allocation.\n\n\u201cIn April, the Federal Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC) said it has doled out in excess of N9.13 trillion to states in the past four years. So, where did all the trillions go if governors cannot pay simple salary?\u201d Anjorin asked.\n\nQuoting the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), Anjorin noted that the bureau disclosed that three South-South states \u2013 Delta, Akwa Ibom and Rivers- are the recipients of the larger portion of the federal allocations in the past four years, yet the three states also owe workers\u2019 salary and have not implemented the minimum wage.\n\nFor the economist, states that sack workers for lack of money to pay their salaries should not be given the monthly federal allocation or half of the allocation because the people the money is meant to benefit have been sacked.\n\nUgonma Onwubiko, an Abia State health worker, is worried over El-Rufai\u2019s approach because she thinks her governor, who has the culture of owing salaries would most likely consider the sack option.\n\n\u201cAt present, our salaries and pensions are not paid as regular as they should be. The irregularity has made it difficult for most parents to pay school fees of their children, pay house rent and carry out other responsibilities. So, if they now sack us, they are encouraging untimely deaths, wayward children, and insecurity,\u201d the mother of four said.\n\nShe also disclosed that workers\u2019 salaries, even when you add ghost workers, are not as much as the money politicians steal through inflated contracts, retinue of political appointees, allocation for buying votes, and money laundering.\n\nIn the same vein, Anjorin advised governors to cut their unnecessary expenses, focus on projects that will empower people and not elephant projects like airports, seaports and railway, which are humongous and conduit pipe of stealing government funds.\n\n\u201cIf Governor El-Rufai wants to sack Kaduna workers, he should start from his relations and friends in the state civil service. But I think that plan is unthinkable because he has sacked many in his rightsizing exercise. He should copy the Lagos State internally generated revenue model to boost his earnings and pay people well, including minimum wage,\u201d Anjorin said.\n\nHowever, an Abuja-based top government official who pleaded for anonymity expressed his disappointment over the planned sack by El-Rufai, noting that the Federal Government gave states bailout; they still receive federal allocation, yet they complain of lack of fund to pay poor workers\u2019 salary.\n\n\u201cIt is not fair to threaten the poor with sack when we all know that politicians are moving money in bullion van. The EFCC should arrest any governor who threatens to sack workers and probe what they have been doing with their allocations, starting with El-Rufai,\u201d he said.\n\nExplaining the reason for picketing Kaduna, Ayuba Wabba, the NLC national president, said it was partly because of the sacking of 7,000 workers from local governments in the state.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe are also aware that in the Primary Health Care Development Agency, 1,700 workers were sacked. All these are happening in the face of exorbitant increment in tuition fees, high cost of living and other uncalled-for actions in ministries and agencies in the state.\u2019\u2019\n\nWabba further said: \u201cWe cannot accept the bitter pills; \u2026because the labour law in Nigeria says before you can declare redundancy, labour shall be consulted and we were never consulted.\u201d\n\nHe however, noted that it was not strange to relieve workers of their job when it becomes difficult to retain them. He argued that necessary steps should be followed in line with Labour laws in the country.\n\nWabba accused Kaduna of sacking the workers without paying them severance allowances to cushion their suffering.\n\nHe also faulted the claim that those sacked were mainly workers who no longer fit into the 21st century workforce as a result of their qualifications.\n\nThe NLC boss said that since such workers were interviewed and hired on the basis of the qualification they had at the point of entry, compensation must be paid to them to enable them start a new life.\n\nThe NLC had, last Monday, embarked on a five-day warning strike over the sack of thousands of workers and refusal to pay entitlement to retrenched workers in the state.\n\nEl Rufai said the sacks were part of the government\u2019s process to \u2018rightsize\u2019 the state\u2019s civil service.\n\nHe condemned the industrial action that lasted for three days before it was called off Wednesday evening by Wabba. The NLC chairman said the strike was called off to give room for negotiations after the Federal Government waded in.",

          "title": "Outrage as Buhari shuns funeral ceremony of late army chief, Attahiru, 10 others",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari was absent at the burial ceremony of his Chief of Army Staff, Ibrahim Attahiru, drawing condemnation from Nigerians who questioned his absence from critical national occasions and his perceived lack of empathy.\n\nMr Attahiru, a lieutenant general, and 10 other officers were laid to rest at the National Military Cemetery, Abuja on Saturday, a day after they died in a military plane crash.\n\nThey died in the crash that occurred in Kaduna on Friday while on official assignment to Zaria in Kaduna State.\n\nThey were travelling to the Depot Nigerian Army, Zaria for the passing out parade of regular recruits slated for Saturday.\n\nIt was the third military air disaster this year and the army posted videos on social networks of the service attended by top political and military leaders at the national mosque.\n\nThe religious services for the deceased were organised by the military.\n\nThe Islamic funeral service was held at the National Mosque, Abuja for the late army chief and five others who were Muslims while the Christian funeral services burial rites were held at the Nigerian Air Force Protestant Church, Abuja for the officers who were Christians.\n\nAfter the religious services, the bodies of the dead officers were taken to the National Military Cemetery along Airport Road for internment.\n\nTears, anguish\n\nFamily members, friends, colleagues and sympathisers wept uncontrollably as their remains were lowered into the graves.\n\nIn attendance were the Chief of Defence Staff, Lucky Irabor, a general; Chief of Air Staff, Isiaka Amao; and Chief of Naval Staff, Gambo Awwal, all of whom were appointed on January 26 as Mr Attahiru by Mr Buhari.\n\nAmong government officials present were the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha; Chief of Staff to the President, Ibrahim Gambari; Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed and Minister of Communications and Digital Strategy, Isa Pantami.\n\nOthers were the Sultan of Sokoto, Sa\u2019ad Abubakar; Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, governors of Borno, Kaduna, Yobe and Kebbi.\n\nBut conspicuously missing at the sombre event was the president of the republic. No one has explained to the nation why he stayed away.\n\nEulogy\n\nIn the address read on his behalf by Mr Magashi, Mr Buhari said the death of the officers would not be in vain.\n\nHe described Mr Attahiru as a dedicated and committed officer.\n\nHe said, \u201cToday is indeed a trying moment for the Nigerian Army and indeed the armed forces of our country, a period that witnessed the death of 11 brave officers and men of the armed forces in an ill-fated crash in Kaduna.\n\n\u201cThese fine gentlemen had a glorious career in the armed forces in the course of which they served gallantly in several capacities.\u201d\n\nMr Buhari said Mr Attahiru \u201cinspired courage and confidence in the Nigerian Army which informed successes recorded during his watch\u201d.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cHe led the Nigerian Army from the front and was a source of inspiration worthy of emulation by all officers and men of the armed forces of Nigeria,\u201d the president said, promising to ensure that the contribution of the deceased officer to the unity, peace and security would be remembered\n\nEfforts to reach the president\u2019s media aides, Femi Adesina and Garba Shehu, to comment on why the president did not personally attend such a high-profile funeral as sometimes done by other world leaders, were not successful.\n\nHowever, criticisms against the president intensified with the news that he just returned to Abuja from France where he attended the African Finance Summit but did not deem it fit to attend the burial of his top military chief and other military personnel who died on duty.\n\nMr Buhari left Abuja on Sunday and returned on Thursday, two days before the burial.\n\nOutrage\n\nReno Omokri, a former aide to former President Goodluck, said the absence of the president from the funeral ceremonies showed that the country was \u2018leaderless\u2019.\n\n\u201cSad that President Muhammadu Buhari did not attend the burial of the late Chief of Army Staff, (Lieutenant) General Attahiru. He was represented by his Defence Minister\u2026 Attahiru died serving Nigeria. Buhari, who went to Paris for four days, could not go to Attahiru\u2019s funeral for 30 minutes,\u201d the ex-aide to former President Goodluck Jonathan and staunch Buhari critic, tweeted.\n\n\u201cI ask again, where is the President and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria? When the occupant of the highest office in the land becomes so redundant to the point that he cannot attend the funeral of his Chief of Army Staff and other officers who died in a plane crash while on official assignment, it is an indication that the country is leaderless. Buhari has become a mere mannequin. He is neither useful to the country nor to humanity,\u201d Lagos-based human rights lawyer, Inibehe Effiong, wrote on Facebook.\n\nIn another tweet, Mr Omokri recalled that when the nation was thrown into mourning following the death of a former Chief of Defence Staff, Owoye Azazi, in 2012, Mr Jonathan attended the burial ceremony.\n\nAnother popular blogger, Japhet Omojuwa, tweeted, \u201cIf you can go to France, you can attend the burial of your COAS + others and use that platform as an opportunity to reassure your troops whilst celebrating the loss of our gallant men. But I shouldn\u2019t tweet this. I shouldn\u2019t attract unnecessary negative energy to my timeline.\u201d\n\nAbiola Sanni, a twitter user said, \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed and heartbroken This is the least the President could have done.\u201d\n\nNot the first time\n\nThis is not the first time the president is being condemned for failing to attend significant national burials and not visiting victims of monumental tragedies.\n\nAtiku Abubakar, a former vice president had in 2018 described the absence of President Buhari at the burial of soldiers killed by Boko Haram in Metele, Borno State, as \u2018totally unacceptable\u2019.\n\nMr Abubakar also criticised Buhari in 2019 for not attending the burial of the five Nigerian Air Force officers, who died while prosecuting the war on terror.\n\nOther popular burials Mr Buhari did not attend was that of his late Chief of Army Staff, Abba Kyari, who died from COVID-19 last year.\n\nIn similar fashion, Mr Buhari had in December sparked outrage over his failure to visit Kankara after over 300 schoolboys were abducted while he was on vacation at his country home in Katsina, which was not far from the scene of abductions.\n\nHe, instead, detailed a delegation led by the National Security Adviser, Babagana Monguno, to travel from far away Abuja to Katsina, where he was, to comfort the grieving families.\n\nMany commentators say Mr Buhari has proven again and again that he is a man bereft of empathy for the the people he governs.",

We see that has greatly subsided and students are more focused on their academic activities and I think that is very impressive.\n\n\u201cThat is what will explain for the higher level of interest that is displayed by the number of students that are seeking admission, because nobody will want his or her children in a university where there is a high rate of cultism and bad behaviour.\n\n\u201cSo, I will like to congratulate the Governing Council on your particular achievement of curbing the rate of insecurity which is one challenge that we are now currently dealing with along the length and breadth of not just this state, but the country at large,\u201d the governor stated.\n\nAbiodun who disclosed that his administration has acquired buses for the smooth transportation of students on campuses, added that the buses would soon be handed over to the institutions as soon as issues on the management of the buses are sorted out with respective institutions.\n\nWhile appreciating the Governing Council for the changes it has made in the curricular of the institution, the governor also commended the Council members for what they were able to achieve in terms of students\u2019 welfare.\n\n\u201cI want to appreciate some of the changes that you\u2019ve made in curricular; you have mentioned that you have introduced Nursing, Music and Linguistics and that it is doing very well. You have also done a lot of work in regards to students\u2019 welfare, particularly by providing through Public Private Partnership, accommodation and increased students population from four hundred to three thousand,\u201d Abiodun submitted.",

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nLeader of apex Yoruba sociopolitical organisation, Afenifere, Pa Ayo Adebanjo, has expressed concern over what he called undemocratic and reckless shoot-on-sight order against agitators in the Southeast zone of the country by the Acting Inspector General of Police, Usman Baba Alkali, noting that it\u2019s an indication that people of the zone are no longer safe.\n\nThe Acting IGP had on Tuesday last week, declared war on pro Biafra agitators and gunmen attacking and destroying police infrastructure in the Southeast and South-South regions and ordered their complete extermination.\n\nThe police boss who spoke on the sideline while addressing the Police Mobile Force and Special Tactical Squad of the Force in Enugu shortly after he launched Operation Restore Peace, directed policemen in the region not to adhere to the rules of engagement while dealing with Biafra secessionist groups, adding that his job was to protect them.\n\nHe went ahead to threaten police officers who fail to carry out his orders and gets killed in the process.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind the media shout; do the job I command you. If anyone accuses you of human rights violation, the report will come to my table and you know what I will do. So, take the battle to them wherever they are and kill them all. Don\u2019t wait for an order,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat another order are you waiting for when Mr. President had ordered you to shoot anybody carrying AK-47 rifle? Quote me, even a dead policeman can be tried and dismissed from the force and his family will not get his benefits.\n\n\u201cSo, don\u2019t seat and wait for them to come; take attack to them and don\u2019t lose your arms to criminals.\u201d\n\nHowever, condemning the order, Adebanjo pointed out that the move is a further escalation of President Muhammadu Buhari government\u2019s hostility towards the Southeast since he took power in 2015.\n\n\u201cThe rising hostility against the South-East Zone since the beginning of the Buhari administration has now become a matter of great concern to Afenifere, as this reality should also become a major concern to other stakeholders in the Nigerian project,\u201d Adebanjo said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nThe Afenifere leader, who decried the situation where two sets of laws exist in the country; a set of laws where the Fulani go scot free and another, that the lives of others, especially that of the Igbo, do not matter.\n\n\u201cTaking a look at the Security Council, no Igbo man is a member of Buhari\u2019s security architecture. Is that how to run a multi-ethnic multi-religious country like Nigeria?\u201d he queried.\n\n\u201cOne will assume that Nigeria is now a theatre of bloodshed as the streets are now lined with the blood of innocent Nigerians. With this draconian order, no opposition member is safe.\n\nHe said that if the President had no hidden agenda, there were more civilised and democratic ways to beef up security in the South East.\n\nHe urged other leaders in the zones to condemn the shoot-on-sight order to prevent another looming massacre in the South-East zone, saying: \u201cTo prevent yet another looming massacre in the South-East Zone, leaders in other zones should condemn the shoot-on-sight order. The President must be told that if he is sincere about peace and unity of this country, the order should be revoked forthwith. Certainly, if the President has no hidden agenda, there are more civilised and democratic ways to beef up security in the South-East.\u201d",

          "title": "Bank Customers Groan Under Burden Of Charges",
          "text": "In 2020, despite the pandemic and the downturn in economic activities, 12 commercial banks had jointly pulled in N933.16 billion in profits and made N216.52 billion from charges on electronic transactions, as customers continue to complain of excessive fees that they are being charged.\n\nThe banks are FBN Holdings, Access Bank, United Bank for Africa, Wema Bank, Sterling Bank, Zenith Bank, Guaranty Trust Bank, Stanbic IBTC, Ecobank, Fidelity Bank, Union Bank and FCMB had also seen an increase of 2.3 per cent in the revenue from fees and commission last year.\n\nIn total, they made N825.23 billion last year from fees and commission compared to N806.87 billion made in 2019 and to bank customers. Fee and commission income of banks include account servicing fees, investment management and other fiduciary activity fees, sales commission, placement fees and syndication fees, revenue from electronic banking transactions, card maintenance fees and others are recognised as the related services are performed.\n\nFor many bank customers who spoke with Leadership about stamp duty charges, account maintenance charges, card charges as well as SMS alert charges which are the most complained about. Many of them were of the view that the charges ought to be reviewed downwards further.\n\nWhilst some were of the view that though some banks charge them unnecessarily, the charges are still reasonable. The general consensus was however against the stamp duty charge, as all those whose opinion were sampled said there is no reasonable excuse for it other than to generate money for the government.\n\nCBN deputy governor, Financial System Stability, Aisha Ahmad had mentioned that efforts are being put in place to lower the cost of deploying services by banks through many services initiatives. According to her, a cut in bank charges had been one of the factors being canvassed for the country to be able to achieve its financial inclusion goals of the country as the CBN plans to achieve a financial inclusion target of 95 per cent by 2024.\n\nIn December 2019, the Central Bank of Nigeria had issued a revised guide on bank charges which became effective on January 1, 2020. The guide had made some major cuts in fees that banks charge customers, one of such is the reduction in electronic transactions.\n\nAccording to the guide, electronic transfers of N5,000 and below will have a N10 transactions cost plus VAT and transfers of above N5000 but below N50,000 now attract N25 charges plus VAT, while transfers above N50,000 attracts N50 charge plus VAT. The charges on electronic transfers had been cut from N50 which most banks were charging.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAs against the N65 previously charged by banks after third withdrawals on remote- on-us ATM transactions, the CBN had insisted that bank do not charge above N35 per withdrawal. However customers complain that they are still charged N65 and some banks make the charge on every remote-on-us withdrawal, irrespective of if it is the first or second in the month.\n\nAlso, maintenance charges on cards was cut from N600 spread through the year to N200, a N400 shave off from what card holders would have to pay banks on an annually.\n\nAlso maintenance charge for foreign currency card holders was also cut down to $10 or its equivalent from the previous charge of $20 yearly. Other major changes in the charges include removal of Card Maintenance Fee (CAMF) on all cards linked to current accounts. Other reductions include Advance Payment Guarantee (APG) which was pegged at maximum of one per cent of the APG value in the first year and 0.5 per cent for subsequent years on contingent liabilities.\n\nThe guideline also stipulates an interest rate minimum of 30 per cent of monetary Policy Rate (MPR), the latest guide also stipulated that a one-off charge of N1,000 be applied to the issuance of cards, irrespective of card type (regular or premium) compared to N2,000 that was being charged by some banks. The same one-off charge of N1,000 applies for the replacement of debit cards at the customer\u2019s instance for lost or damaged cards.\n\nAccording to the guide, there will be no more charges for reactivation or closure of accounts such as savings, current and domiciliary accounts while status enquiry at the request of the customer (like confirmation letter, letter of non-indebtedness and reference letter) will now attract a fee of N500 per request.\n\nOn Current Account Maintenance Fee (CAMF), the Guide expressly stated that this would be applicable only to current accounts in respect of customer-induced debit transactions to third parties and debit transfers/lodgments to the customer\u2019s account in another bank. It emphasized that CAMF is not applicable to Savings Accounts.\n\nAs the 2019 Finance Bill became effective in February 2020, banks were required to deduct N50 stamp duty due on every transaction, from customers account. The Bill which took effect in February last year stipulates that the N50 stamp duty charge would be levied on electronic payments above N10,000 as against payment above\n\nN1,000 which had previously been proposed.\n\nThe stamp duty charge is deducted on every transaction that is N10,000 and above\n\nirrespective of the account type, savings or current and then remitted to the Treasury\n\nSingle Account resident with the CBN. The N50 charge had been the source of squabble between the Federal Inland Revenue service and the Nigeria Postal Service last year.\n\nMany banks had immediately begun deducting N50 stamp duty from all transactions above N10,000 made from bank accounts including savings, current and corporate accounts in the country in compliance with the 2020 Finance Bill.\n\nIn April last year, customers of Access Bank had attacked the bank on social media after it compiled and deducted three months\u2019 worth of stamp duty charge at once.\n\nAfter trending for more than four days on most social media platform the bank had tried restoring its image by offering to refund customers and pick up the stamp duty fees.\n\nA female nurse, Uche Pius speaking with Leadership said \u201cI don\u2019t understand the bank charges, at times if you decide to transfer money on your mobile phone the bank charges suppose to be N10 but you will be seeing N100 as bank charges and there is no alert that the money was removed or anything.\n\n\u201cI think the bank charges need to be looked into. It is like there is nobody regulating it, they (the banks) just remove charges because they know nobody is going to the bank to complain about N50 or N20 it will just look ridiculous do they just keep doing it over time and nobody talks about it. It needs to be regulated and there should be an alert for it. It needs to be regulated.\u201d\n\nFor Obinna Ani, a software engineer, his grouse is with the withdrawal charges as well as card and account maintenance charge. According to him, banks charge more than they are supposed to and complaining does not do anything to rectify it. \u201cThey said after eight withdrawals N65 will be deducted but at the end of the month instead of seeing N65 you will be seeing N300 or more than that as bank charges or liquidation and it can be deducted like three times in a month, at times even without using the ATM they still deduct money calling it maintenance or liquidation fee and it happens every month.\n\n\u201cI had to withdrawal all my money in that account. Unlike what we were told growing up that money in savings account appreciate, these days, money kept in savings account depreciate. A friend of mine who had like N100,000 in his account before he left the country came back four years later to meet an empty account. They were just deducting charges on an account that was not even in use.\n\nA writer, Ngozi Stanley-Obi whilst noting that banks are businesses and need to make profit opined that some of the charges are unnecessary. Ifeanyi Chukwu, a videographer and editor, said on a monthly basis, his bank account take a hit from several charges.\n\n\u201cI have a savings and a current account. Charges on the savings are OK, but the charges on the current account are too much. With the volume of transactions I do, I get charged not less than N10,000 monthly. The charges are mostly stamp duty charges, which is from the government and SMS alert.\u201d\n\nAn accountant, Itoro Bassey noted that she had gotten a N600 debit for SMS alert,\n\nan amount she says is over the top. However she did not complain to the bank\n\nbecause of the hassle of going into the banking hall.\n\nAlthough, Leadership reached out to some banks most did not respond. An email\n\nresponse received from Oluseye Omiwole, Wema Bank\u2019s Team Lead, Prepaid Cards, Cards Business & Service noted that the bank\u2019s chargers are in consonance with the guide that the CBN had released in 2019.\n\nAccording to him, the bank charges its customers card issuance fee of N1,000, VAT exclusive, quarterly maintenance fee of N50 per quarter, VAT exclusive and withdrawal fee outside the issuer bank of N35 per withdrawal, after the third count of transaction in the month.\n\nHe explained further that Wema Bank's foreign exchange mark-up fee is based on the exchange rate, transaction amount on foreign currency-based merchants might be higher than what the merchant has set. This rate depends on the market risk analysis.",

Rwandan state media said they would be lodged in schools and places of worship.\n\nNew fractures were opening in the volcano, letting lava flow south toward the city after initially flowing east toward Rwanda, said Dario Tedesco, a volcanologist based in Goma.\n\n\u201cNow Goma is the target,\u201d Tedesco told Reuters. \u201cIt\u2019s similar to 2002. I think that the lava is going towards the city centre.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt might stop before or go on. It\u2019s difficult to forecast,\u201d he said.\n\nEmmanuel De Merode, head of Virunga National Park, asked park employees in parts of Goma to evacuate, according a note seen by Reuters.\n\nHe said lava had reached the international airport on the eastern edge of the city but that it was not likely to reach other parts of Goma.\n\nCelestin Kasereka, head of scientific research at the Goma Volcano Observatory (OVG), told reporters he did not think the lava was flowing fast enough to reach Goma.\n\nA United Nations source said all U.N. aircraft had been evacuated to the city of Bukavu to the south and Entebbe in neighbouring Uganda. The power was also out across much of Goma.\n\nPrime Minister Jean-Michel Sama Lukonde convened an emergency meeting in the capital, Kinshasa, where the government activated an evacuation plan for Goma.\n\n\u201cWe hope that the measures that have been taken this evening will allow the population to reach the points that were indicated to them in this plan,\u201d government spokesman Patrick Muyaya said in comments broadcast on national television.\n\nPresident Felix Tshisekedi will cut short a trip to Europe to return to Congo on Sunday, the presidency said on Twitter.\n\nOn the streets of Goma, panic spread quickly.\n\n\u201cWe are panicked because we have just seen the entire city covered by a light that is not electricity or lamps,\u201d said John Kilosho. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what to do. We don\u2019t even know how to behave. There is no information.\u201d\n\nOthers fled to the city centre from villages and neighbourhoods threatened by lava on the northern outskirts.\n\n\u201cWe looked at the sky and saw the red colour of the volcano,\u201d said Richard Hazika Diouf from the Majengo neighbourhood. \u201cWe have fled to seek shelter in town.\u201d\n\nVolcano watchers have been worried that the volcanic activity observed in the last five years at Nyiragongo mirrors that in the years preceding eruptions in 1977 and 2002.\n\nVolcanologists at the OVG, which monitors Nyiragongo, have struggled to make basic checks on a regular basis since the World Bank cut funding amid embezzlement allegations.",

          "text": "Former President Olusegun Obasanjo on Friday gave a hint on how the country can get out of its current insecurity challenges.\n\nAccording to him, for the country to get out of all the challenges of insecurity including, banditry, Boko Haram, kidnapping among other crimes and criminalities, a long gestation period of training and educating all Nigerian children must be established .\n\nAlthough he did not give how long or short the gestation period should be, Obasanjo underlined that all Nigerian students irrespective of language, region, tribe or creed must get quality education.\n\nHe made the statement while giving a remark at the commissioning of the Professor Abayomi Oluwatosin Jiboku Building and Entrepreneur Centre at Lariken International College, Ologuneru, Ibadan.\n\nThe former president who retained that there must not be any alternative for quality education as a cure-all also harped on the place of not allowing our culture and values to be deteriorated by other preferences.\n\nObasanjo said \u201cLet me now talk about education. If we are going to get out of the morales of insecurity, banditry, Boko Haram, kidnapping and other criminalities, we will have a long gestation period of training and educating all Nigerian children.\n\n\u201cAnd I underlined, all Nigerian children. Education is the beginning of a life well-lived.\n\n\u201cGod has given each and every one of us the innate ability. It is when those innate abilities are developed that you can be of best in your own self-service, in the service of our nuclear and extended family, in the service of our community and in the service of our nation and the world.\n\n\u201cEducation, and there is no substitute for education. If you don\u2019t give it, then those you should have given it to don\u2019t have it and if they don\u2019t have it, then you don\u2019t get the best out of them and whatever you get out of them, if you start to complain, you will have yourself to blame. Education and quality education is important.\u201d\n\nHe stressed further \u201cThe second thing that I will want to mention is culture. I define culture as the totality of the way of living of a particular people. Our food, our hair, make-up, fashion, dance, songs and even the way we carry our marriage and even our burials are all our culture from cradle to grave.\n\n\u201cWhat makes us different as a people is that totality of our ways of life. Yes, I do agree that culture is dynamic and of course if there is any part of our culture that must be removed, yes, we may have to remove it, but don\u2019t let us forget our culture.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let us have our culture to be overtaken by cultures that are not ours.\n\n\u201cAlso, I want to tell us about values. One of the ways where we have problems in our society today is the worth or the value that we cherish.\n\n\u201cToday, money-making is something else. In Yoruba land, money-making is not one of our values but the Omoluabi ethos; truthfulness, integrity, truth, industry and hard work- where are all those now? Where have they gone? Why have we put them aside and all we are striving for is money?\n\nDirector, Lariken International College, Mr Idowu Jiboku, in his opening remarks, stated that education today has changed a lot and it will continue to change depending on societall need saying \u201cIn today\u2019s world, education has gone beyond memorization of facts and figures only.\n\n\u201cIt now includes the teaching of life skills that can promote innovation reasoning and turn students into entrepreneurs and problem solvers.\n\n\u201cSequel to the introduction of trade/entrepreneurship subjects by the federal government, we decided in 2017 to have an entrepreneurship centre that will teach these skills in the most immersive and practical way.\u201d\n\nHe said, catering and confectionaries, cosmetology, robotics and artificial intelligence, fashion designing, leather works, graphics and web-designing, interior decoration, photography and cinematography are some of the courses that will be taught in the commissioned centre.\n\nHe added that the inauguration of the facility is part of the effort of Lariken International College to play a part by explaining what complete education is in Oyo State.\n\nMr Olasunkanmi Olaleye, Commissioner for Education, Science and Technology,in his remark praised the institution and charged them to put the facility to good use.",

Does it not violate the respective rights of the Fulani and Ibo people if you restrict their rights to movement of their possessed goods that are not legally outlawed?\n\n\u201dFulanis own cattle which they move around in possessive sense. Spare part dealers move spare parts in ownership and possessive sense. We submit that it is the encroachment of the right of others that has ever been punishable and not the act of lawful grazing. Identifying encroachment with an ethnic toga is dangerous and mischievous and it has ever been. A spare parts dealer that encroaches into other peoples land to store his wares has committed an act of trespass not because he is an Igbo man but because of his unlawful act.\n\n\u201dAs AGF, his role is to set out the law in precise terms and if we must understand, he is not the one that made these laws because it is not his duty to do so.\n\n\u201dWe also make bold to say that the Southern Governors\u2019 declaration is a blanket statement lacking in precision and legally wrong. The statement of the AGF in the interview was aimed at showing this.\n\n\u201dWe believe the AGF spoke strictly on the lawfulness of cattle rearing. Based on our laws, every lawful business is free and guaranteed by the 1999 Constitution. We are not also unmindful of the fact that in the course of doing business an act of criminality may occur and if that happens, it can be dealt with according to the extant law. We believe it is wrong from for the Southern Governors to throw a blanket ban because criminals have infiltrated a business. It is illogical to act in that regard and we urge the Governors to revisit their stand in the overall interest of unity and peaceful coexistence among all Nigerians.\n\n\u201dAt this stage of our national life when tackling insecurity is at the front burner of governance, the Governors should not distract citizens with the issue of open grazing. They should rather focus their energy on granting autonomy to States Legislature, Judiciary and Local Governments . By this we mean that the Governors should immediately implement the provisions of Executive Order 10 as signed by President Muhammadu Buhari. They should respect the democratic principles of independence of State Legislature and Judiciary in line with Section 121 (3) of the Constitution. Nigerians seek nothing less. The divisionary and diversionary techniques should be over.\n\n\u201dWe believe the AGF spoke strictly on the lawfulness of cattle rearing. Based on our laws, every lawful business is free and guaranteed by the 1999 Constitution. We are not also unmindful of the fact that in the course of doing business an act of criminality may occur and if that happens, it can be dealt with according to the extant law.

          "text": "An emotional Luis Suarez has said he was \u201cunderestimated\u201d by Barcelona after winning La Liga with Atletico Madrid.\n\nSuarez \u2014 who was allowed to leave Camp Nou eight months ago \u2014 scored the winning goal on Saturday as Atletico pulled off a 2-1 comeback victory away at Real Valladolid to clinch the league title on the final day of the season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of things. It was difficult, the situation I had to go through,\u201d a visibly tearful Suarez told Movistar.\n\n\u201cAt the start of the season, with the way I was underestimated\u2026 Atletico Madrid opened the door for me, to keep showing that I\u2019m still valid. That\u2019s why I\u2019ll always be grateful to this great club for trusting in me.\n\n\u201cA lot of people have suffered with me. My wife, my kids, they\u2019re with me day-to-day. I\u2019ve been in football for many years and this is the year they\u2019ve suffered the most.\u201d\n\nSuarez, 34, scored 21 league goals this season for Atletico, firing them to their first title in seven years after being deemed surplus to requirements by Barca last summer.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve shown again that Atletico had a great year, despite the difficulties we had at some stages of the season,\u201d Suarez said. \u201cWe\u2019ve shown we were the best team, the most consistent, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re champions.\u201d\n\nAtletico had led the La Liga table since December, but a dip in form saw the title race go to the final weekend when the 2-1 win at Valladolid saw them finish two points clear of rivals Real Madrid and seven points ahead of Barcelona.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s special, because of everything I had to suffer,\u201d Suarez said, when asked how this title compared to the four he won with Barca.\n\n\u201cMy statistics are there. Five out of seven league titles. That is Luis Suarez.\u201d\n\nCoach Diego Simeone had backed the Uruguay international to make the difference this week, saying they were entering the Suarez zone.\n\n\u201cThe Suarez Zone, man\u2026 I said it two days ago,\u201d Simeone said on Saturday. \u201cMaybe I was lucky, but it\u2019s Suarez. Suarez. The name speaks for itself.\u201d\n\nSuarez had been pictured having lunch with former Barca teammate and close friend Lionel Messi in Madrid earlier this week.\n\n\u201c[Messi] will be happy, we\u2019re friends, that\u2019s the most important thing,\u201d Suarez said. \u201cHe wished me luck.\u201d",

          "text": "Atletico Madrid pipped city rivals Real Madrid to the La Liga title on Saturday after Luis Suarez fired them to a 2-1 comeback win at Real Valladolid.\n\nValladolid took a shock lead in the 18th minute when Oscar Plano slotted past Jan Oblak to complete a sweeping counter-attack after Yannick Carrasco had lost control of the ball following an Atletico corner.\n\nJust as they had done in last week\u2019s comeback win over Osasuna, Atletico missed a series of clear opportunities but they drew level after a moment of magic from Angel Correa, who danced his way through the defence before arrowing into the bottom corner in the 57th minute.\n\nSuarez then pounced on a giveaway by the Valladolid defence to score in the 67th and put Atletico on their way to a victory that would secure the title no matter what happened in Real Madrid\u2019s game at home to Villarreal.\n\nValladolid missed a couple of glaring opportunities down the other end while Geoffrey Kondogbia wasted a chance that would have given Atletico a more relaxing finish when he blasted into the side-netting.\n\nReal Madrid ended up fighting their way back from a goal down to beat Villarreal 2-1 which meant they would have swiped the title from Atletico\u2019s hands if Valladolid had equalised thanks to a better head-to-head record.\n\nHowever, Diego Simeone\u2019s side saw out the victory and wildly celebrated on the pitch.\n\n\u201cAtletico have had an incredible season despite all the difficulties we\u2019ve had. We\u2019ve been the most consistent team and we are champions,\u201d said Suarez.\n\nAtletico finished top of the standings on 86 points while Real, who snatched a late 2-1 win over Villarreal, came second on 84. Valladolid finished 19th and were relegated to Spain\u2019s second division.\n\nHundreds of fans celebrated in central Madrid after the match, while the police drafted in extra officers and drones to monitor the situation.",

          "text": "A Palestinian official says an initial assessment shows at least 2,000 housing units were destroyed in the fighting between Israel and Palestinian militant groups in Gaza.\n\nNaji Sarhan, deputy of Gaza\u2019s works and housing ministry, said on Saturday that more than 15,000 other units were partly destroyed in the 11-day war.\n\nIsrael launched hundreds of airstrikes on the overcrowded strip, targeting residential, commercial and government buildings. It said it was going after locations where Hamas had offices and resources.\n\nSarhan said four mosques were destroyed along with dozens of police offices in Gaza. He said most of the factories in Gaza\u2019s industrial zone were destroyed or damaged.\n\nMeanwhile, police inspected unexploded Israeli ordinance collected during the campaign. Police chief Mahmoud Salah said nearly 300 Israeli rockets and shells did not explode.\n\nSarhan put the estimated financial losses from the fighting at $150 million. Assessment is still ongoing, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the United Nations says approximately 800,000 people in Gaza do not have regular access to clean piped water, as nearly 50% of the water network was damaged in the recent fighting.\n\nQuoting Gaza\u2019s public works and housing ministry, the UN \u2019s office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said nearly 17,000 residential and commercial units have been damaged or destroyed in the 11-day campaign.\n\nThese include 769 housing and commercial units that have been rendered uninhabitable, at least 1,042 units in some 258 buildings which have been destroyed and another 14,538 units that have suffered minor damage.\n\nA cease-fire took effect Friday after an 11-day campaign that left more than 250 dead \u2014 the vast majority Palestinians \u2014 and brought widespread devastation to the already impoverished Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip\n\nThe UN said 53 education facilities, six hospitals and 11 primary health care centers have been damaged since May 10. One health center was severely damaged, the UN said, while one hospital is not operational because of lack of electricity. Schools in Gaza remain closed, affecting almost 600,000 children.",
