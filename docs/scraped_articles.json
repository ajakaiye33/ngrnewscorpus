          "title": "Too much protein intake can damage kidneys, dietician warns",
          "text": "Angela Onwuzoo\n\nA Registered Dietician-Nutritionist, Cynthia Onyekwere, says though the body needs protein to help build muscle, repair tissue, and fight infection, too much intake of it can damage the kidneys.\n\nAccording to the dietician, eating too much protein could place more burden on the kidneys, warning that this can progressively cause damage.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with PUNCH HealthWise, Onyekwere also cautioned Nigerians against living mainly on processed foods, noting that those doing it are at risk of developing kidney diseases.\n\nEating a lot of processed foods, she warned can predispose those indulging in it to Type 2 diabetes and increase their risk of coming down with kidney diseases later on in life.\n\nOnyekwere noted, \u201cToo much intake of protein can damage the kidneys. Although protein is required for the repair of worn-out tissues and the build-up of new ones, when consumed excessively, it is harmful to the kidneys.\n\n\u201cThis is because it is the kidney that helps the body to get rid of the waste products that are generated after the digestion of protein.\n\n\u201cEating too much protein will place more burden on the kidneys and this can progressively cause damage.\u201d\n\nAccording to the National Kidney Foundation, having too much protein in the body can cause waste to build up in the blood, and the kidneys may not be able to remove all the extra waste.\n\nAlso, Mayo Clinic \u2013 a medical center focused on integrated health care, education, and research, says a high-protein diet may worsen kidney function in people with kidney disease because the body may have trouble eliminating all the waste products of protein metabolism.\n\nThe dietician also stressed that an unhealthy diet was a major contributing factor to the onset of kidney diseases.\n\nOnyekwere explained, \u201cFor one to keep kidney diseases away, it is important to pay close attention to his/her diet and make some dietary adjustments by mainly reducing intake of certain foods that can affect renal function negatively.\n\n\u201cOne of such foods to be reduced is salt. Salt contains sodium which when consumed in excess can cause high blood pressure which can lead to kidney damage.\n\n\u201cTo achieve a reduced salt intake, one can start by reducing the amount of salt and stock cubes used in cooking, stop adding salt to meals when eating, and limit intakes of pastries and salty snacks.\n\n\u201cAlso, processed foods can also affect renal function and as such should be consumed in limited amounts. Examples of processed foods include canned meat and as well as canned fruits and vegetables. They should be consumed sparingly as they contain a lot of sodium.\u201d\n\nThe dietician also said people need to be wary of herbal concoctions to ensure optimal renal function.\n\n\u201cHerbal concoctions, be it in water or alcohol extracts contains substances that may be toxic to the kidneys,\u201d she added.\n\nOn how people can avoid coming down with kidney diseases, the dietician enjoined them to embrace a healthy lifestyle and to go for regular health checks for early detection and proper management.\n\nIn a 2020 article published in PubMed Central Journal titled, \u201cThe Effects of High-Protein Diets on Kidney Health and Longevity\u201d, the authors said as high-protein diets continue to be popular for weight loss and type 2 diabetes, evidence suggests that worsening renal function may occur in individuals with-and perhaps without-impaired kidney function.\n\nPMC is a free digital repository that archives open access scholarly articles that have been published in biomedical and life sciences journals.\n\nThe authors said long-term high protein intake might lead to chronic kidney disease.\n\n\u201cHigh dietary protein intake can cause intraglomerular hypertension, which may result in kidney hyperfiltration, glomerular injury, and proteinuria.\n\n\u201cIt is possible that long-term high protein intake may lead to de novo CKD. The quality of dietary protein may also play a role in kidney health.\n\n\u201cCompared with protein from plant sources, animal protein has been associated with an increased risk of end-stage kidney disease in several observational studies, including the Singapore Chinese Health Study.\n\n\u201cPotential mediators of kidney damage from animal protein include dietary acid load, phosphate content, gut microbiome dysbiosis, and resultant inflammation,\u201d the authors said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": ".\n\n**Order\u2019s Review of Rules of Engagement for Operation Safe Conduct to Guide Troops during Elections.\n\nBy: Kingsley Omonobi \u2013 Abuja.\n\nAhead of the 2023 general elections, the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen Faruk Yahaya directed all General Officers Commanding, Corp Commanders, Commanders of Theaters of Operations, Brigade and other Formation Commanders remain apolitical while ensuring that troops under command comply with the directive.\n\nSpeaking at the Second Quarter Chief of Army Conference which kick-started on Tuesday in Abuja, the COAS disclosed that towards implementing this directive, he has ordered a review of the rules of Engagement for conduct of Operation Safe Conduct\n\nHis words to the Senior Officers, \u201cLet me hasten to remind us that the nation is currently preparing for general elections. All personnel must remain apolitical while providing enabling and secured environment for electoral processes to thrive.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, I directed the review of Rules of Engagement and Code of Conduct for Operation Safe Conduct and the approved guidelines would be conveyed to you soon. The Nigerian Army will continue to enhance its Civil- Military relations efforts and provide the necessary support in aid of the civil authority.\n\nOn the conference, Gen Yahaya said, \u201cFew months ago, in my First Quarter Conference closing remarks, I affirmed that the Nigerian Army remains resolute and committed to squarely confront the myriad of security challenges bedeviling the country.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, we have confronted all forms of criminalities in collaboration with our sister Services and other security agencies. The level of cooperation and professionalism exhibited by our sister Services and other security agencies in furtherance of this effort has been heartwarming. This has led to the achievement of several successes across various theatres of operation in the country.\n\n\u201cIn the North East troops of Operation Hadin Kai have sustained the onslaught against the terrorists leading to the clearance of the several criminal enclaves and the surrendering of large numbers of insurgents and their families.\n\n\u201cConcerted effort has also been made to contain and checkmate the secessionist activities in the South East and illegal oil bunker activities in the South \u2013 South. The South West has remained relatively calm while our reinvigorated operations across North Central and North West theatres are also yielding positive results.\n\n\u201cThis conference would therefore enable us to fine-tune our strategies and establish new benchmarks for enhancement of our operations in all theatres of operations. I wish to commend the sacrifices and bravery of our troops and assure the people that the Nigerian Army will continue to sustain its effort to provide the enabling environment for socio economic activities to thrive.\n\n\u201cOur training activities have also improved significantly as we continue to vigorously pursue adequate training of our personnel both locally and overseas. The current efforts by our foreign partners in bringing relevant and mission-oriented training to our personnel are yielding the desired results.\n\n\u201cThe positive feedback on the effect of the training from Restore Hope 1 and II and Project Stinger in the theatres of operation since the deployment of the trainees is encouraging. Accordingly, we shall continue to devote premium attention to our training activities as this remains the best welfare for our troops and fundamental requirement for successful operations.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Army has continued to make giant strides in infrastructural development. Our unwavering commitment to ensure adequate accommodation can be seen in the number of commissioned living quarters for troops and several ongoing renovation works in various barracks across the country\n\n\u201cRecently, several formations, including the Army Headquarters Garrison have commissioned befitting accommodation for Regimental Sergeant Majors. This gesture has certainly raised the morale of the troops and bolstered their aspirations while on the job. We will continue to upgrade the infrastructure in the barracks, improve the overall health care of the personnel and their families and strengthen the current welfare packages to the benefit of our personnel.\n\nHe disclosed that \u201cthe successes achieved in our operations were no doubt facilitated by the commitment of the political leadership toward enhancing operational competences of the Nigerian Army as well as our general logistics, welfare, and wellbeing of the troops\u201d adding that, \u201cthe Nigerian Army is deeply indebted and thankful to President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cLet me once again therefore register our thanks and appreciation to the President Muhammadu Buhari for his strategic guidance, for the confidence he always reposes in the Nigerian Army and for always standing with us in the provision of funds for the procurement of new platforms, and other support and requirements. These untiring efforts by the President have continued to enhance our operations and successes. I want to assure of the unalloyed loyalty of the officers and soldiers of the Nigerian Army to the President Commander-in-Chief and the Constitution of the Federal Republic\u201d he added",
          "summary": "The Nigerian Army will continue to enhance its Civil- Military relations efforts and provide the necessary support in aid of the civil authority.\n\u201cConcerted effort has also been made to contain and checkmate the secessionist activities in the South East and illegal oil bunker activities in the South \u2013 South.\n\u201cOur training activities have also improved significantly as we continue to vigorously pursue adequate training of our personnel both locally and overseas.\n\u201cThe Nigerian Army has continued to make giant strides in infrastructural development.\nI want to assure of the unalloyed loyalty of the officers and soldiers of the Nigerian Army to the President Commander-in-Chief and the Constitution of the Federal Republic\u201d he added",

We\u2019ll not lord it over you, but support you so that you work for the socio-economic development of your areas.\n\n\u201cIf elected, our government would operate and open door policy, and would ensure that everyone is carried along.\n\n\u201cAs governor, I\u2019ll ensure monies belonging to the councils are not tampered with so that you can use same to ensure the development of communities at the councils.\u201d\n\nDikko also harped on the need for party members in the state to unite and work together in order to defeat the opposition in the 2023 general election.\n\nHe urged them not to be distracted by whatever may have happened during the party\u2019s primary and team up to work at winning the hearts of the electorate ahead of the polls, noting that he bears no grudge against anyone he had competed against for the party\u2019s ticket.\n\nIn his words: \u201cAs the general election draws nearer, many allegations would come up aimed at tarnishing the image of state government, and the party. I want us to be vigilant about this.\n\n\u201cWe have several months before the polls, so we have time to work for the victory of the party. We should therefore come out with our resources and supporters to ensure success.\n\n\u201cI hold no grudge against anyone in the party, especially those that contested with me for the governorship ticket of the party.\n\n\u201cWe have had our internal wranglings and we have come out of the primary. The time is now, for us to put hands together, forget our differences and work to ensure we return the party to power in 2023.\n\n\u201cOn election day, you\u2019re not going to vote for me. You are going to vote for the APC, the party that gave me the ticket.\n\n\u201cThe coming election is going to be different. Results are going to be sent to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as they come, so there can be no irregularities.\n\n\u201cTherefore, ensure that you work diligently for the party so that we can compete favourably with the opposition.\n\n\u201cLook at ways you can sell the party and its candidates to the electorate, as this is the only way to win their hearts and convince them to vote for the APC.\u201d",

          "text": "From Emmanuel Adeyemi lokoja\n\nThe Bishop of the Anglican Diocese of Kabba, Kogi State, Rt. Rev. Dr Steven Kayode Akobe, has called on the Federal Government to urgently devise a new security architecture that would finally put an end to the incessant senseless killings of innocent people in the country by terrorists suspected to be foreign mercenaries.\n\nHe said the situation is worsening every day as terrorists invade communities, kill and maim innocent citizens with little or no response from security agencies or government, while the people continue to live in fear in their fatherland.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nHe said: \u201cNigeria is fast becoming a land flowing with tears and blood because the reality of terror, devastations, destructions and fear are evident every where. It is like an earthquake, which is followed by a tsunami, leaving great destruction of lives and property, and we have no place to hide.\n\n\u201cWe live in very uncertain times, Nigerians have lost their homes, livelihood, lives and property because these attacks have become senseless and endless, there seems to be no end in sight, either at home, on the road, at worship centres or at work, on the farm, nowhere is safe.\n\n\u201cThe government appears to be weak and overwhelmed, and the security agencies appear not to be able to bring the situation under control. Nowhere is safe in Nigeria; every aspect of our national life is under attack, we are in a war situation, the government has to seek external help if necessary, so as to save our lives.\n\n\u201cIt must be noted that the incessant insurgency, banditry, kidnapping attacks devastating our communities are mostly carried out by foreigners from other parts of Africa with collaboration from some elements and groups within the country. And government must urgently do something about this before it escalates further,\u201d the bishop noted\n\n\u201cNigeria has more than 250 ethnic nationalities that have existed peacefully together for many centuries, however,some unpatriotic Nigerian politicians have brought in foreigners from other countries in Africa in order to enhance their political advantage. Our young people have always been turned to political thugs and the result is what we are now witnessing today.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, call on the Federal Government to speedily find a way of securing our country and deliver us from the hands of insurgency. There is an urgent need, therefore, to guard our national borders against marauders and raiders and for the government to act decisively and stop the blame game,\u201d he added.\n\nBishop Steven Kayode Akobe gave the charge recently during the Ninth Synod of the Anglican Diocese of Kabba at the Cathedral Church of St Andrews, Kabba, with the theme, \u201cThe place and power of the Altar (personal, family, church and national) as a means of Christian discipleship. 1Kings: 18: 20-41.\n\nOn the nation\u2019s dwindling economy, Bishop Akobe said the devastation on the economy was having a serious toll on the day-to-day living of Nigerians, adding that the current foreign debt profile of N41. 6 trillion was on the high side and unacceptable.\n\nOn the forthcoming general election, the man of God called on all Nigerians of voting age to go and collect their PVC and vote on election day, according to their conscience, even as he called on voters to stop worshipping the politicians because of peanuts they would collect from them, stressing that they should not sell their future.\n\nWhile urging christians to play active roles in electing their leaders in the coming polls, he said it was not enough to pray and fast alone for the country, but believers must come out and also seek elective positions, so as to rid Nigeria of corruption.\n\nBishop Akobe, while exhorting christians on the need to build personal and family prayer altars to intercede for the nation and for their personal needs, said an altar for God would enhance the personal relationship of christians and their Maker, as it would enable them communicate with Him and hear directly from Him.\n\nRt. Rev. Akobe, who gave comprehensive accounts of those who built prayer altars for the Lord in the Bible and their lives were positively transformed, said every genuine child of God must have a personal prayer altar, and every genuine christian family must have a corporate prayer altar as a lifestyle.\n\nHe enumerated the benefits of prayer altars to include giving christians free access to the throne of grace, constant refreshing from the Lord, drawing constant strength and spiritual energy, connecting deeper to the Lord, and hearing or getting direct revelations from God, among others.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

Those targets have started to look unachievable.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Tinubu working on options, asks for more time\n\n\u2022Okowa, Wike top preference as opposition party is almost done\n\n\u2022Obi, Kwankwaso still consulting\n\n\u2022Abdulsalami peace committee doubts credible polls in 2023\n\nChuks Okocha, Onyebuchi Ezigbo, Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja, and Segun Awofadeji in Bauchi\n\n\n\nWith deadline for the submission of names of presidential candidates and their running mates three days away, the leaderships of some of the main political parties \u2013 the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the Labour Party (LP) and New Nigeria People\u2019s Party (NNPP) \u2013 are already in some last minute consultations over the choice of their vice-presidential candidates which must be submitted to the electoral body by Friday\n\nThe parties had recently elected their presidential candidates, weeks apart at different locations and times.\n\nPDP elected former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar at its presidential primaries held at the National Stadium some three weeks ago, the APC, last week, elected a former governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu, at its special convention, held at the Eagles Square; LP elected Obi its candidate in Asaba, Delta State, while Kwakwaso was elected NNPP candidate the Moshood Abiola Stadium, Abuja.\n\nHowever, while the APC is said to be considering a choice presidential running mate from the North East part of the country, being a part of the north yet to produce the nation\u2019s president, the party remains divided on the vexed issue of religion. But party stalwarts concede, it remains the decision of the candidate even though some believe the candidate should depart from that venture.\n\nAt the same time, the PDP might have narrowed down its choice of candidate to between the Governor of Delta State, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa and his counterpart from Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, who also contested the PDP presidential primaries and came second. Interestingly, Wike has been lobby for the position, The PDP is expected to name its candidate anytime soon.\n\nOn their parts, Obi and Kwankwaso were allegedly still consulting, according to insiders, and this is in addition to the suspicion that both men might be considering working together, if things get to a head.\n\nThis, nonetheless, the National Peace Committee, led by a former Head of State, General Abdusalami Abubakar (rtd), who just turned 80 years, has expressed fear that the 2023 general election may not meet the expectations of Nigerians of a free, transparent and credible electoral process.\n\nThus, barring any further changes, while the vice-presidential candidates of both the PDP and the APC are likely to come from the South-south and the North East geopolitical zones respectively, those of Obi and Kwankwaso are not known yet.\n\nA special committee set up by the stakeholders of the PDP, THISDAY gathered, had settled for Okowa and Wike.\n\nNational Vice Chairman of the PDP, South-south zone, Dan Orbih, Wike\u2019 s man Friday, was said to be in the push for Wike to be nominated vice-presidential candidate from Rivers State.\n\nBut, he was allegedly being opposed by some stakeholders from the same zone, who argued that the Delta State governor, was not aligned during the campaigns, more so, that he had earlier yielded his senatorial seat in Delta north to a former member of the House of Representatives, Ned Nwoko.\n\nYet, the special committee has said its duty stopped at shortlisting credible and capable hands, but not to impose a candidate on Atiku.\n\n\u201cOurs is to recommend and not to impose a vice-presidential candidate on Atiku,\u201d a source on the committee hinted.\n\nThe source said what had been going for Wike was his financial war chest that could support the Atiku campaigns, explaining that money would certainly play a vital role in the 2023 general election.\n\nAccording to him, the two governors would be presented to Atiku Abubakar today for him to make his final choice and present to the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party on Wednesday.\n\nThe source explained further that, \u201cWhat we are doing is to ensure a hitch-free choice on Atiku and avoid what happened in 2019.\u201d\n\nConsequently, the committee has recommended that the office of the Senate President should be zoned to the North West, should the PDP win majority seats in the Senate at the general election.\n\nAlso, it recommended that the office of the Speaker of the House of Representatives be zoned to the South East, if the PDP wins majority seats in the lower chamber.\n\nFurther to the recommendations, top ministerial positions should be reserved for either of the two governors short-listed for the vice-presidential slot, depending on who between the two Atiku Abubakar settles for as his running mate.\n\nIn the APC, multiple sources in the party said, Tinubu has asked for more time to choose his running mate, even though some APC leaders were said to be keen on the party\u2019s position on religion.\n\nTHISDAY gathered yesterday that the APC governors and other relevant stakeholders agreed that Tinubu\u2019s running mate should come from the North East, but not certain, if it would be a Muslim-Muslim ticket or Muslim-Christian ticket.\n\n\u201cThe views of the Kaduna State Governor, Mallam el-Rufai for a Muslim Muslim presidential ticket as was the case in Kaduna State is a recipe for crisis in a modern Nigeria. That it happened in the days of Chief MKO Abiola with Babagana Kingibe does not mean that it can happen in the present day Nigeria,\u201d a staunch party source said.\n\nThe source further explained that the Christian stakeholders of APC from the North East have capable hands in the persons of the Secretary to the Government of Federation, Boss Mustapha, who is from Adamawa State.\n\nConversely, he noted further that, \u201cBoss Mustapha is a Christian and worships with the Redeem Christian Church of God (RCCG) and there is also the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara from Bauchi State.\u201d\n\nThe source stated that the governor of Plateau State, Simon Lalong, is from the North Central, where the party\u2019s National Chairman, Senator Adamu Abdullahi, is from and therefore, automatically ruled him out.\n\nIn the same manner, the source said if the APC maintained its majority in the National Assembly, the Senate President is expected to come from the South East and the North West to produce the Speaker of the House of Representatives.\n\nThe source, however, reiterated that the North Central has been ruled out, because of Adamu.\n\nAPC National Stakeholders Kick Against Muslim-Muslim Ticket\n\nThe APC National Stakeholders have kicked against the purported Muslim-Muslim ticket being mulled by the party leadership.\n\nThe Convener, Mr. Aliyu Audu, while addressing a press conference yesterday in Abuja, said the country was deeply divided within the fault lines of ethnicity and religion, saying the ruling party could not afford to jettison those sensibilities in critical decision-making.\n\nAgainst this background, the group noted that APC must be guided by such sensibilities in the selection of its vice-presidential candidate, even as it recalled that the unity of the country was put to test a few weeks ago, when certain interests were divided as to which of the regions between the north and the south should produce the next president of Nigeria.\n\nWhile noting that some interests wanted the north to pick the ticket, others advocated that the APC should pick her standard bearer from the south in the spirit of nationalism, justice and fairness.\n\nIt stressed that while the debate raged, governors and leaders of thoughts from the northern region heeded the call for a southern presidency by declaring their support and also stood their ground.\n\nThe group pointed out that with their insistence and strong support, a southern candidate in the person of Senator Bola Tinubu, emerged as the candidate of the APC, and therefore, commended members of the Northern Governors\u2019 Forum, who ensured that it came to pass, by proving themselves to be true heroes of democracy.\n\nIt noted that having successfully crossed the hurdle of producing a presidential candidate from the southern region, the bone of contention now lies in which of the two dominant faiths would produce the vice-presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cThere have been arguments that vice-presidential candidate, which is primed to come from the north must be of the Christian faith, while some others have argued that for the APC to stand the chance of winning the 2023 presidential election, the vice must be a Christian, since the South has already produced a Muslim as the Presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cAPC National Stakeholders is deeply concerned about the raging controversy, which has heated the polity in the last few days. While we are conscious of the fact that religion should not be a determining factor in the our leadership selection process, the peculiar circumstance the nation found herself calls for reflection in the decisions we take, so long as they bother on our national lives.\u201d\n\nThe group insisted that northern APC has in its fold capable individuals from the Christian faith with proven track record that could deliver just like anyone from the other faith and called on the party to narrow its search for the vice-presidential candidate of the party to a northern Christian, saying doing this would ensure national inclusion, help to manage our differences and promote national unity.\n\nWike Best Option to Atiku, Says Arewa Youths Advocate\n\nAs the search for a presidential running mate to the candidate of the opposition PDP, Atiku Abubakar, thickens, the Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has been identified as the best choice for the number two office considering his acceptability across the country.\n\nThe assertion was made by a political pressure group, Arewa Youth Advocates For Peace and Unity Initiatives, in a press release signed by its National President, Sani Mohammed, copies of which was made available to journalists in Bauchi, yesterday.\n\nThe group stated that, \u201cWe deem it fit to be partners of progress, peace building agents to ensure that youths are fully and adequately sensitised through media Platforms, to further ensure that youths contributes positively to the development of our only country Nigeria, for peaceful elections come 2023.\n\n\u201cIt is on this premise, that after an extensive consultations within different youths groups and relevant stakeholders in the North, and the conduct of opinion polls using different online platforms/ physical methods on Atiku/Wike Presidency 2023, the results proved successful and the ticket will give PDP decisive victory.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, as the presidential candidate and former Vice-President of Nigeria, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar GCON intensifies search for his running mate in the forthcoming presidential election, he should put it at the back of his mind especially, now that he is leading a unifying campaign that Nigeria is ethnically heterogeneous and culturally pluralistic.\n\n\u201cThe Political practice has since 1979 is either a president from the North and Vice President from the South or otherwise. Atiku Abubakar, a Northerner will be considering different names as a choice of his running mate, though it is his sole responsibility, but demography and other factors should guide him to avoid mistakes of the past.\n\n\u201cHowever, there are many eminently qualified Nigerians from the South to be nominated as Atiku\u2019s running mate but as it stands, Rivers State Governor, Barrister Nyeson Wike, stands as one among many to complement the PDP ticket to ensure Victory,\u201d the group posited.\n\nAbdulsalami Peace Committee Doubts Credible Poll in 2023\n\nThe National Peace Committee led by a former Head of State, General Abdusalami Abubakar (rtd), has expressed fear that the forthcoming 2023 general election could meet the expectations of Nigerians for a free, transparent and credible electoral process.\n\nThe committee\u2019s reservations came just as it urged all the people taking part in the Ekiti State governorship election to follow due process and conduct themselves with civility and patriotism.\n\nThe NPC also said a peace accord would be signed by the various political parties and stakeholders on Wednesday, at the Amazing Grace Events Hall, Ikokun, Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State.\n\nIn a statement signed by the former Head of State, the peace committee said, \u201cjudging from the experience at the recent party primaries, where politicians monetised the entire process, the hope of ordinary Nigerians that their interest and aspirations will be reflected in the outcome of the 2023 general election may be lost\n\n\u201cWe are aware that the 2023 election may not be the best \u2013 as can be attested to by the monetisation of the process, the acrimonious conduct of the recent party primaries, and the elevation of the \u2018delegate position\u2019 over and above the welfare of ordinary Nigerians,\u201d the committee said.\n\nOn the forthcoming governorship election in Ekiti State, the Peace Committee urged the contenders to follow due process, conduct themselves with civility and patriotism, even as it advised the youths not to make themselves pawns in the chessboard of the political class\n\n\u201cThey should not take the laws into their hands \u2013 no matter the grievances they may hold against individuals, against the state, or against electoral bodies or security agencies.\n\n\u201cThe youths must realise that the security, stability, and future of Nigeria remains their common patrimony. They must make themselves available to become ambassadors of peace, retaining hope in Nigeria and support the democratic process in Ekiti State, and Nigeria in general,\u201d it said.\n\nSimilarly, the committee said the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), security agencies and the political candidates in the Ekiti governorship elections should know that the eyes of Nigerians, and indeed the world, were on them.\n\n\u201cThe conduct and peaceful outcome of the Ekiti State off-cycle elections will put to test all the claims of reforms and strategic policy implementations of the last four years.\n\n\u201cWe expect that a level playing field should be provided for all contestants \u2013 irrespective of the party under which they are contesting. We call on INEC and the security agencies not only to be non-partisan in the discharge of their duties but also to be seen to be so,\u201d it added.\n\nCAN Youths Advise Tinubu to Pick Northern Christian as Running mate\n\nThe youth wing of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), has advised the presidential candidate of the APC, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, to pick a Christian northerner as a running mate.\n\nThe group gave the advice at a press conference in Abuja yesterday.\n\nSpeaking at the press conference, National Chairman of the association, Belusochukwu Enwere, said in a country like Nigeria, it would be unfair to field a Christian/Christian or a Muslim/Muslim presidential ticket, adding that the idea of a Muslim/Muslim ticket was a slap on Christiandom.\n\n\u201cThe call for a Muslim-Muslim ticket by certain individuals is callous and deceptive, a move with a sinister agenda. It is a true definition of bigotry. It is a slap on the entire Christiandom; a ploy to distabilise the nation.\n\n\u201cThis is an insult; it devalues and dehumanises millions of Christians. Any political party that fields a Muslim /Muslim ticket or Christian/Christian ticket should know that it will lose the election,\u201d the group stated.\n\nIt added that it would amount to unholy action to insinuate that there was no competent Northern Christian that could be in a position of trust.\n\n\u201cDoes it imply that northern Christians are not regarded as northerners?\u201d the Christian group, asked, adding that for the unity and togetherness of the country, the north should support a Christian as vice-presidential candidate to Tinubu.\n\n\u201cIf we claim that we are together and the north is united \u2013 as the northerners make us to believe, then, they should have no reason to reject a northerner because he or she is a Christian.\n\n\u201cThere is no other time better than for northern brothers to prove to us that they are one. In the spirit of ethno-religious balancing and to foster integration and national unity amongst all tribes and religion, Nigeria needs oneness and togetherness,\u201d the group explained.\n\nInsecurity May Affect 2023 Elections, Group Warns\n\nThe Campaign for Democracy (CD), a human rights advocacy in Niger State, has expressed fears that the insecurity situation in parts of the state and the country, if not checked, could impede the smooth conduct of the 2023 general election.\n\nChairman of CD in the state, Abdullahi Jabi, said in Minna at the event to mark this year\u2019s Democracy Day that fears of attacks by insurgents could also lead to voter apathy.\n\n\u201cCD wants to say emphatically that in the area of security, Nigerians are passing through turbulent times with security challenges, food insecurity, disruption of goods, socio-economic challenges, poverty and hunger.\n\n\u201cIt is my opinion that insecurity if not properly checked and addressed by the Federal Government of Nigeria, it may likely affect the conduct of the 2023 general election due to voter apathy and massive migration of people to safer areas to avoid danger and risks to their lives,\u201d Jabi declared.\n\nHe, however, counseled INEC to ensure it provides peaceful environment and build the confidence of the electorate for them to participate in the election.\n\nChairman of the occasion and Board of Trustees Chairman of CD, North Central Zone, Mr. Murtala Ibrahim Agboola, in an address congratulated all the registered political parties for the peaceful conduct of their primaries, especially, the presidential primaries.\n\nThis, he said showed that, \u201cour democracy is maturing and on course.\u201d\n\nAgboola appealed to politicians and party members to, as the nation approaches the 2023 general election, go about their campaigns and debates with decorum, devoid of character assassination and mudslinging.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

One party, Action Peoples Party (APP), will not present a presidential candidate for the poll, as the time given by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for political parties to conclude their primaries elapsed on June 9.\n\n\n\nWith the emergence of the presidential candidates for the February 2023 general election, the next stage is the choice of their running mates to make up complete tickets, as provided by the constitution.\n\nWhile the politicking for vice presidential candidates goes on, we familiarise Nigerians with the men, who want to lead the country, perhaps, to help the citizens in their choice of preferred candidates.\n\nTHISDAY presents the 17 men, who seek to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023.\n\nChristopher Imumolen (AP)\n\nProfessor Christopher Imumolen is the presidential candidate of Accord Party (AP).

He is the founder of Global Wealth System, a business network system, with over 450,000 membership, set up to empower entrepreneurs globally.\n\n\n\nImumolen said he joined the 2023 presidential race because he believed Nigeria needed a new kind of leadership, since things were not working because there was a leadership gap.\n\nHamza Al Mustapha (AA)\n\nMaj. Hamza Al-Mustapha was Chief Security Officer to the late Head of State, Gen. Sani Abacha. Al-Mustapha was trained as a military intelligence operative and held various command posts in the Ministry of Internal Affairs; Security Group of the Directorate of Military Intelligence (SG-DMI), 82 Division; Army Headquarters; Ministry of Defence; and the Presidency. He was also involved in counter-intelligence activities and at least, two investigations of coup attempts, which brought him to the attention of Abacha. He conducted operations in Chad, Liberia, Bakassi, Gambia, and Sierra Leone.\n\n\n\nAl-Mustapha oversaw the reorganisation of the entire territory of Nigeria into six geopolitical zones. In this, he cultivated a vast network of spies and informants across the federation.\n\nHe was removed from office and subsequently arrested after the death of Abacha in 1998. On 21 December 2010, Al-Mustapha and his co-defendants were acquitted of most of the charges against them, but they were not cleared of the alleged murder of Kudirat Abiola. On January 30, 2012, the Lagos High Court found Al-Mustapha guilty of the murder and he was sentenced to death by hanging. However, on July 12, 2013, the Court of Appeal in Lagos overturned the high court judgement and acquitted Al-Mustapha of all the murder charges.\n\n\n\nIn 2017, Al-Mustapha joined partisan politics and founded the Green Party of Nigeria (GPN).

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Kenya\u2019s controversial \u201cICT Practitioners Bill\u201d is closer to becoming law",
          "text": "On Wednesday, Kenya\u2019s 12th parliament passed the controversial 2020 proposal that seeks to regulate \u201canyone who employs technologies to collect, process, store or transfer information for a fee\u201d.\n\nFirst introduced in 2016 by majority leader, Aden Duale, and supported by Kenyan MP, Godfrey Osotsi, the wide-sweeping and vague ICT Practitioners Bill mandated the registration and licensing of vaguely defined \u201cICT practitioners\u201d by a council. According to the 2016 proposal, individuals who sought registration with the council needed to have completed a university education with at least 3 years of relevant experience and would pay an annual license fee. The proposal also outlined jail terms and fines for individuals who failed to comply.\n\nA snapshot of the amended 2020 bill. The full bill is here.\n\nNeedless to say, the proposal drew an outcry from the country\u2019s tech community and was reportedly withdrawn after Joseph Mucheru, Cabinet Secretary in Kenya\u2019s Ministry of Information and Computer Technology, rejected it, noting that proposals in the bill would affect innovative talent and alienate local youth from lucrative online jobs, educational and investment opportunities. At the time, Mucheru had said, \u201cIf enacted, the ICT Protection Bill 2016 will cause duplication in regulation and frustrate individual talents from realising their potential.\u201d\n\nThat was in 2016.\n\nTwo years later, in 2018, a member of parliament who was nominated to represent workers, Godfrey Osotsi, reintroduced the bill with an amendment that simply loosened the eligibility requirement for ICT professionals. Now instead of being required to have graduated from a university, a proposed ICT Practitioners Council would determine who got registered.\n\nIn 2018, the bill was also rejected.\n\nAgain, 2 years later in November 2020, the bill was reintroduced with superficial amendments that removed degree requirements, jail terms, and fines for people who fail to register.\n\nAlmost 2 years later, this Wednesday in a sleepy parliamentary session, and with one day to go before the 12th parliament closed shop for the term, the bill was quietly passed and now awaits presidential assent.\n\nWho is supporting this bill?\n\nWhile the bill has generated outrage from stakeholders in Kenya\u2019s tech community, there is significant support from a raft of tech professionals. In 2016, the Secretary-General of the ICT Association of Kenya (ICTAK), Kamotho Njenga, released a statement supporting the bill. \u201cOnce enacted,\u201d the statement read in part, \u201cthe various provisions enlisted will go a long way not only to elevate the standards of ICT practice in Kenya but to also avail a blueprint that will help counter multiple challenges that accompany emergent technologies. By creating a registration framework, the bill injects professionalism and introduces a culture of accountability within the industry as the country gears towards an ICT-driven economy.\u201d\n\nPaul Macharia, a health informatics consultant supports the proposal. \u201cHaving worked in the ICT space for over 15 years, I know we needed a regulatory body like yesterday.\u201d he opined. He says the bill will ensure standards of competence, allow governments to keep a register of all the professionals that meet these standards and deal with the professionals that fall short of these standards.\n\nBoth Macharia and the ICTAK\u2019s points are the standard arguments of the proponents of the bill. But Kenya already has a Computer Misuse Act and a Cyber Crimes Act\u2014both wide-sweeping laws that regulate the use of technology in Kenya, so it is not clear how or why another law is needed to stop the so-called quacks from operating. Besides this, the bill does not disclose how the council would issue accreditation for ICT professionals or provide the criteria to be used in determining if an individual is of good moral standing.\n\nThat \u201cquack\u201d classification is also problematic. Information technology is one of the most dynamic and fast-growing spaces globally. Unlike civil engineering or medical health, for example, a software developer does not need to be certified to build software. Indeed many of today\u2019s widely used tech products are built and maintained by unlicensed developers. No country has the sort of national ICT licensing programme that this bill proposes.\n\nBut Macharia contends that Kenya can lead the way, \u201cSure! Kenya being the first is a great thing,\u201d he wrote in a LinkedIn comment. \u201cWe could set the pace/standard on how ICT professionals work.\u201d\n\nA black spot for Silicon Savannah\n\nKenya\u2019s Long Term Development Blueprint, Vision 2030 depends on strong performance from its burgeoning ICT sector. Photo by Mustafa Omar on Unsplash\n\nA loose alignment of tech stakeholders and professionals who have been fighting the bill since its debut in 2016 disagree.\n\nIn a draft counter-statement to the ICTAK\u2019s 2016 declaration seen by this writer, the group wrote, \u201cRegistering of practitioners does not necessarily lead to professionalism and accountability. ICTAK has not cited any direct evidence that registering of practitioners affects the overall quality of services provided to customers by members of a regulated profession.\u201d\n\nThe statement continues, \u201cAlmost every ICT job is conducted within the confines of \u201ccontracts\u201d that define the responsibilities of parties involved, hence ensuring accountability. What values shall this bill add to the accountability of ICT practitioners, that is beyond the scope of contracts we sign today as we go about our duties?\u201d\n\nKenya\u2019s government says that its Long Term Development Blueprint, Vision 2030 will make the nation a globally competitive and prosperous nation by promoting \u201clocal ICT software development,\u201d and making ICT Software more affordable and accessible\u201d\u2026 gatekeeping can have serious adverse effects on its nascent tech ecosystem.\n\nMembers of the group also organised a petition which garnered over 14,000 votes at the time and succeeded in getting the bill withdrawn twice. But the almost comical and steady 2-year-gap-march of the bill appears to have won out\u2014at least in parliament.\n\nStakeholders now fear a presidential assent on the bill could seal what has been described as rent-seeking behaviour.\n\n\u201cThe reason why I think the bill is detrimental is that innovation is about thinking outside the box,\u201d Sheena Raikundalia, Director of UK-Kenya Tech Hub told TechCabal, \u201cit\u2019s not about your degree or paper certificates. Some of the best techies I know are self-taught! Tech moves so fast, [that] by the time you finish your degree what you learnt is outdated. This is taking a step back.\u201d\n\nAffectionately described as Africa\u2019s Silicon Savannah, Kenya is one of the Big Four technology heavyweights in Africa. As recently as last month, Microsoft and Google set up new offices in Nairobi, global card payment association, Visa announced that it had opened an innovation hub\u2014one of only 6 in the world, and Amazon announced plans to open an Amazon Web Services (AWS) local zone in the country. These are all a significant testament to the East African nation\u2019s tech reputation which also ranks 4th on the list of African countries with the most professional developers only behind Nigeria, South Africa and Egypt.\n\nKenya\u2019s government says that its Long Term Development Blueprint, Vision 2030 will make the nation a globally competitive and prosperous nation by promoting \u201clocal ICT software development,\u201d and making ICT Software more affordable and accessible\u201d. But in a heating tech talent market, poorly thought out regulation that looks, to all intents, like pure gatekeeping can have serious adverse effects on its nascent tech ecosystem. Right now Kenya is distracted by its upcoming national elections, and reports of social media-fueled hate speech and misinformation are increasing. Those are important areas for regulation; deciding who is qualified to build a mobile app is not.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How Tijan Watt is building a pan-African VC from Dakar",
          "text": "On a windy Thursday evening, in April, a delegation of investors, startup founders, and journalists gathered at the Port of Dakar waiting for the Chaloupe de Gor\u00e9e, a formidable ferry that could hold as many as 340 people, to transport them to the historic Gor\u00e9e Island, where Wuri Ventures, a Dakar-based pan-African early-stage venture capital firm, was hosting its launch party.\n\nAway from the high-end restaurants and 5-star hotels\u2019 seaside bars in Dakar\u2019s city centre where most other events of this nature took place, 45-year-old Tijan Watt, co-founder and general partner at Wuri Venture, had spefically chosen this Gor\u00e9e Island, which used to be the \u201cpoint of no return\u201d during the Transatlantic Slave Trade, to introduce his firm to the world.\n\nWatt towered over almost everybody else on the chaloupe in a white, Guinea-fabric shirt and black jeans. Even though his beard had nearly gone a solid grey, he was still full of energy, and his eyes were as ambitious as they probably were 21 years ago when he first moved back to Senegal.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nWuri Venture is not a new establishment; it\u2019s more than 3 years old. It was first conceptualised through an early advisory business called African Tech Leaders that Watt had founded to advise startups in the process of fundraising and seeking entry into global accelerators like Y Combinator. But Watt told TechCabal that in 2018, he realised advisory alone wasn\u2019t enough to scale the ecosystem, and the idea to start investing in early-stage startups was born. He joined forces with Jerome Cretegny, a seasoned investment professional leading the Senegalese operation of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) at the time. The two combined their personal funds and used that to back promising African founders. In 2019, they incorporated Wuri Ventures, and within a year, the duo made 6 investments.\n\nWatt said that to realise their pan-African ambition, they needed more funds. So they sold 7.5% equity from their general partner equity, bringing 15 top tech and finance operators into the venture. They also partnered with Capria Ventures, which provided Wuri with the credit line it needed to invest, and eventually led to a $1.5 million investment in South Africa\u2019s Whereismytransport $14.5 million series A extension round before the partnership was discontinued. After that, the firm launched a subscription model so that they could pool funds from local and international individual investors\u2014angels, endowment funds, family offices, etc.\u2014using the Angellist Venture platform (It\u2019s the same platform Nigeria\u2019s Future Africa and Kenya\u2019s Mutua Venture use to power their subscription angel investing models.)\n\nA delegation of investors, startup founders, tech operators and journalists admiring and taking pictures of the historical Gor\u00e9e island as the chaloupe approaches the island.\n\nHowever in January this year, Carry1st, a mobile game publishing company Wuri Venture invested in at a very early stage and at a $4 million valuation, closed a $20 million series A extension round from a16z and Google at a valuation of $100 million. This single deal returned double of all the 6 deals they had made over the years. So Wuri exited so that it could be liquid enough to fund other deals.\n\n\u201cWe made some good returns and exited so that we can continue supporting other early stage startups,\u201d Watt told TechCabal.\n\nEven prior to the official launch in April, Wuri Ventures has advised more than 20 startups and invested $2 million across 14 deals including Carry1st, Whereismytransport, Lori Systems, Kotani Pay, Tambua Health, Norebase, Nestocoin and Caytu Robotics amongst others. The firm continues to invest alongside global investment leaders such as a16z, Google, Toyota Tshusho, Avenir Growth and others. Now, Watt believes that its subscription model is going to help ramp up their investment figure from $2 million to $4 million within a year.\n\nWuri Venture also provides incubating programs for founders to learn the ropes of the startup world. Caytu Robotics, one of such startups that incubated with Wuri, recently displayed one of its robots, an Autonomous Delivery Robot, at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) where it was remotely controlled from Dakar\u20146,000 km away from Boston where MIT is located.\n\nFrom Wall Street to selling sugar in Dakar\n\nWatt was born to a Senegalese father and an African American mother. He grew up in Washington, DC where he attended Sidwell Friends School, a prestigious institution that counts Chelsea Clinton and Sasha and Malia Obama among its esteemed alumni. Watt went on to study mathematics and computer science at Howard University, a historically black college.\n\nAfter a brief foray into science, running lab tests on both humans and animals, Watt spent 3 years as an investment banker at Goldman Sachs in New York and London, and in 2001 he decided to move to Senegal.\n\nEven though the dotcom boom had shown signs of bursting in 2000, it didn\u2019t, and the cool kids of Wall Street were still dumping their six-figure salaries to embrace the promise of the digital revolution. Even though Watt saw his colleagues moving to companies like Priceline, he devised a plan instead to move to Africa and become a dotcom pioneer there. How difficult could that be?\n\nTijan Watt, co-founder and general partner at Wuri Ventures, stands on a makeshift podium to address the guests at the launch event.\n\nIn reality, Watt had only visited Senegal once when he was 18 and knew close to nothing about the landscape. He started to abandon one startup idea after the other: he first wanted to become an internet service provider (ISP) but the \u201cexisting player had a massive capital warchest to kill him on arrival,\u201d he giggled as he narrated this part. After spending a year playing with ideas, he started his own flavoured sugar company in 2002. The company was called Crystal, a name he claimed was inspired by a Notorious BIG song\u2014and that\u2019s how he waltzed off the track of his dotcom ambition.\n\nLike his earlier ISP idea, the Senegalese sugar industry was dominated by The Mimran Group, a French, family-owned company. The Mimran Group owns the Compagnie Sucri\u00e8re S\u00e9n\u00e9galaise (CSS) which cultivates 8,000 hectares of sugarcane in Senegal, and has more than 5,000 employees during harvest time\u2014the largest employer in Senegal after the country\u2019s government. To understand how much money this family made from sugar consumption in Senegal as far back as the 1980s, in 1981, they paid $3 million to acquire Lamborghini and saved the Italian fast car company from bankruptcy. Then they sold it to Chrysler Corporation in 1987 after expanding its model line of product from 1 to 3 in the space of 6 years.\n\n\u201cMy thought then was: since everyone in the country consumes sugar, it\u2019s essentially like a tax on the population,\u201d said Watt. \u201cAnd then that should not be held in the hands of a single person or that single family.\u201d So at 26, the ambitious Watt took on the Mimran empire.\n\nWatt would build the business into a household name employing nearly 100 people and achieving revenues of $15 million. In the grand scheme of things, that didn\u2019t harm the Mimran\u2019s dominance, but Watt believes that it created a new narrative. \u201cThere is a lot of value in Africa and it\u2019s a pity that it\u2019s the foreigners who are capturing most of it. To some extent, we changed that\u201d\n\nAfter 3 years running the company as CEO, building processes and structure, Watt left to pursue an MBA at Harvard. After that, he worked as an investment officer at Nigeria\u2019s Travant Capital in Lagos, where he stayed for 2 years before returning to Senegal to run Crystal in 2009. Seven years after, Watt finally exited Crystal and moved to Ethiopia to work as the chief revenue officer of mFino, a fintech company providing banks and telcos with mobile banking solutions in major markets in Africa including Ethiopia, Nigeria and Senegal.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "title": "Factors driving upsurge in youth voter registration",
          "text": "As the surging crowd of Nigerians are struggling to beat the June 30 deadline for the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), BusinessDay has learnt that there are many factors responsible for the development.\n\nIt was also gathered that close to 11 million new registrants have been registered in the last few months since INEC announced the deadline.\n\nSome private sector players in a meeting on Monday were in agreement that some of the reasons for the new wave of interest in registration for Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs) may include a referendum on the current administration, the entrance of Peter Obi into the race, the decision by Nigerians to have a break with the two major political parties, and the quest by young Nigerians to be more involved in the nation\u2019s political process.\n\n\u201cThey are not registering for the status quo; they are registering against the status quo. It is definitely a damaging verdict on the ruling party. There is no indication that the increase in the new registration will be or is in favour of the ruling party. It is some kind of referendum against the government of the day. There must be something happening,\u201d they said.\n\nAccording to them, there are some party members that are not happy with the turn of events in the ruling All Progressives Congress and perhaps, they decided to get or update their PVCs to seek an alternative.\n\nThe private sector players, who dismissed the army of social media campaigners, said the majority of them would not even vote on the election day.\n\nThey, however, acknowledged that there seemed to be some level of political awareness going on never seen before in the nation\u2019s history.\n\nA political analyst believes it is happening because of the \u201cPeter Obi momentum\u201d and mantra of \u201ctaking the country\u201d back for the people.\n\n\u201cWith many young people disillusioned and the prospect of fleeing their country seen as their only path to a secure future, many have adopted Obi\u2019s presidential bid as their last hope to rescue their country from its inexorable march towards a failed state,\u201d the analyst, who spoke with BusinessDay on condition of anonymity, said.\n\n\u201cThis grim prospect, feared over the next eight years in the hands of the ruling APC and the opposition PDP, is galvanising young people better than any financial inducement. Many say those who emerge victorious in the presidential primaries of the major political parties have given them little cause for cheer. It is now helping to spur the biggest political movement since the June 12, 1993 elections,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, the #EndSARS protest may have been crushed by the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government, but the lessons from that movement are being transferred into the new movement to elect, for the first time in a long time, a candidate who left office without the taint of corruption and crass opulence that characterise Nigeria\u2019s rapacious political class.\n\nObi seems to believe that the awakening in relation to CVR was set off by him.\n\nWhile responding to issue of lack of structure to win a national election, he said: \u201cWhenever I hear of no structure, my answer to it is simple, the 100 million Nigerians that live under poverty will be the structure, the millions of Nigerian youths who don\u2019t know where the next meal will come from will be the structure, our mothers and fathers, the old ones that are dying and being owed their gratuities and pensions will be the structure, the lecturers that are being owed, the students who are not in school will be the structure. Structure is about human beings.\u201d\n\nSome important personalities across the country and groups, including the young people, are urging and mobilising Nigerians to register for their PVCs.\n\nSome groups go as far as providing free transportation as part of the mobilisation efforts.\n\nOthers are offering their buildings, including residences, religious houses and business premises to INEC for use as registration centres.\n\nMany Nigerian youths last Saturday defied rain as they trooped out for the Youth Vote Count Mega Concert 2.0 at the Tafawa Balewa Square, Lagos.\n\nSpeaking at the event, Mahmood Yakubu, chairman of INEC, said, \u201cIn the last one week, we have registered over 5,000 people. When I saw the crowd that trooped here to register, we had to change our strategy. We decided that instead of everyone coming here (TBS) to register, we would register prospective voters in 20 centres spread across 20 local government areas in Lagos. Also, more machines will be deployed all over Lagos from next week.\u201d\n\nOlusegun Obasanjo, a former president, had on Sunday told Nigerian youths that their tomorrow would never come if they continued to leave the affairs of the country in the hands of those ruining it.\n\nRead also: Voters meet challenges in move to beat PVC deadline\n\nObasanjo, who spoke at \u2018OBJ @85 Free Keke Programme\u2019 held at the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library, Abeokuta, challenged the younger generation to take their rightful place in the affairs of the country as leaders of tomorrow.\n\n\u201cIf the youths leave things to those who are messing it up, and who are saying they (youths) are the leaders of tomorrow, they will never have that tomorrow,\u201d he said.\n\nEnough Is Enough, a non-governmental organisation campaigning for good governance, has urged Nigerians to \u201cshine their eyes\u201d this time around.\n\nIt said: \u201cIn Nigeria, the elections are here; plans and midnight alliances are to grab power, deepen individual pockets, in some cases with foreign coins. The outcome, who knows?\n\n\u201cWill Nigeria and Nigerians be the Caesar?\n\nWith only one important tool, Nigerians have their PVCs. How do you, a Nigerian, plan on using your PVC?\u201d\n\nLast Thursday, the electoral body issued a release, saying it would provide an additional 270 registration machines as reports of large turnouts in the South-East, Lagos, Rivers and other northern states overwhelmed their staff.\n\nNow, there are calls to extend the deadline for registration as the electoral body clearly lacks the capacity to register willing voters within the timeframe. Meanwhile INEC thinks the surge has something to do with confidence in its ability.\n\n\u201cThe sudden surge is an affirmation of the increasing confidence Nigerians have in our electoral process,\u201d said Festus Okoye, chairman, information and voter education committee of INEC.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s fish and wheat imports from Russia plunged by 83 percent year-on-year in the first quarter of 2022 amid the ongoing war in Ukraine, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) show.\n\nSince Russia invaded Ukraine in February, prices of wheat, maize, fertilisers, and other commodities have climbed to unprecedented heights as the crisis has disrupted global food supplies, forcing countries to seek other trade partners.\n\nThe latest foreign trade report released by the NBS shows that Nigeria\u2019s fish imports (blue whiting and herrings) from Russia decreased by 83 percent to N8.99 billion in the first quarter of this year from N53 billion in the same period of 2021.\n\nOn a quarter-on-quarter basis, the country\u2019s fish imports from Russia dropped by 17 percent to N8.99 billion from N10.82 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nThe top sources of fish into Nigeria for the period included the Netherlands (N10.9 billion), Russia (N8.99 billion), Norway (N1.48 billion) and Poland (N1.37 billion).\n\nRead also: Productivity constraints to drive acquisitions in Nigerian manufacturing \u2013 Experts\n\n\u201cIt is expected that the country\u2019s imports from Russia will decline. The war is making it very difficult to get commodities out of the Black Sea region,\u201d said Abiodun Olorundenro, operations manager at Aquashoot.\n\n\u201cThe situation has forced Nigeria and others to look for other countries that can supply them,\u201d he added.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most populous country also buys some of its wheat from Russia and other Black Sea countries to mix with quality wheat from the United States and Canada.\n\nIn the last five months, wheat-based products such as the popular pre-packed wheat flour and bread (sliced and unsliced) have witnessed a steady price increase across the country.\n\nIn April 2022, a 500g sliced bread was sold for N450, representing a 35 percent increase on a year-on-year basis. The 500g unsliced bread rose by 25 percent from N306.74 in April 2021 to N383.51 in April 2022, NBS data show.\n\nWheat flour pre-packaged Golden Penny 2kg was sold for N1,047 in April 2022, up 35.9 percent from N770.58 in the same month last year.\n\n\u201cPrices of bread and other wheat derivatives have been surging, and this means more pain for poor Nigerians who are currently struggling to feed,\u201d said AfricanFramer Mogaji, chief executive of X-Ray Consulting.\n\nThe Black Sea region, which includes Russia and Ukraine, plays a major role in the global food system.\n\nForty percent of wheat and corn exports from Russia and Ukraine goes to the Middle East and Africa. According to the United States Department of Commerce, Ukraine\u2019s agricultural strength is partly linked to its fertile black soil, with 25 percent of the world\u2019s reserves on its land.\n\nThis fertile land is behind Ukraine\u2019s grain strength, helping it to become one of the world\u2019s largest exporters of wheat and maize, as well as the world\u2019s largest exporter of sunflower oil, which is the fourth most-consumed vegetable oil in the world.\n\nThe main destinations of Ukrainian wheat in 2019 were Egypt ($3.65 billion worth of wheat), Indonesia ($664.5 million), Bangladesh ($418.6 million), Turkey ($207.4 million), and Tunisia ($195.5 million), according to data from the UN\u2019s Comtrade. In 2020, Lebanon imported $148.49 million worth of wheat from Russia ($22.9 million) and Ukraine ($119.1 million).",

          "text": "Amid a tough operating environment, airline operators are finding it increasingly difficult to employ young pilots and engineers, forcing them to seek employment outside the country.\n\nBusinessDay\u2019s investigations show that many pilots and engineers now work for airlines and helicopter companies in the Middle East and Canada.\n\nThe high cost of aviation fuel, naira depreciation and the high taxes and surcharges have continued to eat deep into the revenues of airlines, making it difficult for them to employ young pilots who are supposed to get trained by the operators before they are absorbed into the airlines.\n\nAccording to data by the National Association of Aircraft Pilots and Engineers (NAAPE), over 60 percent young pilots are currently unemployed as many others are preparing to graduate from pilot training schools to join the already congested labour market.\n\nAbednego Galadima, president of NAAPE, told BusinessDay that the situation of the young unemployed pilots is a reflection of the larger society, and it is also because of the rising cost of fuel prices and rising naira-dollar exchange rate, which have pushed maintenance costs higher.\n\nGaladima said: \u201cAs part of the survival instinct, these young pilots and engineers are now going outside the country to get jobs. Our pilots and engineers are mostly employed in the Middle East now. Middle East airlines and helicopter companies employ these pilots more. Some of our engineers have also gone to Canada in search of jobs and they are getting the jobs.\n\n\u201cThere are state governments that also train these pilots. Niger Delta trains the pilots and most of them are trained abroad.\u201d\n\nRead also: Ethiopian Airlines to commence flights to Chennai, India\n\nHe recalled that the cost of aviation fuel almost made the airlines go on strike recently, saying many airlines are struggling to survive.\n\n\u201cThe situation is biting; so if they are unable to employ pilots at this time, it is quite understandable. But in aviation, you cannot compromise training but in this case, those that have the jobs have to get trained to maintain currency so that safety is not compromised,\u201d he added.\n\nDuring a recent visit to Air Peace, BusinessDay observed that the gate of the company was crowded with job applicants seeking to get employed as pilots, engineers and crew members.\n\n\u201cThere was a time when job applicants crowded our office every Thursday in search of jobs. These people loiter around the premises waiting for the chairman to come and most times, he is moved with compassion to help them. He will often get the HR manager to collect their CVs and invite them for interviews and some of them will get employed after the interviews,\u201d Stanley Olisa, spokesperson for Air Peace, said.\n\nOlisa, however, hinted that Air Peace cannot employ all the pilots but does its best to accommodate as many as the airline can take.\n\nIbrahim Mshelia, owner of West Link Airlines Nigeria and Mish Aviation Flying School, said the fuel price hike is a global problem and the effects should not be magnified as if it is the cause of all the challenges facing airlines.\n\nMshelia said: \u201cWe are not operating aviation the way it should be in Nigeria. The manpower that is required for aviation is purely technical but we have people who have no clue about what aviation is all about. There are close to 40,000 employees working for aviation agencies now. The agencies must generate money; so they have to create surcharges.\n\n\u201cThere are too many surcharges to raise money for the industry; so the airlines pay a lot. The service providers have surcharges they pay to the government. Aviation is supposed to be delivered with deliberate policies to cushion the effects of operating costs. When the industry is thriving, the value chain will be great and that is when employment can be generated.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, airlines are refusing to employ and train pilots because they don\u2019t have money.\n\nHe said the surcharges are eating into the airlines\u2019 income and making it difficult for them to train.\n\nHe said a vacuum is being created because airlines are no longer employing and training young pilots.\n\nMshelia said: \u201cThe way to create jobs for pilots is to look at the policies. Create a robust general aviation where someone who has one single plane can get a permit to do passenger operations. More companies will come up, if we separate the processes of the Air Operating Certificates (AOC).\n\n\u201cFor instance, if you are doing a scheduled operation or non-schedule operation, you can get different classes of AOCs. This is to enable people to create small aviation units and people can grow there. So that as people are retiring from aviation, we are replacing them and they are being absorbed.",
          "summary": "Amid a tough operating environment, airline operators are finding it increasingly difficult to employ young pilots and engineers, forcing them to seek employment outside the country.\nBusinessDay\u2019s investigations show that many pilots and engineers now work for airlines and helicopter companies in the Middle East and Canada.\nGaladima said: \u201cAs part of the survival instinct, these young pilots and engineers are now going outside the country to get jobs.\nSome of our engineers have also gone to Canada in search of jobs and they are getting the jobs.\n\u201cThe situation is biting; so if they are unable to employ pilots at this time, it is quite understandable.",

          "text": "A federal high court in Abuja, on Tuesday, convicted and sentenced two co-defendants of Abba Kyari, in a suit filed by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) against suspended deputy commissioner of police over an alleged drug deal to two years imprisonment.\n\nJustice Emeka Nwite, in a judgment, said having admitted to committing the offence preferred against them in counts 5, 6 and 7 by the NDLEA, Chibunna Umeibe and Emeka Ezenwanne, who are 6th and 7th defendants, \u201care hereby convicted accordingly.\u201d\n\nThe Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, on Tuesday, sentenced two drug traffickers, Chibunna Patrick Umeibe and Emeka Alphonsus Ezenwane, who were linked to the suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police, DCP, Abba Kyari, to six years imprisonment.\n\nThe duo, who were arrested at the Akanu Ibiam International Airport in Enugu while attempting to smuggle cocaine into the country, were on March 7 arraigned before the court alongside DCP Kyari and four other police officers- ACP Sunday J. Ubia, Insp. Simon Agirigba, Insp. John Nuhu, and ASP Bawa James.\n\nBoth Umeibe and Ezenwanne had upon their arraignment, pleaded guilty to the drug trafficking charge against them.\n\nThough Justice Nwite initially adjourned to review facts of the case against them, however, at the resumed proceedings on Tuesday, the NDLEA, through the Director of its Legal Department, Mr. Sunday Joseph, informed the court that it has entered into a plea bargain agreement with the two defendants.\n\nMr. Joseph, therefore, persuaded the court to adopt the terms of the plea bargain deal as its judgement against the defendants.\n\nConsequently, Justice Nwite, in his judgement, convicted and sentenced the two defendants to two years jail term on each of the three-count charge against them.\n\nHowever, the court, which noted that the two defendants were remorseful, held that the sentence would run concurrently, commencing from the date they were arrested.\n\nMore so, the court, held that the defendants should forfeit their international passports in accordance with section 30 of the NDLEA Act, Cap M30, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria.\n\nIn line with the plea bargain agreement, the court, okayed Umeibe and Ezenwanne to testify as witnesses in the trial of DCP Kyari and the other accused police officers, even as it ordered the NDLEA to ensure their safety in any Correctional Facility of their choice.\n\nIt directed the NDLEA to constantly monitor the two defendants to ensure that they do not engage in any drug related criminal activity while serving their jail term.\n\nJustice Nwite subsequently fixed July 18, 19 and 20 for full blown trial of DCP Kyari and his men, as well as for hearing of their fresh application for bail.\n\nThe NDLEA had in the charge marked FHC/ABJ/57/2022, alleged that Kyari, who hitherto headed the Police Intelligence Response Team, IRT, and his men, unlawfully tampered with 21.25kilograms worth of cocaine that they seized from the two apprehended drug traffickers, even as it also accused them of dealing in cocaine worth 17.55kg.\n\nIt alleged that the police officers committed the offence between January 19 and 25, 2022, at the office of Inspector-General of Police (IGP) IRT, Abuja, in connivance with one ASP John Umoru (now at large), contrary to section 14(b) of the NDLEA Act, CAP N30 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004.\n\nBesides, Kyari, was said to have attempted to bribe a senior officer of the NDLEA with $61, 400. 00 at a restaurant in Abuja to prevent the testing of part of the cocaine that was seized from the two arrested drug pushers.\n\nOn the other hand, the agency, alleged that Umeibe and Ezenwanne, conspired with one IK that is currently at large, to import 21.35kg of cocaine into the country without lawful authority and knowingly possessed same, and thereby committed an offence contrary to and punishable under section 11(d) of the NDLEA Act, CAP N30 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004",

The exhibition began on Friday June 10 and ended on Sunday, June 12.\n\nAdire textile, one of the indigenous textiles with origins in Southwestern Nigeria, is an indigo-dyed cloth made by using different wax resist methods to create dazzling designs. Adire, comes in a variety of texture such as silk, chiffon, cotton, and polyester and are made fashionable in both English and traditional styles.\n\nHe said, \u201cI am really impressed with what I\u2019ve seen here today. I have seen real tourism potential that needs to be explored by others. If as a country we look inward, we would discover that our tourism advantages are enormous and desire immediate attention. We can create exportable merchandise if we join hands to boost our potential, we would not be looking up to foreign currency to boost our economy\u201d.\n\nHe further affirmed that \u201cas one of the pioneer promoters of Adire, I am positive that it can boost the county\u2019s tourism industry, because it has what it takes to meet international textile standards.

          "text": "Presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Mr Peter Obi has said the federal government can reduce crime and criminality in the country by pulling the citizens out of poverty.\n\nThis is as he said it was ironical that Nigeria which is the largest economy in Africa, produces mere 4,000 megawatts of electricity, when countries like Egypt and South Africa produce 54,000 megawatts respectively.\n\nObi spoke yesterday in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital, at The Forum, organised by a religious organisation, the Trinity House Church, in commemoration of the 2022 Democracy Day celebration.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe said, \u201cIf we get it right and start borrowing for investment; that is where we will start. When we start pulling people out of poverty, this criminality which the keynote speaker was hampering will start reducing.\n\n\u201cThat is what they do in South America and that is what they do in Asia. The more people you pull out of poverty, the more you reduce criminalities.\u201d\n\nThe LP presidential hopeful stated that there was the need to support the micro and medium scale businesses to grow through improved power supply.\n\nObi said, \u201cWe need to focus on our micro small businesses, to be able to support them because supporting them is not difficult.

The news is false, because he was never abducted rather, he was arrested by police operatives from Police Area Command Owerri, lmo State. The facts was that, sometime in the month of March, 2022, a lady reported a case of fraud against Prof Jachimike Adiele at the Police Area Command Owerri, alleging that, the said professor collected the sum of one million two hundred thousand (1.2 ) naira from her with a promise to give her a shop in Douglas market. But, after some months, she discovered that there was no shop and demanded for her money but could not get it hence, her report .\n\n\u201cOn the strength of the complaint, Prof Jachimike Adiele was invited. After his statement, the Area Commander released him on bail due to his status in the society. And he promised to refund the money back to the lady on 1/4/2022, but never did; rather, he jumped bail. When all efforts made to reach him proved abortive, the surety was invited and he claimed not to know the whereabouts of the suspect and pleaded for time to trace him.\n\n\u201cLuck ran against him today 11/6/2022 at about 0940 hours, when the surety got information that he was in the studio presenting a programme and alerted the police. On arrival, the police were professional, they never went to the station; rather, they waited until he concluded his programme presentation and was heading home when he was arrested. He has since been released and on conclusion of investigation, he will be charged to court. \u201c",

We thank God today June 12 is now being recognised as democracy day. It is also good that our leader is now the candidate of the APC in the 2023 elections.\u201d\n\nThe TSO DG who went down the memory lane in recounting the efforts of the APC scribe, said the former Lagos governor sacrificed almost everything he had during the struggle that he had to go into exile when it became very glaring that the then military ruler was after his life. \u201cDuring the military era, Tinubu had to leave the country. He had done so much for the entrenchment of democracy. We thank god for him because his struggle did not go in vain. Tinubu has done a lot for the entrenchment of democracy and MKO Abiola in particular.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on Tinubu\u2019s Democracy day speech, Alhaji Suleiman said: \u201cTinubu has done a lot for Abiola and June 12 in general. MKO Abiola felt cheated and this informed his decision to declare himself winner of the election. Tinubu stood by him and we thank God today he\u2019s now the APC flagbearer.\u201d\n\nOn the APC flagbearer\u2019s effort to bring all parties along, Alhaji Suleiman said: \u201cTinubu has shown that he\u2019s a team player. He carries everybody along and he has demonstrated that with his visits to all co-aspirants. He has shown that he wants to carry everybody along. He consulted almost everybody. He has met with Osinbajo, Ahmed Lawan and many others. He has shown maturity and he believes in one Nigeria. There\u2019s no one you can compare with. He\u2019s doing everything to ensure the party comes together. He\u2019s indeed a party leader\u201d\n\nWhile reacting to question on the choice of Asiwaju Tinubu\u2019s running mate, the TSG scribe cautioned Nigerians, especially APC members not to overheat the polity over the Christian-Muslim or Muslim-Muslim ticket. \u201cAsiwaju Tinubu will soon come out about his choice of running mate. We don\u2019t want to people to rush or begin to guess. Asiwaju Tinubu is someone who\u2019s knowledgeable enough to bring the best. We appeal to people to be calm. We don\u2019t need people to be apprehensive about who becomes his running mate and play politics based on religion,\u201d the TSO DG said.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari had in 2018 directed that effective 2019 every June 12 be celebrated as Democracy day. This was hitherto marked and celebrated every 29th of May.\n\nLate MKO Abiola indisputably won the June 12 1993 Presidential election but was it annulled by the then military head of state, Ibrahim Babangida.",

          "text": "Judges in London have thrown out last-ditch bids by human rights groups and campaigners to stop Britain sending its first flight of asylum seekers to Rwanda on Tuesday, a plan the United Nations\u2019 refugee chief described as \u201ccatastrophic\u201d.\n\nAs part of an initial 120-million-pound ($148 million) deal with Rwanda, Britain will send some migrants who arrived illegally by crossing the Channel in small boats from Europe.\n\nBritain\u2019s Conservative government says the deportation strategy will undermine people-smuggling networks and stem the flow of migrants risking their lives in Channel crossings.\n\nAmid legal challenges, the number of people scheduled to leave on Tuesday\u2019s plane, which charities said originally included people fleeing Afghanistan and Syria as well as Iran and Iraq, had now fallen to less than a dozen.\n\nA High Court judge refused on Friday to grant a temporary injunction to block the flight, and on Monday three justices on the Court of Appeal upheld that decision.\n\nJudge Rabinder Singh said they could not interfere with the original \u201cclear and detailed\u201d judgement, and refused permission for further appeal. A full hearing to determine the legality of the policy as a whole is due in July.\n\nA second legal challenge at the High Court was also later rejected, with judge Jonathan Swift saying everyone on the flight had been given access to a lawyer to challenge their deportation.\n\nHuman rights group say the policy is inhumane and will put migrants at risk. The UNHCR has said Rwanda, whose own human rights record is under scrutiny, does not have the capacity to process the claims, and there is a risk some migrants could be returned to countries from which they had fled.\n\n\u201cWe believe that this is all wrong\u2026for so many different reasons,\u201d U.N. High Commissioner For Refugees Filippo Grandi told reporters. \u201cThe precedent that this creates is catastrophic for a concept that needs to be shared like asylum.\u201d\n\nInitially, some 37 individuals were scheduled to be removed on the first flight, but the charity Care4Calais said that number has dwindled to just eight. Three more individuals will have their cases heard at the High Court on Tuesday morning.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson had earlier said the government was determined to press ahead with the policy despite the legal challenges and opposition, reportedly including from Prince Charles, the heir to the British throne.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important that the criminal gangs who are putting people\u2019s lives at risk in the Channel understand that their business model is going to be broken and is being broken by this government,\u201d Johnson told LBC radio.\n\n\u201cThey are selling people false hope and luring them into something that is extremely risky and criminal.\u201d\n\nThe government said the deportation plan would deter the Channel crossings, although more than 3,500 people have reached Britain in small boats since the middle of April when the Rwanda scheme was unveiled, according to government figures.\n\nAs the court hearings were taking place, about 35 migrants arrived in Dover, some carrying their possessions in black bags, where they were taken away by British border forces.\n\nReuters",

A package was delivered, by drone, in 13 minutes.\n\nSince then it has trialled drone delivery partnerships with the US retailer Walmart and the courier firms FedEx and UPS.\n\nExplaining how Prime Air deliveries would work, Amazon said: \u201cOnce onboarded, customers in Lockeford will see Prime Air-eligible items on Amazon. They will place an order as they normally would and receive an estimated arrival time with a status tracker for their order.\n\n\u201cFor these deliveries, the drone will fly to the designated delivery location, descend to the customer\u2019s backyard, and hover at a safe height.

          "text": "The Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission (ICRC) Monday hinted that the country would start local production of uniforms for its military and paramilitary personnel from January 2023.\n\nThe move was expected to create over 920 employment opportunities for Nigerians.\n\nThe initiative is a joint venture Public-Private Partnership (PPP) between the Defence Industries Corporation of Nigeria (DICON) and Sur Corporate Wear to create the Sur Corporate Wear Nig. Limited.\n\nThe DICON Sur collaboration which would span a concession period of 20 years, would be responsible for producing uniforms for the army, navy, air force, police, civil defense and other military and paramilitary organisations.\n\nIn a meeting at the instance of the ICRC, the commission\u2019s acting Director-General, Mr. Michael Ohiani had charged all stakeholders in the project to resolve all issues that were hindering the completion of the factory and report back to the commission in one week.\n\nHowever, at the rescheduled meeting chaired by the Director of the Contract Compliance Department (CCD) in the ICRC, Dr. Jobson Ewalefoh, stakeholders were further urged to ensure that the project is completed within the stipulated time frame.\n\nEwalefoh said that the project remained important to the country as it will curb capital flight, create over 920 jobs and will also be a thing of pride for the nation to produce its own uniforms.\n\nHe added that the DICON Sur joint venture was also expected to begin to source all its raw materials from within Nigeria in the course of operation.\n\nThe ICRC director explained: \u201cThe fact that we produce our military and paramilitary uniforms locally is a pride to all of us. It is a pride that we all must uphold.

          "text": "The presidential candidate of Labour Party (LP), Mr. Peter Obi, on Monday declared that over 100 million Nigerians were living in poverty, saying the situation was responsible for the rising insecurity in the country.\n\nAccording to the LP presidential candidate, the inability of the current government to handle challenges facing Nigeria has painted the country as a failed state.\n\nObi spoke during a one-day International Colloquium forum with the theme: \u201cWhat do Nigerians Want?\u201d held virtual that was organised by Christ Church, in Port Harcourt.\n\nAccording to the former Governor of Anambra State, \u201cOver the years what we see as a country is training people into poverty. The consequence is that we have 100 million people today living in poverty. There is no way you will have 100 million people living in poverty and you will not have crisis.\n\n\u201cWe have more people living in poverty than China and Egypt combined, a population of about 2.5 billion. There is no where you won\u2019t have these crises we are going through. The number of people that supposed to be working in Nigeria is 120 million, but today only 40 million are gainfully employed in Nigeria. We have 80 million people who are supposed to be working not working.\n\n\u201cThe consequence is that we have a state but it is unproductive. Nigeria as a country is unproductive because when we talk about 80 million people that are not working, about 70 per cent are youths in their productive age doing nothing with so much tendencies.\n\n\u201cSo, the country is not doing anything, all the country is doing today is sharing. Everybody is looking for what to share, even when what we are sharing is finished which is why we have the large crisis till date\u201d.\n\nSpeaking on security, Obi expressed sadness that the government was no longer in control of the nation\u2019s territory, adding that the nation was being led by gangsters whose target is to loot the country\u2019s treasury for personal gain.\n\n\u201cWe are no longer in control of our economy. We have to deal with the issue of security. Why do we have a security problem? Is very shameful. Is curating the effect of leadership failure over the years?\n\n\u201cI have to stop the bleeding. You are going to borrow money but there had to be a law that all borrowed money will be for investment. We had to move from sharing formula to production formula.\n\n\u201cIf we get it right and start borrowing for investment, that is where we start. When we start pulling people out of poverty. The more they pull people out of poverty, the more they reduce criminality.\n\n\u201cWe need to start doing proper investment in security. Nigeria is lacking leadership. We have one situation where our system has been criminalised by gangsters who call themselves leaders and that is why we see desperation by people who want to run the government. It is remaining for us to carry gun and shoot people because we want to serve them\u201d, Obi added.\n\nEarlier, Dr. Victoria Ekhomu, spoke on the State of Insecurity in Nigeria, while Prof Oyelowo Oyewo and Ifiesimama Sekibo respectively spoke on \u201cRestructuring and True Federalism in Nigeria\u201d and \u201cThe Economy Nigeria Needs to Break Forth.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Peter Obi Support Network (POSN) has condemned the alleged intimidation of people of south-east origin at some voter registration centres in Lagos State.\n\nThe group also described as unacceptable, the prevention of voters\u2019 registration exercises in some parts of Imo State.\n\nPOSN stated these while reacting to series of viral videos of unbelievable intimidation of adults, who had peacefully attempted to contribute their civic quota to the democratic process of obtaining their PVCs.\n\nThe group therefore called on security agencies, to collaborate with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to tame the ugly trend.\n\nThe POSN statement was signed by the spokesperson, Sani Saeed Altukry.\n\nThe group further implored INEC to distribute more equipment and personnel to the allocated registration centres in Lagos State particularly and other states of the federation that require same urgent attention to effectively register all adults, who desire to exercise their civic rights in 2023 and beyond.\n\nPart of the statement read: \u201cWe condemn, in the strongest possible terms, the intimidation and violence evidently meted out to the people from the south-east origin resident in Lagos State, who went to exercise their fundamental rights of getting registered as voters to be eligible to perform their simple civic duty of voting during elections in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFew weeks ago, similar incidents were reported about people being chased out of a registration centre in Imo State by those alleged to be armed bandits.\n\n\u201cThese developments in our democratic polity are extremely worrying and should be of great concern to our security agencies.\n\n\u201cWe commend INEC for establishing emergency registration centres in Enugu, Lagos and other locations, which has given eligible youths the opportunity to register while we continue to call for extension of the registration deadline beyond June 30 so as not to disenfranchise millions of eligible Nigerians who are willing to exercise their civic duties.\u201d\n\nSunday Aborisade in Abuja and Blessing Ibunge in Port Harcourt",
