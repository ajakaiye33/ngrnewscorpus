          "text": "\u2026says FG officials have questions to answer\n\nBy Levinus Nwabughiogu\n\nFollowing the leaked report of the Lagos State judicial panel of enquiry that validated the massacre of many youths at Lekki during the ENDSARS protest last year, the minority caucus in the House of Representatives has asked the Minister of Information, Alhaji Lai to resign or be sacked by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nRecall that Mohammed had said that no one was killed describing the development as a \u201cmassacre without bodies\u201d.\n\nBut relying on the report, the caucus said Mohammed lied, stressing that other officials of the government also have many questions to answer.\n\nThe call was made in a statement signed by the minority leader, Hon. Ndudi Elumelu on Thursday.\n\nThe statement read thus: \u201cThe Minority Caucus in the House of Representatives, after a thorough review of the report of the Lagos State EndSARS judicial panel, holds that the attempt by officials of the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led Federal Government to cover up the now confirmed bloody massacre of Nigerians youths by security forces at the Lekki Tollgate suggests a high level state-backed conspiracy against Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe confirmation by the Lagos Panel that there was indeed a massacre at the Lekki Tollgate during the 2020 EndSARS protests in Lagos and that APC government-controlled security forces carted away bodies and mopped up evidence, places a huge burden on i Federal Government which had vehemently denied any killings.\n\n\u201cThe Minority caucus is therefore apprehensive as to what furtive motive must have made the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, who ought to know the truth, to rush to the media, ahead of the judicial panel, to insist that there were no killings at Lekki Tollgate, even in the face of testimonies of witnesses at the sad event.\n\n\u201cWhereas the proclivity of the APC-led administration to lie to Nigerians on issues is legendry and known to all, our caucus is however shocked that the administration can lie in a matter that has to do with the gruesome killing of citizens, particularly our youths and even attempt to provide official cover to the culprits.\n\n\u201cAs representatives of the people, the minority caucus holds that killing of our young one for having the audacity to demand for justice, rule of law and good governance in our nation is the height of wickedness which will continue to haunt the APC and its administration until justice is served.\n\n\u201cThe report of the Lagos panel shows that no matter how lies and falsehood try to prevail, the truth will always triumph at the end. The blood of the innocent slain at Lekki Tollgate cry out for justice and there will be no rest for their killers and those who give support or cover to the murderous act.\n\n\u201cThe Minority caucus therefore calls on the APC-led administration to come clean on the killings as well as the furtive moves to cover up the vicious act. Also, giving the findings of the Lagos panel, the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed is expected to resign immediately or be fired by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cOur caucus commends the Lagos panel for its boldness in the pursuit of truth and justice and urges other panels investigating allegations of brutality in other states not to be deterred but ensure that the truth is not suppressed.\n\n\u201cWhile commiserating with the victims of the Lekki Tollgate attack, particularly the families of those killed, the Minority caucus urges Nigerians to remain calm at this crucial moment, as we will leave no stone unturned in using our legislative instruments to join forces with other well-meaning Nigerians to get justice for our people.\u201d",

          "text": "There\u2019s no institution that cannot atrophy or degenerate, if like a fish, it begins to rot from the head. And that was the story of the Nigerian Army at a point in time, when there was a deliberate policy to emasculate and debilitate it, incidentally by leadership that emerged from its very bowels.\n\nOur army had done exploits in Burma, in Congo, at different peace keeping operations in many parts of the world, but by 1993, it had deteriorated to become \u201can army of anything goes.\u201d Like disorganized Boy Scouts. Pity!\n\nWhy should we believe that unflattering appellation? Because it came from one of its very own, a well respected Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Salihu Ibrahim.\n\nIbrahim had commanded the army from August 1990 to September 1993, and when he was retiring, he lamented that the once revered institution had become \u201can army of anything goes.\u201d\n\nThere was hardly a whimper in protest, because the army itself knew that its Chief spoke the truth. Many years before then, a police spokesman, Alozie Ogbugbuaja, had said all that officers of the army knew how to do was to plan coups, drink beer, \u201cand eat pepper soup.\u201d Great was the umbrage, and that impudent policeman was run out of town.\n\nBut by the time Salihu Ibrahim spoke in 1993, the pepper soup was almost no longer there. Gen Ibrahim Babangida, incidentally a former Chief of Army Staff himself, had rendered the institution prostrate and comatose, so much so that it was almost not able to shoot firecrackers again, not to talk of guns, light or heavy.\n\nWhat Babangida started was consummated by Sani Abacha, and Olusegun Obasanjo, two other Generals of the Nigerian Army. It became truly \u201canything goes,\u201d to the disquietude and sorrow of some officers trained in the finest traditions of the military.\n\nThe situation was not radically better under subsequent Presidents, until that thoroughbred soldier, an officer and gentleman from Daura came. It is said that you can not likely effect change in a system, unless you were sufficiently vexed with the inadequacies of that system. Muhammadu Buhari did not do any other thing after school, other than soldiering. So he knew the Nigerian Army in its days of glory, and he also saw when it had degenerated into \u201can army of anything goes.\u201d\n\nIt is on record today that no Nigerian leader has trained, equipped and motivated the army as much as Muhammadu Buhari has done. The Nigerian Navy and Air Force would have their days, but let us focus on the Nigerian Army today.\n\nWhen the Boko Haram insurgency started in 2009, it was envisaged that the army would make short work of it. Didn\u2019t it do same to the Maitatsine sect, and other disruptive forces before it? But to our consternation, the insurgency survived Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua, Goodluck Jonathan, and has stretched a battle-tested Buhari, almost to the limits of his strength.\n\nRight on Inauguration Day, the new President in 2015 directed that the command centre of the war be moved to the Northeast, which was the epicenter. And he took personal interest in the equipping, training and motivation of the military. The result today is that the Nigerian Army has never been better positioned to discharge its duties. One is not saying everything is perfect, but it is a far cry from the days of \u201canything goes.\u201d Discipline is restored, esprit de corps is revived, and honor reigns again.\n\nAn administration that is out to feather its own nest won\u2019t spend billions of naira to equip its military. But the United States of America bears testimony that it has sold $593 million worth of military equipment to Nigeria under Buhari. The same administration has committed a total $100 million to the Multinational Joint Task Force fighting Boko Haram between 2015 and now. A contract of $152 million was signed with China, and tanks and artillery guns/trucks were recently taken delivery of. I repeat: when a government is out to steal, it does not equip, train or motivate the military. They become \u201can army of anything goes.\u201d\n\nDid you hear Chief of Defence Staff, Gen LEO Irabor, talk of the army a couple of days ago, in response to some reports making the rounds about the EndSARS probe panel report in Lagos? He said: \u201cThe armed forces of Nigeria is a professional armed forces, we are peopled by Nigerians, and remain committed to constitutional mandates. So, we do not at this point think that Nigerians should make disparaging remarks regarding the armed forces of Nigeria, in the sense that we are a professional armed forces, if there are issues, we address them within the ambit of the provisions. It would not be right to disparage men and women who have worked so hard to ensure that the territorial integrity of this nation is kept intact\u2026The armed forces are there to provide the ambience that will enable every Nigerian to live in peace and harmony. Let us not make inciting comments that will put the entire space on fire. That\u2019s not right.\u201d\n\nNow, compare the two. It\u2019s \u201can army of anything goes.\u201d True. Very true, as of that time. Now, today, \u201cThe armed forces of Nigeria is a professional armed forces\u2026and remain committed to constitutional mandates.\u201d True, very true. What makes the difference? Leadership. Under Muhammadu Buhari, the Nigerian Army has got its groove back. It is discharging its duties to the country and the citizens, making the ultimate sacrifice when necessary, so that you and I may live in peace and be safe.\n\nShould anybody then deride such an institution? Not if we value or hold anything dear. To ridicule, disdain or malign our army is to cast our pearls before swine. The pigs would trample them in the mud.\n\nBut for those who know the value of gold, they pray daily, asking God to protect our troops, as they strive to keep the nation intact, so we can go about our lawful duties. Only evildoers need fear the army. Other lawful citizens should appreciate them, and extol their commitment and sacrifices. May God keep and protect our troops. Amen. It is surely no longer \u201can army of anything goes.\u201d\n\n*Adesina is Special Adviser to President Buhari on Media and Publicity",

          "text": "The Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), otherwise known as eNaira, initiated by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), will enhance multi-layered security encryption of the digital currency.\n\nThe initiative and other interventions by the apex bank will also facilitate the journey to economic diversification of the economy.\n\nCBN spokesman, Osita Nwanisobi, who highlighted 37 interventions at a seminar in Lagos, explained that they were designed as responses to socio-economic situations and exigencies.\n\nReporters, who attended the \u201d Master Class\u201d with the theme: Central Bank of Nigeria interventions as fulcrum for economic diversification,\u201d lauded the interventions.\n\nThe event was organised by the Centre for Financial Journalism in Lagos.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nCBN interventions span healthcare, agriculture, creative industry, infrastructure and other aspects of human endeavour.\n\nNwanisobi said the interventions reflect the vision of the CBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, whom he said had pledged to run a people-centric central bank upon assumption of office.\n\nNwanisobi said the interventions were, therefore, a conscious effort by the CBN to ensure that Nigerians especially the ordinary folks benefit from the economy.\n\n\u201cThese interventions do not just happen, they are well-thought out responses by the CBN to exigencies. You would recall that when he assumed office in 2014, Mr. Emefiele promised to run a people-centric CBN and a financial system that would meet the needs of the average Nigerian,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the interventions were practical efforts to diversify the economy, stressing that the CBN under Emefiele has been at the cutting- edge of such initiatives to truly diversify the economy.\n\nIn clear terms, he said the interventions were responses to market failures, stressing that no responsible central bank would fold it hands and watch the nation\u2019s economy collapse.\n\nNwanisobi who traced the evolution of interventions by the CBN from 1979, said the global financial crisis of 2008/2009 threw up multiple interventions by the CBN which also reflected the responses in other countries. He argued that but for the CBN interventions, the economy would not have grown post-global crisis era.\n\n\u201cInterventions are necessary. Without interventions where would the Nigerian economy be by now?\u201d he asked rhetorically.\n\n\u201cWho would have thought that a time would come in Nigeria and the rest of the world that economies would experience total shutdown as we experienced in the case of Covid-19? Just imagine what would have happened if CBN did not respond with well-planned intervention in the containment of Covid-19 and the attendant financial crisis,\u201d the CBN spokesman said.\n\nMr. Olabimtan Adebowale of the Development Finance Department of CBN in his presentation outlined the benefits of the various interventions which he described as \u201cdevelopment finance interventions\u201d, meaning they are well-planned interventions targeted at meeting specific needs all aimed at growing the economy and improving the living standards of the people\u201d.\n\nHe said the interventions were meant to increase lending to high-impact and employment-elastic sectors of the economy, diversify economic base, create jobs and improve macroeconomic stability. Other purposes of the interventions include to encourage exports and conserve foreign exchange reserves, expand output of agriculture, manufacturing and services sectors, provide access to affordable credit, and boost the capacity of MSMEs in priority sectors of the economy.\n\nAccording to Adebowale, one of the interventions aimed at boosting local production and creating employment is the new financial instrument titled \u201cThe 100 for 100 PPP \u2013 Policy on Production and Productivity\u201d, which will be anchored by the Development Finance Department under the direct supervision of the CBN Governor. Under the policy, the CBN will advertise, screen, scrutinize and financially support 100 targeted private sector companies in 100 days.\n\nThe programme commenced on November 1, 2021, and will roll over every 100 days with new set of 100 companies.\n\nOn the eNaira, which was launched on October 25 by President Muhammadu Buhari to complement the physical naira and help deepen the digital economy space, Mr. Yusuf Abduljelil in his presentation, said Nigeria was the first African nation to introduce a central bank digital currency and one of the early birds in the world.\n\nDuring the master class, editors were able to onboard seamlessly to the eNaira platform. On the issue of hacking and vulnerability to compromise by cybercrooks, the CBN official explained that the eNaira platform has enough layers of encryption and integrity that insulate it from hackers.\n\nNigeria is currently among the top nations of the world with growing and robust e-payment systems. The eNaira will further boost the nation\u2019s rating in e-transactions.",

          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh\n\nThe Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kyari, yesterday said getting appropriate financing for major projects remains key challenge in the global transition to renewable sources of energy.\n\nKyari, who spoke on the sidelines of the Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition Conference (ADIPEC) in the United Arab Emirates, insisted that no nation should be stampeded into abandoning fossil fuels because each country has its peculiar energy history.\n\nThe NNPC GMD noted that with the commencement of the implementation of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), investors were beginning to pour into the country especially to invest in the deep-water segment of the oil and gas industry.\n\nAccording to the NNPC helmsman, Artificial Intelligence (AI) remained the future of the strategic application of technology in the industry, explaining that although Nigeria is still at the very basic stage, it also has the advantage to procure the most modern carbon-free systems.\n\nKyari argued that the Nigerian oil industry had become more competitive with the new PIA, maintaining that the country now has a clearer fiscal environment and a stronger regulatory ecosystem.\n\n\u201cWe are at the threshold of history. Our country has changed and our industry has changed because we have a new legislation that has brought clarity in the way we do our business. We have a much more competitive fiscal environment and much more modern regulatory environment and we are seeing the outcome of all these coming up.\n\n\u201cOur partners are coming up to invest, especially in the deepwater and also a lot of efforts are going on to bring back all of the production that we have lost and we are very excited for our country.\n\n\u201cI think the key challenge of the energy transition is financing what we need to do today, to produce gas and consume gas in the best possible manner and you can\u2019t produce hydrogen without properly doing it. The key challenges is financing and also realising that different countries have different circumstances, that jurisdictions are different and that we can\u2019t move at the same pace,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe urged proponents of the energy transition to appreciate the basic fact that the circumstances of every nation is peculiar and take it into consideration.\n\n\u201cCountries have different exposures and the handling (of the transition) must be in different manners and I am not sure this is properly appreciated,\u201d he stated.\n\nOn the application of technology in the transition process, he added: \u201cArtificial intelligence is the way to go in the future. We saw this coming, but currently we are at the basic level , but we are making efforts to ensure that we automate our systems and our processes.\n\n\u201cWe will make use of the best technology that is available. But Good enough for our country, we are starting from almost ground zero in sub-Saharan Africa and so carbon production petroleum systems will now be based on the basis of current technology that is available and clearly the emissions will be quite low in this circumstances,\u201d he added.\n\nHe stated that although climate change is real, there are real problems in the world, noting that for this reason, every stakeholder must work together.\n\n\u201cWe should work towards net-zero by 2050, for some countries 2060, but obviously it\u2019s a step we must take and I think it\u2019s a good development,\u201d Kyari stressed.\n\nOn the importance of the conference, he stated that ADIPEC had brought everyone on the table to realise that the entire industry needs to work together to achieve net-zero by 2050 or \u201cshortly after that.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Group Executive Director, Gas and Power, NNPC, Mr. AbdulKabir Ahmed, has said the implementation of the PIA has opened more opportunities for investors in the Nigerian oil and gas sector.\n\nSpeaking on a panel at the same event, on the theme \u2018\u2018Building the Energy Company of the Future: New Business Models and Investment Flows\u201d, Ahmed emphasised that since the PIA became law, many opportunities had been made available to investors, especially in the area of gas.\n\n\u201cWe have seen some kind of opportunities as far as the law is concerned. We have seen several bottlenecks that have been removed and those who wish to invest are encouraged to come and invest and it is everybody\u2019s destination for now and those who have investments they want to make are welcome,\u201d he said.\n\nHe attributed the rising gas prices to certain uncertainties brought about by production and supply challenges coupled with the climate change issue.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of uncertainties, not only in terms of production and supply, but we also have nature itself playing its own role and we can look at it from this perspective.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the climate change, the winter, the direction of the timing whether it is prolonged or shortened, it now gives you this kind of energy demand. Then, you cannot determine when the winter will begin and that can spur volatility,\u201d he stressed.\n\nAhmed explained that the NNPC will continue to do more in deepening the gas sector by finding the most convenient way of transporting gas, adding that the corporation will continue to build infrastructure in addition to the pipelines that are being built.\n\n\u201cA lot of confidence is being reposed in Nigeria as an investment environment. Now, that is leading to the Train 8. We are also contemplating on it. So, if Train 8 is being contemplated, then that means that that environment is still viable for investors to come in,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

He has left behind an excellent legacy; a man, who was committed to his country, to his family, and committed to his people.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo added, \u201cIt was a big shock for us that he had passed on.

See Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: Education Ministry Permanent Secretary, Echono, Former NECO Acting Registrar, Gana, Others Fingered In N6bn Contract Fraud\n\nThose specifically accused of involvement in the corruption saga are the immediate past Acting Registrar of NECO, Abubakar Gana, his Special Assistant, one Ibrahim Peter Alih, as well as Chairman of the Governing Board of the council, Dr Abubakar Sadeeq.\n\nAlso accused of having a hand in the matter is the Permanent Secretary of the Federal Ministry of Education, Arc. Sonny T. Echono.\n\nSince then, Sadeeq has been victimising some workers, pointing accusing fingers at them, some workers told SaharaReporters.\n\nMost of the affected workers who have worked in the headquarters of the examination body in Minna, the Niger State capital and its office in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital, for years have now been moved to other parts of the country, outside their regions and states. See Also Corruption EXPOSED: How Former NECO Registrar, Gana, Illegally Retained Director Due For Retirement\n\nThe aggrieved workers revealed to SaharaReporters that they had taken the matter to the National Industrial Court, which said the status quo should be maintained pending the determination of the case.\n\nBut according to them, the Chairman flouted the order of the court by still redeploying some of them and sacking the others.\n\nOne of the documents obtained by SaharaReporters is a circular dated November 8, 2021, and addressed to Directors, SA to Registrar/Chief Executive, PA to Registrar/Chief Executive, Zonal Coordinators, State Officers, Liaison and AU Staff.\n\nIt was signed by the Acting Director, Human Resource Management, Mrs. Gloria B. Likate.\n\nIt read, \u201cThis is to inform all Staff and the general public that the underlisted persons' appointments have been terminated from the services of the National Examinations Council (NECO) with effect from 5th November, 2021: Mr. Joakia Elogie, Mr. Ibrahim T. Musa, Mr. Eye Bassey Eyo, Mr. Ibrahim Ali, Mr. Bashir Bulangu, Mr. Arisa Agwu Arisa.\n\n\u201cThe General Public is hereby advised not to transact any business with them on behalf of the Council, or do so at their own peril. Please, be guided.\u201d\n\nSources said the Chairman has also created an administrative aberration, a parallel chain of authority with him as the uncontested boss in NECO.\n\nMr Mustapha Minister Submis... by Sahara Reporters\n\n\u201cThe Registrar/CEO is now merely a figurehead. His powers are appropriated by the Chairman. So he must seek approval for literally everything under operations and day-to-day administration of the council,\u201d one of them said.\n\nAnother document obtained by SaharaReporters directed the redeployments of some workers to offices in other parts of the country. The affected workers are listed as Talle Abubakar, Udochukwu Ohuegbe, Bashir Bulangu, Joakin Elogie, Belinda Igwenyi, Ibrahim Ali, Agwu Arisa Agwu, Angela Uumefune, Fatima Suleiman and Chinedu Ejeagha.\n\nOne of the workers told SaharaReporters, \u201cWe have sent an appeal to the Minister of Education about being wrongfully redeployed. We sent a petition to the Minister of Education.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen on the 8th October 2021, we went to the industrial court and there was a motion on notice and injunction asking them to maintain status quo pending the determination of the case but they went ahead to terminate our appointment,\u201d another source said.",

          "text": "The Nigerian Embassy in Dublin, Ireland is collecting illegal \u20ac100 (approximately N47,000) postal orders from Nigerians applying for passports which are shared and monetised by staff members for personal gains, SaharaReporters has learnt.\n\nSources told SaharaReporters on Sunday that workers at the Embassy resumed the fraudulent practice after the departure of the former Nigerian Ambassador to Ireland, Dr (Mrs) Uzoma Emenike.\n\nAccording to one of the sources, Nigerian Embassy workers in Ireland have mandated applicants to submit with their application a \u20ac100 postal order not addressed to anyone in particular.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that the embassy used to request postal orders from passport applicants but that was stopped by former Ambassador to the European country, Dr Uzoma Emenike, who is now the Ambassador to the United States of America.\n\nAccording to one of the sources, the Embassy recently issued a statement backdated to September 2021 to give the illegal practice an official seal.\n\n\"When the passport is ready, they are mandating applicants to submit a postal order which is not addressed to anyone. If you bring a postal order addressed to the Nigerian Embassy, they will reject it.\n\n\"Since Dr Uzoma Emenike has been posted out from Ireland to the US now, the staff members are the ones requesting for postal orders from Nigerians who are applying for passports.\n\n\"They are not giving people their passports except they bring blank postal orders which they will go claim. Now, they are charging illegal 100 euros postal orders.\n\n\"They gave express warning that it should not be addressed to the Nigerian Embassy but should be left blank,\u201d one of the sources said.\n\nAnother source told SaharaReporters that though the practice had been going on for some time, the Embassy recently released a memo in an attempt to give the illegality official backing.\n\n\"The practice has been going on for a while now, so now they decided to paste a memo at the embassy and backdated it to September 2021 in order to make it look as if it is now official,\u201d the source said.\n\n\"However, in the memo, they cleverly decided not to mention who to address the postal order to. They will reject it if addressed to the Nigerian Embassy.

That notwithstanding, all applicants who were given the extended collection period were able to collect their passports as and when due.\n\n\u201cHowever, there are applicants who before or after processing their passport applications request for early collection dates. This is to the detriment of applicants who are patiently waiting for their due collection dates. It also causes undue pressure on the passport section and the embassy in general.\n\n\u201cTherefore, in consideration of the need to serve all category of applicants based on their peculiar circumstance, especially those who have genuine reasons to request for their passports earlier than the due collection date, and in line with global practice for passport fast-track, the Embassy of Nigeria Dublin wishes to commence passport fast-track services at \u20ac100.00 only per applicant payable in postal order.\n\n\u201cIt should however be noted that in order not to allow for abuse of process and the privilege, the passport fast-track service will be operated on merit. Thus, any applicant who wants to request for the fast-track service will be required to provide documentary evidence for the urgent need of the passport before the due collection date.\n\n\u201cAny applicant for the fast-track service must have processed his/her passport application (i.e. must have his/her biometrics already captured).

          "title": "Chipper Cash\u2019s Twitter integration may revolutionise Africa\u2019s creative hustle",
          "text": "Want to be a creator in Africa? Okay. But be wary; it\u2019s going to take time, thick skin, and a little bit of what we at TechCabal like to call \u201cthe creative hustle\u201d.\n\nFor years, Africa\u2019s creative industry has been hampered by poor returns, leaving creators at the mercy of sponsors and algorithm-manipulated trends.\n\nBut fintechs like Chipper Cash stand to be a driving force behind fan-sponsored content that may change the way Africans create and consume digital media.\n\nWhere the money resides\u2026\n\nTwitter has been a space for clapbacks, online discourse, and creativity since its inception. On the third most popular social media platform in Africa, the continent\u2019s Twitter users wield power so influential that Twitter began to build out its first Africa-based team in Ghana this year.\n\nWhile Twitter is an impactful platform for creators, it has not always been a lucrative one. In a world where creators are waking up to the value of their content, monetisation has become more essential than ever, and social media platforms are finally catching on.\n\nThe digital content industry is predicted to skyrocket to a value of $38.2 billion by 2030. But developing content in an increasingly competitive market requires funding and return on investment that Africa\u2019s creators are not seeing, which \u201cthe quality of work creators produce,\u201d said David I. Adeleke, Communications Lead and Managing Editor at Nestcoin, in an interview with TechCabal.\n\nSo when TikTok, a newer entry into Africa\u2019s social media space, came on the scene, it offered a monetisation plan, out of necessity. To incentivise creators to pivot from the more popular social media platforms in Africa like Facebook, it rolled out its very own Creator Fund offering payouts to TikTok-ers once that reached 100,000 authentic views on the app.\n\nStill, in a world where creators like Ryan Kaji, a 9-year-old from the US, made an estimated $29.5 from YouTube and an additional $200 million from branded toys and clothing, Africa\u2019s creatives are making far less money from their work.\n\nThe funding divide\n\nYouTubers earn money directly from YouTube for ads inserted on top of their videos. They are paid on a cost-per-thousand-views (CPM) basis, and accrue earnings when a viewer watches at least 30 seconds of a played ad, or half the ad for a shorter advertisement.\n\nOf the 10 countries with the highest CPM per video, Algeria, is the only African country on the list. Algerian YouTubers receive $24.50 CPM. And, after earnings are garnered, YouTube takes a 55% cut, further reducing take-home pay.\n\nAccording to Mike Otieno, co-founder of Wowzi, a seamless, Africa-focused, AI-driven influencer marketing platform, South Africa is the most mature market for paid creative content in Africa, with the nation\u2019s influencers earning more, on the whole, than other influencers throughout the continent.\n\nBut, even with higher than average earnings, Caspar Lee, South Africa\u2019s most watched YouTuber, earns around 10% of Kaji\u2019s YouTube earnings per year. Nigeria\u2019s highest earning YouTuber, Mark Angel Comedy, earns around 12.2% of that same figure. And Uganda\u2019s most watched creator on YouTube, musician Eddy Kenzo, earns around 1.6% of that.\n\nThe difference between creator revenues and earnings in countries like the US versus countries in Africa comes down to market size and potential, says Otieno.\n\n\u201cMarkets with many big brands making a lot of money means more allocation to advertising budgets, which trickles down to creators. Thriving markets also tend to be hyper competitive, so brands want to outdo each other.\u201d\n\nWhen bigger brands enter growing markets, they do so with a long-term outlook of the markets\u2019 growth, spreading endorsement funding out over a longer period. Brands with smaller budgets, on the other hand, tend to place conversion as a top priority and aim to get a \u201cmaximum return for their buck,\u201d remarked Otiento.\n\nBut forecasting a market\u2019s potential growth does not account for the power and value that creators add to the creative ecosystem in the present.\n\nChipper Cash, an Africa-made cross-border payments company valued at $2 billion, is working to change this by giving creators the opportunity to receive direct revenue from the audience that loves and understands the true value of their creative content.\n\nTwitter sponsors\n\nTwitter joined the creator monetisation club in May with its very own Tip Jar function. Through the Tip Jar, users are now able to send money to their favourite online voices via PayPal, Venmo, or Cash App in app integrations. But, as none of these payment aps are widely used throughout Africa, the region\u2019s Tweeters were still limited in their ability to sponsor their favourite creators.\n\nIn October, Chipper Cash announced its all-new seamless integration with Twitter\u2019s Tip Jar.\n\nIn an interview with TechCabal, Wiza Jalaskasi, Vice President of Global Developer Relations at Chipper Cash, shared that the fintech company worked with Twitter to build out the platform\u2019s tech to create a \u201ccheap mechanism for tipping out creators\u201d.\n\nTwitter users will be able to receive payments via a QR code or direct link using their chipper.me link along with their username and an easily accessible button on mobile, using the Twitter Tips feature.\n\nThe integration will also support smaller micro transactions, with no charge for withdrawals.\n\nJalakasi believes that the app\u2019s integration with Twitter will change the \u201cfundamental misalignment of incentives\u201d by getting rid of \u201cunnecessary middlemen [such as brand sponsors] in the creative economy value chain\u201d and help \u201cexpand monetisation pathways for African creators\u201d at large.\n\nSo far, the Twitter-Chipper Cash integration is only supported for users in Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda.\n\nFunding the fandom\n\nIt\u2019s clear that fans of Africa\u2019s top creatives are willing and ready to fund their faves. On Wednesday, Nigerian singer-songwriter, Davido, raised more than $338,000 via social media after posting his bank account information and asking fans and friends to send him a little bit of birthday cash.\n\n\u201cFans funding creatives\u201d has been a tried and true method in other parts of the world.\n\nChipper Cash\u2019s Twitter integration is reminiscent of similar models used on China-made live-streaming apps. Fuelled by digital payment platforms like WeChat and Alipay integrated into the social media app itself, users were able to tip their favourite creators without leaving the app. Live stream tip functions were so successful in China that the market reached an estimated $4.4 billion in revenue in 2018 before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic\u2014which led to an additional surge in live stream viewing.\n\nWhat user-generated tip culture has provided in China is a robust influencer culture with a robust, local, influencer economy that spans e-commerce, gaming, entertainment, and education.\n\nChina\u2019s influencers wield so much power that, in a recent double-11 sale for Chinese e-commerce giant, Taobao, a top influencer generated $1.67 billion in sales over a 12-hour period.\n\nTikTok, born from the Chinese short video app, Douyin, has attempted to replicate this metric abroad and is now also offering gifts in the form of tips in select regions.\n\nYouTube also began offering a similar system with its Super Chat function in 2021, from which it keeps around 30% of overall earnings gained. Payment also requires linking your credit card to Google Pay.\n\nTwitter-unfriendly\n\nBut before Chipper Cash further expands throughout Africa, ideas about Twitter in certain countries will need a revamp.\n\nKenya is one of the fastest growing economies in sub-saharan Africa and a hotspot for tech innovation. In the country, Twitter is used as a vibrant space for social discourse. The unstoppable force that is Kenyans on Twitter (or KOT) has resulted in the relocation of a New York Times East Africa Bureau Chief and a rally to stop IMF loans to the country.\n\nOtieno says that moments like this make popular creators on apps like TikTok and Instagram hesitant to shift towards using Twitter.\n\n\u201cTwitter guys are seen as noisemakers in Kenya, so it\u2019s not somewhere people go to show love.\u201d\n\nHowever, Otieno believes that the integration of new app add-ons like Twitter Spaces and a clear monetisation scheme like Chipper Cash provides, creates an added benefit for creators to tweet and speak.\n\n\u201cIf you speak to TikTok and Instagram influencers, they\u2019ll say, \u2018I don\u2019t have a Twitter account. I just don\u2019t understand that space.\u2019 But Spaces gave Twitter more life. I think that influencers have started to become more receptive, and we will start to see more of a transition.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Yesterday, African e-commerce giant, Jumia, released its earnings report for the third quarter of 2021.\n\nDespite sharing healthy numbers as a result of accelerated growth across core usage KPIs\u2014including orders, annual active customers and gross merchandise volume (GMV)\u2014the markets responded differently with the stock price dropping by 20%.\n\nBefore sharing details of the report, recall that Jumia changed the functional (default) currency of its financial report from euros to dollars in Q2 2021. This will continue into the foreseeable future.\n\nHighlights from the report\n\nJumia\u2019s adjusted EBITDA and operating losses in Q3 2021 went up by 94% and 93% year-over-year, respectively, to $52.5 million and $64 million. This increase in loss was driven by a hike in the company\u2019s investment in sales & advertising and technology.\n\nSales and advertising expenses reached $24.0 million, up 228% year-over-year, while technology and content expenses increased by 27% to $9.4 million. This is a continuation of its return to aggressive advertising which slowed during the pandemic.\n\nCommenting on this result, the company\u2019s Co-CEOs Jeremy Hodara and Sacha Poignonnec said, \u201cWe believe that these investments are long-term in nature and that accelerating growth will ultimately contribute to profitability, leveraging the strong efficiency gains achieved throughout 2020 and the first half of 2021.\u201d\n\nJumia ended the quarter with $185 million in cash and cash equivalents and $399 million in financial assets.\n\nHistoric number of quarterly orders\n\nA major highlight from the report was that orders made on Jumia reached an all-time quarterly high of 8.5 million, representing a 28% year-over-year growth. It\u2019s the fastest growth rate of the past seven quarters, according to the company. Closely related to that, Jumia\u2019s annual active consumers reached 7.3 million and its gross merchandise value (GMV) reached $238 million, both up 8% year-over-year.\n\nIn the third quarter, FMCG inventories overtook fashion inventories as the fastest-growing category in terms of items sold. The former posted the highest ever volume number, almost doubling on a year-over-year basis.\n\nThe second-fastest-growing category was food delivery, growing by almost 40% year-over-year. This category posted its highest ever quarterly volume with over 2 million orders, surpassing the previous record registered in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nJumia noted that it saw growth momentum across all inventory categories, except phones & electronics. The company attributes this slowdown to a global supply disruption, including global chipset shortages.\n\nJumiaPay and its fintech ambition\n\nIn the second quarter, JumiaPay\u2014Jumia\u2019s financial and digital services\u2014posted its largest-ever quarterly GMV processed. The company followed by disclosing in its third-quarter report that JumiaPay processed 36% of all orders on Jumia, a significant feat considering that it competes with numerous payment options. Riding on that wave, JumiaPay has continued to grow as the company expands the range of services available to consumers on JumiaPay App.\n\nIn Nigeria for example, customers are now able to book bus tickets via the JumiaPay App, including a proprietary seat mapping selection that will be rolled out in other markets in the near future. In Egypt, JumiaPay added new consumers, including several universities which students can now pay their tuition fees online via the JumiaPay app as well as a major Arabic content streaming platform, Shahid.\n\nOptimistic about its fintech ambitions for JumiaPay, the company shared a picture of its roadmap. In the near future, it plans to launch payment cards, savings, insurance and \u2018buy now pay later\u2019 offerings to consumers of JumiaPay. For merchants, it\u2019s looking to roll out point of sale, QR Codes, consumer financing, and other offerings.\n\nSource: Jumia\n\nLogistics services\n\nFor its logistics service to third parties, Jumia reached a major milestone by recording $1 million revenue from this service. It delivered 2.9 million packages on behalf of 766 clients, this was a 123% increase on the 1.3 million packages that were delivered in Q2 2021.\n\nThe company also mentioned that it took part in impact initiatives such as Giga, a global initiative to connect every school in Africa to the Internet and every young person to information, opportunity and choice. It also partnered with Solar Taxi, a modern eco-friendly mobility company, to provide an affordable and eco-friendly delivery solution in Ghana.\n\nThe increase in losses incurred by Jumia in the third quarter wasn\u2019t good news to some investors but the company sees it as a necessary path to achieving its goal of profitability and scale.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Shuttlers, a logistics startup out of Lagos, Nigeria, has raised $1.6 million in seed funding to expand into African countries.\n\nThe investment round was led by VestedWorld, a Chicago-and-Africa-based investment firm, with Interswitch, Rising Tide Africa, Launch Africa, EchoVC, CMC 21 & Alsa, ShEquity, Five35, Consonance Investment, CcHub Syndicate, Sakore, and Nikky Taurus also participating in the raise.\n\nWith its new raise, Shuttlers intends to try its wheels in more Nigerian cities before expanding beyond the borders of the country into other African countries.\n\nShuttling Lagos\u2019 transportation system\n\nIn 2016, Damilola Olokesusi founded Shuttlers to tackle the inefficient transportation system in Lagos, Africa\u2019s most populous city. The startup was a tech-enabled bus-sharing company targeted at helping Lagosians commute in comfort at affordable rates.\n\nAt the time, Lagos was a city holding 23 million people and 90% of its transport system was road-based, with semi-formal mini buses or danfos accounting for 45% of trips while walking accounted for 40%. According to the Lagos Metropolitan Transport Authority in 2015, the city alone also accounted for 30% of the total number of road vehicles in Nigeria, with a vehicular density of 234 cars per kilometre.\n\nAlthough Lagos has a number of federal roads, its transport system is epileptic due to the poor nature of some of the roads and the lack of a formal or public transport system which accounts for only 2.5% of the system.\n\nShuttlers\u2019 solution\n\nAt launch, Shuttlers did not have a mobile app.\n\nThe company\u2019s model at the time was messenger-based, using Slack, email and WhatsApp to communicate routes and timelines to its customers. One of their very first clients was Andela, which took advantage of the startup\u2019s B2B2C option to ferry its workers across the state.\n\nBy 2019, Shuttlers revamped to introduce a mobile app where customers could subscribe to any of the three plans available, which includes a B2B where business clients pay the total fares of their employees, and B2C where individual customers pay fares themselves.\n\nPresently, the platform offers additional features including live bus tracking, digital payments and an on-trip menu.\n\nAlthough the company has only managed to raise about $6,000 in angel investments and grants, Shuttlers\u2019 route has been lauded with immense growth as the company claims to have over 10,000 users across its web and mobile-based platforms. With over 100 buses and 300 bus stops in Lagos, Shuttlers also claims to have recorded over 2 million trips since its inception in 2013.\n\nMoving forward\n\nFor CEO Damilola Olokesusi, the raise validates the hard work her team has put in for the past five years. Olokesusi also believes that it\u2019s an encouraging nod for female entrepreneurs in the tech space. \u201cIt shows that women can thrive in any industry they choose, especially tech which is highly male-dominated,\u201d she told TechCabal. \u201cI\u2019m not only a female entrepreneur, I\u2019m a huge supporter of women who are making a difference in their industries. I hope the work I do at Shuttlers inspires women to be daring with their aspirations.\u201d\n\nInvestors are also excited for the future of Shuttlers with Olokesusi at the helm. \u201cWe are very excited to back Damilola in this venture and work alongside a group of committed financial and strategic investors to scale this further,\u201d said Lavanya Anand, Principal at VestedWorld.\n\nSpeaking on the need for Shuttlers and its mission, the CEO emphasized the company\u2019s mission to transform the commuting challenges in African cities. \u201cOur mission at Shuttlers is to transform the way people commute around the world, by building a global partner network and connecting communities of shuttlers like we are presently doing in Lagos, Nigeria. The negative impact of inefficiencies in the mobility space is visible in the quality of life, mental health, and work productivity of commuters. We also see its impact on the more vulnerable and neglected population in our society; women, children, physically challenged, and the elderly. I\u2019m confident that our smart mobility solutions can solve some of these urban mobility challenges sustainably and also reduce carbon emission.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

At this point, you have become a global business.\u201d Oluwatosin Ajibade (Mr Eazi)\n\nCelebrities are humans first, you know? In the grand scheme of things, they are only individuals striving to live their best lives, showcasing their creativity while making money, and spreading as much love as possible, some of the things that made them famous in the first place.\n\nTo an average LinkedIn user, Ajibade Oluwatosin (his profile name as of the time I reached out) is just a \u201cGlobal superstar and VC.\u201d A cursory glance won\u2019t reveal that he\u2019s the popular Mr Eazi.\n\nI only figured it out a few weeks ago when one of my contacts liked one of his posts. I wasted no time sending a connection request, which he accepted rather quickly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat do I do with this new connection,\u201d I asked myself.\n\nI remembered that Mr Eazi\u2019s emPawa Africa, a talent incubator, was instrumental in placing Joeboy in the limelight. That was when I concluded he would be a good fit for the Techpoint Africa Experts series. I sent him a message, and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Eazi. Source: Instagram\n\nMr Eazi had just returned from an engagement on the evening we\u2019d scheduled our talk and needed a moment to catch his breath, which he did in record time.\n\nShortly after, we exchanged pleasantries, and the stage was set for a somewhat friendly conversation; his mood, best described as calm.\n\nSeeing Mr Eazi very relaxed was quite the revelation because his demeanour was not too different from his public appearances and videos. I guess I expected a contrasting personality, as is often the case with artistes.\n\nI got the thoughts of one of his fans while writing this.\n\n\u201cI think Mr Eazi is a laid back musician. He\u2019s very African and indigenous and relates a lot with his roots.\u201d\n\nOluwatosin said it was easy to build a persona around the name Mr Eazi, which was the nickname his friends in university gave him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think the nickname is just an expression of who I am. I like to live calmly,\u201d he shared.\n\nAnd this calm personality seems to be reflected in every part of his life. Expectedly, though, he takes on a new life when he has to match his fans\u2019 energy and excitement at shows and events.\n\nSince gaining popularity, Mr Eazi\u2019s reputation has grown in leaps and bounds, preceding him even beyond the music scene.\n\nThere was a funny moment. as we spoke. when he revealed his spontaneity and unpredictability. What do you think about Don Eazi as president of any nation or Pastor Eazi?\n\nThirty-year-old Oluwatosin lived his early years in Sango Otta, Ogun State. The Nigeria-born musician later relocated to Ghana for his undergraduate studies before starting his music career in London.\n\nGiven his ardent local and global following, Mr Eazi\u2019s name and content mostly scream \u2018Afrobeats to the world!\u2019 since he came into the music industry a few years back.\n\nHe believes Africa is experiencing its best years in the global music industry, with many of its music genres being embraced globally.\n\nMotivation and obsession\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwatosin Ajibade (Mr Eazi). Source: Supplied\n\nA look at the mark the young artiste has made in a short time shows that he is clearly motivated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m someone who is fascinated with seeing ideas come to life. There\u2019s some form of joy that comes from conceiving an idea and seeing it come to life.\u201d\n\nStrangely, in an industry where one can make tons of money, his excitement mostly comes from creating music in the studio; the monetary value of the music produced is secondary in his books.\n\nAs with most success stories, there\u2019s some history. Oluwatosin\u2019s career track hasn\u2019t always been straightforward. A mechanical engineering graduate, Oluwatosin traded FMCGs and gold before deciding to stick to music.\n\n\n\nThe rest of this article will be made public on November 23, by noon (WAT)..

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSomething good is a frontier; something better is also a frontier and something excellent is just another frontier! You can always go beyond these frontiers! And so what is excellent? Just a frontier!\u201d \u2014 Mehmet Murat ildan\n\n\u201cThere exist limitless opportunities in every industry. Where there is an open mind, there will always be a frontier.\u201d \u2014 Charles Kettering\n\nWhen I think about the word \u2018frontier\u2019, what comes to mind is the American Wild West. Why? My first idea of what that word means came from a book romanticising the life of one of America\u2019s founding fathers, Benjamin Franklin. For the life of me, I can\u2019t remember the title, and Google Search is not helping.\n\nBut back to the word frontier. While there are several meanings of the word, for our purposes, we would be adopting this definition by the Merriam Webster Dictionary: \u201ca new field for exploitative or developmental activity.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy all the talk about frontiers? We\u2019ll get into that at the end of this article, but for now, let\u2019s take a look at some numbers.\n\nThe edtech industry in Africa: the now\n\nAccording to Briter Bridges, as of Q1 2020, there were 210 edtech startups in Africa. The African e-learning space is many times described as nascent. A bit surprising, as it is not a novel industry on the continent.\n\nThe African Virtual University, created by the World Bank in 1997 and established by a charter signed by eighteen African member states, is Africa\u2019s first Internet-based school. It also has a physical building in Kenya\u2019s capital, Nairobi.\n\nNigeria also has a distance learning university, the National Open University of Nigeria, founded in 2002 and the first of its kind in West Africa.\n\nHowever, only just recently has the edtech space begun to pick up steam.\n\nAccording to Boye Oshinaga, Gradely CEO, \u201cThe edtech industry is at its infrastructure-building phase in Nigeria and Africa, where those players that invest in the rails will get a big payoff in the coming years.\u201d\n\nWhy the infrastructure-building phase? Because a lot of what would power the industry is just as nascent as the edtech space.\n\nMost of the time, accessibility to these edtech startups requires an Internet connection, or at the very least, a smartphone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer Internet World Stats, Internet penetration in Africa as of Q1 2020 stood at 39.3%, much lower than the world average of 58.8%.\n\nThe Global System for Mobile Communications (GSMA), however, predicts that 65% of sub-Saharan Africa will have a smartphone by 2025, a number which stood at 50% as of 2020.\n\nEdtech startups vary across different sectors: massive open online courses (MOOCs), extended reality learning content, gamified learning, examination preparation, and subject-based instructional content, among others.\n\nEyitayo Ogunmola, Utiva CEO, classifies them into edtech and teched. He says the former has more to do with \u201cdeploying tech solutions to creating learning experiences.\u201d The latter, on the other hand, \u201cis majorly around incubating and accelerating talent.\u201d\n\nBut he also introduces some unlikely sectors, like jobtech, HR tech, and workforce development tech.\n\n\u201cPeople also think Jobberman and all the hiring platforms are also education technology because many of them are now deploying learning as a subset of the value.\n\n\u201cSo the education technology industry, in Africa, by extension, is a combination of the three different categories that I\u2019ve mentioned: the edtech as a product, the teched as a service, and also the other value creation products and services that are also supercharging the learning side of things.\u201d\n\nThe edtech industry in Africa: the future\n\nSo, what happens next?\n\nEvolving business models\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgunmola is very confident that these sectors will never merge because \u201cthey offer different kinds of value.\u201d So while he doesn\u2019t see them merging, he believes the industry is headed the way of a harmonious divergence.\n\nInterestingly, he believes that in the future, edtech will focus more on its adaptability and new learning models than technology. Comparing fintechs and edtechs, he says the latter would be a combination of APIs and new learning models, unlike the former, which appears to be largely API-driven.\n\n\u201cI see many companies are adopting new technologies, but I also see many companies adopting new approaches; it\u2019s going to be a combination. For example, in the future, it\u2019s going to be a combination of self-paced learning, instructor learning models, gamification to incentivise learning and completion rates, and micro franchising.\n\n\u201cThere are other things like VR and augmented reality. Facebook is exploring the metaverse, right? It will be about those things.\u201d\n\nOshinaga agrees.\n\n\u201cAll disruptive technologies and the behaviour to make them widely acceptable over the next ten years already exist in some form. They will just be utilised further to deliver clearer advantages over current systems and eventually win.\u201d\n\nHe, however, says, \u201cThe future of the industry is AI-driven and personalised, and will have education delivered in more animated, interactive, and immersive content formats. Methodologies such as Use of Technology in the Classroom and other widespread methodologies will be empirically tested to prove their relevance.\u201d\n\nHe also believes homeschooling would increase, citing examples of the US and the UK.\n\n\u201cIn the future, parents will take charge of their children\u2019s learning and be more proactive in what skills they try to imbibe in the child or what exposure they are looking to add to enrich their children\u2019s future.\u201d\n\nThe increase in homeschooling occurred during the pandemic, but Africa\u2019s story is split in the middle. Some countries \u2014 Nigeria, Ghana, and Zimbabwe \u2014 do not have any laws recognising homeschooling. However, in some, like Kenya, it appears to be illegal. In contrast, others like Zambia, Rwanda, South Africa and Botswana have legalised homeschooling.\n\nIn fact, in Botswana, you are not mandated to send your child to school.\n\nWhile homeschooling data is not available in most African countries \u2014 a challenge we\u2019ll come to in a bit \u2014 South Africa, where homeschooling has been legal for several years, showed a spike in the heat of the pandemic.\n\nData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne thing Ogunmola and Oshinaga agree on is the emergence and importance of more data in the next frontier of the edtech industry.\n\n\u201cAs you deploy technology into the learning space, leaders would have to focus aggressively on the data that has been generated and use that data to improve the technology because this is the intersection of human behaviour and technology,\u201d Ogunmola says.\n\nHe further submits that how this data is utilised to help improve learning for the user is far more important than collecting data.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about, \u2018I have 50 projects on this platform; go and work on them.\u2019 It\u2019s about whether the platform can provide you with feedback during learning to improve your capacity. Because ultimately, this is education \u2014 improving your capacity.\u201d\n\nBut, Africa\u2019s data collection and retention structures are pretty underdeveloped. Look no further than identity verification and collection processes in several African countries and how long it has taken to get to this stage.\n\nOshinaga laments the lack of data, especially in the use of government funds without any thought to \u2018Who needs it more?\u2019 or \u2018Is this school performing well enough to warrant this funding, or should it be shut down and focus shifted to other schools?\u2019\u201d\n\nSo he says, \u201cWe will have more data on the performance of teachers and schools at a more global level so it\u2019s clear what donors, governments, investors, and companies can do about it.\u201d\n\nAs we said in an earlier article, for greater efficacy, the government would do better to support players looking to aid universities in providing learning for students.\n\nPutting it succinctly, Ogunmola says, \u201cUniversities would never be edtechs.\u201d\n\nTying it back to data collation, he says, \u201cImagine all universities have the data of all their students. Name, email, and mobile number, not some email they submitted ten years ago that is no longer updated. If they have this updated, they can share that data with us in the form of an API, and we can continue to improve the alumni. That\u2019s how we build a much-improved ecosystem of talent; it\u2019s not by this disintegrated and disaggregated form of engagement.\u201d\n\nAccessibility/Affordability\n\nIn 2020, as the coronavirus swept cities and students remained at home for an extended period, many K-12 schools and universities moved online. This marked a turning point for edtech use as startups like uLesson saw a rise in users and consequently accelerated expansion plans.\n\nBut for most users, especially those in the low and middle-income bracket, some of these services were out of reach due to Internet and smartphone availability. To help with this, some countries turned to tried-and-true radio programmes as an avenue to improve accessibility and affordability.\n\nAccording to Yomi Ojo, Founder of SchoolsCompass, the divide between the haves and have nots is a huge challenge for the edtech industry.\n\n\u201cA lot of these technologies are being built for the privileged, but it further widens the educational gap between them and the less-privileged. School owners and edtech products are overlooking these things; it\u2019s a time bomb.\u201d\n\nBut as Ojo himself says, edtech startups are not non-profit organisations. He believes that the government should do more to provide better Internet services and partner with these companies.\n\nA position Ogunmola and Oshinaga agree with to varying degrees. While both believe public-private partnerships would help in the future, Ogunmola thinks we will see more Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) models or loans.\n\nAccording to Ogunmola, Utiva is one of many companies already implementing these ideas. TalentQL is another one doing so via its AltSchool Africa product.\n\n\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I take a loan for learning if I can guarantee that it\u2019s going to get me a job?\u201d Ogunmola asks.\n\nFunding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of August 2021, Africa\u2019s edtech industry has attracted $20 million in funding since 2019. This is not a lot of money, especially compared to investments in edtech on a global scale, which reached $18.6 billion in 2019 alone.\n\nBut Oshinaga believes we would see better investment rounds in the future. \u201cWe already have a Series A of over $5m and seed of $2-4m. This trend will continue.\u201d\n\nIn September 2020, South African edtech startup, Valenture Institute, raised a $7 million Series A from GSV Ventures.\n\nIn January 2021, Nigerian edtech startup, uLesson, also raised $7 million in a Series A investment round led by Owl Ventures.\n\nThe next frontier\n\nBased on United Nations\u2019 estimates, according to Worldometer, Africa currently has a population of 1.3 billion people, with a median age of 19.7 years. This number is expected to grow to 1.6 billion by 2030.\n\nAt Techpoint Build 2021, discussions about the next frontier in different sectors would be in the limelight. In anticipation of these discourses, we are talking to industry leaders, getting opinions, and seeking patterns.\n\nWe can\u2019t wait to have you join us in January 2022.

Emmanuel Paul has that answer and more here: Led by ex-OPay exec, Kredi Money wants to be the one-stop-shop for payments, loans, insurance, other financial services.\n\nOzow\u2019s $48m Series B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas Pays, CEO and Co-Founder of Ozow\n\nSouth African fintech startup, Ozow has closed a $48 million Series B to ease online payments for South Africans.\n\nPer TechCrunch, The funding was led by Tencent, a Chinese Internet-based company. Other investors, Endeavor Catalyst and Endeavor Harvest Fund, also participated in the round.\n\nWhat does Ozow do? The startup makes it possible to pay online with bank transfers or manual Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) without using your bank app.\n\nHow? It\u2019s called automated EFT; it works just like a payment gateway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen making an online payment, customers choose Ozow as a payment option, select a bank, log in with online banking details, and Ozow automates the payment.\n\nMerchants, on the other hand, only need an account number and smartphone to receive payments.\n\nOzow\u2019s CEO, Thomas Pays, says he started the company in 2014 to create a \u201ccentral platform that could basically provide solutions to eCommerce, point of sale, e-billing and peer to peer payment.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with TechCrunch, Pays says, seven years ago, digital payment was very fragmented,\n\n\u201cif I want a point of sale device, I need to go to a company like Yoco. If I want to accept payments via card on my eCommerce site, I need to go to a PayU.\u201d\n\nOzow plans to use the funding to expand its team from 100 to 250. A part of it will also be geared towards expansion into Kenya, Ghana and Nigeria.\n\nGetting blockchain skills with Bitmama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Lagos Techie on Unsplash\n\nAccording to Statista, the blockchain technology market is currently valued at $6.92 billion. That value is expected to reach $162.84 billion by 2027. This means that as the market grows, the demand for blockchain talent will also increase.\n\nIn light of this, African crypto exchange, Bitmama, is launching Bitmama Credits Programme to support young people globally with the skills needed to get a career in the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nThe programme will begin in the first quarter of next year, offering blockchain learning materials and internships.\n\nThe big picture: With the advent of several blockchain innovations such as Non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralised finance (DeFi) and Web3, the demand for blockchain talent is climbing.\n\nIn 2019, the demand for blockchain jobs increased by 300% from the previous year.\n\nInterestingly, high demand also means huge salaries. The average salary for a blockchain developer is between $150,000 and $175,000; that\u2019s approximately $15,000 to $40,000 higher than the standard salary for software engineers.\n\nWhy\u2019s there so much demand?: According to 101 Blockchains, the need for blockchain talent is fueled by the advantages of blockchain, such as security, transparency, and traceability.\n\nWith more innovations coming out of the space, the demand for blockchain talent is bound to increase.\n\nWhat I\u2019m watching\n\nGoogle\u2019s Next $1 Trillion Opportunity.

          "text": "Mo Abudu, the CEO of EbonyLife Group, is known for several firsts in the media space, and is adding another feather to her hat. For the first time in history, a case study about a female African media entrepreneur titled: \u2018The Harvard Business School \u2013 EbonyLife Case Study,\u2019 will be taught at Harvard Business School (HBS) to over 1,000 MBA students.\n\n\u201cEbonyLife turns 10 next year, so the case reflects on how we started and where we are today. It will also highlight our challenges along the way,\u201d Abudu said. She revealed in an exclusive interview with BusinessDay that she is currently on the HBS campus in Boston where this case study will be taught, and also to share her story with the students and faculty.\n\nWhat this means is that, first-year students at HBS will study a case about an African company, led by a Nigerian woman. It will become one of approximately 500 case studies read by students over the course of the two-year MBA programme. Nearly half of these cases are based on global organisations.\n\nRead Also: Netflix\u2019s Nigerian original film, \u2018Blood Sisters\u2019 from Mo Abudu\u2019s EbonyLife wraps production\n\n\u201cI am looking forward to listening to them and answering their questions. I am humbled and honoured to be chosen for this, and I will always do all I can to encourage everyone out there on the possibilities and results that abound in daring to excel, because as I always say, if you can think it, you can do it,\u201d Abudu said.\n\nWhen Mo Abudu launched EbonyLife TV in 2013, her primary goal for the channel was to create a more positive narrative around Africa. What followed was a string of aspirational TV series to include Fifty, Castle & Castle, Sons of the Caliphate and The Governor, among others.\n\nHer desire to change the narrative about Africa in the international scene birthed her love for filmmaking with the creation of EbonyLife Films in 2014. She has produced different blockbusters such as: Fifty, The Wedding Party, Chief Daddy, The Royal Hibiscus Hotel and Your Excellency. Furthermore, she was the executive producer of \u00d2l\u00f2t\u016br\u00e9, a feature film that exposes the shady business of human trafficking in Nigeria. The film premiered as a Netflix Original in October 2020.\n\nIn 2018, Sony Pictures Television (SPT) announced a three-year deal with EbonyLife TV that would include co-production of The Dahomey Warriors. In 2019, AMC Networks (USA) announced its partnership with EbonyLife to produce Nigeria 2099, an afro-futuristic crime-drama created by EbonyLife. Also, in June 2020, Netflix signed a multi-title deal with EbonyLife to create two original series and multiple branded films and a series. In February 2021, EbonyLife Media signed a First Look deal with Sony Pictures and a slate of co-produced film and television projects with Will and Jada Smith\u2019s Westbrook Studios.\n\nMost recently, EbonyLife Studios and Will Packer Productions are teaming to develop an untitled project, based on Evan Ratliff\u2019s Bloomberg article, \u2018The Fall of the Billionaire Gucci Master.\u2019\n\nThe HBS case study is to be presented in two parts \u2013 A and B. Case study A chronicles the journey of EbonyLife Media from inception to December 2020, while case study B provides a summary of what has occurred between January and October 2021.\n\nHaving read case study A, the students will have to consider the choices told in the HBS case study abstract and give their analysis. In relating with Abudu and understanding case study B, they will discover what has changed since the case was written and what the value of their assessment and recommendations have been.\n\nWhat this feat also means is that, Mo Abudu will be joining a long list of CEOs, including Warren Buffet and Elon Musk, whose strategies and decisions have been analysed in HBS case studies.\n\n\u201cAt first, I was surprised by Harvard\u2019s interest in us; however, I can now see how a diverse faculty and student body could benefit from looking at how companies in Africa and other parts of the world deal with challenges unique to their environment. I\u2019m looking forward to the discussions and the students\u2019 perspectives,\u201d said Abudu.\n\nShe oversees the EbonyLife Group, which includes all EbonyLife Media assets and EbonyLife Place, Nigeria\u2019s first luxury entertainment resort. She is also a part of OSCARS in the producer membership category, and she is the only African woman selected in this category. Forbes described her as \u201cAfrica\u2019s Most Successful Woman,\u201d while CNN said she was \u201cAfrica\u2019s Queen of Media who conquered the continent.\u201d\n\nAbudu is highly sought after for her knowledge of the African and global creative industry. She has spoken at the Wharton School of Business, Cambridge University Judge School of Business, NYU, Oxford University and Harvard University. Throughout the years, Abudu has been a recipient of numerous awards and international recognitions.",

          "text": "The House of Representatives on Thursday took steps to remove the Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT) from the control of the executive arm of the Nigerian Government and domicile it in the Judiciary \u2013 an independent arm of the Government.\n\nThis is as the House passed through second reading, a bill to alter the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 with a view to removing the CCT, an adjudicatory body, from the Executive Arm and placing it under the judiciary as a superior court of record.\n\nSponsored by Solomon Bob (PDP, Rivers) and Olajide Olatunbosun (APC, Oyo) the bill proposes to amend principally sections 6, 84, 240, 243, 254, 294, 295, 316 of the constitution among others that deal with superior courts of record and sought to incorporate the CCT among them.\n\nLeading debate on the bill, Bob said in a presidential democracy such as Nigeria\u2019s, the three arms of government \u2013 the Legislature, Executive and Judiciary are distinct and separate in functions, powers and composition.\n\nHe said the distinct separation of powers is intended to secure the independence of each arm and for each to act as a check on the exercise of power by the other, which ultimately enhances the effective discharge of their respective constitutional responsibilities.\n\n\u201cIt is not, therefore, by accident that the constitution specifically sets out the powers of each of the three arms as spelt out in sections 4, 5 & 6 for the Legislature, Executive and the Judiciary respectively.\n\n\u201cThe Code of Conduct Tribunal \u2013 the focal point of this Bill \u2013 is undoubtedly a judicial body created by paragraph 15 of the 5th schedule to the constitution and section 20 of the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act. It is a statutory body saddled with the responsibility of trying offences under the Code of Conduct Bureau Act.\n\n\u201cHowever, it is absurd and indeed confounding that a judicial tribunal clothed with enormous powers to sanction public officers found guilty of violating the Code of Conduct Act, including the power to order forfeiture and bar offenders from holding public office, is placed under the Executive rather than the Judiciary, an arm where it rightly belongs,\u201d Bob said.\n\nRead also: #EndSARS Panel report opens window into police brutality\n\nHe argued that paragraph 18(2) of the 5th schedule of the Constitution which deals with the powers of the Tribunal provides in extenso; \u2018the punishment which the Code of Conduct Tribunal may impose.\u2019\n\nThe sanctions include: \u201cVacation of office or seat in any legislative house, as the case may be; disqualification from membership of a legislative house and from the holding of any public office for a period not exceeding ten years; and Seizure and forfeiture to the state of any property acquired in abuse or corruption of office.\u201d\n\nThe lawmaker said these provisions clearly clothe the Tribunal as a judicial body with the powers of a competent court of record, adding that the failure to situate it under the judicial arm of government is contrary to the principle of separation of powers\n\n\u201cTo illustrate this point, Mr. Speaker, Honourable colleagues, it is noteworthy to point out here that the highest court of this land has held in the case of Saraki vs FRN (2016) LPELR 46013 SC that the chairman and members of the Code of Conduct Tribunal are not judicial officers. That being the case, they are not subject to the discipline and sanction of the National Judicial Council like other judicial officers.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the offices of the chairman and members of the Code of Conduct Tribunal are clearly omitted in the judicial oath contained in the 7th schedule to the constitution.\n\n\u201cHonourable colleagues, giving effect to this amendment will, therefore, make members of the Tribunal judicial officers with the attendant protection and privileges which that will afford, besides securing the funding of the Tribunal as its funding will be charged on the consolidated revenue of the federation and released directly to the head as statutory transfers. This will in turn immune them substantially from the manipulation or control of the Executive.\n\n\u201cHonourable Colleagues, under a presidential democracy, one single arm of government ought not exercise executive and judicial powers such as is the case presently. The horrifying consequences or dangers of placing the Tribunal under the Executive as it is today are clear for us all to see. Its independence is non-existent and its instrumentalization by the executive as a weapon against the legislature and the judiciary is evident and undeniable.\n\n\u201cMr. Speaker, by way of citing a precedent, this Honourable House in the 6th Assembly vide the 3rd Alteration of the constitution similarly took a bold decision and upgraded the National Industrial Court to a superior court of record, which today has helped in no small measure in the dispensation of justice by that court.\n\n\u201cMr. Speaker, Honourable colleagues, history beckons once again and such legislative intervention is just as desirable, if not more, in the present case in order to fully realize the objectives for which the tribunal was established, enhance its capacity to deliver on those objectives, maintain the very important division of functions among the three arms of government and further entrench and strengthen our democracy,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "Makers of footwear in Aba, cars and other household consumables in South-Eastern Nigeria that depend on Onne Port, the gateway to the Eastern market, for the importation of raw materials are now facing hard times due to difficulties in clearing goods from the port.\n\nAccording to port users, imported containers now dwell for an average of 35 days at Onne Port due to the inefficiency of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) and other government agencies involved in cargo clearing.\n\nThe situation, port users say, compels importers to pay millions of naira as demurrage and storage charges to shipping companies and terminal operators for not taking delivery of their containers as and when due.\n\n\u201cCargoes such as industrial chemicals, spare parts, Completely Knocked Down (CKD) kits for car assembling plants, raw materials like foreign leathers, chemicals, and shoe soles for footwear industries in Aba come into the country through Onne. I know of many footwear industries that bring in their raw materials from Onne Port,\u201d Tony Anakebe, managing director of Gold-Link Investment, a clearing and forwarding company, said in an interview with BusinessDay.\n\nRead also: Stakeholders seek end to extortion, harassment on Nigeria roads\n\nAccording to Anakebe, all the Eastern markets including Onitsha Main Market, Ariaria International Market, and Nkwo Nnewi depend on Onne Port to bring in their goods.\n\nAnakebe, who noted that the major problem in Onne Port was the bad state of the access road, which has become a thorn in the flesh for port users, said there were other bottlenecks to the timely delivery of goods at the port.\n\n\u201cGovernment agencies are not helping, and there are multiple Customs units that also frustrate Ease of Doing Business at Onne. These Customs units have a way of delaying cargo clearing at the port, and Customs officers expect cargo owners to tip them before they would do their jobs, and this results in economic losses for cargo owners,\u201d he explained.\n\nContinuing, he said: \u201cThis situation results in a hike in inflation rate and prices of goods because these bottlenecks force importers to pay demurrages and storage charges. A manufacturer that would have pegged product pricing at N5 would be forced to charge N50 due to the delay and high charges at the port. The consumers would always be the ones to bear it by paying a premium for goods.\u201d\n\nWarredi Enisuoh, a seasoned ship captain, blamed the delay in cargo clearing at the port on the inability of Customs to change its inspection regime to match modern times.\n\nThe Customs needs to automate its processes, use scanners rather than physical inspection and modernise cargo movement at the port to fast track delivery of cargo, he said.\n\nNoah Sheriff, commercial manager of the West African Container Terminal (WACT), told newsmen at the Onne Port in Rivers State recently that the 35-day long dwell time for containers was hampering efficiency at the Onne Port.\n\n\u201cWe appeal to consignees to take prompt delivery of their containers to reduce the dwell time, which has risen to 35 days,\u201d he said, disclosing that the company was considering an additional investment of $111 million, a show of commitment to national revenue generation.\n\nBusinessDay check shows that this delay in cargo clearing is coming one year after WACT, Onne terminal operator, injected about $100 million into the acquisition of terminal handling equipment and expansion of the terminal yard in 2020.\n\nOn why cargo dwells longer, John Oforbike, a licensed customs agent, said despite the Federal Government\u2019s Executive Order on Ease of Doing Business at ports, doing business at the port remained very difficult due to lack of enforcement of the order.\n\nAccording to Oforbike, port terminals are supposed to be transit points for cargo; rather, they have become a detention bay for government agencies that interfere in the release of containers for one reason or the other.",

This has contributed to ending poverty in the state.\u201d\n\nNoting that the government has undertaken nuanced reforms to achieve economic revolution in the state, she said \u201cit is in the best interest of the citizens of the state to achieve the SDGs in line with global practice to end poverty and achieve decent work and economic growth by 2030.\u201d\n\nEnumerating the indicators which show the efforts and success made in achieving the mentioned Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), she noted that the decision of companies like Nosak Group, Saro Africa Group, among others, to locate in the state, is an indication that the state is doing a lot to create the enabling environment for businesses to flourish.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cIf you listened to Mr. Governor at the Alaghodaro summit, you would have heard him say over 102,000 hectares of land have been allocated for oil palm plantation and production. This is to enable private businesses to invest in the sector, thereby creating more jobs and wealth so as to end poverty in the state, which is in line with goal one in SDGs.\n\n\u201cHe also said, in the next five years, Edo will produce a minimum of ten thousand software engineers. All these efforts are to make life better for citizens of the state.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cIt is important to mention that the International poverty line currently is at $1.90 a day. It is the universal standard for measuring global poverty. This line helps measure the number of people living in extreme poverty and helps compare poverty levels between countries.\n\n\u201cThese are some of the things we are trying to deal with and to deal with these issues, we must make an effort to create jobs for all.\n\n\u201cAlso understand that economic growth is the economic prosperity of a nation and its people, but for economic prosperity to happen there must be economic productivity. So, people need to do well as individuals and as a society. For that to happen, the people must be productive, they must be creating things to sell and rendering services that people will pay for.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is what the sustainable development goal eight is and Edo State is striving hard to achieve this. The number of ongoing projects in this state right now shows the readiness to create more jobs and wealth to end poverty,\u201d Alufohai added.\n\n...",

          "text": "The National Economic Council (NEC) says President Muhammadu Buhari has approved a fresh N656 billion Bridge Financing Facility for the 36 states.\n\nZainab Ahmed, Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, disclosed this on Thursday at a virtual NEC meeting presided over by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and anchored from the Presidential Villa, Abuja.\n\nThe minister said the support was to help state governments to meet their financial obligations, especially the previous budget support facility due for repayment.\n\nAccording to Mrs Ahmed, each state will receive N18.2 billion.\n\nShe said that the bridge facility was being processed by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\n\u201cThe approved bridge facility of N656.112 billion will be disbursed in six tranches over a period of six months to the states.\n\n\u201cExpectedly, each of the 36 States will have a total loan amount of N18.225 billion; with a 30-year tenor, and a 2-year moratorium at an interest rate of nine per cent.\n\n\u201cThe facility is to help the states afford the repayment of previous bailout facilities guaranteed for them by the Federal Government,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nOn July 15, the council had received updates on the budget support facility to states.\n\nAt that meeting, Mrs Ahmed informed NEC that the deductions for repayment of previous bailout facilities would commence soon.\n\nSubsequently, the states sought further support leading to the idea of bridge financing.\n\nMeanwhile, the Executive Director, National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), Faisal Shuaib, has briefed the council on the status of the country\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine roll-out.\n\nMr Shuaib said that Nigeria had received over 100 million doses of COVID\u201319 vaccines from COVAX, AU and some countries, which was sufficient to ramp up vaccination for about 50 per cent of the targeted population.\n\n\u201cThe total eligible population of Nigerians for the vaccine is over 111 million.\n\n\u201cGiven the availability of vaccines, we have started rolling out a plan to vaccinate 50 per cent of Nigerians, 18 years and above by Jan. 31, 2022,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe NPHCDA boss added that there would be a scaling up of over 3,000 health facilities nationwide.\n\nIfedayo Adetifa, the Director-General, Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), also made a presentation to the council.\n\nHe said Nigerians must continue to maintain and sustain the COVID-19 response, especially as it entered the holiday period where there would be travels within and outside the country and mass events to herald the holiday season.\n\n\u201cThe country should maintain visibility of the outbreak by testing, continuing to encourage adherence to public health and social measures, encourage vaccination and address vaccine hesitancy,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the Delta variant of the COVID-19 was still the dominant strain of concern in the country.\n\n(NAN)",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nMembers of The Osun Progressives (TOP), a caucus of the All Progressive Congress (APC) loyal to former governor of Osun State and current Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, were on Thursday, chased away from their meeting venue by gunmen who shot sporadically into the air, forcing its members to scamper for safety.\n\nAddressing a press conference after the incident, Chairman of the group, Reverend Adelowo Adebiyi accused Governor Adegboyega Oyetola led-IleriOluwa group of masterminding the attack.\n\nAdebiyi said the attack confirms the alarm he raised on Monday that the governor\u2019s men were out to assassinate TOP\u2019s leaders.\n\nHe wondered why the governor\u2019s camp would be after the lives of fellow party members because of their assiduous efforts at revitalising the party in the state.\n\nAdebiyi said it was high time President Muhammadu Buhari and leaders of security agencies called Governor Oyetola and his men to order, saying that the Thursday\u2019s attack on members of the Hon Rasaq Salinsile led faction of the Osun APC has shown their desperation.\n\nThe former APC Chairman stated: \u201cThe thugs believed to have been sent by the Governor Adegboyega Oyetola\u2019s led IleriOluwa faction of the party invaded the weekly meeting of TOP around 2:10pm today. I was just addressing the caucus when the thugs started shooting. This led to a stampede as APC members scampered for safety. Luckily for us, there were no major casualty as members ran into the main building for safety. But some of our people were wounded.\n\n\u201cWe need to state that officers of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) who usually provide security for the weekly meeting were not on ground. Because of the absence of the NSCDC officers, the IleriOluwa group sent thugs to attack us. One Tesleem Raji, aka Akerele from Ile Esu, Ikoyi, Isokan Local Government of the state sent the thugs that attacked us here. That is the same guy that led the attack on us during the state congress. Today\u2019s attack is coming three days after we raised alarm that the IleriOluwa people have concluded plans to eliminate leaders of TOP and other members of our party.\n\n\u201cI released a statement three days ago that some of our leaders were to be assassinated in the state by the IleriOluwa group, today\u2019s attack bears us witness that they are indeed after us.\n\n\u201cWe need to remind security agencies in the state that they are responsible for the safety of the lives and property of our people. They should not wait until one of us is killed before they act on our petitions and reports. We will officially inform the Commissioner of Police, the AIG Zone XI and the State Commandant of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps on today\u2019s attack.\n\n\u201cThis is a serious concern for all of us in the state. We have been holding weekly meetings for the past four months. We have not attacked anyone. We urge the President to intervene now. Why will the government be using thugs to attack members of the same party openly in the afternoon? On August 16, the same set of people attacked us at the party secretariat. We were arrested and arraigned in court instead of the perpetrators of the attack. But the court set us free. During the state congress, they came to attack us again and two of our members were shot.\n\n\u201cTwo days ago, they attacked some of our members in Ipetumodu, Ife North Local Government during their meeting. Today again, the same things happened to us. We call on President Muhammadu Buhari and the Inspector General of Police to come and see what is happening in Osun.\u201d",

We at the Federal have to wait for the steps taken by the states, and we have to allow the system to work. We can\u2019t impose ideas on them. Federal Government has to wait for the reaction of the states,\u201d the statement quoted Buhari to have said.\n\nOn the recent removal of Nigeria from watchlist of countries violating religious freedom, which Blinken said was \u201cbased on facts,\u201d President Buhari expressed the country\u2019s appreciation, noting that there was freedom of worship in Nigeria, and no one is discriminated against on the basis of his or her faith\n\nHe said education is a priority in the country, \u201cbecause when you educate a people, there are certain levels they will not fall below.\u201d\n\nThe President equally appreciated the United States of America for allowing Nigeria to procure military hardware to fight terrorism in the country, and for the training given to Nigerian military\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s helping us to stabilize the situation in the Northeast, and we\u2019ve made a lot of progress since 2015,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are doing a lot on security, and the people involved appreciate our efforts.\u201d\n\nOn development of democratic ethos, President Buhari said Nigeria has adopted the American model, \u201chook. line, and sinker, with its term limits. Those who have attempted to breach it were disappointed, if not disgraced. You are even lucky if you have two terms. Others try hard, and don\u2019t get it. The American model has been accepted by Nigerians as the best.\u201d\n\nNigeria and her neighbors, the President noted, have been living with the impact of climate change for a while, which has seen the Lake Chad shrink drastically from its original size, and affected the livelihood of about 30 million people in the Lake Chad Basin countries.\n\n\u201cThat is why the youths defy the Sahara Desert and the Mediterranean to attempt emigrating to Europe. Inter basin water transfer is needed to keep the youths at home, and they can resume their lives of farming, fishing, and animal husbandry.\u201d\n\nMr Blinken, who had held a virtual meeting with the Nigerian President earlier in the year said jocularly that it was now good to see him \u201cmask to mask, hoping that we will soon see face to face.\u201d\n\nHe appreciated the contributions of President Buhari to protection of the climate, particularly his presence and contributions at the recent COP26 climate conference held in Glasgow, Scotland.\n\nBlinken said America and Nigeria have diverse challenges, but a common denominator is security, and hoped for better partnerships, \u201cso that the bad guys won\u2019t get the good guys.\u201d\n\nHe described the report of the EndSARS probe panel as \u201cdemocracy in action, stressing that America equally had its own police brutality, and hoping that necessary reforms would be made.",

          "text": "An advocacy group, Housing Development Advocacy Network (HDAN), has commended the Senate on the recent passage of the Real Estate Regulatory Council bill.\n\nAccording to them,when the bill is assented to by President Muhammadu Buhari, it will help sanitize the housing sector in the country and ensure compliance with the best practices as obtainable in developed countries.\n\nIn a statement by HDAN Executive Directort,Mr. Festus Adebayo, the group commended the Senate leadership, the sponsor of the bill, (former Sokoto State governor),Senator Aliyu Magatarkada Wamako for championing the bill.\n\nSpeaking further, he said: \u2018\u2019 We also want to commend the Senate President and the entire member of the Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria for coming together to ensure that the bill sailed through on the floor of the Senate. HDAN President made a particular reference to Professor Akin Mabogunje whom he credited for advocating housing development regulations in Nigeria.\n\nHe noted that the bill, when passed into law will help reverse the negative trend in the country whereby, \u201conce you have money, you can just enter into real estate business.\n\nEven if you don\u2019t have money you can go into the real estate and be scamming people. We are in a situation where nobody is protecting anybody, not even the subscribers are protected.\u201d\n\nHe decried the abuse which pervaded the sector for long where rules are constantly bent, stating that the situation is not the same in other sectors that are regulated, citing the case of pure water production and argued that no one is permitted to operate except with the approval of NAFDAC as a regulatory body.\n\nHDAN Executive Director expressed confidence in the ability of President Muhammadu Buhari to give a speedy assent to the bill with a view to promoting sanity in the sector through relevant regulatory frameworks.\n\nHe stated that his body had gone through the bill and currently \u201cworking assiduously in collaboration with Real Estate Developers Association of Nigeria, REDAN and other professional bodies that are involved, including government agencies, like the EFCC to ensure that the sector is safe and protected for investment.\n\nHe disclosed that the bill was presented at the national assembly two years ago under Rev( surv) Ugochukwu chime and so we are very pleased that the present redan leadership has made their priority. that According to him all professional bodies in Nigeria\u2019s construction industries are allocated responsibilities in the bill.The bill is not aimed at taking any one\u2019s job.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe said: \u201cThis is one thing that Professor Akin Mabogunje who had just celebrated his 90 years birthday fought for several years ago, for the sector to be regulated. I am sure that he will be happy that at last the real estate sector is going to be professionalized and regulated at last.\u201d\n\nHe recalled that the bill in question is not a strange development, as he noted that Lagos State happened to be the first state in the country to regulate the real estate sector .\n\n\u201cThere is today an agency that regulates the flow of transactions and activities in Lagos real estate sector. But we are asking for the improvement of lagos version at the national level that will have the involvement of all the professionals in the construction industry .It had been done in Ghana, Kenya, India and most advanced countries have their regulatory bodies for the real estate and housing business\u201d\n\nHDAN observed that the purpose of the bill is to govern the interplay of the various stakeholders in the industry and expressed delight that the bill states clearly how things should be done ,who should do what in relation to what matter.\n\nThe statement added: \u201cHDAN therefore called on other professionals in the construction and housing industry to support the bill in order to bring an end to rivalry among practitioners in the sector.\u201d\n\nThe body expressed the hope that President Buhari, based on his pedigree as a transparent leader will give the bill a speedy assent to become a law.\n\nThe Housing Development Advocacy Network,(HDAN) is an NGO at the forefront of promoting and championing the development of Housing / construction industry and affordable housing in Nigeria.",

This has led to a rapid deterioration of his sight.\u201d\n\nThe IPOB leader also lamented that he is restricted to meeting with his Counsel in an atmosphere devoid of private discussions and denied perusal of legal documentation his Counsel brings to him for review.\n\nHe further alleged that his lawyers are being by the DSS, stating that Barrister Ejimakor was detained on the 17th July 2021 and interrogated for hours by the DSS when he came to visit Kanu.\n\n\u201cMazi Nnamdi Kanu, who witnessed the detention before being led away was very distressed and alarmed by this incident and he considers it a brazen act of intimidation of his Counsel.\n\n\u201cThat he has, to date, been denied access to the British Consul despite her repeated requests to see him; and on the day of his last court appearance (10th November, 2021), the British Consul who was in Court to observe the proceedings was intimidated by DSS officers, who restricted her from coming close to Mazi Kanu.\u201d\n\nFearing for his life, Kanu disclosed that the DSS has denied his repeated requests for an independent medical examination to determine the extent of damage done to his body by a suspected substance he may have been injected with during his abduction.\n\n\u201cHe has reason to believe that the said injected substance is depleting the potassium content of his body, thus causing him constipation, a feeling of skipped heart beats, palpitations, fatigue, muscle weakness/spasms and numbness.\n\n\u201cThat in the circumstance of the forgoing, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu continues to have a persistent and heightened feeling of portent threat to his overall well-being and safety within the DSS facility where he is currently detained.\u201d Vanguard\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "The detained Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Mazi Nnamdi kanu has cried out that his condition has worsened under the custody of the Department of State Services, DSS, as the agency declined his request for an independent medical examination.\n\nKanu who spoke through his lawyers, Aloy Ejimakor and Ifeanyi Ejofor, stated that despite a Court order, the condition of his detention at the DSS continues to be harsh, degrading and inhumane.\n\nHe lamented that he has solitarily confined to a very tiny cell 23 hours of the day without access to sunlight and any social interactions while any detainee who greets him during the single hour he is allowed outside his cell is promptly put in solitary confinement or transferred to maximum security as a punishment for exchanging mere greetings with him.\n\n\u201cOur Client, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, has instructed us to make the following information public. Despite a Court order to the contrary, the condition of his detention at the DSS headquarters in Abuja continues to be harsh, degrading and inhumane.\n\nThat he is solitarily confined to a very tiny cell 23 hours of the day without access to sunlight and any social interactions whatsoever. He believes that this is aimed at inflicting extreme emotional and mental distress on him and breaking him psychologically. He believes that this is aimed at inflicting extreme emotional and mental distress on him and breaking him psychologically. Because of this, detainees have resorted to avoiding him and exchanging salutations with him, not to talk of any other form of social interactions. That since the Nigerian government extraordinarily renditioned him, he has not been allowed a change of clothing; and his Jewish prayer shawls and other religious materials brought to him by his Counsel were rejected and returned.\n\n\u201cThat the DSS has refused to replace his corrective glasses (lenses) which were smashed to smithereens by agents of the Nigerian government in the process of the violence they unleashed on him while abducting him in Kenya. This has led to a rapid deterioration of his sight.\u201d\n\nThe IPOB leader also lamented that he is restricted to meeting with his Counsel in an atmosphere devoid of private discussions and denied perusal of legal documentation his Counsel brings to him for review.\n\nHe further alleged that his lawyers are being by the DSS, stating that Barrister Ejimakor was detained on the 17th July 2021 and interrogated for hours by the DSS when he came to visit Kanu.\n\n\u201cMazi Nnamdi Kanu, who witnessed the detention before being led away was very distressed and alarmed by this incident and he considers it a brazen act of intimidation of his Counsel.\n\n\u201cThat he has, to date, been denied access to the British Consul despite her repeated requests to see him; and on the day of his last court appearance (10th November, 2021), the British Consul who was in Court to observe the proceedings was intimidated by DSS officers, who restricted her from coming close to Mazi Kanu.\u201d\n\nFearing for his life, Kanu disclosed that the DSS has denied his repeated requests for an independent medical examination to determine the extent of damage done to his body by a suspected substance he may have been injected with during his abduction.\n\n\u201cHe has reason to believe that the said injected substance is depleting the potassium content of his body, thus causing him constipation, a feeling of skipped heart beats, palpitations, fatigue, muscle weakness/spasms and numbness.\n\n\u201cThat in the circumstance of the forgoing, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu continues to have a persistent and heightened feeling of portent threat to his overall well-being and safety within the DSS facility where he is currently detained.\u201d Vanguard\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "Amidst continued shutdown of telecoms services in Katsina state, bandits have resorted to use of Radio Frequency Walkie Talkie Transceivers, Secretary to the State Government (SSG) Mustapha Inuwa has said.\n\nThe SSG stated this Thursday during a media parley at the Government House Katsina.\n\nAt the parley were Commissioner of Police in the state, Sanusi Buba and the Special Adviser to the Governor on Security, Muhammad Ibrahim Katsina.\n\nAt the height of security challenge occasioned by activities of the bandits, the state government, via a Containment Order signed by Governor Aminu Bello Masari, had, among several measures, ordered the shutdown of telecommunications network in 13 local government areas considered the hotspots for banditry.\n\nThere were also outcries from some stakeholders who believed the shutdown had worsened the security situation of the people.\n\nFor instance, the state legislature recently tasked the Masari administration to up its game, saying the telecoms shutdown had left the people at the mercy of the bandits.\n\nSSG speaks in the contrary\n\nSpeaking to the contrary, however, SSG Inuwa said the telecoms ban had achieved the desired results in the state.\n\nWhile some level of successes had been recorded since the measures were put in place, Inuwa said the bandits had devised another means to carry out their acts.\n\nInuwa said: \u201cIn spite of the successes recorded, however, it is worthy to note that since the commencement of the Containment Order, the bandits\u2019 elements across the frontline local government areas have been unrelenting in devising new strategies aimed at circumventing the impact of the Containment Order.\n\n\u201cThe strategies range from attacking motorists/motorcyclists to siphon PMS from fuel tanks, to ransacking communities and coercing villages into sourcing PMS on their behalf. A recent and most worrisome move by the criminals is the observed acquisition of Radio Frequency Walkie Talkie Transceivers by the bandits.\u201d\n\nInuwa, who also chairs the security committee in the state, however, said security agents were on the trail of bandits using the walkie talkies.\n\nCasualties\n\nHe further said 480 suspected bandits were arrested between March and September 2021, 216 under prosecution and 42 others undergoing investigation.\n\nFrom September to date, he said, 244 suspects were arrested with 80 under prosecution and 33 under investigation.\n\nInuwa, who said there was a reduction in bandits\u2019 attacks since the Containment Order, also added that from September to date, 244 suspects were arrested with 33 under investigation and 80 under prosecution.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Containment Order is a child of necessity, and has not been put in place to hurt or cause hardship to the citizens of the state. The driving objective was to arrest the emerging situation that was becoming a threat to peace, order and our collective well being.\u201d\n\nThe SSG also confirmed the killing of 213 people and abduction of over 676 innocent citizens within the period of four months across the state.\n\nHe said: \u201cA total of 475 persons were abducted between July and August while only 201 were abducted between September and October.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, between July and August, 97 armed banditry attacks were staged resulting in 130 deaths while only 56 incidents were recorded between September and October with 83 deaths.\n\n\u201cIncidents of cattle rustling also dropped significantly during the period as 1,347 cows, 345 sheep and 119 goats were stolen between July and August while 676 cows, 109 sheep and 160 goats were rustled between September and October.\u201d\n\nThe SSG, who was silent on the number of rescued victims, said the committee concentrated on the enforcement of Containment Order.\n\n\u201cFrom the 230 various bandits attacked we recorded, only 115 victims were injured, 213 lost their lives in the struggle.\u201d\n\nInuwa appealed to people of the state to give necessary support to the Containment Order by reporting informants and people with suspicious character to security agencies.\n\nHe said the order was adopted collectively by the North-west states to tackle the menace of banditry after series of security operations had failed to produce the desired result.\n\nIllela killings\n\nIn a related development, armed bandits have, in series of attacks, killed 43 people in five communities of Munwadata, Kalmalo, Sarma, Runji Tunbulunkun, and Tafkin Taramniya, all in Illela local government area of Sokoto state.\n\nGovernor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal stated this Thursday when he led members of the state executive security chieftains as well as other top government officials on a condolence visit to the people of Illela, a border town of about 97 kilometers from the state capital.\n\nAccording to report, the marauders had attacked Kalmalo town and some villages near it in the wee hours of Monday at first instance, killing thirteen people.\n\nHowever, at the time of the governor\u2019s visit Wednesday afternoon the toll had risen to 43.\n\nThe report said a village head in one of the five villages was wounded during the night attack.\n\nTambuwal, had during the visit to Illela town told his bereaved audience that: \u201cWe\u2019re here to, on behalf of the government and good people of our dear state, to extend our heartfelt condolences on this unfortunate incident which claimed the lives of many of our citizens.\n\n\u201cThis is not a small occurrence. It is upsetting, this incident really touched us.\u201d\n\nHe, however, commended the local government authorities, monarchs and community leaders for their lawful composition of a volunteer group working in tandem with the security operatives in the area.\n\nThe governor said the state government \u201cwill continue to frown upon the constitution of illegitimate volunteers,\u201d pointing out that \u201cthe joint operations of legitimately constituted volunteers, who work closely with and under the supervision of security agencies, is the appropriate antidote to this crisis.\u201d\n\nHe appealed to the people to remain undaunted by the recent attack, \u201cInstead, it should motivate you all to redouble your efforts, without seeking revenge, in securing your communities.\u201d\n\nThe governor assured them of sustained government assistance \u201cwhenever required\u201d, while praying for the repose of the souls of the deceased.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, pray that God grant them eternal glory and forgive their shortcomings and sins while they were alive. May He also grant their families and relatives the fortitude to bear the losses of those who died just as we besiege Him to grant health and relief to those who sustained injuries and are recuperating at home and in the hospitals.\n\n\u201cWe, again, pray to God to continue to ensure that peace prevails in all our communities and across the country. I, once again, urge you to be patient and prayerful. I am delighted with the communal efforts at cooperation and prayers, led by the monarchs and community leaders here, being offered for the intercession of God in bringing us peace. Please, do not relent. May Allah grant us peace and peaceful coexistence,\u201d he further prayed.\n\nOgun\n\nMeanwhile, the Ogun State House of Assembly Thursday passed a resolution calling on the state government and all security agencies in the state to place a ban on street carnivals and the usage of fireworks during the coming yuletide.\n\nThe move, according to the lawmakers, was to forestall any security breach and also prevent further spread of COVID-19 among residents.\n\nThe passage of the resolution followed an extended debate by lawmakers leading to a motion moved by the Majority Leader, Yusuf Sheriff.\n\nThe motion was seconded by a member representing Ijebu North I State Constituency, Sylvester Abiodun and supported by all the lawmakers at the plenary presided over by Speaker Olakunle Oluomo in Abeokuta.\n\nThe lawmakers who spoke in unison said it was imperative for the state government to consider suspending any form of carnival or street procession which could further affect the security situation in the state, noting that such event organised in the past had resulted in clashes leading to breach of public peace.\n\nPassing the motion, Speaker Oluomo said the lawmakers\u2019 decision was in the best interest of the state, saying the Assembly as an institution would not allow any criminal act under the guise of carnivals, disrupt the relative peace in the state.\n\nHe also said there was need to avoid any act that could further spread COVID-19 among the residents.\n\nHe thereafter directed the Clerk and Head of Legislative Services, Mr. \u2018Deji Adeyemo to convey the Assembly\u2019s resolution to Governor Dapo Abiodun and all security formations.\n\nIn another development, Speaker Oluomo has announced that the Assembly would hold a stakeholders\u2019 forum on \u201cH.B. No. 072/OG/2021- the Ogun State Anti-Corruption Law, 2021- A Bill for a law to Establish the Ogun State Public Complaints and Anti-Corruption Commission Law and for connected purposes\u201d tomorrow, Friday, 19th November, 2021 at the Assembly Complex, Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta.\n\nAccording to him, the public hearing would take place at 10:00am prompt; while all relevant stakeholders are enjoined to be seated by 9.30 am prompt.",

We can\u2019t impose ideas on them. Federal Government has to wait for the reaction of the states.\u201d\n\nOn the recent removal of Nigeria from the watchlist of countries violating religious freedom, which Blinken said was \u201cbased on facts,\u201d Buhari expressed the country\u2019s appreciation, noting that there was freedom of worship in Nigeria, and no one is discriminated against on the basis of his or her faith.\n\nREAD ALSO: President Buhari Signs Climate Change, AMCON (Amendment) Bills Into Law\n\nBuhari Receives US Secretary Of State Blinken\n\nHe said also said education is a priority in the country, \u201cbecause when you educate a people, there are certain levels they will not fall below.\u201d\n\nThe President equally appreciated the US for allowing Nigeria to procure military hardware to fight terrorism in the country, and for the training given to the Nigerian military.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s helping us to stabilize the situation in the Northeast, and we\u2019ve made a lot of progress since 2015,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are doing a lot on security, and the people involved appreciate our efforts.\u201d\n\nOn the development of democratic ethos, President Buhari said Nigeria has adopted the American model, \u201chook, line, and sinker, with its term limits. Those who have attempted to breach it were disappointed, if not disgraced. You are even lucky if you have two terms. Others try hard and don\u2019t get it. The American model has been accepted by Nigerians as the best.\u201d\n\nNigeria and her neighbors, the President noted, have been living with the impact of climate change for a while, which has seen Lake Chad shrink drastically from its original size, and affected the livelihood of about 30 million people in the Lake Chad Basin countries.\n\n\u201cThat is why the youths defy the Sahara Desert and the Mediterranean to attempt emigrating to Europe. Inter-basin water transfer is needed to keep the youths at home, and they can resume their lives of farming, fishing, and animal husbandry,\u201d Buhari added.\n\nMr Blinken, who had held a virtual meeting with the Nigerian President earlier in the year, said jocularly that it was now good to see him \u201cmask to mask, hoping that we will soon see face to face.\u201d\n\nHe appreciated the contributions of President Buhari to the protection of the climate, particularly his presence and contributions at the recent COP26 climate conference held in Glasgow, Scotland.\n\nBlinken said America and Nigeria have diverse challenges, but a common denominator is security, and hoped for better partnerships, \u201cso that the bad guys won\u2019t get the good guys.\u201d\n\nHe described the report of the EndSARS probe panel as \u201cdemocracy in action,\u201d stressing that America equally had its own police brutality, and hoping that necessary reforms would be made.",

All the governors in Nigeria are helpless. And that is why we are saying give us state police,\u201d Ishaku lamented.\n\nHis comments were in response to a recent attack in Taraba by some suspected Ambazonian soldiers from the Republic of Cameroon.\n\nThe soldiers are said to have stormed Manga village in Takum Local Government Area of Taraba State on Wednesday, killing 11 people including a traditional ruler.\n\nTakum Local Government Area is a border community between Taraba State and the Republic of Cameroon.\n\nSpeaker in reaction to the incident, Ishaku said he has complained severally to the Nigerian military, seeking help to secure the border.\n\nThe governor further stated that his pleas have gone unheard for quite a while, leaving the community prone to attacks such as was recently experienced.\n\nAccording to Ishaku, there is little a governor can do in such a case, especially because he does not control the armed forces, neither does he have a state police force specifically put together for the service of the Taraba people.\n\n\u201cIf I have state police, I would have ordered the police. All the governors are helpless, not only Darius Ishaku that is helpless; not only Taraba State that is helpless. Go and ask other governors and tell me any who has a solution to this. We have to depend on Federal might\u201d he explained.\n\nIn forging a way forward, Governor Ishaku called for the military to help man Taraba\u2019s \u2018long-stretch\u2019 border with Cameroon.\n\n\u201cTaraba has one of the longest borders with Cameroon. There is an absolute need that this our boundary must be manned by security agencies. The military, precisely, must man it,\u201d the governor argued.\n\n\u201cBecause they (the separatists) are well armed, they are a separatist group, and when they kill, they run away. So it is not an easy thing, it has to be the military to man the border.\u201d\n\nAfter Wednesday\u2019s attack, the Governor said the military and police have now moved into the attacked community.\n\nHe expressed hopes that fleeing villagers can now return after Nigerian security officials were deployed to the area.",

          "text": "More than two dozen aid workers will go on trial over their role in helping migrants reach Greece between 2016 and 2018 on Thursday.\n\nThe defendants face a raft of charges, including espionage, forgery and the unlawful use of radio frequencies.\n\nHuman rights groups have condemned the trial as being politically motivated and Amnesty International has called the charges \u201cfarcical\u201d.\n\nLesbos, the island at the centre of the migration crisis, will host the trial.\n\nAmong the 24 defendants, 17 of whom are foreign nationals, is Syrian refugee Sarah Mardini, the sister of the Olympic swimmer Yusra Mardini. The siblings came to international attention in 2015 after dragging their refugee boat to safety when the engine failed.\n\nMs Mardini has been barred from entering Greece to defend herself and has been forced to watch the trial from Germany, where she was granted asylum.\n\nProsecutors allege that the aid workers, who were affiliated with a search and rescue group, monitored the Greek Coast Guard\u2019s radio channels and used a vehicle with a fake military licence plates to enter restricted areas on Lesbos.\n\nIf found guilty they could face five-year prison sentences.\n\nSome also remain under investigation for a number of other felonies, including human smuggling, and if convicted could face further sentences of up to 25-years.\n\nSean Binder, an Irish aid worker facing trial, told the Irish broadcaster RT\u00c9: \u201cI am happy to defend myself, I know I did nothing wrong, and we can prove that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m being charged with crimes that I am supposed to have committed a year before I was ever on the island,\u201d he added.\n\nNils Mui\u017enieks, Director of Amnesty International\u2019s European Regional Office, said in a statement: \u201cThe charges they face are farcical and should never have come to trial\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis emblematic case demonstrates how far the Greek authorities will go to deter people from helping refugees and migrants. Stopping rescue operations doesn\u2019t stop people from making dangerous journeys, it simply makes those journeys more perilous,\u201d he added.\n\nThe trial comes as Greece\u2019s conservative government, led by Kyriakos Mitsotakis, has clamped down on human rights groups in an attempt to limit the number of migrants entering the country.\n\nLast year it introduced tougher rules for the operation of dozens international aid groups, which critics say makes it harder to operate in the country.",
