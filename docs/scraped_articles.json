And in a statement released to newsmen in Abuja, the APC deputy spokesman said that Nelson\u2019s death is a big loss to the APC family.\n\nAjaka maintained that the deceased was a generous politician, loyal and dedicated to APC as a governing party, adding that it is a personal loss to him.\n\nHe also paid condolences to the presidential candidate of the APC, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and the Lagos state APC family for the loss.\n\n\u201cNelson stood for unity and was in forefront of championing campaigns that favoured the lives of APC members and the masses. She never gave up on any responsibility. Her contributions to the successes of APC in Lagos state and Nigeria is beyond measure.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn 1999, she joined Alliance for Democracy (AD) and from 1999 to 2003, she served as the Lagos State Commissioner for Women Affairs and Poverty Alleviation during the tenure of Bola Ahmed Tinubu and has served as the Women Leader of Lagos State Chapter of APC and was later made the South West Women Leader of APC.\n\nShe was the only female serving member of the Lagos State Governor\u2019s Advisory Council (GAC).\u201d\n\nAjaka furthet said that Nelson was a remarkable woman that devoted her life to women\u2019s grassroot mobilization, protecting the cause of women, and encouraging women active participation in politics and setting of goals.\u201d\n\n\u201cKemi Nelson was a tireless advocate of women and youth emancipation.

          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Lateef Dada, Osogbo, Ndubuisi Orji, Paul Osuyi, Asaba,Okwe Obi, Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja, Rose Ejembi, Makurdi\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its presidential candidate and former vice president, Atiku Abubakar, have bragged that the victory of Senator Ademola Adeleke, the party\u2019s candidate in the Osun State election, was a reflection of the outcome of 2023 general poll.\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), yesterday, officially declared Adeleke winner of Saturday\u2019s keenly contested governorship poll in Osun State\n\nReturning officer for the election, Prof Oluwatoyin Ogundipe, who is the Vice Chancellor, University of Lagos, said the PDP candidate polled a total of 403,371 votes to defeat the sitting governor, Gboyega Oyetola, of the All Progressives Congress (APC), who scored a total of 375,027 votes. Adeleke won with a margin of 28,344 votes. He swept 17 of the 30 local government areas of the state, while Oyetola topped in 13 local governments. But the duo had narrow winning margins in majority of the local government areas they won, respectively.\n\nThe candidate of the Action Democratic Party (ADP), Kehinde Atanda, who scored 10,104 votes came a distant third, while the Accord candidate, Dr. Akin Ogunbiyi came fourth with 4,515 votes. A former deputy speaker of the House of Representatives, Yussuf Lasun, of Labour Party (LP) came fifth with 2,729 votes. A total of 15 political parties fielded candidates for the election.\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party ( PDP), in its reaction, said the victory of its candidate in the Osun governorship poll, was a referendum on the APC.\n\nPDP\u2019s national chairman, Iyorchia Ayu, in a statement, yesterday, said the people of Osun has spoken through the governorship poll.\n\nAyu expressed confidence that the rest of the country would also reject the APC in the 2023 polls.\n\nThe PDP leader said with the Osun victory, the party\u2019s next move is to regain the presidency in the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cThis election was a referendum on the disastrous APC stewardship, and proves conclusively that Nigerians want PDP back. And, indeed, PDP is coming!\u201d\n\nAyu alleged that the Osun State government did everything it could to frustrate the opposition party, prior to last weekend\u2019s election.\n\n\u201cThis included denying us the use of any public facility in the state capital for our mega-rally. We had to use the party\u2019s state secretariat. As it were, we couldn\u2019t have access to the stadium, but we had access to the people\u2019s hearts, loyalty and votes. The convincing win of 403, 371 against governor Oyetola\u2019s 375, 027 is ample proof of that.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Atiku in his congratulatory message to the governor-elect titled, \u2018The ship of hope is already at the harbour\u2019, said the referendum on the administration of the APC had commenced with the verdict of the people of Osun State in electing Senator Adeleke.\n\nThe former vice president added that the ship of hope was at the harbour under the umbrella of the PDP, adding that the party would intensify the work to ensure the uproot of vestiges of bad governance and false hopes towards the 2023 election.\n\n\u201cIt is inconceivable that Nigerians will reward the APC for the failings of the last seven years. And in a state like Osun, for example, its been a long time since the people last felt the effect of good governance\u2026The Imole (light) that has started to shine from Osun shall soon have a national coverage. One more good thing about the victory in Osun is that it has provided a catalyst for the PDP to see the opportunity when the party works together in unity,\u201d the former VP said.\n\nDelta State Governor and vice presidential candidate of the PDP, Ifeanyi Okowa, said the victory of Senator Ademola Adeleke in Saturday\u2019s governorship election in Osun State was a signpost of the determination of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) to rescue Nigeria in next year\u2019s general elections.\n\nOkowa said Adeleke\u2019s victory was the beginning of the rescue mission of Nigeria by his party.\n\nThe governor, in a congratulatory statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Olisa Ifeajika, described the election of Adeleke as \u201cthe affirmation of Osun people\u2019s will\u201d and called on Nigerians to always stand for good leaders with the interest of the people at heart.",

          "text": "By Adewale Sanyaolu\n\nStrong indications that fuel markets may have settled for an unofficial deregulation with majority of filling stations selling Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), popularly called petrol above the officially approved pump price of N165 per litre. Their decision may not be unconnected with what they termed Nigeria\u2019s harsh economic realities which have made sale of petrol at the official retail price of N165 per litre unrealistic.\n\nFindings by Daily Sun across some filling stations in Lagos showed that majority of the filling stations have now adopted different price models.\n\nWhile some filling stations have changed the price on their meters to reflect the current selling prices, others have left theirs to show the approved retail price of N165 per litre only to dispense at above the displayed price.\n\nFor instance, the Mobil filling station on Agidingbi sold a litre of petrol at N170 per litre on Friday and that was evidently displayed on their meters.\n\nThe development was also the same at Enyo filling station at Chisco bus stop, in Lekki, which now sells for N170 per litre, with Eterna filling station at Jankade bus stop Lekki, selling at N180per litre. Also Mobil Filing station, by Osapa London, Lekki sold at selling at N170 per litre.\n\nAll the above three filling stations in Lekki have had the new prices reflected on their meters while the big board which normally have their prices displayed for motorists to see have equally been changed.\n\nAs at yesterday morning (Sunday), the Mobil filling station before Otedola bridge sold at N170 per litre. This was boldly written on their overhead board for everyone to see and equally displayed on their meters. Also, the Petrocam filling station in Ejigbo, Lagos sold at N177 per litre last Thursday.\n\nAs at last Friday, the Mobil filling station on Charity road in Abule-Egba, sold a litre of petrol at N180 per litre but displayed N165 on its meters, Conoil on Dayo Adeniji street is selling at N170 per litre , Northwest Filling station in Anthony is also selling at N170 per litre while Seabird Vivid on Barracks-Command road in Ipaja sold at N195 per litre.\n\nHowever, the situation was different at the Oando filling station in Omole Estate at Saturday as it sold a litre of petrol at the approved retail price of N165 per litre. The unofficial deregulation stand of fuel retailers confirms the posture of the Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria(MOMAN) which last week, said the regulated N165 pump price for petrol, was no longer realistic.\n\nChairman, MOMAN, Mr. Olumide Adeosun, who spoke Wednesday during a virtual consumer protection workshop for Oil Marketers by the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) had said the current retail price was no longer realistic.\n\nAdeosun, who was reacting to the lingering fuel scarcity across the country, blamed the situation on the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine which had disrupted global energy supply distribution.\n\nThe MOMAN chairman likened the current situation to the COVID-19 pandemic era with some countries moving to halt exportation of petrol in favour of their own national energy securities.\n\nHe maintained that it would be difficult to enforce any kind of price control mechanism on marketers who had to slightly adjust their prices based on how much they bought products from the depots.\n\nThe MOMAN chairman said the way forward was a phased deregulation of PMS by the Federal Government to reduce the shock on consumers.\n\nAdeosun said the gradual price deregulation should be followed with targeted palliatives in the areas of transportation and agricultural subsidies to the public to ease implementation.\n\nHe said the huge amount spent on petrol subsidy over the years would have been deployed to other critical areas that could have reduced the impact of the current energy crisis on Nigerians.\n\nAdeosun empathised with Nigerians and the Federal Government who had been bearing the huge subsidy cost, adding that the government was working assiduously to mitigate the effects of the situation on the economy.\n\nHe said as the nation was moving towards full deregulation of the downstream petroleum sector, MOMAN would continue to collaborate with the FCCPC to ensure the protection of the rights of consumers.",
          "summary": "By Adewale SanyaoluStrong indications that fuel markets may have settled for an unofficial deregulation with majority of filling stations selling Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), popularly called petrol above the officially approved pump price of N165 per litre.\nFindings by Daily Sun across some filling stations in Lagos showed that majority of the filling stations have now adopted different price models.\nAs at yesterday morning (Sunday), the Mobil filling station before Otedola bridge sold at N170 per litre.\nAlso, the Petrocam filling station in Ejigbo, Lagos sold at N177 per litre last Thursday.\nThe unofficial deregulation stand of fuel retailers confirms the posture of the Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria(MOMAN) which last week, said the regulated N165 pump price for petrol, was no longer realistic.",

I am aware of it but I can\u2019t give the full account of it because the report I have is still sketchy.\u201d\n\nBut the source said the terrorists ransacked the residence of one Usman Abdullahi Yarima and abducted his two wives and three other members of the family before moving to Abdulraziz Lawal\u2019s house where they also kidnapped his two wives and two other relatives.\n\nHe added that the husbands of the abducted housewives who were overpowered by the motorcycle-riding terrorists, fled for safety which led to the abduction of the victims.\n\nAccording to the source, \u201cThe terrorists attacked the Shema quarters in large numbers around 11:30pm yesterday (Sunday) and abducted nine people despite a heavy downpour that we witnessed here yesterday.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey broke into the house of one Usman Abdullahi Yerima and abducted his two wives and three other family members in the compound. They later moved into the house of one Abdulraziz Lawal and kidnapped his two wives and two other relatives.\n\n\u201cThe terrorists operated from 11:30pm to 2am before some police officers came. You know it was raining seriously during that time, so all efforts we made to prevent the attackers from going with the victims proved abortive.\u201d\n\nHowever, Isah, while confirming the incident, said the Dutsin-Ma Armoured Personnel Carrier vehicles and some police officers were drafted to the scene of the incident and engaged the terrorists in a gun duel.\n\nHe, however, debunked reports that the terrorists operated from 11:30pm to 2am, saying: \u201cWe got that report around 11pm but for them to have operated up to 2am, that one I cannot say is true.\u201d",

Our own interest lies here.\n\n\u201cAny other incident here, we will ask our people to get guns to protect themselves. We will even get guns for our people to protect themselves. So, you want me to stay inside my house and someone will come and kill me there.\n\n\u201cIf we are pushed to the wall, we will also encourage our people to get guns. We are talking to our traditional rulers to get us the traditional powers. I am begging you, nobody, state, the country can continue to witness this kind of insecurity.\n\n\u201cPeople will be on motorbikes and attempt to attack planes at Airport. How did they come in? Are there no people manning the place? What a country where you can\u2019t get a plane, or train to travel and you dare not travel by road.\n\n\u201cBandits save their people from the government and the government can\u2019t save its people from bandits.\n\n\u201cUp till today, not all Chibok girls, now women, have come back.

In the Osun governorship election, we were shy of two million registered voters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThese are stand alone elections. For the Ekiti election, we utilised the service of the Nigerian Air force and they flew the materials into Akure airport. We did the same thing with the Osun election, and we moved the materials to our state offices.\n\n\u201cBut for the 2023 general election, we are going to have over 95 million ballot papers printed for the presidential election. Over 95 million will be printed for the senatorial election; over 95 million papers will be printed for the house of representatives election. Then it goes down.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a huge logistics nightmare. What we intend to do going forward since there are issues with keeping our materials with CBN, we have not had enough opportunity to sit down with the Central Bank to review the entire issue surrounding our moving our material with the Nigerian Air force.\n\n\u201cWe are definitely going to do that. If at the end of the day, we are not satisfied with the arrangement then we are going to look for a new logistics pathway of how to manage logistics during the 2023 elections. But no decision has been made.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen you have to move materials to 36 states of the federation and the capital territory, it\u2019s a completely different ball game.\n\n\u201cWhat we did in Ekiti and Osun in terms of the general election will not be sustainable. We need to look for a complete logistics pathway of how to deal with this particular problem.\u201d",

          "title": "The leading African tech moves from June 2022",
          "text": "We\u2019re halfway through the year, and quite a number of exciting things have happened in Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s $53.4 mobile money fraud lawsuit and Kune\u2019s shutdown in Kenya, to big acquisitions across North Africa, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves from June.\n\nIn June 2022, African startups made 36 fully disclosed* raises totalling $426,280,000 million. This amount is a 2.4% decrease from May 2022\u2019s $437,100,000.\n\nThis means that in the first half of 2022 (H1 2022), African startups raised a whopping $2,787,523,000, a 134.25% increase from the $1.19 billion raised in H1 2021.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors in June are fintech, energytech, and mobility/logistics. Fintech startups raised $305,430,000. (71.7%), energytech startups raised $35,700,000 (8.4%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $32,700,000 (7.7%).\n\nPer region, North Africa led with $173,300,000 of the funding, with fintech MNT-Halan\u2019s $150 million at the helm. South Africa came a close second with $127,500,000, while West and East Africa followed with $79,430,000 and $46,050,000 respectively.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals in June are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in June 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y Combinator.\n\nLess than 2 months after the launch of its mobile money payments service bank (MoMo PSB) in Nigeria, telco MTN in June reportedly took 18 Nigerian banks to court over a $53.7 million fraud allegation.\n\nAccording to the telco, the fraud was committed over a total of 700,000 transactions, over a one-month period, and the amount was transferred in error to 8,000 accounts.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest unicorn, Flutterwave, made some pretty important hires last month.\n\n\n\nFormer managing director at Goldman Sachs, Gurbhej Dhillon, joined the fintech startup as chief technical officer (CTO) while former vice president of American Express, Oneal Bhambani, also joined the company as chief financial officer (CFO).\n\nIt\u2019s no news that about 70% of startups fail at the pre-seed or seed stage, and Kenyan food delivery service Kune\u2019s shutdown came as little surprise to Kenyans.\n\nLess than a year after raising $1 million to solve a problem many Kenyans believe does not exist, Kune shut down in June after founder Robin Reecht announced on LinkedIn that they had run out of money.\n\nPiggyTech, parent company of Nigeria-based fintech PiggyVest, pocketed a mobile money (MOMO) license in June.\n\nPiggyTech also rebranded its payment app from Abeg to PocketApp. The licence will help the startup transition PocketApp from a payment app to a social commerce app that supports online merchants in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria may have lower mobile money usage compared to Kenya, Uganda or even Ghana, but that may soon change.\n\nIn more Nigerian mobile money news from June, telecom giant Airtel also launched its own payments service bank (PSB), SmartCash PSB. With its PSB license, Airtel can provide the 55% of Nigerians who don\u2019t have bank accounts access to SmartCash PSB.\n\nAbout 15,900 tech workers from startups across the globe were laid off in June 2022.\n\nIn Africa, Egypt- and Dubai-based healthtech startup, Vezeeta, laid off about 10% of its staff. Its LinkedIn profile says it has 500 staff, so about 50 workers must have been laid off.\n\nThis news comes a month after another Egypt- and Dubai-based startup, Swvl, laid off 32% of its workforce.\n\nIn big news about acquisitions, 3 happened in June 2022.\n\nFirst, MFS Africa announced plans to acquire US-based payments software company Global Technology Partners (GTP) in a $34 million deal.\n\nThen Apetito, a Cairo-based on-demand grocery retail business announced the acquisition of Lamma, a similar startup, to help its expansion to Morocco, Tunisia, and West Africa.\n\nFinally, Nigeria\u2019s Access Bank announced its second acquisition in Kenya. It\u2019s reportedly aiming to buy Sidian Bank for $36.7 million (Ksh 4.3 billion).\n\nIn June, Kenya\u2019s parliament passed the ICT Practitioners\u2019 Bill which requires all techies in Kenya to register and pay tax before they can work in the country.\n\nFortunately, President Uhuru Kenyatta rejected the bill stating that it was \u201cimpractical and counterproductive\u201d.\n\nIn more news about Kenyan legislations, the Kenyan government made another move to regulate its digital lending space.\n\nThe government announced plans to introduce a 20% excise tax on all fees charged by all digital lenders.\n\nOther than Flutterwave\u2019s, several other important hires were announced in June.\n\nMara, a pan\u2013African crypto exchange platform, appointed ex-Apple executive Susan Younis as its chief marketing officer (CMO).\n\nEloho Omame, co-founder and General Partner at FirstCheck Africa, joined TLcom Capital as a partner.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your network on Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Two fintech executives and a manager at a US-based money transfer company have been sentenced to a combined 8 years in US federal prison.\n\nThe firm, Ping Express, admitted in US district court filings that it broke money laundering rules after it transferred $167 million out of the US. One hundred and sixty million dollars of that money was sent to Nigeria over a period of 3 years, some of which were proceeds from online romance scams.\n\nAccording to a statement released by US Attorney for the Northern District of Texas, Chad E. Meacham, the firm admitted it failed to maintain an effective anti-money laundering programme and operated without a licence in at least 5 US states.\n\nPing Express CEO Anslem Oshionebo, 45, and COO Opeyemi Ode, 43, both recently received 27-month prison sentences, and the company\u2019s business manager, Aleoghena Okhumale, received a 42-month prison sentence for intentionally transferring criminal proceeds.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Oshionebo, a former senior manager at PwC, said in an email that he did not have the resources to continue fighting the case and \u201chistory will be the best judge\u201d. On his part, COO Odeyale claimed the case against him had \u201cgross violations\u201d.\n\nAccording to the US Department of Justice (DoJ), Ping\u2019s anti-money laundering policy claimed it limited first-time customer transactions to $499, daily transactions to $3,000, and monthly transactions to $4,500. The company admitted in court filings that it \u201callowed more than 1,500 customers to violate these rules. In one instance, Ping allowed a customer to remit more than $80,000 in a single month\u201417 times more than the purported limit,\u201d read part of the statement.\n\nPing Express also admitted it failed to seek sufficient details about the sources or purposes of the funds it helped to transmit, or the customers initiating the transmissions. By law, the company was supposed to report any suspicious transactions to regulators. But according to the company\u2019s court filings, it failed to make a single anti-money laundering report in 3 years of operation.\n\nAccording to DoJ statements, Collins Orogun, one of Ping\u2019s top customers and a co-defendant in the case, admitted to receiving a fee for laundering money for \u201cromance scam\u201d fraudsters and other criminals. Over a period of 2 years, the DoJ says he received more than $1.3 million in cash, cashier\u2019s cheques, and wires into several US bank accounts he controlled, and then quickly moved more than $1 million of the funds to Africa through Ping.\n\nIn one incident, an Indiana woman wired $15,000 to \u201cCarson Jacks\u201d, a putative oil roughneck in the Gulf of Mexico she fell in love with online, after he claimed to have malaria. Another Indiana woman claimed to have fallen in love online with an Irish ship captain named \u201cThomas Ken\u201d and wired him $6,300 to fix his ship. Orogun facilitated both payments through Ping.\n\nOrogun now faces up to 20 years in federal prison when sentenced on January 23, 2023.\n\nPing Express itself faces up to 5 years of probation and a $500,000 fine.\n\nPing COO Odeyale also founded a UK-registered electronic money firm, Payzen Limited, formerly Clicks FX Limited in 2013. In December 2020, about 10 months after he was formally charged by US DoJ officials for failing to maintain an effective AML programme and operating without a licence, he relinquished his controlling stake in Payzen. The UK business was not mentioned in the US case, but filings on the UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) website show that Payzen also trades as Ping Express. Per Bloomberg, the current controlling shareholder of Payzen, Adekanmi Adedire, said that his company is \u201cunrelated\u201d to Ping Express, which is a \u201ctotally different entity\u201d. However, Payzen\u2019s website on the FCA\u2019s online database is still listed as ping-express.com.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Earlier on Friday, many African fintech startups offering virtual dollar card services sent emails to their customers stating that their virtual card service will be unavailable indefinitely starting Saturday, July 16, 2022. Virtual cards are digital replicas of physical bank cards. They are created and stored within digital virtual wallets.\n\nAn email sent to Barter customers by Nigerian-born unicorn Flutterwave read, \u201c\u2026effective Sunday, 17th July 2022, all our Virtual Dollar cards will be unavailable for any transactions and purchases.\u201d The payments giant attributed the reason for this suspension to \u201can update from the company\u2019s card partner\u201d. Barter is a Flutterwave consumer-facing virtual card platform that launched in early 2017.\n\nThis announcement by Flutterwave is bound to affect many other startups who use the company\u2019s white-labeled virtual card service to issue virtual cards to their customers.\n\nOther fintech startups including crypto exchange Busha, Rwanda-headquartered Payday, and Ugandan Eversend also issued similar notices.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear which \u201ccard partner\u201d Flutterwave and the other fintech startups are referring to, but these platforms have issued virtual cards powered by MasterCard and Visa\u2014two leading global card issuers. TechCabal is yet to confirm what exactly happened that led the \u201ccard partner\u201d to take this decision.\n\nIndividuals and businesses in Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem affected by the unexpected notifications went on social media to complain about the widespread suspension of virtual card services.\n\n\u201cIt affects us in a big way because all our Facebook ads are connected to our Barter virtual card,\u201d Douglas Kenydson CEO Selar said. \u201cOur Amazon web services (AWS) plan is also connected, and you can\u2019t even afford to miss one payment, or else they\u2019ll take you off.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about his other options, Kendyson expressed uncertainty about switching to existing virtual cards by Nigerian banks. He complained about the hassle of changing dollars and potentially dealing with failed card payments.\n\nKendyson\u2019s best alternative is to turn to the virtual card services of Mercury, a San Francisco-based digital bank for startups, that had restricted tens of African startups\u2019 accounts in March.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good that this happened in the middle of the month so that whatever payment you need to make, make it,\u201d Kendyson said.\n\nIn the midst of the widespread announcement, startups like Bitmama and Mono took the opportunity to announce that their virtual card services are still up, a reminder that not all fintech startups were affected.\n\nBest in email from @bitmamaexchange \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "title": "Meet Burna Boy's monitor engineer, Precious Tawo as he takes us on his journey into sound engineering",
          "text": "Today\u2019s guest on Everyday People is someone whose magic you\u2019ve probably experienced at any Burna Boy, Wizkid, or Fireboy DML\u2019s concerts. Without further ado, let\u2019s meet Precious Tawo, freelance sound engineer and production manager. He has worked with firms like Google, IBM, and MultiChoice, and is a die-hard perfectionist, perhaps in recovery. He also runs Decibelz Production Limited, a one-stop-shop for all your audio rental needs.\n\nThere\u2019s this saying my sister made all of us get used to, which is still on my email address now:\n\nGood, better, best.\n\nI will never rest,\n\nUntil my good is better\n\nAnd my better best\n\nWe grew up singing that. We always lived by that mantra.\n\nSo I kept on putting my best into what I was doing. Everybody was interested in sitting on the console, but I was interested in knowing the whole craft.\n\nOn the 20th day [of the Calabar festival], we were doing a sound check in the stadium for the band, and my boss was not on the stage.\n\nSo he said, \u201cPrecious, please go to the console in front and mute the whole Front of House.\u201d\n\nFront of House is basically the mix the engineer mixes for the audience. So I ran there and quickly muted it. And he was shocked. Because he knew that at this point, he had not shown me anything that concerned the board.\n\n\u201cHow did you know how to mute the board?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been reading.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou this boy! You are a Puma!\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know how they say it in Yoruba, but he called me Puma because he says I jump. At the end of the festival, I became the first trainee to join the main crew in less than three weeks. I was paid \u20a6230,000 ($1,403)*, which was the highest [amount of] money I had ever received.\n\nPrecious Tawo\u2019s journey into sound engineering\n\nPrecious Tawo\n\nI didn\u2019t choose the path; the path chose me. So sometime after I finished secondary school, I wanted to study marine engineering real bad because I had friends in the marine space.\n\nI even had to wait one year at home for the entrance exam period. And I even went as far as Ibadan [Oyo State, Nigeria] to write for Polaris Marine Academy entrance exam. Then I went to the Maritime Academy in Oron to write the exam.\n\nFortunately, I got admission into the Maritime Academy, Oron, but before it came out, I was already working as a facility manager in a hotel in Calabar [Cross River State, Nigeria] because I just wanted to while away time.\n\nI\u2019m not an idle person. And then I\u2019ve always been someone that\u2019s been independent, and I wanted my little stipend. I got to work in a hotel thanks to my dad\u2019s South African friend \u2014 the manager \u2014 who gave me a job as one of the facility guys.\n\nBecause of how fast I was and everything, I was transferred from the hotel to the event centre, where I worked for over six months. And this was when I wrote the Polaris entrance exam. As at November, I knew full well that my time there was done because I know when it\u2019s time for me to leave somewhere.\n\nI don\u2019t need to pray about it; I feel it in my tummy that it\u2019s time to go, and I leave without a plan, but I always have something all worked out later on. So I felt it was time to leave.\n\nAnd in 2013, the Calabar Festival was very popular. This was something that we normally went to the stadium to watch every December and wish that we were on stage or part of the crew.\n\nAt this point, I had no audio background. The only knowledge I had about audio came in November [2013] when we had the Beer Festival in 520 [Hotel, Calabar], and they wanted to rent equipment worth about \u20a65,000,000 ($31,645)**.\n\nI made the company give me \u20a6700,000 ($4,430)** to buy some equipment, and I was like, \u201cI am gonna make this work.\u201d\n\nAnd I did DJ for the Beer Festival with Virtual DJ on my laptop and saved them over \u20a63,000,000 ($18,987)**. That\u2019s the only thing I knew about audio, which was basically from YouTube; plug this here, plug this there, turn this here, turn this there.\n\nWorking at The Voice in 2021\n\nSo on November 25, 2013, I resigned and told my dad that I would like to work with the crew for the Calabar Festival because he had his friend there.\n\nMy dad was an immigration officer in the Tourism Bureau, so he sorted out the passports for most foreigners working in Calabar. So he had relationships with these guys.\n\nThe production manager then was one of his friends, and he told him his son was interested in working with the guys for the December festival.\n\nI heard they were paying them \u20a6200,000 ($1,255)***. And how much was I earning at my place of work? It was just \u20a618,000 ($113)*** initially, then it went up to \u20a625,000 ($156)***. If I could make \u20a6200,000 a month, it\u2019d actually be better than what I was making in a year or close to what I made in a year if I stayed at the event centre.\n\nI planned to join them only for that month and then use the \u20a6200,000 to start school when results come out in January or February.\n\nOn the first day, I was told to go to the Governor\u2019s office for the interview. I dressed in my nicely starched shirt and trousers, and a nice pair of shoes.\n\nOnly for me to walk into the office and they were like, \u201cOh, you are the Precious. Okay, no problem. Hop into the Hilux; let\u2019s go to the warehouse and show you around.\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I going to change?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no. Just come.\u201d\n\nWhen I arrived, they were loading trucks to move the equipment to the studio. This was the 28th of November. And when I got there, I had this whole \u201cbig boy\u201d thingy going on, so seeing boys loading trucks, I was like, \u201cNah, that\u2019s not what I came for; I came for the cool stuff.\u201d\n\nSo they asked me what I wanted to do, and I said, \u201cThe sound department,\u201d because I really loved the whole sound thing. When you went to the Festival, you could hear the speakers pumping from miles away, and I really wanted to be a part of that.\n\nPlus, I had just finished the Beer Festival and wanted something higher than I\u2019d experienced. They introduced me to Aigbovosa Giwa-Osagie, my boss. They took me around and showed me speakers I\u2019d never seen before up close.\n\nThen they introduced me to another person who would be my head.\n\nI was like, \u201cOkay, cool. I\u2019ll resume tomorrow. Nice meeting you guys.\u201d\n\nNext thing, \u201cNo o!. You are resuming now and joining them to load that truck.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, no problem. Easy thing,\u201d I told him.\n\nLuckily, I had a singlet and a pair of jeans in my bag because I was supposed to go somewhere from there. Nice pair of jeans o!\n\nWizkid\u2019s concert\n\nSo, I started loading with the guys. The equipment was very heavy, and there I was, not used to carrying heavy things, seeing young people like me doing it, and told myself I could too.\n\nWe finished loading four trucks after almost four hours and headed to the venue for the Festival\u2019s first event. And I was told to jump into the back of the truck because the Hilux was full.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: senior crew sits in the Hilux, junior crew at the back, and trainees like me sit on the equipment inside the 40-foot truck like the one used to convey cows.\n\nAt first, I was like no way, especially since Calabar is such a small place, but I eventually jumped in. Part of the price you have to pay, you know. At this point, my jeans were gone, and my singlet was like rags.\n\nWe got there, and my boss walked up to me and asked me what audio background I had. And I told him I had none, but the only thing I knew was the entry stuff, but I was willing to learn.\n\nSo when we started setting up, he asked me to go and get the 10 mm ep5 cable. In my head, I was supposed to go and see a cable labelled 10mm ep5.\n\nHe pointed in a direction of over 65 open cases, so I went there straight, and for like 40 minutes, I was searching for the ep5 cable, and I didn\u2019t even know what I was looking for. And then I couldn\u2019t even ask because the way he said it, it was like I was supposed to know the cable.\n\nSo I did not ask, and I didn\u2019t want to look small. After 40 minutes, I went back to him.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t find the cable.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I see it, what should I do to you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you want to do, but I can\u2019t find the cable in the box.\u201d\n\nAnd then he asked another guy that had been there for like four years to get the cable for him and take me and show me the cable.\n\nThis guy just opened the case, stretched his hand, and picked up the cable.\n\nMixing in a studio.\n\nYo! It was super embarrassing. And I didn\u2019t like the way everyone was laughing and everything. So I told myself that I was going to know everything in the company, how it works, and I was going to know all their needs.\n\nSo that night, I started downloading the PDF files for the equipment manuals and spent another hour downloading more when I got home at 3:00 a.m. before I slept.\n\nThe next night, since I was just a trainee, I sat in one corner with all the loud music and was just reading stuff, checking stuff, and going behind the Front of House to peep and see what they were doing even though it looked like they were running a spaceship.\n\nAfter the Festival, my boss gave me the opportunity to go to an event in Lagos for IBM computers. Then I also did Love Like a Movie by Darey Art Alade in February 2014, the outdoor version with Kelly Rowland.\n\nLong story short, I kept on growing, going from event to event. I\u2019m a sucker for information, always trying to keep myself updated. People were recommending me because no matter how good you are, you need people to recommend you.\n\nOn February 20 [2014], my mom called me to tell me that the result for the Academy was out, and I passed. My name was announced on NTA [a state-owned broadcasting station]. But, I had no plans to go to school anymore.\n\nThat February, I was also offered a position with the company, but my boss advised me not to take it.\n\nHe said, \u201cEvery week and every day, experts fly in from South Africa and the United States or wherever to come and work in Nigeria. And if you are good at what you do, they\u2019ll fly you from whatever hole you are in to come and do an event.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve worked with different companies and been exposed to various equipment and clients.\n\nAnd I will not put this achievement on one company. If I was working with one company, I\u2019d be stuck with their clients and the kind of events they do. I learn from everybody, and I also like the way I\u2019m being treated like the golden egg.\n\nI love my job. I\u2019ve done stuff for Google, Amazon, IBM, Airtel, MTN, MultiChoice, and The Voice. Presently I\u2019m Burna Boy\u2019s monitor engineer and Fireboy\u2019s Front of House engineer. I\u2019ve mixed for Wizkid\u2019s December concerts, Cardi B, and Davido; any big artiste really.\n\nLearning from mistakes\n\nMixing at Burna Boy\u2019s Dakar concert in 2022\n\nSometime in 2015, we had an event in Eko Atlantic; it was supposed to be the launch for Majestic Voyage and ten minutes before the show, we did the sound check. Everything was sounding all right and I was mixing monitors.\n\nFive minutes to the show, I tapped my screen and it was frozen. I tried restarting the console, but nothing. That meant every artiste who climbed that stage was not going to hear jack!\n\nI felt like the ground should open for me to enter. We tried everything and eventually had to plug my monitors into my boss\u2019 equipment. By this time, the first artiste, Yemi Sax, was already on stage. I had already explained to him and everything but the first three minutes of the show were hell.\n\nI somehow survived the performance and my boss stabilised everything and that\u2019s how we ran the show. Another moment was when I was doing a show at Calabar Cultural Centre, and then we had power issues in the middle of the show and the console went off.\n\nThe show was cancelled and they had to fix another date. I spent four years trying to correct that mistake. I was hard on myself for four years. I\u2019m a perfectionist so I like to give 110%. Eventually, I had to accept that every engineer has bad days.\n\nGiving back\n\nIn line with what I\u2019ve learnt over the years, I decided to try and pass on this knowledge because I found out that, at the end of the day, we have to leave a legacy.\n\nIt\u2019s not just about money to me, my job is like my life right now. And I\u2019ve seen that many engineers have come and gone but there\u2019s nothing anybody can point to that they made. And so I started sharing knowledge at every opportunity I got. If I went to an event, I\u2019d teach the in-house engineer things I knew they would need if they asked politely, of course.\n\nI run a clinic for engineers, although I haven\u2019t done it since 2019. I also have some people I mentor, all so I can give back.\n\n*Average dollar to naira to rates in February 2014.\n\n**Dollar to naira rate in November 2013.\n\n***Average dollar to naira rates in 2013.",

          "title": "How bureaux de change aid bank fraud in Nigeria",
          "text": "Officers investigating bank fraud and other financial crimes in the country are worried over the principal role bureaux de change (BDCs) in the country play in supporting bank fraud and in the laundering of illicit proceeds.\n\nEarlier this year, billions of naira were stolen from one of the commercial banks in the country by fraudsters who hacked the account of the country\u2019s major telecommunications company (telco).\n\nInvestigations by BusinessDay revealed that the monies were moved from the account of the telco into predetermined private accounts set up within the bank, from which they were then evacuated using primed ATM cards in other banks. These accounts, BusinessDay found out, were set up within the bank because the account of the telco did not allow for interbank transfer.\n\nThe bank, part of a financial services holding company headquartered in Lagos, had its system, including its main server compromised by the hackers who then hewed off about N10 billion from the telco\u2019s account into a dozen arranged accounts within the bank. To do this, the hackers had modified the limits on transfers from a dozen accounts to unlimited transfers and were then able to relocate the monies from the funded accounts in the compromised bank to hundreds of accounts in different banks across the country.\n\nThe bulk of the funds was transferred by the fraudsters into the accounts of dozens of BDC operators in Lagos, Abuja, Ibadan and Kano to procure mainly the United States dollar and other foreign currencies.\n\nDefined by the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN) Revised Operational Guidelines for Bureaux De Change in Nigeria 2015 as a company that is licensed to carry on small-scale foreign exchange business in Nigeria and whose sole object is the carrying on of such business on a stand-alone basis, BDCs have become the major suppliers of foreign currencies to individuals and small businesses.\n\n\u201cThe long processes, complicated forms, and poor service quality from the commercial banks created huge opportunities for the BDCs in Nigeria,\u201d a 2020 Stears report said.\n\nAnti-money laundering regulations state that every BDC keeps proper registers and records of all transactions for transparency and compliance with Anti-Money Laundering Provisions, CBN guidelines, circulars, or directives. Furthermore, the arrival amount sold to or bought from a customer should be issued by a BDC through a machine list or receipts.\n\nMost BDCs do not adhere to these rules and are hardly sanctioned by the CBN.\n\n\u201cBDCs have become essential to major bank frauds in the country,\u201d a senior official at the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), with long years of experience investigating bank frauds and financial crimes, told BusinessDay.\n\nThe official added: \u201cWe have found out that it is difficult if not impossible for hackers to steal banks\u2019 customers\u2019 monies on an industrial scale which they do without the support of BDCs.\n\n\u201cThey can only evacuate huge amounts of monies out of the system using BDCs because if they have to use ATM cards only, they would not be able to get a tenth of what they get using BDCs.\u201d\n\nAn earlier investigative report by BusinessDay showed that BDCs have become indispensable partners with fraudsters in major bank fraud operations. While the BDC operators do not originate any fraud operation, they serve as the most credible and practicable instruments for evacuating and laundering the scores of billions of naira hacked out of the banks every year.\n\nIn July last year, Godwin Emefiele, the CBN governor, announced that the top bank would no longer approve BDC licence applications and would also stop providing forex to the existing licensed ones.\n\nThe decision, he said, was premised on the Monetary Policy Committee\u2019s observation of how BDCs had become wholesale dealers, conducting large FX transactions worth millions of dollars, above their sales limit of $5,000 per person.\n\nEmefiele noted the astronomical rise in the number of operators from 74 in 2005 to 5,689 in June last year, implying the BDC business was very lucrative for the operators and was pushing Nigeria towards the dollarisation of the domestic economy.\n\nEarlier in 2016, the CBN governor had decried the role played by BDCs in the mismanagement of the country\u2019s forex system and the apex bank\u2019s subsequent inability to maintain stability in that system.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn total disregard of the difficulties that the bank is facing in meeting its mandate of maintaining the country\u2019s foreign exchange reserves to safeguard the value of the naira, we have continued to observe that stakeholders in some of the subsectors have not been helpful in this direction. In particular, we have noted with grave concern that Bureau de Change (BDC) operators have abandoned the original objective of their establishment, which was to serve retail end users who need $5,000 or less. Instead, they have become wholesale dealers in foreign exchange to the tune of millions of dollars per transaction. Thereafter, they use fake documentation like passport numbers, BVNs, boarding passes, and flight tickets to render weekly returns to the CBN.\u201d\n\nA source at the Nigeria Police headquarters in Abuja told BusinessDay that between January and June this year, tens of billions of naira have been stolen by fraudsters hacking accounts of mostly corporate and institutional customers.\n\n\u201cWhat is clear from the hundreds of cases we have been investigating recently,\u201d he said, \u201cis that there are still some of these BDCs that have been involved with these fraudsters innocently and end up being victims themselves. This can happen when a fraudster walks up to a BDC operator and tells him he has a transaction to make and requests the account number of the BDC in which hundreds of millions of naira, sometimes one billion naira, will be transferred to the account.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe operator will give the equivalent amount in USD, without knowing he is engaging in a fraudulent transaction. In such cases, the BDC operator will be arrested when the fraud is uncovered, because the money was transferred directly to his account from the bank by an authorised person,\u201d he added.\n\nThe longstanding relationship between bank fraudsters and BDC operators in the country is said to be undergoing a fundamental change. In the past, when fraudsters stole monies from banks and transferred a billion naira to a BDC or several BDCs, the negotiated payment formula ranged from 40 percent to 50 percent in returns to the fraudsters, with the BDCs taking between 50 percent and 60 percent.\n\nRead also: Nigeria\u2019s dollar scarcity turning to gain for cattle rearing and local diary production\n\nBDCs take the biggest risks in fraud transactions, BusinessDay was told. \u201cThey have to be paid well because the BDCs will need lots of money to follow up the case in the event of arrest and investigations. It is not easy to find and arrest the brains behind the fraud. It is easier to trace the flow of money to the BDCs. The BDCs provide the final evacuation accounts for the big money and this can easily be traced to them by the Police or EFCC and when investigations start, they need money to handle the case with lawyers, and if necessary, to influence the investigative and judicial process,\u201d a senior police officer said.\n\n\u201cWhat we are witnessing now,\u201d the source said, \u201cis that fraudsters no longer trust the BDCs to keep to their terms of the agreement.

          "text": "Officers investigating bank fraud and other financial crimes in the country are worried over the principal role bureaux de change (BDCs) in the country play in supporting bank fraud and in the laundering of illicit proceeds.\n\nEarlier this year, billions of naira were stolen from one of the commercial banks in the country by fraudsters who hacked the account of the country\u2019s major telecommunications company (telco).\n\nInvestigations by BusinessDay revealed that the monies were moved from the account of the telco into predetermined private accounts set up within the bank, from which they were then evacuated using primed ATM cards in other banks. These accounts, BusinessDay found out, were set up within the bank because the account of the telco did not allow for interbank transfer.\n\nThe bank, part of a financial services holding company headquartered in Lagos, had its system, including its main server compromised by the hackers who then hewed off about N10 billion from the telco\u2019s account into a dozen arranged accounts within the bank. To do this, the hackers had modified the limits on transfers from a dozen accounts to unlimited transfers and were then able to relocate the monies from the funded accounts in the compromised bank to hundreds of accounts in different banks across the country.\n\nThe bulk of the funds was transferred by the fraudsters into the accounts of dozens of BDC operators in Lagos, Abuja, Ibadan and Kano to procure mainly the United States dollar and other foreign currencies.\n\nDefined by the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN) Revised Operational Guidelines for Bureaux De Change in Nigeria 2015 as a company that is licensed to carry on small-scale foreign exchange business in Nigeria and whose sole object is the carrying on of such business on a stand-alone basis, BDCs have become the major suppliers of foreign currencies to individuals and small businesses.\n\n\u201cThe long processes, complicated forms, and poor service quality from the commercial banks created huge opportunities for the BDCs in Nigeria,\u201d a 2020 Stears report said.\n\nAnti-money laundering regulations state that every BDC keeps proper registers and records of all transactions for transparency and compliance with Anti-Money Laundering Provisions, CBN guidelines, circulars, or directives. Furthermore, the arrival amount sold to or bought from a customer should be issued by a BDC through a machine list or receipts.\n\nMost BDCs do not adhere to these rules and are hardly sanctioned by the CBN.\n\n\u201cBDCs have become essential to major bank frauds in the country,\u201d a senior official at the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), with long years of experience investigating bank frauds and financial crimes, told BusinessDay.\n\nThe official added: \u201cWe have found out that it is difficult if not impossible for hackers to steal banks\u2019 customers\u2019 monies on an industrial scale which they do without the support of BDCs.\n\n\u201cThey can only evacuate huge amounts of monies out of the system using BDCs because if they have to use ATM cards only, they would not be able to get a tenth of what they get using BDCs.\u201d\n\nAn earlier investigative report by BusinessDay showed that BDCs have become indispensable partners with fraudsters in major bank fraud operations. While the BDC operators do not originate any fraud operation, they serve as the most credible and practicable instruments for evacuating and laundering the scores of billions of naira hacked out of the banks every year.\n\nIn July last year, Godwin Emefiele, the CBN governor, announced that the top bank would no longer approve BDC licence applications and would also stop providing forex to the existing licensed ones.\n\nThe decision, he said, was premised on the Monetary Policy Committee\u2019s observation of how BDCs had become wholesale dealers, conducting large FX transactions worth millions of dollars, above their sales limit of $5,000 per person.\n\nEmefiele noted the astronomical rise in the number of operators from 74 in 2005 to 5,689 in June last year, implying the BDC business was very lucrative for the operators and was pushing Nigeria towards the dollarisation of the domestic economy.\n\nEarlier in 2016, the CBN governor had decried the role played by BDCs in the mismanagement of the country\u2019s forex system and the apex bank\u2019s subsequent inability to maintain stability in that system.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn total disregard of the difficulties that the bank is facing in meeting its mandate of maintaining the country\u2019s foreign exchange reserves to safeguard the value of the naira, we have continued to observe that stakeholders in some of the subsectors have not been helpful in this direction. In particular, we have noted with grave concern that Bureau de Change (BDC) operators have abandoned the original objective of their establishment, which was to serve retail end users who need $5,000 or less. Instead, they have become wholesale dealers in foreign exchange to the tune of millions of dollars per transaction. Thereafter, they use fake documentation like passport numbers, BVNs, boarding passes, and flight tickets to render weekly returns to the CBN.\u201d\n\nA source at the Nigeria Police headquarters in Abuja told BusinessDay that between January and June this year, tens of billions of naira have been stolen by fraudsters hacking accounts of mostly corporate and institutional customers.\n\n\u201cWhat is clear from the hundreds of cases we have been investigating recently,\u201d he said, \u201cis that there are still some of these BDCs that have been involved with these fraudsters innocently and end up being victims themselves. This can happen when a fraudster walks up to a BDC operator and tells him he has a transaction to make and requests the account number of the BDC in which hundreds of millions of naira, sometimes one billion naira, will be transferred to the account.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe operator will give the equivalent amount in USD, without knowing he is engaging in a fraudulent transaction. In such cases, the BDC operator will be arrested when the fraud is uncovered, because the money was transferred directly to his account from the bank by an authorised person,\u201d he added.\n\nThe longstanding relationship between bank fraudsters and BDC operators in the country is said to be undergoing a fundamental change. In the past, when fraudsters stole monies from banks and transferred a billion naira to a BDC or several BDCs, the negotiated payment formula ranged from 40 percent to 50 percent in returns to the fraudsters, with the BDCs taking between 50 percent and 60 percent.\n\nRead also: Nigeria\u2019s dollar scarcity turning to gain for cattle rearing and local diary production\n\nBDCs take the biggest risks in fraud transactions, BusinessDay was told. \u201cThey have to be paid well because the BDCs will need lots of money to follow up the case in the event of arrest and investigations. It is not easy to find and arrest the brains behind the fraud. It is easier to trace the flow of money to the BDCs. The BDCs provide the final evacuation accounts for the big money and this can easily be traced to them by the Police or EFCC and when investigations start, they need money to handle the case with lawyers, and if necessary, to influence the investigative and judicial process,\u201d a senior police officer said.\n\n\u201cWhat we are witnessing now,\u201d the source said, \u201cis that fraudsters no longer trust the BDCs to keep to their terms of the agreement. We have noted several cases where fraudsters hack banks, steal billions of naira, transfer large chunks to BDCs hoping to get between 50 to 60 percent of the monies in dollars but end up getting 15 to 20 percent from the BDCs. The BDCs know that the fraudsters can do nothing about it. They know the fraudsters need them more than they need the fraudsters.\u201d\n\nAn executive member of the Association of Bureaux de Change Operators of Nigerian (ABCON), who spoke to BusinessDay under anonymity in Abuja, said that despite the fact that the association was doing everything possible to stem the trend of fraudulent transactions emanating from these fraudsters, \u201cthere seems to be a very strong cabal within the association that specialises in this trade\u201d.\n\nIn July 2020, a Lagos High Court convicted Abbas Mohammed and a BDC operator, Ibrahim Saidu Jogal, who connived to hack into the flexible database of Union Bank and defrauded it of N2.55 billion.

Ovie Omo-Agege, on Sunday said that the Delta Government had not been fair to the Ijaw ethnic nationality in the state.\n\nOmo-Agege, the All Progressives Congress (APC) Governorship Candidate in Delta, made the observation when he visited the Ijaw nations.\n\nHe was hosted by the Ijaw people at the premises of Mr Dan Ekpebide in Effurun, Uvwie Local Government Area of the state.\n\nOmo-Agege who was flanked by his running mate, Mr Friday Osanebi, thanked the people for the honour\n\nAddressing the crowd, Omo-Agege said that he was ready to change the current narrative in the state if elected as governor.\n\nThe lawmaker, representing Delta Central Senatorial District at the National Assembly, said he was pained by the sufferings the Ijaws were subjected to in the state.\n\n\u201cI have always felt the pain of the Ijaw nations because I know their contributions to the economy of this country.\n\n\u201cI believe that government has been unfair to the Ijaw people, given their contribution to the economy of this country.\n\n\u201cI know as a consequence of that contribution, so much is returned to our state by ways of FAC allocation and 13 per cent derivation.\n\n\u201cBut if you look around and asked yourself, is their anything on ground and more specifically in the Ijaw nation commensurate with that receipt, the answer is no.\n\n\u201cWe are prepared to change the narrative of Delta, we are prepared to judiciously use the resources that will come to the state to the benefit of our people,\u201d he assured.\n\nOmo-Agege said that when voted into power, he would ensure prompt payment of pension and gratuities.\n\nAccording to him, the era when, \u201cpeople spend the best part of their lives rendering services to the state and after retirement they will not be paid their pension and gratuity is gone\u201d.\n\nHe said that his administration would focus among others, creating employment and empowerment of the people, developing the state, ensuring peace and security.\n\nOmo-Agege urged the people to support his governorship ambition, adding that they would be carried along.\n\n\u201cWe will do better than this government. I seek your partnership in all ramifications as I run this governorship race. I cannot dictate to the Ijaw nation what their entitlement should be, but by way of dialogue.\n\n\u201cThis is not about APC or PDP, it is about leadership, competence and orientation. Some believed you get there, collect the money and share while others believe it is about baking the cake to the benefit of all.\n\n\u201cWhen you think differently and act differently, you have a better outcome, this is what I commit to the people of Delta.\n\n\u201cBefore we can make genuine case for oil companies to return, we must address the issues of insecurity in the state. So our cardinal agenda is to provide peace and security,\u201d he said.\n\nOmo-Agege said that with the support from his side, together and a sustainable support from the Ijaw leadership, he was confident of winning the governorship election in 2023.\n\nEarlier, the host, Mr Ekpebide thanked Omo-Agege for honouring the call.\n\n\u201cI am delighted to have you in my house. After 2007, I have not been active in politics but today I am wholeheartedly declaring my support for my brother Omo-Agege and the party he represents.\n\n\u201cMy official declaration will be done in Okerenkoko which is my ward headquarters. Where ever you\n\nstand, that is where I will stand.\n\n\u201cI am not alone, I am working with my brothers, friends and others in the struggle. Very soon we will roll out and I am very sure we will get to the promse land,\u201d he said.\n\nEkpebide said that the achievement of Omo-Agege in the Delta Central spoke volumes, expressing hope that the development would transcend to the Ijaw nation when he became the governor.\n\nAlso, an APC chieftain in Delta, Mr Michael Johnny, said the Ijaws were ready to work with Omo-Agege in the governorship race.\n\nJohnny also thanked Ekpebide for declaration support for APC.\n\n\u201cThe Ijaw APC are ready to work with you and others that are willing to join us to achieve this great opportunity that is coming to us,\u201d Johnny said.\n\nIn attendance were representatives from various Ijaw communities in Delta among whom were Dr Chris Ekiyor, former Commissioner for Commerce and Industry in Delta and others from Edo, Bayelsa and Rivers.

We cannot continue this way,\u201d it stated.\n\nANAP warned that the future of education will be bleak as little or no attention was focused on the system as most of the children of politicians are schooling abroad.\n\nThe union warned that their members will align with the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) position on protest against the unfortunate situation in the tertiary education sector.\n\nIt added that all members have been put on alert in solidarity actions on the directive of Nigeria Labour Congress at very short notice.",

We have been here to support our brother. If you will recall that on the day of our mega rally, I sang a song, and the song says \u2018power belongs to God.\u2019\n\nWith this result by INEC, it has been proven that power belongs to God. And I told you that I am a miracle governor and prayed that the miracle robs off on Osun election. And so, we are all happy and excited.\n\n\u201cLet me on behalf of my national chairman, Senator Iyorchia Ayu and the presidential candidate of our party in the 2023 election, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, say a very big congratulations to the dancing, loving, loveable, straight forward, honest governor-elect. You are now the dancing governor.\u201d\n\nGovernor Diri described the victory as the will of the people and a statement of intention by the PDP ahead of the 2023 general election, saying the \u201cPDP is coming.\u201d\n\nDiri stated, \u201cYou see, we came in here to campaign and after the campaign we stayed back here with him and from the day of campaign, I clearly told him that there was an organic support for the candidate and for the party, and it has been so proven. Let no man play the role of God. And I have also told you that this election is not only for Osun State, this election was a national election, this election was a test election for 2023.

We have been here to support our brother. If you will recall that on the day of our mega rally, I sang a song, and the song says \u2018power belongs to God.\u2019\n\nWith this result by INEC, it has been proven that power belongs to God. And I told you that I am a miracle governor and prayed that the miracle robs off on Osun election. And so, we are all happy and excited.\n\n\u201cLet me on behalf of my national chairman, Senator Iyorchia Ayu and the presidential candidate of our party in the 2023 election, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, say a very big congratulations to the dancing, loving, loveable, straight forward, honest governor-elect. You are now the dancing governor.\u201d\n\nGovernor Diri described the victory as the will of the people and a statement of intention by the PDP ahead of the 2023 general election, saying the \u201cPDP is coming.\u201d\n\nDiri stated, \u201cYou see, we came in here to campaign and after the campaign we stayed back here with him and from the day of campaign, I clearly told him that there was an organic support for the candidate and for the party, and it has been so proven. Let no man play the role of God. And I have also told you that this election is not only for Osun State, this election was a national election, this election was a test election for 2023. I warn you PDP is coming in 2023.\u201d",

          "text": "A former governor of Imo State, Hon Emeka Ihedioha, has slammed Governor Hope Uzodimma-led administration for increasing level of indebtedness of the state resulting from unbridled borrowing by the government.\n\nIn his speech as the special guest of honour at the Mbaise USA 13th Annual Convention at Santa Clara, California, in the United States of America, which was made available to newsmen yesterday, he said, statistics released in April this year, by the Debt Management Office, DMO, shows that the debt profile of Imo State has jumped to N205.19 billion, which means it has more than doubled from the level he brought down the huge debt profile inherited from the previous administration.\n\nIn his reaction, the commissioner for information and strategy, Hon Declan Emelumba advised Ihedioha to display the spirit of sportsmanship and stop lamenting. He highlighted that the present administration under the leadership of Uzodimma is responsible and responsive and nothing stops the government from borrowing for infrastructural development. According to him, the debt profile brandished by the former governor does not reflect the true position of the debt portfolio.\n\nBut Ihedioha said, \u201cThe supposedly high indebtedness of Imo State, incurred in the last two and half years, is cause for worry. This is because, while other states like Lagos, Ogun, Rivers and Akwa Ibom with the same level of debt profile have robust economic activities, including significant internally generated revenue to meet their loan obligations, Imo State is left with practically nothing to fall back on to support its loan exposure.\n\nWhat this means is that the debt burden, without economic activities to generate revenue, will continue to weigh the state down. \u201d\n\nIhedioha described the high indebtedness as man\u2019s inhumanity to man and a mortgaging of the future of the state.\n\nThe former governor who used the opportunity to commend the people of the state, especially people of Mbaise extraction, also gave an account of his seven months stint as the governor of the state.\n\nHe said rebuilding Imo State was at the heart of his growth and development initiatives and priority, adding that the development of the human capital index, the economy and infrastructure with special interest in the rural areas was at the centre of his plans for the state.\n\nIhedioha who set up technical committees to harness potentials in the state stated that he took steps towards enhancing the internally generated revenue (IGR) thereby raising monthly revenue to over N1 billion by blocking areas of leakage through the introduction of Treasury Single Account, TSA, while reducing the dubious debt profile of the state.\n\nWhile speaking to over 2000 delegates from across the US, Europe and Nigeria at the 13th Mbaise USA Convention in California, he assured that if given an opportunity to preside over the affairs of Imo State again, he would be bold in redressing the developmental retrogression in the state.",

          "text": "By Onu Okorie\n\nIn Nigeria today, when agents of transformations in the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari are being counted, the Director General of Securities and Exchange Commission SEC, Mr. Lamido Yuguda will definitely standout, if the numerous reforms he has introduced is anything to go by.\n\nIn less than two years after assuming office the SEC management under Mr. Yuguda has not only set strategic goals but also continued to expand the frontiers of investment space thereby attracting improved local and foreign direct investment, FDIs into the economy through innovative regulatory guidelines and collaboration with other relevant institutions.\n\nFor instance, on market-wide issues, the Commission has drafted and presented an amendment to ISA Bill to the National Assembly as part of its efforts to enhance the regulatory framework of the Nigerian capital market, lead to the introduction of new products into the market, and increase the effectiveness of the Investments and Securities Tribunal, amongst other benefits to ensure that the provisions of the Bill represent realities in the nation\u2019s investment climate.\n\nAlso, the Commission is collaborating with National Assembly Business Environment Roundtable NASSBER to prepare a roadmap towards passage of the Bill within the shortest time frame.\n\nAlso, the Yuguda-led executive management team has been implementing capital market development goals set out in the Capital Market Master Plan (CMMP) (2015-2025) and successfully completed the review of CMMP to realign the initiatives/deliverables to prevailing market conditions and keep the document relevant in the dynamic capital market due to issues related to Fintech, sustainability and regional integration.\n\nTo resolve legacy issues of Identity Management which is a crucial driver in improving market participation and solving unclaimed dividends and related problems, the management also inaugurated a market-wide Identity Management Committee with mandate to harmonize the various databases of investors in Nigerian capital market, facilitate data accuracy in the market, mitigate fraud, improve KYC requirements and manage AML/CFT risks, among others.\n\nThe report of the committee is expected to resolve issues that have hindered growth of the Market, hampered investor confidence, and matters that serve as barriers to entry for potential investors, amongst other benefits.\n\nOn primary market activities, the Yuguda-led executive management of the SEC has also in the past two years approved 41 new equities issues valued at N656.9 billion, 37 bonds valued at N776.2 billion, 28 applications for shelf programmes valued at N2.5 trillion and 21 Exchange Traded Derivatives Contracts.\n\nThis is even as it processed six Schemes of Merger, seven Acquisitions, 21 Corporate Restructurings, and three Takeovers during the period. It also ensured that over N11 billions of untraceable shareholders\u2019 funds from Schemes of Arrangement in the custody of Registrars were transferred to the National Investor Protection Fund NIPF.\n\nAs part of the process of improving time to market of transactions and fast tracking the review process, the Commission conducted training for issuing houses to help improve the quality of applications submitted.\n\nSimilarly, Commission also recorded a landmark achievement on the first electronic offering with combined feature of book building to Qualified Institutions and use of the price discovered from book-build for sales to Retail Investors. It also granted approval for the first 21 derivatives contracts which had seven and 14 different contracts from both the NGX and FMDQ Exchanges respectively in the past two years.\n\nOn Collective Investment Scheme CIS, the Yuguda-led management has also, following completion of series of monitoring and evaluation processes, commenced implementation of 100 per cent custody requirement in the CIS sector to protect investors. As a result, all clients\u2019 assets currently managed under discretionary and non-discretionary mandates are to be held under independent custodial agreements in custodial banks.\n\nThe Commission has also recorded remarkable milestones in its secondary market activities in the past years with successful demutualization of the Nigerian Exchange Limited NGX which investment analysts see as milestone in the development of Nigerian capital market.\n\nThis is even as the management collaborated with University of Cambridge\u2019s Centre for Alternative Finance, UK for the training of its select employees on a certified course on Fintech & Regulatory Innovation, to enhance the Commission\u2019s capacity in regulating Fintech.\n\nAlso, it collaborated with the World Bank to commission a Fintech Scoping project and held collaborative engagements with 15 International and local Fintech stakeholders to guide the Commission on its Fintech policies.\n\nThe Regulatory Incubation Guidelines to operationalize provisional regulation for aspiring Fintech firms were released within the period. In furtherance of its market regulation roles, management of the Commission was able to ascertain the quantum of unclaimed dividends of publicly traded companies that fall within the categories eligible to be borrowed by the Federal Government.\n\nThis amounted to N56, 584,795,648.71 and $8,153,118.41 respectively. In addition, it also facilitated the transfer into the SEC/CNB NIPF Account of N2.3 billion in excess of return monies and N11.4 billion in Schemes consideration money, both of which had previously been held in the custody of the Registrars.\n\nOn the pesky issue of Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing Of Terrorism AML/CFT, following the GIABA Mutual Evaluation of Nigeria, the Yuguda-led executive management had made concerted efforts in the capital market to meet both the GIABA Mutual Evaluation Report MER Follow-Up Process and the FATF International Cooperation Review Group ICRG requirements in order to avoid Nigeria being placed on the FATF public grey list at the Plenary when the grace period expires in October, 2022.\n\nFor instance, following the MER findings that Nigeria had several important deficiencies in its AML/CFT/CPF system in relation to Technical Compliance, and that its effectiveness controls were insufficient to mitigate its high ML/TF/PF risks, the Commission championed the amendments of Rules and Regulations of the Virtual Asset Service providers; the sector specific regulations to repeal the 2013 SEC AML/CFT Regulations and enactment of the 2022 AML/CFT Regulations; the SEC AML/CFT RBS Framework.\n\nThese new rules and amendments were done in order to address Nigeria\u2019s MER deficiencies and broaden the scope of preventive measures available to VASPs. In furtherance of its regulatory mandate, the Commission conducted investigations into complaints by investors and out of the 250 complaints brought forward into the period, 182 were resolved.\n\nAlso, out of the 58 complaints in relation to Ponzi schemes received, 45 were resolved. The Commission was able to recover 10,659,168 units of various companies\u2019 shares as well as the sum of N1, 384,255,526.73 recovered for investors during the period under review.\n\nIt issued New Rules on Robo-Advisory Services to guide the regulatory requirements and expectations for providing automated advisory services in the market and released the Rules on Trade Repositories during the period under review.\n\nSimilarly, the Yuguda-led executive management of the Commission also introduced new rules on Crowd Funding, Social bonds, Digital Assets Exchange DAX, Digital Assets Custodians DACs, Issuance of Digital Assets as Securities and Requirements for registration of Digital Assets Offering Platforms as part of its efforts to guarantee security of investments in the capital market.\n\nOn Corporate Governance measures, the Commission also released guidelines on the Implementation of Sections 60-63 of Investments and Securities Act (ISA), 2007 and in order to strengthen the disclosure regime in capital market, the Commission in a circular dated January 19, 2022 provided public companies a fast track option for filing Audited Financial Statements.\n\nIn addition, the Commission also developed the SEC Corporate Governance Guidelines SCGG to address corporate governance issues not considered in the NCCG, and released same in October 2020. As part of its efforts to harmonise the reporting timeline of the SEC Corporate Governance Guideline SCGG with that of the National Code of Corporate Governance NCCG, it also in year 2021 exposed to the public for comments an amendment to Rules 42(2).\n\nThe Commission has also as part of its regulatory interventions to amicably resolve disputes between the board and shareholders of listed companies resolved the disputes between Alhaji Muneer Alade Bankole (the Chief Executive Officer and Sheikh Abdulmohsen A. Al-Thunayan Chairman of the Board, of Medview Airlines, resolved those between major shareholders of Ikeja Hotels Plc and returned the company to profitability and also reached a settlement with Oando Plc in 2021 after concluding investigation of Corporate Governance allegations levelled against the company.\n\nIn regard to its market development mandate, the Commission has continued its Investor Education and Public enlightenment programmes by organizing workshops on infusion of Capital Market Studies into the curricula of Basic and Secondary Schools in Nigeria and also collaborated with the Standards Organization of Nigeria SON and other partners to organize Stakeholders\u2019 Sensitization Workshops on Commodities Standards in Lagos and Kano during the period under review.\n\nFurthermore, the Commission held webinars on Non-Interest Capital Market Products, Financial Inclusion, Ponzi Schemes and Solid Minerals targeted at the pension industry, investor protection, women, Youth/millennial and the commodities segment of the market.\n\nAlso in pursuit of non-interest market education and enlightenment programmes, the Commission collaborated with Islamic Financial Services Board IFSB and the Auditing and Accounting Organisation of Islamic Financial Institutions AAOIFI to organize Non-Interest Capital Market training for over 1000 participants.\n\nAlso, the Yuguda-led executive management of the Commission has led the team to improve the capacity of the Nigerian Capital Market Institute NCMI by providing it with necessary tools to train Capital Market Operators CMO in different fields.\n\nOn international engagements, Mr Yuguda is now saddled with leadership of West African Securities Regulators Association WASRA. Under his leadership, rules for the integrated West African Capital Market were developed and reviewed.\n\nOn human capital development, the Commission had in 2019 conducted an internal capacity assessment that outlined staffing deficits and needs.\n\nAlso, in furtherance of its drive to leverage its operations by deploying innovative technologies and solutions to its departments and units, the Commission conducted a review of its IT infrastructure and determined that it was in a poor state.\n\nThe investigations focused on the internal and external perceptions of the Commission with the conclusion that the IT infrastructure was out dated and needed to be upgraded to international standards of securities regulators.\n\nAlso, on its Risk-Based Supervision Framework Implementation and Capacity Building Project the Commission secured a $400,000 grant from the African Development Bank AfDB to support capacity building projects in the areas of RBS, Derivatives and Green Bonds.\n\nThe Commission has also secured counterpart funding of $450,000 from AfDB on its Nigeria Securities Market Surveillance System Project to support the deployment of a real-time market surveillance system for the Nigerian capital market.\n\nIn addition, it has also secured from the Central Bank of Nigeria CBN the sum of N3.5 billion for Information Technology transformation project. Given the unparalleled achievements recorded so far, it has been argued by some financial experts that there is nexus between Yuguda\u2019s reforms and investors\u2019 making Nigeria a preferred destination in recent times.",
          "summary": "Also, the Yuguda-led executive management team has been implementing capital market development goals set out in the Capital Market Master Plan (CMMP) (2015-2025) and successfully completed the review of CMMP to realign the initiatives/deliverables to prevailing market conditions and keep the document relevant in the dynamic capital market due to issues related to Fintech, sustainability and regional integration.\nThis is even as it processed six Schemes of Merger, seven Acquisitions, 21 Corporate Restructurings, and three Takeovers during the period.\nUnder his leadership, rules for the integrated West African Capital Market were developed and reviewed.\nOn human capital development, the Commission had in 2019 conducted an internal capacity assessment that outlined staffing deficits and needs.\nThe Commission has also secured counterpart funding of $450,000 from AfDB on its Nigeria Securities Market Surveillance System Project to support the deployment of a real-time market surveillance system for the Nigerian capital market.",

          "text": "Nearly four years after failing, by a small margin, in his bid to govern Osun State, Senator Ademola Adeleke of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has overcome the biggest obstacle to his dream.\n\nOn Saturday, he achieved a hard-fought victory over the state\u2019s incumbent Governor, Gboyega Oyetola, of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state\u2019s governorship election.\n\nSenator Adeleke, 62, riding on the back of a campaign aimed at developing the state and retrieving what he says is his stolen mandate, secured 403,371 votes, 28,344 more than his closest rival, the incumbent governor. Governor Oyetola polled 375,027 votes.\n\nIt was enough for the Returning Officer of the election, Professor Oluwatoyin Ogundipe, to declare him winner and governor-elect.\n\n\u201cI declare that Adeleke Ademola Jackson Nurudeen of PDP, having satisfied the requirements of the law, is hereby declared the winner and he is returned elected,\u201d Professor Ogundipe declared, sparking jubilation among Adeleke\u2019s supporters.\n\n\ufeff\n\nSaturday\u2019s election featured 15 contestants with the rematch of Oyetola and Adeleke drawing the most attention.\n\nAs the results from the local governments trickled in, it was clear that the election which was generally considered peaceful was a two-horse race between both men.\n\nThey split 96.76 per cent of the total valid votes cast in the election.\n\nKehinde Atanda of the Action Democratic Party (ADP) came in at a distant third with 10,104 votes, followed by Akin Ogunbiyi of the Accord Party with 4,515 votes.\n\nVotes for the other candidates are as follows: Akinade Ogunbiyi, A party \u2014 4,514 votes; Awojide Segun, AAC \u2014 2,148; Kehinde Atanda, ADP -10,104; Awoyemi Lukuman, APM \u2014 1,222; and Adebayo Elisha, APP \u2014 601 votes.\n\nAdeleke Adedapo of BP got 374 votes; Rasaq Saliu, NNPP \u2014 393; Abede Samuel, NRM \u2014 777; Ayowole Adedeji, PRP \u2014 1,007; Omigbodun Akinrinola, SDP \u2014 515; Ademola Adeseye, YPP \u2014 1,303; and Adesuyi Olufemi, ZLP \u2014 364 votes.\n\nVictory At Last\n\nIn the last governorship election held in 2018, it was a tough contest as the APC flagbearer had to win a supplementary election before he was returned elected.\n\nFollowing the initial poll held that year, Oyetola trailed Adeleke who had led by 353 votes going into the supplementary election which held in seven polling units.\n\nThe votes garnered in the supplementary poll would later help the incumbent governor to overturn the deficit and put him ahead of his PDP counterpart, leading to his emergence as the winner of the keenly contested election.\n\nAccording to the final votes announced by the electoral umpire that year, Oyetola polled 255,505 votes while Adeleke scored 255,023 votes \u2013 a difference of 482 votes.\n\nIt was, however, victory at last for the PDP candidate and his supporters on Sunday (today) when he was returned elected by Professor Ogundipe who doubles as the Vice Chancellor of the University of Lagos (UNILAG).\n\nCompared to his loss in the last election, Adeleke bounced back to defeat incumbent Governor Oyetola with a vote margin of 28,344.\n\nBetter Conduct\n\nSaturday\u2019s election started off on schedule at many polling units observed with accreditation and voting going on smoothly for the most part.\n\nSome of the candidates and observers also had words of praise for the conduct of the poll.\n\nGovernor Oyetola told reporters that he is satisfied with the conduct of the poll and commended the security operatives for \u201cdoing a very good job\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe whole thing has been very peaceful,\u201d he said after voting at Unit 2, Ward 1 in Boripe Local Government Area.\n\n\u201cI think INEC has performed very well,\u201d said PDP\u2019s Adeleke after he voted. More than 21,000 policemen had been deployed for the exercise along with three police helicopters and three gunboats.\n\nAhead of the polls, there had been concerns about possible disturbances by cultists and the menace of vote-buying.\n\nHowever, as the exercise progressed, reports from observers and security agents indicated that it was peaceful, backing up assurances by security operatives that adequate arrangements had been made for the poll.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been able to make adequate arrangements to take care of the possible consequences of the activities of the cultists,\u201d said the Deputy Inspector-General of Police in charge of the election, Johnson Kokumo.\n\n\u201cThat is, effecting their arrest before the election and of course mopping up light weapons in circulation. This is intended to create a conducive atmosphere where the gubernatorial election will take place without crisis.\u201d\n\nPeaceful Poll\n\nHours into the poll, the Director-General of the National Youth Service Corps, Brigadier-General Mohammed Fadah, adjudged the poll peaceful.\n\n\u201cThe place is more peaceful than Ekiti because there isn\u2019t any report of violence,\u201d he told Channels TV\u2019s Seun Okinbaloye when asked about the poll in Osogbo, the state capital.\n\n\u201cEverybody is peaceful like it\u2019s Sallah day, everywhere is peaceful and they are doing their thing in a very peaceful manner. There is no negative report so far.\u201d\n\nIn a preliminary report, the Civil Society Situation Room also adjudged the election as peaceful.\n\n\u201cFrom the Situation Room\u2019s observations, no violence has been recorded and the number of people who came out was encouraging,\u201d it said in another assessment report \u2013 the second for the day.\n\n\u201cWe commend the people of the State of Osun for coming out early to cast their votes, especially the elderly who waited in queues patiently.\u201d\n\nWhen it came to vote-buying, however, the steps taken to combat the act fell short.\n\n\u201cThere was open negotiation of buying and selling of votes well-coordinated by the polling agents in many of the polling units,\u201d the Civil Society Situation Room said in its assessment of the election.\n\n\u201cThere were no complaints from any of them (the polling agents) against each other. Codes were used to extract commitments from voters as opposed to the blatant money exchanging hands observed in the Ekiti State governorship election.\u201d\n\nVote-Buying Still A Problem\n\nCandidates also had concerns about vote-buying.\n\nThe governorship candidate of the Accord Party, Akin Ogunbiyi, told journalists that he witnessed vote buying in Aiyedire Local Government Area.\n\n\ufeff\n\nShortly after casting his vote with his wife at Ile-Ogbo Ward 1, Unit 1, Methodist Primary School, Ogunbiyi listed other areas where vote-buying took place to be in Ile-Ogbo and Osogbo environs.\n\nHe lamented that there was no official of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) there to arrest party agents who trade votes for money.\n\n\u201cThe police officers there can\u2019t do any arrest. They were sitting down. In fact, it was by their side that they (voters) were going to collect money for the vote that they sold,\u201d Ogunbiyi said.\n\n\u201cAn Aiyedire Local Government, there was a vehicle parked behind a building. There was a lady inside and there was another man. They were the ones who were exchanging cash for votes.\u201d\n\n\ufeff\n\nThe candidate of the Labour Party, Lasun Yusuf, also had concerns about vote-buying.\n\nAfter voting at his polling unit in Irepodun LGA around 10:20 am, he had a warning for voters.\n\n\u201cI just have fears for the future generation but let me sound a note of warning, if people actually go out today to buy the votes, Nigeria is in problem,\u201d he said.\n\nAhead of the polls, INEC had said it would work closely with security operatives on the issue of vote-buying. As part of efforts to tackle the menace, various security agencies were present in the state for the poll, including the EFCC.\n\n\u201cWe have our Force Intelligence Bureau operatives; our tactical operatives are here too. They are not in uniforms, they are everywhere, and we are working with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC),\u201d Police Public Relations Officer, Muyiwa Adejobi, told Channels TV during the polls.\n\n\ufeff\n\nThe EFCC would later arrest three men for vote buying.\n\nAccording to the anti-graft agency, the three suspects were arrested through actionable intelligence and digital means, and all three will be prosecuted.",

          "text": "&nb\n\nThe Commissioner for Information and Voter Education of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Festus Okoye, has said the commission is going to have talks with the Central Bank of Nigeria to try and resolve the storage of election materials.\n\nEarlier in June, INEC chairman, Mahmood Yakubu, had stated that sensitive election materials would no longer be \u201crouted\u201d through the apex bank. as the \u201ccurrent circumstances\u201d, would require an alternative by the body for its storage solutions.\n\nHowever, in an interview on Channels Television\u2019s show, Sunrise Daily, Mr Okoye warned that INEC was in for a logistics nightmare if it doesn\u2019t have a form of parley with the CBN over its election materials storage issues.\n\nREAD ALSO: Osun Election: INEC Begins Distribution Of Sensitive Materials\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a huge logistics nightmare. What we intend to do going forward since there are issues with keeping our materials with CBN,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe have not had enough opportunity to sit down with the Central Bank to review the entire issue surrounding our moving our material with the Nigerian Air force.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are definitely going to do that. If at the end of the day, we are not satisfied with the arrangement then we are going to look for a new logistics pathway for how to manage logistics during the 2023 elections. But no decision has been made.\n\nHe also insisted that the recently concluded elections in Ekiti and Osun governorship storage measures will not be tenable going into the general elections in 2023.\n\n\u201cYou cannot use the Ekiti governorship election and Osun governorship election as a measure of what will happen in 2023,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is because for instance, in the Ekiti governorship election, we had less than a million registered voters. In the Osun governorship election, we were shy of two million registered voters.\n\n\u201cThese are stand-alone elections. For the Ekiti election, we utilised the service of the Nigerian Air force and they flew the materials into Akure airport. We did the same thing with the Osun election, and we moved the materials to our state offices.\n\n\u201cBut for the 2023 general election, we are going to have over 95 million ballot papers printed for the presidential election. Over 95 million will be printed for the senatorial election; over 95 million papers will be printed for the house of representatives election. Then it goes down.",

          "title": "Buhari Congratulates Osun Governor-Elect Adeleke, Says People\u2019s Will Must Be Respected",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari, on Sunday, described the outcome of Saturday\u2019s governorship election in Osun State, won by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, Senator Ademola Adeleke, as an expression of the will of the people through ballot, which must matter and be respected.\n\nThe president, who congratulated Adeleke, as well as commended the maturity and commitment of all stakeholders, however, reiterated his commitment to a credible electoral system in the country.\n\nThis is as congratulatory messages, have continued to come for Adeleke from different strata of the system, particularly, members of his political family, including person like the presidential candidate of the PDP, Atiku Abubakar; National Chairman of the PDP, 7/17/22r. Iyorchia Ayu; former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki; Bayelsa State Governor, Douye Diri and his Edo State counterpart, Godwin Obaseki, among others.\n\n\u201cWith the election over, the president expressed conviction that the people of Osun have expressed their will through the ballot, and the will of the people must always matter and be respected in a democracy,\u201d he said in a release by his Media Adviser, Femi Adesina.\n\nContinuing, he noted further that the successful conduct of the election was a further testimony to the maturity and commitment of all stakeholders \u2013 the electoral body, security agencies, political parties, the media, civil society and the electorate \u2013 to further strengthen the integrity of the electoral process in the country.\n\nBuhari, therefore, reassured the nation that the commitment of his administration towards having credible elections remained unshaken.\n\nAtiku, Ayu, Saraki, Diri, Obaseki Salute Adeleke\n\nIn his congratulatory message, Atiku Abubakar said, \u201cAt this point in time when our country needs to take a break from the shameful effects of bad governance, it shall be on record that Osun State provided the compass into that brighter future that awaits us at the horizon.\n\n\u201cThe referendum on the administration of the APC, has commenced with the verdict of the people of Osun State in electing Senator Ademola Adeleke, while we know that the 2023 general election will be a full referendum.\n\n\u201cIt is inconceivable that Nigerians will reward the APC for the failings of the last seven years. And in a state like Osun, for example, it\u2019s been a long time since the people last felt the effect of good governance.\n\n\u201cThe ship of hope is already at the harbour under the umbrella of the Peoples Democratic Party. We shall intensify the work to ensure that we uproot all vestiges of bad governance and false hopes towards the 2023 election. The Imole (light) that has started to shine from Osun shall soon have a national coverage.\u201d\n\n\u201cCongratulations to Sen. Ademola Adeleke, on a well-fought victory. Also, hearty congratulations to the PDP family and all stakeholders, who came together to make this sweet victory possible. But even more importantly, congratulations to the great people of Osun State for proving that power truly belongs to the people.\u201d\n\nAyu, who in his congratulatory message, said the Osun people have spoken, recalled how the defeated governor denied the party the use of facilities for its campaign.\n\n\u201cA few days ago, the defeated and outgoing Governor, HE Adegboyega Oyetola and his party, the APC, did everything to frustrate us. This included denying us the use of any public facility in the state capital for our mega-rally.\n\n\u201cWe had to use the party\u2019s state secretariat. As it were, we couldn\u2019t have access to the stadium, but we had access to the people\u2019s hearts, loyalty and votes,\u201d adding that, the convincing win of 403, 371 against Governor Oyetola\u2019s 375, 027 was ample proof of that.\n\nAyu said, \u201cToday is, therefore, not just a day of double restoration \u2013 it\u2019s a day of redemption too. It restores PDP to power and redeems the Osun people from the scourge of mediocrity, empty promises and excuses.\u201d\n\n\u201cI congratulate the two-time winner, the tenacious Adeleke. I congratulate the good people and residents of Osun State. I hail every party stakeholder, who stood with us in action, prayers and hope.\u201d\n\nIn his message, Saraki too said, \u201cToday, all across Nigeria, the nation has watched as the people of Osun State deliver a clear, loud, and strong message: \u201cImole De\u201d \u2014 which means that light has come.\n\n\u201cWe have watched, as the people of this great state have reclaimed their mandate and the mandate of my dear friend and brother, Senator Ademola Adeleke, the PDP governorship candidate, which was surreptitiously stolen at the polls exactly four years ago.\n\n\u201cWith everything that we have all witnessed here in Osun State, one lesson remains clear: the people of Nigeria want better. They want lives that are not hampered by the rising cost of living, the flailing economy, and the insecurity. They want a conscientious government \u2014 one that works for and represents the best interests of themselves, their families, and their communities.\n\n\u201cMake no mistake, this victory was not easily attained. It is the culmination of the sacrifice and hard work of our party leaders, stakeholders, and leaders, who all played specific roles to ensure that this time around, our party\u2019s mandate has been protected, and our candidate has now emerged victorious.\n\n\u201cI congratulate my brothers, Governor Douye Diri of Bayelsa and Governor Godwin Obaseki, for taking the time out of their busy schedules to ensure that our victory was not only concise but complete.\u201d\n\nObaseki: Osun People Chose Progress over Retrogression\n\nEdo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, has congratulated the PDP governorship candidate in Osun State, Ademola Adeleke, following his victory in Saturday\u2019s election, saying the Osun people chose progress over retrogressive politics.\n\nObaseki, who also said Osun people made their choices through the ballot, choosing the PDP and its ideals of equity, unity and progress over the retrogressive policies that had put them in dire straits, however, stood with the people of Osun in sending a clear message to Nigerians that, \u201cwe are prepared and ready to rescue them from the hardship and woes that they have been thrown into.\n\n\u201cWe thank the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for sustaining the electoral reforms, which started in the September 19, 2020 Edo State governorship election. These reforms have ensured a peaceful, fair and credible conduct of the election, which gave the people the freedom to elect their preferred candidate.\n\n\u201cAs a party, we remain steadfast in our commitment to rescue Nigeria and are, by this victory, fired up to go into the 2023 general elections to win.\u201d\n\nMakinde: People\u2019s Power\u2019ll Continue to Triumph\n\nOyo State Governor, \u2018Seyi Makinde, has congratulated Senator Ademola Adeleke, over his victory at the just-concluded Osun State governorship election, saying the power of the people has again triumphed and would continue to triumph.\n\nAccording to him, Adeleke\u2019s victory was similar to what happened in Oyo State during the 2019 governorship election, when the people exercised their franchise in support of an opposition party.\n\nMakinde, who hailed the teeming voters across the 30 local governments of Osun State for standing by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and staying resolute to ensure that their votes counted, said: \u201cit\u2019s great to have a second PDP flag flying in the South-West.\u201d\n\nAccording to a statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Mr. Taiwo Adisa, Makinde lauded Adeleke, PDP members and Osun State voters for remaining strong and unwavering throughout the electioneering period.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the government and the good people of Oyo State, I congratulate the Osun State Governor-Elect, Senator Ademola Adeleke and the people of Osun State on this victory.\n\n\u201cIt is great to have a second PDP flag flying in the South West and this victory teaches all politicians an important lesson \u2013 that truly, power resides with the people. The power of the people will continue to triumph, the earlier politicians realise this fact, the better for our democracy,\u201d he said.\n\nObi Congratulates Adeleke\n\nPresidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, has extended what he described as his warmest personal congratulations to Ademola Adeleke on wining the Osun State gubernatorial election.\n\nObi also congratulated candidate of the Labour Party in the election, Hon Lasun Sulaimon Yusuff and his running mate, Adeola Adekunle Atanda, for a hard fought battle and their spirit of resolve and sportsmanship, despite the outcome.\n\nHe said, \u201cTo our the Obidient Movement Family and our supporters nationwide, the outcome of this particular election is not a verdict on our exponentially growing strength nationwide especially, when viewed against the fact that we are barely one month old in the party and we had to contend with forces that have been entrenched in the state for the last two decades.\n\n\u201cHowever, within this very short period of only a few weeks, the Labour Party has made its presence and political impact felt nationally. We must strengthen our collective resolve not relent in our noble march to take back our country. Much work remains to be done, hence we must focus the totality of our efforts now on the forthcoming 2023 General elections.\n\n\u201cIn the fullness of time, our message of rescue and recovery will resonate through out the length and breath of the Nation and most Nigerian electorate will buy in into our mission to take back Nigeria, for the purpose of rescuing it from continued decline , shift the National psyche from consumption to production and from sharing dwindling resources to creating wealth and frontally combating poverty.\u201d\n\nNwobodo: Adeleke\u2019s Victory, Precursor to PDP\u2019s Success in 2023\n\nA former governor of Anambra State, Senator Jim Nwobodo, has described the victory of Osun State Governor-elect, Senator Ademola Adeleke, as a precursor to the success awaiting PDP in the 2023 general election.\n\nNwobodo, in a statement last night, said Adeleke\u2019s victory showed that the presidential candidate of the PDP, Atiku Abubakar, would win the presidency in 2023 and that the PDP would win in the Southwest and the other geopolitical zones.\n\n\u201cI congratulate the governor-elect of Osun State, Senator Ademola Adeleke for his victory in the well-conducted polls last Saturday. Adeleke\u2019s victory is a forerunner to the electoral fortunes of the presidential candidate of the PDP, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar. Atiku will win the presidency for the PDP in 2023.\u201d\n\nNwobodo recalled that Adeleke had in 2018 won the same governorship position through the ballots but was \u201crobbed of victory through the rigging machinery of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).\u201d\n\n\u201cThis time around, he has won again in another clear victory, and I congratulate the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for conducting a credible poll in Osun State.\u201d\n\n\u2018Buhari\u2019s Negligence Responsible for Edo, Osun Losses\u2019\n\nA Chieftain of APC in Edo State, Mr. John Mayaki, has laid the blames for the party\u2019s recent struggles, including a crushing defeat in Osun State with the ouster of incumbent Governor Gboyega Oyetola, at the feet of President Muhammadu Buhari, whom he accused of negligent management of party activities and \u2018suicidal\u2019 tolerance of anti-party activities within the ranks.\n\nHe also added that the anti-party activities of top ranking APC members, governors and ministers under the President Buhari-led administration was to blame for the electoral misfortune of the party in Edo and Osun states.\n\nMayaki noted that the poor reward system of the party and that of the president, posed another negative impact on the party, adding that Buhari as the leader of the party does not appear concerned if the party collapsed under his watch.\n\nMayaki, who chaired the Media Council of the Edo APC in the 2020 governorship election, maintained that although the president\u2019s non-interference through the infamous \u2018federal might\u2019 represents a good development for the country\u2019s democracy, it still doesn\u2019t excuse the observed \u201cabandonment of his obligations as the leader of the party, who ought to be spearheading efforts to unite the ranks, enforce loyalty, and expand political control.\u201d\n\nHe warned that unless the President changes tack, his \u2018look the other way\u2019 approach to party issues might complicate the party\u2019s chances in 2023, adding: \u201cThe anti-party activities of top ranking APC members, governors and Ministers under the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration is to blame for the electoral misfortune of the party in Edo and Osun states.\n\n\u201cPoor reward system of the party and that of the president, if not checked, could impact negatively on the party just as the \u2018I don\u2019t care attitude\u2019 of Mr. President as a party man. The president is the leader of the party and he doesn\u2019t appear concerned if the party collapses under his watch.\u201d\n\nOrtom: Takeover of Nigeria by PDP Has Begun\n\nBenue State Governor, Dr. Samuel Ortom, has said the election of Senator Ademola Adeleke as the next Osun State Governor, was a precursor to the round of victories awaiting the PDP as it began to take back all the states in its resolve to rescue Nigeria from the destruction meted to it by the APC-led federal government.\n\nWhile congratulating Adeleke for his victory at Saturday\u2019s gubernatorial election, he praised him for his steadfastness, hard work and commitment to the welfare of the people that earned him the victory, saying \u201c the people have spoken\u201d.\n\nOrtom also praised the people of Osun state, the INEC, the media, civil society organisations (CSOs) and the security operatives for ensuring that the will of the people prevailed.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of myself, the government and the PDP family in Benue State, I congratulate Senator Ademola Adeleke on his election as the Governor-elect of Osun State. I am convinced that you will provide an enduring leadership for the people in appreciation for the massive support they have given you by your election.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe victory of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate; Senator Adeleke in the Osun election is a measure of trust and confidence of the citizens on him and the party \u201c, Ortom stated.\n\nWhile congratulating the National Chairman of the PDP, Senator Iyorchia Ayu and the National Working Committee of the PDP, Governor Ortom also expressed confidence that the victory of the party in Osun State would further change the political map of the South West as the PDP is ready to rescue the country from its undertakers in the APC.\n\nElumelu: PDP\u2019s Victory in Osun Marks APC\u2019s Exit in 2023\n\nMinority Leader of the PDP in the House of Representatives, Hon. Ndudi Elumelu, has congratulated Ademola Adeleke, on his victory in the Saturday, governorship election, saying it marked the exit of the APC in 2023.\n\nElumelu, in a congratulatory message, said the victory and recovery of the mandate that was allegedly stolen from Adeleke by the APC in 2018, further reinforced his popularity and that of the PDP not only in Osun State, but also in the South West geo-political zone and the nation as a whole.\n\nAccording to him, this showed that the PDP would win 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the members of our great Party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the House of Representatives, I congratulate you, the Osun State Governor-Elect, Your Excellency, Sen. Ademola Adeleke, on your well-deserved victory in the Saturday, July 16, 2022 Governorship election.\n\n\u201cYour overwhelming defeat of a sitting governor underscores the well-founded confidence and trust the people of Osun State repose in you as the leader with the desired capacity, integrity, humility, love for the people and the political will to lead their state in the right direction.\u201d\n\nAdeleke\u2019s Victory Has Vindicated Diri, Says IYC\n\nThe Ijaw Youths Council (IYC) Worldwide said the victory of Senator Ademola Adeleke at Saturday\u2019s governorship election in Osun State, was a proof of the commitment, loyalty and capacity of the Bayelsa State Governor, Senator Douye Diri, to his party, the PDP.\n\nIn a statement by the President of IYC, Peter Timothy Igbifa, he said Diri as the Chairman of the PDP Electoral Committee in Osun, proved that an Ijaw man could be trusted to deliver in a national assignment.\n\n\u201cAs a council, we noticed that some PDP leaders were not happy that an Ijaw man was appointed to handle the Osun electoral matters. They conspired against Governor Douye Diri to make him fail in his first national party assignment.\n\n\u201cThey referred to him as an inexperienced politician and tried to demean and relegate him to the background. But man is not God. Diri triumphed as a miracle governor and delivered a resounding victory to his party\u201d.\n\nIgbifa, who congratulated Diri for piloting the success of his party in Osun, said the victory of PDP had brought shame to the enemies of the Bayelsa governor and the Ijaw nation within the PDP, who had earlier conspired to make the Bayelsa governor fail in his first national party assignment.\n\nFemale Lawyers Commend INEC, Women Turn-out\n\nThe International Federation of Women Lawyers (FIDA) in a preliminary report on its observation of the governorship election in Osun State, has commended the efforts of the INEC, for the efforts at ensuring a free and fair election in Osun State.\n\nThe body also commended women for turning out en mass to exercise their franchise in selecting who governs them in Osun State for the next four years.\n\nFIDA Nigeria, in its preliminary report on the Osun poll, signed by its Country Vice President and National President, Mrs Amina Agbaje, noted that women and persons with disability were also accorded priority by the electoral umpire.\n\n\u201cReports across the Local Government Areas in Osun state observed indicate that there was early and high voter turnout for the polls across the state as security personnel, electoral officers and election materials arrived at most polling units between the hours of 8:00 \u2013 9:00am.\n\n\u201c24% of the polling units had the election materials before 8AM, 48% by 8AM and 28% by 8:30AM. Furthermore we observed that 64% polling units visited had more than one electoral official, 24% had 3 electoral officials, and 12 % had two (2) electoral officials.\n\n\u201cWith regards participation of female electoral officials, we observed that a larger percentage of the polling units visited , that is about 76% had more than 2 female electoral officials, 12% had less than 2 officials, while 12% were above 2 officials.\n\n\u201cFor instance, at polling unit 007, Ward 3, Boluwaduro LGA, polling unit 012, ward 2, Ife North LGA, accreditation commenced between 8.20- 8.30am, Similarly at polling unit 7, ward 6, Iwo LGA, accreditation commenced as early as 8am, however at polling unit 23, ward 5 , Oshogbo LGA, voters were accredited at 9.45am\u201d, Mrs Agbaje said.\n\nOn the turn out. of female voters and Persons with Disabilities, FIDA, claimed it observed a large turnout of female voters in about 88% of the polling units observed, adding that only 12% of the polling units visited had low voters.\u201d\n\nUtomi: With Transactional Politics, APC, PDP Can\u2019t Produce Good Leaders\n\nNational Leader of Labour Party, Prof Pat Utomi, has declared that, with structural deficiency by reason of their transactional politics, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressives Congress (APC) could not produce good leaders.\n\nHe also said his 2012 Leadership Newspaper Annual Lecture gave birth to the APC but that people, who hijacked power then never wanted people like him to come closer.\n\nUtomi, a Professor of Political Economics and Management, made the assertion in Benin City, capital of Edo State, weekend, at a one-day sensitisation programme organised by \u201cNigeria Can\u2019t Continue Like This\u201d NCC-LIT, with the theme: Supporters of Good Governance.\n\nAccording to him, what attracted persons him then was the anti-corruption thing, because Buhari said, when elected, he would kill corruption, so that Nigeria could make progress.\n\n\u201cHowever, because of this transactional politics, we can see what has become of the government and in my opinion, this government is the most corrupt Nigeria has ever had.\n\n\u201cASUU has been on strike forever, and look at what they are just asking for and it is for the sake of our children and this is what one man, called Accountant General can just take N170 billion from our treasury. You can see that their conscience don\u2019t worry them again, because of the structure,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, the desire to change Nigeria made him to start working with some persons on the need for a third force and that made him to be working with some groups including the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC), the Labour Commission from the thirty-six states of the country and that was how the Labour Party allied to the Labour Congress.\n\n\u201cSo, when some persons begin to project me for the presidency, and Peter Obi said the PDP thing will not work for him and came to the LP, I said okay, I will step down for him, because I am for anything that will make Nigeria work,\u201d Utomi noted.\n\nHe also disclosed that the formation of APC as a party began from a lecture he delivered in Lagos in 2012.\n\n\u201cAPC started from a lecture that I gave at the Leadership Newspaper Annual Lecture, 2012 with the title, \u2018Political Parties: Will Opposition Save Nigeria?\u2019 At the Sheraton Hotels. When I finished the lecture, Chief Paul Unongo, accosted me and said, can I just close this gate so that about one thousand persons at the lecture will not go until we know how opposition political parties should be created.\n\n\u201cOn the high table were Muhammadu Buhari, Bola Tinubu, Bisi Akande and others. In that meeting, I was mandated to go and write APC manifesto with the Vice President Yomi Osinbajo. But from the day one, it seemed that people that captured power do not want people like us around, and I just decided to stay on my own.\u201d\n\nNwosu: Relegation of Founding Fathers, Arrogance Cost APC Osun\n\nA Chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and former governorship candidate of APC in Imo State, Mr Uche Nwosu, has blamed internal crisis, arrogance, reliance on power of incumbency and poor reward system for the inability of the party to win the just concluded Osun State governorship election.\n\nNwosu, in a statement shortly after the result was announced by the INEC, noted that the APC leadership allowed internal crisis to engulf the structure of the party in nearly all the states, adding that the loss the APC suffered in Osun State was self-inflicted.\n\nHe stressed further that the arrogance of the people in power had led them to play God, while losing the commitment of party faithful.\n\n\u201cAPC lost because the party leadership allowed internal crisis to kill the structures in all the states. Secondly, arrogance contributed to the fall of the party. They believe that once you are in power, no one can do anything. APC has always believed in the power of incumbency and also remember that we have been saying it that their reward system is zero.\n\n\u201cFor instance, the founding fathers of the party are relegated to please new members. Look at how they treated the former governor of Osun State, Rauf Aregbesola, see how he was relegated, a founding member of the party and they believed he can\u2019t do anything, he should go to hell. They have seen it now,\u201d he said.\n\nOn whether the party could still bounce back ahead the 2023 general elections, Nwosu lamented that the party does not have the luxury of time to make amends.\n\n\u201cIt is getting late, in fact it is already late for the APC to retrace its steps. If they wanted to make corrections, they could have done that since; they had every opportunity to do that, but because some of the leaders in the party are very arrogant, they don\u2019t care, they are selfish and only think about themselves and we have been shouting about this but no one cared to listen. They think that once you become a governor then you have everything and nothing else matters anymore.\n\n\u201cI strongly blame the leadership of our party for the woes that have befallen the APC. God gave us power in 2015 and became arrogant with the power. We no longer care what happens, how the people feel, we don\u2019t care how the founding fathers of the party are treated, see where the arrogance has gotten us today,\u201d he said.\n\nPDP Governors Say It\u2019s Time for APC to Go\n\nThe PDP governors congratulated Ademola Adeleke and said his victory on Saturday was because of the trust Osun people reposed on him, adding that it was time for APC to go.\n\nThe party\u2019s governors said because the people could see Adeleke\u2019s heart, which was full of love and concern for the wellbeing of his people, they elected him\n\nIn a statement by the chairman of the PDP Governor, Governor Aminu Tambuwal, the party\u2019s governors said, \u201cThis victory is as a result of the sagacity, hard work, teamwork, skillful campaigns, efficient resource allocation, openness and humility exhibited by the Governor-elect \u2018\n\n\u201cHe concentrated on issues that mattered most to Osun people and they responded in kind, bestowing on him and PDP an earth-shaking victory of historic proportions. This victory is a lesson for all. It shows that everyone matters in politics, particularly the electorate. It also confirms the famous dictum that \u2018God\u2019s time is the best\u2019.\n\n\u201cWe must remain vigilant and anticipate all the antics the dying All Progressives Congress (APC) will come up with. But rest assured that we are all with you in this great effort to reset the trajectory and story of Nigeria, positively. The light has shone on Osun State, in July. It is time for the light to shine on Nigeria, again through the instrumentality of the PDP, come February, 2023.\u201d\n\nPSC, IG Say Osun Signposts Peaceful 2023 Elections\n\nThe Police Service Commission (PSC), said at the weekend, that, the commendable performance of the personnel of the Nigeria Police and during the just concluded Osun State governorship election was a signal that future elections in the country may witness good coverage by police and other security agencies.\n\nSpeaking in the same breath, the Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Mr Usman Baba, commended security operatives particularly, officers of the Nigeria Police, the military, and other security agencies as well as the electorate in Osun State for the peaceful conduct of the elections held last Saturday in the three Senatorial Districts, 30 Local Government Areas (LGAs), and 3753 polling units of the State.\n\nThe commission, in a statement, said it monitored policemen on election duties in the 30 Local Government Areas of the state and rated their performance above average.\n\n\u201cThe police men arrived the polling centres on time and were professional in their conduct. They exhibited a high level of commitment to their duties and were able to restore orderliness in most of the polling units.\n\n\u201cThere were an average of three policemen in most of the units who were properly dressed with their name tags and were also firm and courteous to voters.\u201d\n\nThe IGP applauded the massive deployment of police operatives, specialised units, and other human and operational assets including three helicopters and a couple of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for aerial surveillance in the the senatorial districts, four adequately manned gun boats for the riverine areas, and Armored Personnel Carriers (APCs) which enabled swift responses to the pockets of electoral issues.\n\nAs statement by Force Headquarters said the IGP also lauded the collaborative efforts of other security agencies which assisted in the peaceful conduct of the elections.\n\nAvoid Litigation, Congratulate Adeleke, Lawyer Tells Oyetola\n\nHuman rights lawyer, Pelumi Olajengbesi, has asked the Osun State Governor, Gboyega Oyetola, to concede defeat and congratulate the governor-elect of the state, Senator Ademola Adeleke.\n\nOlajengbesi, who is also a member of the Peoples Democratic Party, also said Oyetola would disgrace himself if he dares heads to court to challenge the electoral victory of Adeleke as announced by the Independent National Electoral Commission.\n\nThe lawyer described as a waste of time, any litigation by the APC candidate, saying even the Supreme Court cannot save Oyetola from his defeat at the polls of Saturday, July 16, 2022.\n\nHe therefore asked Oyetola to do the honorable thing and congratulate the governor-elect (Adeleke) just as President Muhammadu Buhari has done on Sunday.\n\nSecondus Felicitates Adeleke\n\nA former National Chairman of the PDP, Uche Secondus, has congratulated Ademola Adeleke on his well deserved victory at the Saturday\u2019s Osun State governorship election.\n\nSecondus said the victory was a clear affirmation and demonstration of the people\u2019s goodwill in appreciation of the efforts of the Adelekes in the development of the state.\n\nHe commended all those who contributed greatly to the victory, in particular, the PDP 2023 presidential candidate, Atiku and his running mate, Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State, among others.\n\n\u201cBy this brave and courageous act, Osun people have shown their determination to take their collective destiny in their own hands and for this PDP and all lovers of democracy are proud of them.\u201d\n\nMark: Adeleke\u2019s Victory, PDP\u2019s Gateway to 2023\n\nFormer President of the Senate, Senator David Mark, has said the victory of Ademola Adeleke, was a gateway for the PDP in 2023.\n\n\u201cYour perseverance, steadfastness, focus, determination and unwavering commitment to the wellbeing of the citizens of Osun State has paid off. Their votes are investments and trust in you to lead them to the promised Land,\u201d he said.\n\nThe former Senate President told Adeleke to see his victory as a call to higher responsibility, and the power to do good and emancipate the people from deprivation, poverty and want.\n\nHe praised the people of Osun State for remaining steadfast and believe in the capacity of Adeleke to deliver dividends of democracy to them hoping that the governor- elect will live up to expectation.\n\nMark also praised the Independent National Electoral Commission ( INEC), the security operatives and the media for the enabling environment that guaranteed free, fair and credible election in Osun state.\n\nHe said the PDP victory in Osun State shows that, \u201cthe PDP is the party of choice and the vehicle to usher In positive changes for Nigeria in 2023.\u201d\n\nAbdulsalami\u2019s Peace Committee Urges Adeleke to be Benevolent in Victory\n\nThe National Peace Committee (NPC) has described recently concluded governorship election in Osun state as a triumph of democracy.\n\nIn a statement signed by the former Nigeria\u2019s Head of State, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar (rtd), the group urged the winner of the election, Senator Adeleke Ademola Jackson Nurudeen of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to be benevolent in victory, urging him and his political party to eschew triumphalism that may make peace-building difficult after what at certain moments was a fractiously fought election\n\n\u201cWe wish to commend and congratulate the people of Osun State over their peaceful conduct during the July 16, 2022, governorship election making the following observations.\n\n\u201cWe particularly commend the people of Osun State for coming out in large numbers abiding to the procedures set out by the Electoral Act and implemented by the electoral commission. Your conduct is an admirable example of proper voter behaviour to the nation, even as we look forward to the General Elections in 2023.\n\n\u201cWe note with certainty, the efforts put in place by various stakeholders in government, Civil Society Organisations (CSOs), traditional and religious leaders, and various development partners, to ensure a peaceful and transparent atmosphere before, during and after the elections in Osun State. We are elated over this development and call for further cooperation in future elections.\n\n\u201cWhile the elections were not devoid of incidents, particularly the scourge that is vote trading, we commend the efforts of all stakeholders who have tirelessly worked either as ombudsmen or observers or participants to ensure that the elections were conducted according to the rules,\u201d. It said.\n\nAdeleke\u2019s Emergence, Victory for Democracy, Says Yaman\n\nGovernorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), in Kwara State, Alhaji Shuaibu Abdullahi Yaman, has described the electoral victory of Senator Ademola Adeleke as the governor-elect of Osun State as one for democracy.\n\nYaman also said the victory was an indictment of betrayers and traitors.\n\nHowever, in a statement in Ilorin, congratulated Adeleke and said, \u201cthe nascent Nigeria\u2019s democracy is gradually coming to an age, where the voices of the masses are resonated and counted. The PDP victory in Osun is a victory for democracy and a clear signal to political demagogues to prepare their handover notes, as the majority of the people can no longer be deceived.\u201d\n\nYaman urged Adeleke to remain committed to his electoral promises and also congratulated the PDP leadership for the support given to the winner while the campaign lasted.\n\n\u201cI, especially, congratulate the President, 8th National Assembly, Dr Abubakar Bukola Saraki, for his pioneering role in the Osun struggle,\u201d Yaman said, and implored the good people of state to vote out the clueless government in the state come 2023 election so as to create a better and prosperous future for the state.\n\nTHISDAY",

          "title": "Nigeria to Continue Setting Petrol Prices Despite NNPC\u2019s Transition to Commercial Entity",
          "text": "The Group Chief Executive Officer (GCEO) of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kyari, has maintained that determination of fuel prices would continue to be a decision by the federal government despite the firm\u2019s transitioning to a commercial entity.\n\nBut unlike his counterpart in Brazil state-run Petrobras oil company, Jose Mauro Coelho, who resigned from his post as CEO last month over President Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s interference in the company\u2019s fuel pricing policy, Kyari said that the exercise would henceforth be performed for a fee for the Nigerian government.\n\nCoelho was forced to step down from his role just days after Petrobras announced that it would increase petrol and diesel prices and Bolsonaro who is seeking re-election in October described the move as one that, \u201ccould sink Brazil into chaos.\u201d\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari also holds the same view.\n\nCoelho would be the third Petrobras CEO to have come and gone since Bolsonaro took office in early 2019, with the disagreements earlier leading to the ouster of former CEOs Roberto Castello Branco and Joaquim Silva e Luna.\n\nSpeaking during a prerecorded interview with Channels Television, on Sunday, Kyari stated that whereas before now the NNPC\u2019s function of being the sole importer may not have been on a commercial basis, it would henceforth charge a fee for the service.\n\n\u201cIn the case of the price of petroleum, this is a policy matter. And the NNPC is going to be a supplier to the Federation at a fee. So, the issue of at what price you sell petroleum will be the decision of the state.\n\n\u201cThe state has continued to maintain that we must continue to pay subsidy on petroleum products. We are happy to do this, but as a commercial venture, we will have a service-level agreement between us to render that service,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough it became a Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA) on July 1 by the provisions of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), the NNPC is expected to be officially unveiled by Buhari on Tuesday.\n\nThe president recently deferred the full deregulation of the sector, which would have seen the removal of the controversial and opaque petrol subsidy and will gulp at least N4 trillion this year, by 18 months.\n\nBut Kyari reiterated that it would no longer be business as usual, insisting that as a commercial venture, the NNPC would just be a service provider to government, rather than shouldering the responsibility of importation and allowing it hurt the company\u2019s bottom line.\n\n\u201cWe will procure the products and we will sell to the state, and will be step on step with the country and literally, I\u2019ve seen no indication at this point in time that the state is ready to change any price of petroleum products. It has nothing to do with our operations.\n\n\u201cFor us, what it really means is that this is business for us. We\u2019ll charge them a fee and at any point, so that the company can make money on behalf of its shareholders,\u201d he said during the interview.\n\nKyari, who also spoke on the new demands on the new NNPC explained that it would henceforth take the issue of transparency more seriously, having earlier joined the global Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI).\n\n\u201cMore than anything else, there\u2019s really no plan of tying this (subsidy) to our turnover and they have no relationship,\u201d he noted.\n\nAccording to him, the new NNPC will not withdraw from the international organisation, but will rather continue to ensure more openness in its operations to attract more investments and foreign partnerships.\n\n\u201cActually it now becomes more demanding to be more transparent. NNPC is a partner company for the global EITI initiative, like very many other private companies that voluntarily chose to become partner company to the EITI.\n\n\u201cThe meaning of this is that you\u2019re going to make certain disclosures to your shareholders and to the world community that companies ordinarily are not required to do and we will keep to that because we\u2019re not going to withdraw as a partner company to the EITI.\n\n\u201cThat means that there are further requirements beyond what we are doing today. Beyond just publishing your financial statements, there are very many other disclosure requirements for being a partner company to EITI.\n\n\u201cWe believe that this is good for our company, we will continue to sustain this. And as a matter of fact, as you may be aware, we\u2019re the only company that publishes its operational reports: production, sales and everything on a monthly basis,\u201d he said.\n\nKyari explained that although there\u2019s no statutory obligation to make those operational disclosures, the new NNPC\u2019s commitment to getting it right remains unwavering.\n\n\u201cNo company does this anywhere in the world. There\u2019s no requirement to do this. As a matter of fact, I\u2019ll borrow one of my colleagues\u2019 view that we\u2019re actually not just transparent, we are actually naked.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re happy telling people that this is who we are. This is what we\u2019re trying to do and on their behalf and also because companies and partners, particularly the lending community, the global energy community would like to see what you\u2019re doing.\n\n\u201cOnce they do, trust becomes higher and your ability to access capital becomes real and easier. And ultimately it gives you all the advantage that you require, so you lose nothing by being transparent,\u201d he stressed.\n\nAside being the sole importer of petroleum products, the NNPC has yet to explain what happens to its other major function of contributing monthly to the Federation Account since by law CAMA companies only pay dividends to their shareholders annually.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",

          "text": "The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has expressed its resolve to hold a two-day national protest to demand the immediate reopening of the country\u2019s public-owned tertiary institutions which have been shut for five months.\n\nThe resolution by the NLC came just as the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), Usman Danfodio University chapter has debunked claims by the Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige that its medical lecturers have backed out of the ongoing strike embarked upon by the university lecturers\u2019 union.\n\nThe NLC accused the federal government of not negotiating in good faith to resolve the crisis in Nigeria\u2019s public Universities.\n\nThe Labour movement had at its National Executive Council (NEC) meeting held in Abuja, on June 30, 2022, threatened to embark on a nationwide protest to compel, \u201cthe federal government to conclude the ongoing negotiation with trade unions in Nigeria\u2019s universities and be prepared to commence implementation of whatever Collective Bargaining Agreement arising therefrom so that public universities in Nigeria can resume normal activities.\u201d\n\nThe federal government was then given a 21-day ultimatum to resolve the dispute or face a one-day nationwide labour protest which might culminate in a full blown worker\u2019s strike.\n\nThe ultimatum would end on July 26.\n\nHowever, in a mobilisation letter sent to all the state branches of NLC and the Federal Capital Territory, the Congress directed them to activate all the mechanisms to implement the decision of NEC to organise a national protest beginning from Wednesday, July 26 to Thursday, July 27.\n\nAmong the resolutions reached at the NEC meeting were the condemnation of the alleged unserious attitude of government to negotiations as well the activation of, \u201cno work\u2013no pay\u201d policy on the striking university workers.\n\nThe NEC described the stoppage of salaries of the university workers as draconian.\n\nThe NEC went on to resolve to organise a one-day solidarity action in support of Congress affiliates in the education sector.\n\nBut in a statement issued Sunday, NLC President, Ayuba Wabba, said the decision of the NEC have been activated accordingly with a circular to affiliates and state councils for compliance.\n\nThe NLC lamented the delay in resolving the dispute between members of ASUU and other non-teaching staff unions despite the setting up high-powered negotiating team headed by the Chief of Staff to the President, Prof. Ibrahim Agboola Gambari for that purpose.\n\nIt also recalled that a tripartite meeting was convened by the federal government on May 12, 2022, at the instance of the organised labour and well-meaning Nigerians to resolve the crises in the tertiary institutions.\n\nAccording to NLC, negotiations were held and the meeting was adjourned for three weeks to allow the Prof. Nimi-Briggs Committee to turn in their report and also to allow the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) to subject all the proposed unviersity payment platforms to integrity test including IPPIS.\n\n\u201cThe committee was asked to conclude its work and report back to the negotiation meeting.\n\nIt was the federal government at the Tripartite Plus negotiation meeting, that requested that the meeting be adjourned for three weeks to enable the Briggs Committee to submit their report and for integrity test to be conducted on the payment platform proposed by the trade unions.\n\n\u201cHow can government now turn around to blame the unions for the work of a committee they appointed? This was the same way the last committee report on this matter was aborted,\u201d it stated.\n\nThe NLC statement added: \u201cGiven the foregoing and in line with the resolutions of the NEC of the Nigeria Labour Congress which took place on the 30th of June 2022, we demand the following from the federal government:\n\n\u201cThe federal government should immediately conclude the ongoing negotiation with trade unions in Nigeria\u2019s universities and be prepared to commence implementation of whatever Collective Bargaining Agreement arising therefrom so that public universities in Nigeria can resume normal activities.\n\n\u201cThe federal government should immediately pay the salaries of striking university workers which had been frozen on the premise of the so-called \u201cno work-no pay\u201d policy especially as recommended by the leaders of Nigeria\u2019s two major faiths.\n\n\u201cWe demand that the federal government meets these demands in line with the resolutions of the statutory organs of the Congress.\n\n\u201cAll the decisions of the NEC have been activated accordingly with a circular to affiliates and state councils of Nigeria Labour Congress.\u201d\n\nNLC also spoke on the need for the review of the 2009 Collective Bargaining Agreement between the federal government and the union in the tertiary institutions, saying that it had expired long before now.\n\n\u201cGiven the free fall of Nigeria\u2019s currency, the naira, and its continuous devaluation, the need for the review of the 2009 Collective Bargaining Agreement is public knowledge.\n\n\u201cAs it stands today, the highest earning university Professor and staff earns less than $800 as take-home pay. This is indeed very ridiculous and is a major factor to the high rate of brain drain in our system making us unable to retain our best brains.\u201d\n\nASUU Debunks Minister\u2019s Claims That Medical Lecturers Suspended Strike\n\nMeanwhile, ASUU, Usman Danfodio University Chapter has debunked claims by Ngige that its medical lecturers have back out from the ongoing strike embarked upon by the union.\n\nIn a statement at the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) Secretariat, Sokoto, Sunday, the chairperson of the union, Prof. Muhammad Almustapha accused Ngige of misleading Nigerians.\n\nHe added that recently Ngige in an interview with Arise TV on 14 July, 2022, had said the medical lecturers of the university had suspended the strike since it didn\u2019t produce the desired results.\n\n\u201cNgige on the July 14, 2022 pitiably and shamefully said medical lecturers of the university are at work, they have written their Vice Chancellor that they are at work.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the statement was the imagination of the minister which was intended to misinform the general public against the sensibility of Nigerians.\n\nHe explained that Ngige depicted his inhumane nature and wanton disregard for truth, honesty and integrity a character unbefitting of a federal minister.\n\n\u201cHow could a senior minister of the Federal Republic, who is supposed to be an elder statesman continue to dish out disinformation to over 200 million Nigerians, knowing fully well that he was not saying the truth,\u201d he added.\n\nHe maintained that Ngige had not be telling the president the true picture of things about the negotiations, calling on the minister to resign with immediate effect.\n\nHe further disclosed that the entire members of ASUU, UDUS branch including the College of Health Sciences were fully on total and comprehensive strike and have never had the intention of calling it off until federal government wake up to its responsibilities.\n\n\u201cContrary to Ngige claims there is no letter written by the Vice Chancellor of Usman Danfodio University, Sokoto or any of his representatives or any union officials, depicting that the medical lecturers are not on strike.\n\n\u201cWe challenge the self-acclaimed \u201cConciliator,\u201d Dr. Chris Ngige to produce any factual evidence to back his crooked claims,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe said his calling on Ngige to resign was not on personal hatred for the minister, but based on his antics and biasness which earned Nigeria number of strikes during his tenure.\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja and Onuminya Innocent in Sokoto",

          "text": "Sri Lanka\u2019s acting president, Ranil Wickremesinghe, has declared a state of emergency as his administration seeks to quell social unrest and tackle an economic crisis gripping the island nation.\n\n\u201cIt is expedient, so to do, in the interests of public security, the protection of public order and the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the life of the community,\u201d a government notice released late on Sunday said.\n\nWickremesinghe had announced a state of emergency last week, after president Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country to escape a popular uprising against his government.\n\nIt was unclear whether that order had been withdrawn or had lapsed, or whether Wickremesinghe had reissued the order in his capacity as acting president, having been sworn in on 15 July. A spokesperson for Wickremesinghe\u2019s office did not respond to Reuters request for comment.\n\nThe specific legal provisions of the latest emergency are yet to be announced by the government but previous emergency regulations have been used to deploy the military to arrest and detain people, search private property and dampen public protests.\n\nThe country\u2019s commercial capital, Colombo, remained calm on Monday morning, with traffic and pedestrians out on the streets.\n\nBhavani Fonseka, senior researcher at the Centre for Policy Alternatives, said declaring a state of emergency was becoming the government\u2019s default response.\n\n\u201cThis has proven ineffective in the past,\u201d Fonseka told Reuters.\n\nRajapaksa\u2019s resignation was accepted by parliament on Friday. He flew to the Maldives and then Singapore after hundreds of thousands of anti-government protesters came out on to the streets of Colombo a week ago and occupied his official residence and offices.\n\nSri Lanka\u2019s parliament met on Saturday to begin the process of electing a new president, and a shipment of fuel arrived to provide some relief to the crisis-hit nation.\n\nWickremesinghe, an ally of Rajapaksa, was nominated by the ruling party as its candidate to be the next president but protesters also want him gone, leading to the prospect of further unrest should he be elected.\n\nWickremesinghe was appointed interim president on Friday after informally occupying the role since Wednesday, and the announcement was greeted with anger and frustration on the streets of Colombo.\n\nWickremesinghe, who has now been prime minister six times, stands accused of protecting and propping up the Rajapaksa family dynasty for years, shielding them from corruption charges and enabling their return to power.\n\nHis decision to agree to become a caretaker prime minister two months ago was seen by many as the reason Rajapaksa stayed in power for weeks longer than he would have otherwise.\n\nThe public frustration at Wickremesinghe has manifested multiple times, from his private residence being burned down to his offices being stormed by protesters on Wednesday.\n\nWickremesinghe will be the candidate for the Rajapaksas\u2019 ruling party, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), which still has the largest number of seats in parliament. He stands a high chance of being elected after the vote by MPs in parliament scheduled for next Tuesday or Wednesday.\n\nWickremesinghe\u2019s nomination even appeared to cause divisions with the SLPP. The party chair, GL Peiris, sent a letter to the party\u2019s general secretary expressing \u201camazement and total disbelief\u201d at the statement that it would be backing Wickremesinghe as its presidential nominee.\n\nHowever, Wickremesinghe will be up against several candidates in the presidential secret ballot next week, including the leader of the opposition, Sajith Premadasa \u2013 who has vowed to make sure \u201can elective dictatorship never, ever occurs\u201d and go after the leaders who \u201clooted the country\u201d \u2013 and another SLPP politician, Dullas Alahapperuma, which could split the vote of the ruling party.\n\nFormer army chief Sarath Fonseka has also signalled his intention to run.",
