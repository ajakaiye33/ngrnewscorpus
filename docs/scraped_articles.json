Photo: AFP\n\nSri Lanka\u2019s President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled his official residence on Saturday shortly before protesters, angered by an unprecedented economic crisis, overran the compound and stormed his nearby office.\n\nThousands of people had surrounded the leader\u2019s home to demand his resignation, blaming government mismanagement for a downturn that has subjected the island nation\u2019s 22 million people to months of bitter hardship.\n\nAs the crowd surged at the gates of the presidential palace, troops guarding the compound fired in the air to hold them back until Rajapaksa was safely removed.\n\n\u201cThe president was escorted to safety,\u201d a top defence source told AFP on condition of anonymity. \u201cHe is still the president, he is being protected by a military unit.\u201d\n\nFootage broadcast live on social media showed hundreds of people walking through the palace, with some among the boisterous crowd jumping into the compound\u2019s pool for a swim.\n\nOthers were seen laughing and lounging in the stately bedrooms of the residence.\n\nThe colonial-era state mansion is one of Sri Lanka\u2019s key symbols of state power and officials said Rajapaksa\u2019s departure raised questions as to whether he intended to remain in office.\n\n\u201cWe are awaiting instructions,\u201d a top civil servant told AFP. \u201cWe still don\u2019t know where he is, but we know he is with the Sri Lanka navy and is safe.\u201d\n\nPrivate broadcasters showed what appeared to be a vehicle convoy belonging to the president at Sri Lanka\u2019s main international airport, but there was no confirmation on whether he had left the island.\n\nSoon after the crowd stormed the presidential palace, Rajapaksa\u2019s nearby office also fell into the hands of protesters.\n\nSecurity forces attempted to disperse the huge crowds that had mobbed Colombo\u2019s administrative district.\n\nThree people were hospitalised after being shot along with 36 others who suffered breathing difficulties following intense tear gas barrages, a spokeswoman for the main hospital in Colombo said.\n\nPrime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who would assume the presidency in the event of Rajapaksa\u2019s resignation, has called an urgent cabinet meeting to discuss a \u201cswift resolution\u201d to the political crisis.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Not a deterrent\u2019 \u2013\n\nSri Lanka has suffered through months of food and fuel shortages, lengthy blackouts and galloping inflation after running out of foreign currency to import vital goods.\n\nThousands of people had poured into the capital for Saturday\u2019s demonstration, the latest outbreak of unrest sparked by the crisis.\n\nPolice had withdrawn a curfew issued on Friday after opposition parties, rights activists and the bar association threatened to sue the police chief.\n\nThousands of anti-government protesters ignored the stay-home order and even forced railway authorities to operate trains to take them to Colombo for Saturday\u2019s rally, officials said.\n\n\u201cThe curfew was not a deterrent, in fact it encouraged more people to get on the streets in defiance,\u201d the defence official said.\n\n\u201cPassengers had commandeered trains to reach Colombo.\u201d\n\nThe country has nearly exhausted already scarce supplies of petrol, but protesters backed by the main opposition parties hired private buses to travel to the capital.\n\nDemonstrators had for months been camped outside Rajapaksa\u2019s seafront office to demand his resignation over the government\u2019s mismanagement of the crisis.\n\nSoldiers armed with assault rifles were bussed into Colombo on Friday to reinforce police guarding Rajapaksa\u2019s official residence.\n\nAuthorities said they had deployed nearly 20,000 troops and police officers for a security operation to protect the president.\n\nSri Lanka has defaulted on its $51 billion external debt and has been in bailout talks with the International Monetary Fund.\n\nNine people were killed and hundreds wounded when clashes erupted across the country after Rajapaksa loyalists attacked peaceful protesters outside the president\u2019s office in May.\n\nAFP",

At this point in time, it is very essential for us to join our hands, pray with one voice and ask God for peace across the nation.\u201d\n\nEneukwu also stressed the importance of using this period to pray for enemies of peace in the country to be exposed; while urging Nigerians to keep on supporting the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nHe, however, called for support toward the Presidential flag bearer of the ruling party, Sen. Bola Tinubu; while also urging Nigerians to jettison the politics of calumny ahead of the forthcoming 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cNigeria is our country and we must work hard to make it habitable for all, by putting hands on deck to say no to terrorism, kidnapping, banditry, thuggery and other vices that reduce the progress of our dear country.\n\n\u201cThe rate of killings in the country is enormously excruciating; as human beings are being slaughtered everyday like animals.\n\n\u201cWe must use this period to reflect on the importance of giving value to human lifes as no religion supports killing of humans but rather encourages peace and oneness.\n\n\u201cPrayers are required at this point in time to help the efforts of the security agencies in their quest to protect our lives and properties,\u201d he said.

          "text": "From Adanna Nnamani, Abuja\n\nThe $44 billion Twitter acquisition deal by Tesla Chief Executive Officer, Elon Musk has collapsed after he sent a letter to Twitter\u2019s board on Friday saying he is terminating the deal.\n\nAccording to newsmax, Twitter did not immediately respond to a message for comment. It is not entirely clear whether Twitter\u2019s board will accept the $1 billion breakup fee or if there will be a court battle over the deal.\n\nThe possible unraveling of the deal is just the latest twist in a saga between the world\u2019s richest man and one of the most influential social media platforms. Much of the drama has played out on Twitter, with Musk \u2014 who has more than 95 million followers \u2014 lamenting that the company was failing to live up to its potential as a platform for free speech.\n\nOn Friday, shares of Twitter fell 5% to $36.81, well below the $54.20 that Musk had offered to pay. Shares of Tesla, meanwhile, climbed 2.5% to $752.29.\n\nIn a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Musk said Twitter has \u201cnot complied with its contractual obligations\u201d surrounding the deal, namely giving Musk enough information to \u201cmake an independent assessment of the prevalence of fake or spam accounts on Twitter\u2019s platform.\u201d\n\nMusk\u2019s flirtation with buying Twitter appeared to begin in late March. That was when Twitter said he contacted members of its board \u2014 including co-founder Jack Dorsey \u2014 and told them he was buying up shares of the company and interested in either joining the board, taking Twitter private or starting a competitor. Then, on April 4, he revealed in a regulatory filing that he had become the company\u2019s largest shareholder after acquiring a 9% stake worth about $3 billion.\n\nAt first, Twitter offered Musk a seat on its board. But six days later, Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal tweeted that Musk will not be joining the board after all. His bid to buy the company came together quickly after that.\n\nIn a regulatory filing prepared by his lawyers, Mr. Musk said he wanted to terminate the Twitter deal because of a continuing disagreement over the number of spam accounts on the platform. He claimed that Twitter had not provided information necessary to calculate the number of those accounts \u2014 which the company has said is lower than 5 percent \u2014 and that the company had appeared to make inaccurate statements.",

They happen. And I want to assure you that all those who are supposed to play a role in ensuring that the attack is neutralized did the best that they could to neutralize it. I think what helped them (terrorists) was the number of people they came with and the superior weapons that they came with. And because nobody anticipated it, the few people who are there guarding the place could not withstand the number that they came with. I think that was what happened.\n\n\u201cLike I said, this investigation is still going on. You will only do good to allow the investigation to continue and maybe by the time they finish, you will be able to get the details of what actually happened and why it happened.\u201d\n\nDingyadi revealed that some of the assailants were killed.\n\n\u201cSome of them have been killed. But I can\u2019t give you the number and I don\u2019t know the number. Because like they use to do, whenever one of them is killed, they take the corpse away and you cannot know the number of people who have been killed but definitely quite a number of them were killed and many of them runway with bullet wounds.\u201d The minister said the meeting which was summoned by President Buhari, reviewed the security situation in the country, particularly the Kuje jail break as a result of the attacks on the Correctional Centre by terrorists, the banditry attack in Katsina, as well as the various attacks on Shiroro local government of Niger State. The minister said the President was deeply concerned about the recent developments.\n\n\u201cMr. president is surprised that what happened in Kuje actually took place in spite of all the security arrangement that has been made to ensure that such an incident does not happen.\n\n\u201cWe are assuring the nation and Nigerians in general that arrangements have been made to ensure that full investigations are carried out to ensure that a repeat of these incidences will not occur. The service chiefs have been given very clear directives to ensure that adequate measures are taken not only to investigate what happened, but also to take steps to forestall the reoccurrence of such incidences. We call on Nigerians to continue to support the Federal Government, in its effort to ensure that we fight criminalities to finish and to ensure that this country is brought back to normalcy in a more secure and a more peaceful atmosphere.\n\n\u201cWe are moving toward 2023, and government is committed to ensuring that there\u2019s peace, tranquility to ensure a very credible and a peaceful and transparent elections in Osun State come early next week.\u201d",

In his message, the President assured Nigerians that he won\u2019t rest until he brings relief to Nigerians, adding that he is quite aware of the difficulties people are facing. He promised that he is working to resolve them. He called on Nigerians to put the interest of the country above selfish interests and to \u201cuse religion as a motivation for the love of our common humanity.\u201d\n\nMr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, the Lagos State governor, urged Nigerians, especially Muslims to imbibe the lessons of the sacrifice made by Prophet Ibrahim and work for the unity, peace and progress of the nation.\n\nIn a public statement issued on his behalf by his Special Assistant on Media, Kelvin Ebiri, Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State, assured that Rivers State government would continue to protect the rights of every citizen in the state and to guarantee the freedom of worship and association as enshrined in the constitution.\n\nGovernor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, of Rivers State, wished Muslim faithful and all Nigerians a pleasant and safe celebration while urging them to rededicate themselves to God and to continue to pray fervently for the peace, unity, security and progress of the nation. Former Senate President Bukola Saraki, while congratulating Nigerian Muslims and other faithful across the world urged members of the Ummah in Nigeria to use the occasion of the festival to pray for peace, security, unity, and prosperity in the country because lack of these elements is threatening to disintegrate the country and set her people against each other.\n\nOsun Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, in a statement released by his Chief Press Secretary, Ismail Omipidan, the governor implored the Muslim faithful to always exhibit the act of genuine sacrifice and submission to the will of Allah, which he said, are the major lessons of the festival.\n\nGovernor Hope Uzodimma of Imo State yesterday put the Muslim community in Imo in a celebratory mood by giving them two cows and two truckloads of 50 kilogramme bags of rice to the admiration of their leaders. The entire Muslim community In Imo State which includes the Hausas, the Oba of Yaruba in Imo State, the Chairman and Secretary of the Hausa Community in Imo State and other leaders were around to receive the gifts.\n\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila urged Nigerian Muslims, to redouble their prayers for the country. Similarly, the minority caucus, in the House, in a statement by its leader, Ndudi Elumelu, charged Nigerians to use the occasion to pray for the country as well as renew their trust in God, with sense of patriotism towards nation building.\n\nAsiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the Presidential flag bearer for All Progressives Congress (APC), while extending greetings to all Muslims in Nigeria and around the world urged their Muslim faithful in Nigeria to take a stand against terror and injustice, especially the spate of violent attacks on innocent Nigerians.\u201d His wife, Senator Oluremi Tinubu prayed that the spirit of community, togetherness and compassionate generosity would bring good tidings to all as \u201cwe collectively confront our challenges as a nation and build a peaceful and prosperous Nigeria.\u201d\n\nOthers who sent out messages include Prof Nora Ladi Daduut, representing Plateau South at the National Assembly and Speaker, Nasarawa State House of Assembly Ibrahim Balarabe Abdullahi. While Daduut commended Muslims in Plateau South Senatorial district for the roles they have played in sustaining the peace, unity and development of the nation despite the numerous challenges confronting them, Abdullahi who wished all Muslims a successful Sallah celebration, emphasized the need for all to be law-abiding citizens and to remain committed to constituted authorities. In a press statement it released in Lagos, Globacom urged the Nigerian faithful to celebrate with love and to abide by the teachings of the Holy Koran. The Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Olalekan Balogun, Alli-Okunmade II, and the Chairman, Senate Committee on Local Contents, Teslim Folarin, urged the adherents of Islamic faith not to be carried away by wining and dining that the slaughtering of rams would naturally attract, but the essence of the revered and significant event.",

Even then, millions of people will troop to the various praying grounds on Sallah day to give glory to Almighty Allah for preserving them and to also make more requests to the ultimate provider. I enjoin those who are fortunate to go to the praying grounds to remember to pray for our country and our fellow citizens who wish to join the prayers but could not make it because of one unfortunate incident or the other beyond their control.\n\n\u201cNigerian Muslims should rise together and pray for the country and the citizenry. We should ask Allah to forgive our sins and restore peace and prosperity in our country. We should call on Almighty Allah to heal our land and help us defeat all those who have waged wars against the country.\n\n\u201cMuslims should use the Eid-el-Kabir festival to rededicate ourselves to Allah and truly demonstrate the values recommended by our religion in our actions, activities, and transactions. Those who are fortunate to have should share with the less privileged and live happily and with tolerance for people of other faiths and tongues.\n\n\u201cAs we get ready to go to the polls next year to elect new leaders, we should pray for the guidance of Allah in doing what is right and working honestly for the elections to produce leaders whose policies, programmes, and projects will restore unity, peace, stability, prosperity, inclusivity, justice, equity and patriotism in our country.\n\n\u201cIt is necessary to reiterate my usual prayers for the men and women in the various security services who are on the frontlines and genuinely fighting to secure the country and halt the menace posed by the deviants seeking to destroy the country. May the protection of Almighty Allah be on such patriotic and loyal security officials and may He give them victory against the warmongers.\n\n\u201cOnce again, I congratulate all our Muslim brothers and sisters and wish them happy Sallah. Eid Mubarak. Ma salaam,\u201d Saraki stated.",

          "text": "Fidelis David\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents of Rufus Giwa Polytechnic, Owo, Ondo State yesterday protested the death of one of their colleagues, Folarera Ademola, an ND1 student from the Department of Science Laboratory Technology who was allegedly killed by an officer of the state Security Network Agency, codenamed Amotekun corps.\n\nThe protesting students have also given the state government a 24-hour ultimatum to hand over the said officer to the Nigeria Police for proper prosecution, take charge of the deceased\u2019s burial, and compensate the family.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the students, the Students\u2019 Union President, Olorunda Oluwafemi, confirmed that the boy was shot on the 27th of June by an officer of the Amotekun in front of his parents\u2019 house.\n\nOluwafemi added that the deceased suffered the gunshot wounds for 10 days before he was taken to the federal medical centre Owo, where he gave up the ghost yesterday (Thursday).\n\nThe protesting students also marched from the school gate through the Palace of Olowo before taking the protest to the governor\u2019s office at Alagbaka, Akure, to further express their grievances.\n\nAnother student of the institution who preferred anonymity told THISDAY that \u201cafter he was shot, Amotekun took Ademola to a local herbalist for extraction of bullet pellets lodged in his thighs and stomach but ended up abandoning him there.\n\nAdemola\u2019s mother was denied access to him until his health worsened and he was referred to a hospital considered to be quack. In his failed attempts to resuscitate Ademola\u2019s health, the quack doctor allegedly quickly sent him to Federal Medical Centre, Owo, where he later died. The bullets had eaten up his intestines and severely damaged his liver,\u201d he added.\n\nReacting through a statement, the state Commander of Amotekun, Mr. Adetunji Adeleye, said he received with dismay and sadness the news of the death of the student.\n\nWhile explaining what led to the unfortunate death of the student, Adeleye said, \u201cIn its avowed determination to ensure that Ondo State is rid of criminal elements, the state Amotekun Corps is investigating the case of a syndicate that specialises in attacking Okada riders with dangerous weapons and dispossess them of their motorcycles in the process.\n\n\u201cLuck however ran out of one of the syndicates who was given a hot chase into a building in Owo by men of the Amotekun corps where other 15 members of the gang were met in the building, seven out of the men stacked naked inside the room filled with smoke. And four Okadas were also found inside the bedroom,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Adeleye, \u201cafter introducing themselves to the men, the men struggled to disarm the operative whose alarm attracted the other two outside.\n\n\u201cIn an attempt to apprehend the suspect, they swung on men of the corps, trying to disarm them and in the course of the struggle, one of their rifles triggered off and hit one of the suspects and an Amotekun officer.\u201d\n\nHe noted that at that instance, none of them told Amotekun officers that they were students.\n\nHe said that his men eventually overpowered the suspects, arrested and took them to the corps office in Owo where they were detained while investigation continued.\n\n\u201cWe sincerely register our condolences to the family and friends of the deceased while we continue with our in depth and thorough investigation to the real cause of his death,\u201d he added",

          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja with agency report\n\n\n\nA United States Appeals Court yesterday said Exxon Mobil Corp and Royal Dutch Shell Plc affiliates may try to enforce part of a $1.8 billion arbitration award against Nigeria\u2019s state-run oil company, in a dispute concerning oil extraction near the African country\u2019s coastline.\n\nIn a 3-0 decision, the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said a lower court judge erred in rejecting the entire October 2011 award, which by 2018 had grown to $2.67 billion including interest, against the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).\n\nIt said the judge should have determined which parts of the award had been deemed enforceable by a Nigerian appeals court, a Reuters report stated.\n\nLawyers for the companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe dispute arose from a 1993 contract for Esso Exploration and Production Nigeria Ltd and Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Co to invest billions of dollars to develop the Erha oil field on the Gulf of Guinea, and share profits with NNPC.\n\nExtraction began in 2006. But disagreements soon arose, and Exxon and Shell said that by late 2007 NNPC was at the government\u2019s behest \u201clifting\u201d more oil than the contract allowed, depriving them of billions of dollars.\n\nFollowing the arbitration ruling, Exxon and Shell sought to enforce their award in Manhattan while NNPC sought to set it aside in Nigeria.\n\nIn yesterday\u2019s decision, Circuit Judge Susan Carney said Exxon and Shell did not prove that setting aside part of the award violated public policy, and said U.S. courts should not second-guess Nigerian courts\u2019 substantive views on Nigerian law.\n\nBut she said the Nigerian judgments were \u201cambiguous\u201d as to how much of the award was set aside, and more fact-finding was needed.\n\nThis decision partially reversed a September 2019 ruling by U.S. District Judge William Pauley in Manhattan. Pauley died last July, and another judge will take over the case, the Reuters report added.\n\nThe case is marked Esso Exploration and Production Nigeria Ltd et al v Nigerian National Petroleum Corp, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Nos. 19-3159, 19-3361.\n\nAccording to court papers arising from the 2019 judgment, the 1993 contract anticipated that Exxon and Shell affiliates would invest billions of dollars to extract oil from the Erha field, about 60 miles (97 km) off Nigeria\u2019s coast, and share profits with NNPC.\n\nBut the affiliates, Esso Exploration and Production Nigeria Ltd and Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Co Ltd, accused NNPC of unilaterally \u201clifting\u201d more oil than was contractually allowed, at the behest of Nigeria\u2019s government, depriving them of billions of dollars of oil.",

          "text": "It was a sunny Saturday afternoon in Gaa-Lamba, a community in the Asa Local Government Area of Kwara State.\n\nSalamatu Ayinde, a 26-year-old nursing mother, stood in front of her house with a worried look on her face.\n\nBorehole at Gaa-Lamba Village\n\nClad in a brown-striped wrapper that barely covered her chest, the nursing mother had her gaze fixed on the ground and one hand on her collarbone.\n\nMs Ayinde was lost in thought when SaharaReporters approached her to inquire about the Zonal Intervention Project (ZIP)-facilitated borehole in her community.\n\nShe looked up with a jolt, sighed and began to complain bitterly.\n\n\u201cThat borehole has never been useful to us. It stopped working a few moments after its inauguration in January 2021,\u201d she said, leading SaharaReporters to the borehole at the back of her house. \u201cSince then, water has been a big challenge.\u201d\n\nMs Ayinde's major concern that afternoon was where to get water to perform her house chores as a housewife.\n\nFor her water needs, the nursing mother had relied on a neighbour who had a borehole in her community.\n\n\u201cEvery morning we usually take our bucket to a neighbour's compound to fetch,\u201d Ms Ayinde said, gloomily. \u201cBut for the last few days, they have refused to pump water because they said people always disturb their sleep while fetching in the morning.\"\n\nMs Ayinde is not the only one disturbed about the water situation in the community. A woman in the community who identified herself as Iya-Ibeji is also troubled.\n\n\u201cIn Gaa-Lamba, to get common water is a big problem for us,\" said the short fair woman. \u201cWe have complained to our community leader so many times, but they have done nothing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\"When this borehole was brought, we thought we had finally won the battle of trekking long distances to get a bucket of water. But our joy was short-lived when the borehole could not serve us beyond a few days.\n\nGaa-Lamba is one of the communities that benefited from the Zonal Intervention Borehole Water Project facilitated by an honourable member of the Federal House of Representatives, representing Asa/Ilorin West Federal Constituency, Abdulyekeen Alajagusi. But, the finding shows that even though the new borehole was installed, it could not serve the people beyond a few after it was opened.\n\nThe Water Situation In Kwara\n\nPoor access to clean and potable water for use in many households across Nigeria has contributed majorly to the spread of waterborne diseases such as cholera, typhoid, and several others.\n\nAccording to data from Water and Sanitary Hygiene National Outcome Routine Mapping (WASH NORM) in 2019, only 14 per cent of the country\u2019s population have access to safely managed drinking water supply facilities.\n\nThe survey also shows that access for people in rural communities is four times less than the population of urban areas. This is due to such supply points being more than 30 minutes away from their homes.\n\nMeanwhile, in a recent report by UNICEF and the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the north-central region ranks lowest of all geopolitical zones in the number of people using basic water supply, sanitation services.\n\nOut of the 36 states and the federal capital territory (FCT), Kwara ranks 36th, just a step above Ebonyi which sits at the bottom of the table.\n\nUNICEF reports that when sources of water are not within immediate premises, women and children pay the price of water collection.\n\nThe N100M Water Projects\n\nTo bring potable water closer to the people of his constituency, In 2020, a member of the Federal House of Representatives, representing Asa/Ilorin West Federal Constituency, Abdulyekeen Alajagusi, nominated projects for the provision of motorized boreholes at Alapa/Onire Odegiwa Ward and at Afon, in the Asa Local Government Area of Kwara State at the sum of N25 million each (N50 Million in total).\n\nThe projects, which were part of the 2020 Appropriation Act, were aimed at resolving water scarcity across six villages. These villages are Gaa-Lamba, Labintan Alakuko, Giwa-Olowo, Ile Baale Afon, Sakama, and Gaa-Igboroko. It was placed under the supervision of the Lower Niger River Basin Development Authority (LNRBDA).\n\nA document released by the supervising agency which was obtained by SaharaReporters revealed that the budgeted sum (N100,000,000.00) was totally cash-backed on the projects.\n\nOn-site fact-finding\n\nTo monitor the projects, SaharaReporters embarked on site verification of these borehole projects supervised by the Lower Niger River Basin Development Authority (LNRBDA) at Alapa/Onire Odegiwa Ward.\n\nVisits to the locations of these projects revealed that although new boreholes were installed at these villages, except for the one built at Giwa Olowo village that was found still serving the community, the other two installed at Labintan Alakuko and 0Gaa-Lamba could not solve the problem of water scarcity in these communities.\n\nThe borehole built at Gaa-Lamba was not functioning during SaharaReporters\u2019 investigation, while that of Labitan Alakuko was functioning but could not serve the population that depended on it.\n\n\"The borehole is working but the problem is that it is not pumping water well,\" said Ismaila Alao, a resident of Labitan Alakuko Village.\n\n\"To fetch a 25-litre jerry-can, you would need to wait for at least an hour and this is why many residents do not even bother about the borehole.\n\n\"As you can see, it has been a while since we went there because no one is ready to contribute money to buy petrol and at the end, the borehole will not pump well,\" he added.\n\nLike many disadvantaged communities in Kwara, where the presence of government was not felt in any way, people of Labitan Alakuko village have many years relied on wells and a stream for their survival and the women in the communities have to struggle daily with walking long distances to the stream to fetch water for drinking, cooking and doing chores.\n\nWhen the borehole had just been drilled, it was a dream come true as women, children and men joyfully thought going to streams to get water would be a thing of the past.\n\n\u201cBut we are still going to the streams to fetch water because the borehole is not enough for us,\" said a woman who was too angered to give her name.\n\nAFON\n\nWhen SaharaReporters visited the locations for the second phase of the projects in Afon, it was discovered that boreholes were installed at Ile Baale Afon, Sakama and Gaa-Igboroko villages.\n\nWhile the people of Ile-Baale Afon were still benefiting from the water project installed in front of their community, residents of Sakama and Gaa-Igboroko complained of lack of water as the boreholes installed were not functioning. They were still forced to trek long distances to neighbouring villages in search of potable water.\n\nBalikisu, a mother of five who is a resident of Sakama village said, \"We fetch water from wells or streams. And Sometimes, we pay pushcart users money to get water for us to drink and do our house chores.\n\n\"All this would have stopped if the borehole installed for us was working well,\" Balikisu added.\n\n\n\nLNRBDA Spends 50 Million Naira On Ote-Ballah Dam But No Value Derives\n\nAnother water project nominated in 2020 by Abdulyekeen Alajagusi for the people of his constituency was the rehabilitation of the Ote-Ballah Dam. N50 million was allocated in the 2020 Federal Government budget for the rehabilitation of this dam in the Asa Local Government Area of Kwara.\n\nAccording to the information received from Lower Niger River Basin Development Authority (LNRBDA), the total sum of N50M was released to rehabilitate the dam which has been abandoned since 2003 and awarded to Micheal Jacobs Consulting Limited.\n\nA visit to the dam by SaharaReporters showed that despite the public funds committed to the project, residents of the communities are yet to derive value for the money as they still scramble for water to meet their daily needs.\n\n\"It has been over ten years we fetched tap water here,\" said Kamaru Yusuf, a resident of Alalubosa Area, Ote, in the Asa local government area.\n\nAnother resident of Ote who identified herself as Amope said for the past seven years since she was married into the community, she had never fetched water from the tap.\n\n\"We only get water from hand-pupping boreholes and wells,\" Amope said.\n\nContractor Speaks\n\nWhen contacted for comment, Fatai Aberi, the Managing Director of Fab Confidential Limited told SaharaReporters\u2019 correspondent that they had completed the project and got a 'satisfied' acknowledgement after the needed assessment from LNRBDA, the supervisory agency.\n\nHe said despite the N25 million contract sum released for the project, he also used part of his personal funds to see that the project was complete\n\nBut when told about the situation of some of the boreholes that stopped supplying water shortly after inauguration, he said, \"For now, I can't promise anything but we will try and see what we can do.\"\n\nNo Comment on Ote-Ballah Dam\n\nAs at the time of filing this report, all efforts to get the reaction of the lawmaker regarding his failure to rehabilitate dam projects he had facilitated for members of his constituency were not successful. He did not answer several calls from SaharaReporters and did not reply to text and Whatsapp messages sent to his mobile line.\n\nAlso, Micheal Jacobs Consulting Limited, the company that handled the project, did not return several calls, text messages, and Whatsapp messages sent to them, asking for their comment on the dam project.",

          "title": "REVEALED: Inside Oyo community where butchers prepare beef with polluted water",
          "text": "The placid Ogbooro town lies between Saki and Igboho communities in Saki east LGA of Oyo state. The residents are mostly farmers and the town is referred to as one of the food baskets of the state.\n\nThe majority of the people grow the crop they eat with little dependence on food from outside. They are surrounded by herders who rear cattle in nearby forests. From the herders, they buy the meat they need to complement their food. But how the beef is processed leaves much to be desired. It is prepared with polluted water in a dingy environment, which is capable of causing a major epidemic.\n\nSometimes in the past, in its effort to ensure the safe processing of meat meant for public consumption, the state government built an abattoir in Awe, a secluded area on the outskirts of Ogbooro. The abattoir is close to a stream that has its source under a thick shrub on the edge of a forest.\n\nWhen the abattoir was in operation, water from the stream was used in washing the beef. State health officials from the ministry of agriculture would inspect the cattle before they were slaughtered. The aim of the inspection was to curb any unhealthy processes while preparing the beef for the market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAkinpelu Iyanu, a 65-year-old butcher in the town, said the meat was safe for consumption at the time. According to him, the officials from the ministry of agriculture made random visits to the market to ensure that meat processed in illegal slaughter slabs were not sold. Iyanu added that the water from the stream was well protected from being abused.\n\n\u201cMeat business was regulated at the time. Government officials inspected cattle before they were slaughtered at the Awe abattoir. They checked the kidney, liver and other internal organs and issued a certificate before a cow is slaughtered,\u201d Iyanu said.\n\n\u201cSome cows were rejected at the abattoir when they were found to be sick animals. They made sure the cows were treated and brought back in good health before they were taken to the slaughter slab. A herder once brought two cows to the abattoir to sell to butchers, but health officials stopped him after detecting that the animals were sick. One of them died while being reloaded into the truck that brought them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs for the water used in processing the meat, we depended on water from a nearby stream. It was well protected so that herders would not graze their cattle near it or lead the cattle to drink from it and pollute the water.\u201d\n\nIyanu added that the government officials also ensured that the cows were not burnt with tyres. When set on fire, tyres produce thick black smoke that contains several toxic pollutants, including carbon monoxide, which has a dangerous effect on the environment and public health.\n\nBut the government abattoir later aged and collapsed with no plan for rebuilding. When TheCable visited the site of the old abattoir, bushes had overgrown the ruins of the wooden building and the roof has been vandalised.\n\nTHE RETURN OF ILLEGAL SLAUGHTER SLABS\n\nIn 2018, the late Abiola Ajimobi, former governor, cracked down on unauthorised slaughter slabs across the state. In some of the major markets, especially in Bodija and Alesinloye in Ibadan, the state capital, the abattoirs operating under unhealthy conditions were closed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nButchers were asked to relocate to the new state abattoir in the Akinyele area of the state. A task force led by the governor was constituted to force meat dealers who opposed the relocation to comply with the directive.\n\nThe new abattoir has all the facilities to ensure the safe processing of meat meant for consumption. Veterinary doctors from the state ministry of agriculture have an office at the abattoir.\n\nHowever, with the collapse of the government abattoir in Ogbooro, illegal slaughter slabs now thrive and veterinary officers no longer visit.\n\nOne of the illegal slaughter slabs is located in the Bokoro area of the town. Mucky water from a stream flows through the illegal abattoir, which the butchers use in washing the meat during processing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen TheCable traced the flow of the water, it was discovered that somewhere along the channel, children were defecating inside the stream, and at the other end of the stream, herders were seen leading their cattle to drink from it.\n\nThe cattle also defecated and passed urine in the water. The same water is used a few meters away to process beef for human consumption.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt another illegal slaughter slab, wastes dumped by residents littered the environment. The odour of human wastes also rented the air around the site. Two cows were tied in the bush, waiting to be slaughtered.\n\nA residence said butchers use the slab when it rains so that enough water will be available to clean the meat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDEAD COWS SLAUGHTERED FOR CONSUMPTION\n\nKareem Balogun, a youth leader and farmer in the town, said there had been situations where herders slaughtered dead cows and sell them to butchers at low prices.\n\nBalogun said at the meat market, thousands of flies perch on beef displayed on the open table with butchers making little attempt to chase them off since they are a constant feature of the market.\n\n\u201cI also have livestock but I am not happy with the way beef is prepared for public consumption in Ogbooro. We don\u2019t have a standard abattoir since the one built by the government collapsed,\u201d Balogun said.\n\n\u201cOfficials from the ministry of agriculture no longer come to inspect the type of cows killed and where they are killed. Even when they come around, they take bribes from meat sellers and keep mute on the unhygienic practices of the dealers.\n\n\u201cWe have many illegal slaughter slabs beside road drainages that are filled with filth and human wastes. Unfortunately, there are health officials who come from Igboho but don\u2019t act as expected once they are bribed by the butchers. We risk our lives by eating meat processed in this unhygienic condition and the government has to look into it.\n\n\u201cWhile in the bush for grazing, cows often die of snake bites and to minimise the loss, herders will quickly slaughter the dead cow, prepare the beef in the bush with dirty water and bring it to the meat market. Sometimes, they slaughter cows that fall sick in the bush and bring the meat to the market.\u201d\n\nAt the market, there was evidence of unhygienic practices among the butchers. Most of the meat had lost the bright red colour even though sellers claimed they were killed a few hours earlier.\n\nMONARCH LAMENTS\n\nQasim Adegboye, the king of Ogbooro, who took time off from a meeting with chiefs to speak with TheCable, said he grew up in Sokoto and was addicted to eating suya (roasted beef), but he has stopped since he returned to the community.\n\n\u201cIt is a good thing that you came to see how our meat is processed in our town. We believe the government needs to know what is happening and how much damage this can bring to our health.\u201d the monarch said.\n\n\u201cVeterinary doctors should assess the cow meat to be slaughtered for the people; but unfortunately, we don\u2019t have a regulated abattoir.\n\n\u201cI am an engineer, so I will not know how healthy a cow is before it is slaughtered. Veterinary doctors will know this. After I became king, I was informed that our abattoir had collapsed and vandalised. I grew up in Sokoto and even though I love eating suya, I cannot eat it here at home because the process of preparing the meat is unhygienic.\u201d\n\nThe king said a committee was set up to look at the problem, noting that the committee had notified the state commissioner for agriculture as well as the head of local government.\n\nSeriki Ladan, the head of the Hausa community and cattle sellers in the town, said steps are being taken by the butchers association in Ogbooro to repair the collapsed abattoir, calling on the government for support.\n\nIn a chat with Josephine Chukwueike, an Ibadan-based food nutritionist, she said members of the community are at the risk of contracting some deadly diseases with the consumption of beef prepared with contaminated water in a dirty environment.\n\n\u201cThe health implication of consuming beef prepared with contaminated water is deadly. There are micro-organisms which come from animal droppings that can cause a high level of purging which will lead to dehydration,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThis is bad for the kidney because water in the human system is reduced drastically. Aged people and children under five years are mostly affected.\n\n\u201cCholera and typhoid fever come from contaminated water especially when it is consumed. If people in that community continue to consume food prepared with contaminated water, they risk contracting deadly typhoid fever.\u201d\n\nBeatrice Oganah-Ikujenyo, a lecturer at the department of home economics, Lagos State University of Education, said animals slaughtered in abattoirs must be checked by relevant health officials.\n\nShe added that the abattoirs should be equipped to erase serious health issues.\n\n\u201cLet me add that to prevent pathogen, food should be cooked thoroughly and consumed hot before the dormant micro-organism becomes active again,\u201d she said.\n\nSTATE GOVERNMENT ASSURES OF INTERVENTION\n\nWhen confronted with findings in Ogbooro, Niyi Adebisi, the state commissioner for agriculture and rural development, said the government is making effort to provide slaughter slabs in major towns in the state and strengthen the veterinary department under the ministry.\n\n\u201cYou can only find abattoirs in the headquarters of LGAs in the state and not in every town. Ogbooro is not the headquarters of Saki east council but is the third-largest town in the council area. We have attended the abattoir in Saki with the support of the federal ministry of agriculture,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen I realised that the state government will not be able to take care of all the abattoirs, I involved the local government and they have agreed to attend to them one after the other.\n\n\u201cWe are rehabilitating the abattoir in Ago-Amodu which is the headquarters of the council. I will have a meeting with the chairman of that council and instruct him to move to Ogbooro and address this issue. Since it is not going to be a new one, we will just work on the existing one that collapsed, it will be easier to address.\u201d\n\nThe commissioner stated that the extension department of the ministry is already coming up with ways of educating butchers on the need to prepare meat in hygienic conditions but added that the department needs more funding.\n\nWith the promises of help on the way, the inhabitants of Ogbooro are looking forward to a healthy abattoir where they can be assured of healthy food on their table.",

It is prepared with polluted water in a dingy environment, which is capable of causing a major epidemic.\n\nSometimes in the past, in its effort to ensure the safe processing of meat meant for public consumption, the state government built an abattoir in Awe, a secluded area on the outskirts of Ogbooro. The abattoir is close to a stream that has its source under a thick shrub on the edge of a forest.\n\nWhen the abattoir was in operation, water from the stream was used in washing the beef. State health officials from the ministry of agriculture would inspect the cattle before they were slaughtered. The aim of the inspection was to curb any unhealthy processes while preparing the beef for the market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAkinpelu Iyanu, a 65-year-old butcher in the town, said the meat was safe for consumption at the time. According to him, the officials from the ministry of agriculture made random visits to the market to ensure that meat processed in illegal slaughter slabs were not sold. Iyanu added that the water from the stream was well protected from being abused.\n\n\u201cMeat business was regulated at the time. Government officials inspected cattle before they were slaughtered at the Awe abattoir. They checked the kidney, liver and other internal organs and issued a certificate before a cow is slaughtered,\u201d Iyanu said.\n\n\u201cSome cows were rejected at the abattoir when they were found to be sick animals. They made sure the cows were treated and brought back in good health before they were taken to the slaughter slab. A herder once brought two cows to the abattoir to sell to butchers, but health officials stopped him after detecting that the animals were sick. One of them died while being reloaded into the truck that brought them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs for the water used in processing the meat, we depended on water from a nearby stream. It was well protected so that herders would not graze their cattle near it or lead the cattle to drink from it and pollute the water.\u201d\n\nIyanu added that the government officials also ensured that the cows were not burnt with tyres. When set on fire, tyres produce thick black smoke that contains several toxic pollutants, including carbon monoxide, which has a dangerous effect on the environment and public health.\n\nBut the government abattoir later aged and collapsed with no plan for rebuilding. When TheCable visited the site of the old abattoir, bushes had overgrown the ruins of the wooden building and the roof has been vandalised.\n\nTHE RETURN OF ILLEGAL SLAUGHTER SLABS\n\nIn 2018, the late Abiola Ajimobi, former governor, cracked down on unauthorised slaughter slabs across the state. In some of the major markets, especially in Bodija and Alesinloye in Ibadan, the state capital, the abattoirs operating under unhealthy conditions were closed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nButchers were asked to relocate to the new state abattoir in the Akinyele area of the state. A task force led by the governor was constituted to force meat dealers who opposed the relocation to comply with the directive.\n\nThe new abattoir has all the facilities to ensure the safe processing of meat meant for consumption. Veterinary doctors from the state ministry of agriculture have an office at the abattoir.\n\nHowever, with the collapse of the government abattoir in Ogbooro, illegal slaughter slabs now thrive and veterinary officers no longer visit.\n\nOne of the illegal slaughter slabs is located in the Bokoro area of the town. Mucky water from a stream flows through the illegal abattoir, which the butchers use in washing the meat during processing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen TheCable traced the flow of the water, it was discovered that somewhere along the channel, children were defecating inside the stream, and at the other end of the stream, herders were seen leading their cattle to drink from it.\n\nThe cattle also defecated and passed urine in the water. The same water is used a few meters away to process beef for human consumption.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt another illegal slaughter slab, wastes dumped by residents littered the environment. The odour of human wastes also rented the air around the site. Two cows were tied in the bush, waiting to be slaughtered.\n\nA residence said butchers use the slab when it rains so that enough water will be available to clean the meat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDEAD COWS SLAUGHTERED FOR CONSUMPTION\n\nKareem Balogun, a youth leader and farmer in the town, said there had been situations where herders slaughtered dead cows and sell them to butchers at low prices.\n\nBalogun said at the meat market, thousands of flies perch on beef displayed on the open table with butchers making little attempt to chase them off since they are a constant feature of the market.\n\n\u201cI also have livestock but I am not happy with the way beef is prepared for public consumption in Ogbooro. We don\u2019t have a standard abattoir since the one built by the government collapsed,\u201d Balogun said.\n\n\u201cOfficials from the ministry of agriculture no longer come to inspect the type of cows killed and where they are killed. Even when they come around, they take bribes from meat sellers and keep mute on the unhygienic practices of the dealers.\n\n\u201cWe have many illegal slaughter slabs beside road drainages that are filled with filth and human wastes. Unfortunately, there are health officials who come from Igboho but don\u2019t act as expected once they are bribed by the butchers. We risk our lives by eating meat processed in this unhygienic condition and the government has to look into it.\n\n\u201cWhile in the bush for grazing, cows often die of snake bites and to minimise the loss, herders will quickly slaughter the dead cow, prepare the beef in the bush with dirty water and bring it to the meat market. Sometimes, they slaughter cows that fall sick in the bush and bring the meat to the market.\u201d\n\nAt the market, there was evidence of unhygienic practices among the butchers. Most of the meat had lost the bright red colour even though sellers claimed they were killed a few hours earlier.\n\nMONARCH LAMENTS\n\nQasim Adegboye, the king of Ogbooro, who took time off from a meeting with chiefs to speak with TheCable, said he grew up in Sokoto and was addicted to eating suya (roasted beef), but he has stopped since he returned to the community.\n\n\u201cIt is a good thing that you came to see how our meat is processed in our town. We believe the government needs to know what is happening and how much damage this can bring to our health.\u201d the monarch said.\n\n\u201cVeterinary doctors should assess the cow meat to be slaughtered for the people; but unfortunately, we don\u2019t have a regulated abattoir.\n\n\u201cI am an engineer, so I will not know how healthy a cow is before it is slaughtered. Veterinary doctors will know this. After I became king, I was informed that our abattoir had collapsed and vandalised. I grew up in Sokoto and even though I love eating suya, I cannot eat it here at home because the process of preparing the meat is unhygienic.\u201d\n\nThe king said a committee was set up to look at the problem, noting that the committee had notified the state commissioner for agriculture as well as the head of local government.\n\nSeriki Ladan, the head of the Hausa community and cattle sellers in the town, said steps are being taken by the butchers association in Ogbooro to repair the collapsed abattoir, calling on the government for support.\n\nIn a chat with Josephine Chukwueike, an Ibadan-based food nutritionist, she said members of the community are at the risk of contracting some deadly diseases with the consumption of beef prepared with contaminated water in a dirty environment.\n\n\u201cThe health implication of consuming beef prepared with contaminated water is deadly. There are micro-organisms which come from animal droppings that can cause a high level of purging which will lead to dehydration,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThis is bad for the kidney because water in the human system is reduced drastically. Aged people and children under five years are mostly affected.\n\n\u201cCholera and typhoid fever come from contaminated water especially when it is consumed. If people in that community continue to consume food prepared with contaminated water, they risk contracting deadly typhoid fever.\u201d\n\nBeatrice Oganah-Ikujenyo, a lecturer at the department of home economics, Lagos State University of Education, said animals slaughtered in abattoirs must be checked by relevant health officials.\n\nShe added that the abattoirs should be equipped to erase serious health issues.\n\n\u201cLet me add that to prevent pathogen, food should be cooked thoroughly and consumed hot before the dormant micro-organism becomes active again,\u201d she said.\n\nSTATE GOVERNMENT ASSURES OF INTERVENTION\n\nWhen confronted with findings in Ogbooro, Niyi Adebisi, the state commissioner for agriculture and rural development, said the government is making effort to provide slaughter slabs in major towns in the state and strengthen the veterinary department under the ministry.\n\n\u201cYou can only find abattoirs in the headquarters of LGAs in the state and not in every town. Ogbooro is not the headquarters of Saki east council but is the third-largest town in the council area. We have attended the abattoir in Saki with the support of the federal ministry of agriculture,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen I realised that the state government will not be able to take care of all the abattoirs, I involved the local government and they have agreed to attend to them one after the other.\n\n\u201cWe are rehabilitating the abattoir in Ago-Amodu which is the headquarters of the council. I will have a meeting with the chairman of that council and instruct him to move to Ogbooro and address this issue. Since it is not going to be a new one, we will just work on the existing one that collapsed, it will be easier to address.\u201d\n\nThe commissioner stated that the extension department of the ministry is already coming up with ways of educating butchers on the need to prepare meat in hygienic conditions but added that the department needs more funding.\n\nWith the promises of help on the way, the inhabitants of Ogbooro are looking forward to a healthy abattoir where they can be assured of healthy food on their table.",
          "summary": "The placid Ogbooro town lies between Saki and Igboho communities in Saki east LGA of Oyo state.\nWhen the abattoir was in operation, water from the stream was used in washing the beef.\nAdvertisement\u201cAs for the water used in processing the meat, we depended on water from a nearby stream.\nAdvertisementButchers were asked to relocate to the new state abattoir in the Akinyele area of the state.\nMucky water from a stream flows through the illegal abattoir, which the butchers use in washing the meat during processing.",

          "text": "We\u2019re halfway through the year, and quite a number of exciting things have happened in Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s $53.4 mobile money fraud lawsuit and Kune\u2019s shutdown in Kenya, to big acquisitions across North Africa, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves from June.\n\nIn June 2022, African startups made 36 fully disclosed* raises totalling $426,280,000 million. This amount is a 2.4% decrease from May 2022\u2019s $437,100,000.\n\nThis means that in the first half of 2022 (H1 2022), African startups raised a whopping $2,787,523,000, a 134.25% increase from the $1.19 billion raised in H1 2021.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors in June are fintech, energytech, and mobility/logistics. Fintech startups raised $305,430,000. (71.7%), energytech startups raised $35,700,000 (8.4%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $32,700,000 (7.7%).\n\nPer region, North Africa led with $173,300,000 of the funding, with fintech MNT-Halan\u2019s $150 million at the helm. South Africa came a close second with $127,500,000, while West and East Africa followed with $79,430,000 and $46,050,000 respectively.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals in June are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in June 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y Combinator.\n\nLess than 2 months after the launch of its mobile money payments service bank (MoMo PSB) in Nigeria, telco MTN in June reportedly took 18 Nigerian banks to court over a $53.7 million fraud allegation.\n\nAccording to the telco, the fraud was committed over a total of 700,000 transactions, over a one-month period, and the amount was transferred in error to 8,000 accounts.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest unicorn, Flutterwave, made some pretty important hires last month.\n\n\n\nFormer managing director at Goldman Sachs, Gurbhej Dhillon, joined the fintech startup as chief technical officer (CTO) while former vice president of American Express, Oneal Bhambani, also joined the company as chief financial officer (CFO).\n\nIt\u2019s no news that about 70% of startups fail at the pre-seed or seed stage, and Kenyan food delivery service Kune\u2019s shutdown came as little surprise to Kenyans.\n\nLess than a year after raising $1 million to solve a problem many Kenyans believe does not exist, Kune shut down in June after founder Robin Reecht announced on LinkedIn that they had run out of money.\n\nPiggyTech, parent company of Nigeria-based fintech PiggyVest, pocketed a mobile money (MOMO) license in June.\n\nPiggyTech also rebranded its payment app from Abeg to PocketApp. The licence will help the startup transition PocketApp from a payment app to a social commerce app that supports online merchants in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria may have lower mobile money usage compared to Kenya, Uganda or even Ghana, but that may soon change.\n\nIn more Nigerian mobile money news from June, telecom giant Airtel also launched its own payments service bank (PSB), SmartCash PSB. With its PSB license, Airtel can provide the 55% of Nigerians who don\u2019t have bank accounts access to SmartCash PSB.\n\nAbout 15,900 tech workers from startups across the globe were laid off in June 2022.\n\nIn Africa, Egypt- and Dubai-based healthtech startup, Vezeeta, laid off about 10% of its staff. Its LinkedIn profile says it has 500 staff, so about 50 workers must have been laid off.\n\nThis news comes a month after another Egypt- and Dubai-based startup, Swvl, laid off 32% of its workforce.\n\nIn big news about acquisitions, 3 happened in June 2022.\n\nFirst, MFS Africa announced plans to acquire US-based payments software company Global Technology Partners (GTP) in a $34 million deal.\n\nThen Apetito, a Cairo-based on-demand grocery retail business announced the acquisition of Lamma, a similar startup, to help its expansion to Morocco, Tunisia, and West Africa.\n\nFinally, Nigeria\u2019s Access Bank announced its second acquisition in Kenya. It\u2019s reportedly aiming to buy Sidian Bank for $36.7 million (Ksh 4.3 billion).\n\nIn June, Kenya\u2019s parliament passed the ICT Practitioners\u2019 Bill which requires all techies in Kenya to register and pay tax before they can work in the country.\n\nFortunately, President Uhuru Kenyatta rejected the bill stating that it was \u201cimpractical and counterproductive\u201d.\n\nIn more news about Kenyan legislations, the Kenyan government made another move to regulate its digital lending space.\n\nThe government announced plans to introduce a 20% excise tax on all fees charged by all digital lenders.\n\nOther than Flutterwave\u2019s, several other important hires were announced in June.\n\nMara, a pan\u2013African crypto exchange platform, appointed ex-Apple executive Susan Younis as its chief marketing officer (CMO).\n\nEloho Omame, co-founder and General Partner at FirstCheck Africa, joined TLcom Capital as a partner.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your network on Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Digital Nomads: Freelance digital marketer Baraka Mafole wants Tanzanians to thrive in the digital economy",
          "text": "In 2019, Baraka Mafole, then 19, gained admission into the National Institute of Transport (NIT), Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, to undertake a bachelor\u2019s degree in information technology (IT). He was excited about this. But then, things took a wrong turn.\n\nAfter discovering that his fellow students were making money online, Mafole decided to join them; he spent hours learning digital skills. But this distracted him from attending classes. As a result, he failed his first-year university exams and was expelled from the university. He didn\u2019t sulk, though. Instead, he started applying for opportunities at different companies. At first he was rejected by many companies he pitched to because, according to them, he wasn\u2019t skilled enough.\n\nHe pored over online courses on YouTube, Udemy, and other educational technology platforms to learn more about digital marketing and social media management. After upskilling, he resumed his search for jobs. This time around, he was successful; a startup in Dar es Salaam hired him as a social media manager.\n\nBut 4 months into the job, he quit. His confidence in his skills had grown, and he was receiving multiple offers for lucrative digital marketing and design gigs.\n\nIn 2020, he decided to become a full-time freelancer. That same year, he registered on online freelancing platform, Upwork, and since he joined, he has earned at least $4,000 from gigs\u2014over a dozen times more than the country\u2019s upper range TZS 315,000 ($135) for minimum wage. He has been awarded a top-rated badge (for earning more than $1,000 on the platform).\n\nShortly after he began making money on Upwork, he began sharing his freelancing journey online, which helped him build a large online following and get invited to speak at events.\n\nIn the last decade, the Tanzanian digital ecosystem has evolved as more Tanzanian citizens have access to digital services. In 2010, just 18.5% of the country\u2019s population had mobile phones. That number has grown 6-fold to reach 82% or 50 million people in 2021. Similarly, mobile internet penetration has grown 5-fold from 2.9% or 3 million people in 2010 to 25% or 15 million people in 2021\u2014with 12 million new mobile internet subscribers added over the decade. Within this period, the East African country has seen significant economic growth\u2014average annual GDP growth of 7%\u2014which has improved the lives of its citizens. This growth and improvement in quality of living can be traced to the use of digital technologies to improve access to key services such as education, agricultural market information, healthcare, financial services and employment, through digital technologies.\n\nIn recent years, Tanzania has seen heavy investments in fibre infrastructure in recent years to connect more Tanzanians to the internet. Back in 2016, the government updated the Tanzanian National ICT Policy of 2003, in what serves as a recognition of the contribution of the ICT sector to promoting socio-economic development in the country.\n\nDigital technology is poised to help Tanzania in achieving its developmental goals. Already, the mobile industry contributes 5.2% (or $5.2 billion) to Tanzania\u2019s GDP, and employs 2.6 % (or 1.5 million) of its total population.\n\nBut despite having an impressive 2.6% unemployment rate, millions of young Tanzanians remain unemployed, and the skills of those that are currently employed risk becoming obsolete in the coming years if they don\u2019t book their place in the digital economy.\n\nFrom university withdrawal to helping thousands of unemployed\n\nDuring his one year away from school, Mafole discovered that a communication degree could improve his chances of getting higher-paying gigs. So in 2021, he returned to the University of Dar es Salaam to study communication.\n\nOne day in May 2021, another enterprising Tanzanian, Leyla Mohamed reached out to him, out of the blue, and encouraged him to spread his impact further by training young people on digital skills. This led them to co-found an initiative called Tanzania Digital Trailblazers later that month, a series of virtual events to bring awareness of digital skills to young Tanzanians.\n\nAfter 3 months, the co-founders changed the initiative\u2019s name to one in Swahili, Sanuka Kidijitali (roughly meaning, \u201cGet informed fast about the digital world\u201d) to help people easily recall the name better. This time around, they added physical monthly digital skills training events to the mix. This helped Sanuk Kidijitali train over 300 people on digital skills such as writing, digital marketing, and blockchain; guides to get jobs on freelancing on job platforms such as Upwork, Fiverr, and LinkedIn; using video conferencing platforms such as Zoom and Google Meet to speak with clients, and other digital tools such as Canva and Wix for various digital tasks.\n\nSanuk Kidijitali has a 3,000-strong community of young people in various Telegram groups that it is training and connecting to opportunities. It has also spread its awareness through its newly developed university outreach programme to university students across Tanzania, starting from the University of Dar es Salaam.\n\nSanuka Kidijitali launched a podcast, The Founders Confessions, where its co-founder Mohamed, speaks with startup founders in Tanzania to start and increase conversation about the digital economy in the country. Mafole is the country director of Social Media Day Tanzania, an event which took place last Saturday, on July 2, at the Nkrumah Hall, University of Dar es Salam. It brought together digital entrepreneurs for networking while offering them upskilling sessions.\n\n\u201cOur plan at Sanuka Kidijitali is to reach as many youths as we can, as we currently reach 5,000 plus, but one day we will hit our target of 100,000 per year,\u201d Mafole, who is also Sanuka Kidijitali\u2019s chief operating officer (CPO), told TechCabal.\n\n\u201cWe have an employment problem and digital jobs are a solution to this problem, but university students can\u2019t use computers and unemployed graduates do not have digital skills,\u201d he said.\n\nMafole said that dozens of Tanzanian youths have connected with his story and have been inspired to upgrade their lives by learning digital skills. After discovering that only 18 Tanzanian freelancers have earned over $1,000 on Upwork as compared to Kenya\u2019s 300, he realised that his country is playing catch-up. \u201cMy task is to help people who don\u2019t have digital skills build them and also help those that do identify and navigate freelancing platforms to get jobs,\u201d he explained.\n\nBut it is not all rosy, Mafole warned. Tanzanian freelancers still have to deal with inaccessible payment gateways or cut-throat transaction costs, high data pricing, and bad internet connection. And that\u2019s not all. They also have to deal with societal stereotypes. \u201cMany Tanzanians still see freelancing as an extra job and not as a real job. When you tell people you are a freelancer, they make you feel like you are unemployed,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "These founders are closing delivery gaps in Rwanda\u2019s capital",
          "text": "In the past 2 years, stories of success and challenges e-commerce startups have often involved the impact of the pandemic on operations, and this story of 2 Rwandan co-founders does not break the formula.\n\nDuring the 2020 lockdown, Anselme Mucunguzi, 30, noticed a gap in the technology needed to service last mile delivery in Kigali, the Rwandan capital. To his mind, payment processing was robust\u2014people could use Paystack or Flutterwave when ordering stuff online; and for SMS marketing, they could use products like Africa\u2019s Talking. But there was no solution that delivered goods from sellers to the doorsteps of buyers. Sellers relied on random motorcyclists riding past to deliver packages to their customers. It was a risky measure. Not only could they not vouch for the professional and ethical conduct of such random riders, they also had no failsafe way to track the transportation of these packages. Even worse, these random riders were delivering the packages to locations that were described verbally, with landmarks as identifiers. It was an unreliable solution.\n\nSo, in January 2021, he founded Nisawa, a last-mile delivery service. The company was a subsidiary of Panavis, a legal research platform he\u2019d started working on in 2017 as part of his master\u2019s thesis at the University of Notre Dame, and incorporated in 2019. His co-founders were lawyer Mayday Karugarama, and software engineer Fran\u00e7ois Birori.\n\nNisawa would close operations a few months later, on October 14, due to disagreement over business direction with his then co-founder, Fran\u00e7ois Birori. Birori had wanted Nisawa to transition to an online marketplace while Mucunguzi insisted on remaining in the last-mile delivery line.\n\nOn October 15, the day after Nisawa closed, Vanoma began operations, maintaining all former staff and customers of Nisawa. Building off of the solution he activated at the predecessor startup, Vanoma is an integrated e-commerce solution centred around a last-mile delivery service to enable local businesses and independent sellers to sell online.\n\nVanoma\u2019s solution is designed to take the burden off the seller. All a seller needs to do to initiate a delivery is supply the receiver\u2019s phone number on the Vanoma website. Vanoma then sends the receiver an SMS with a custom link they refer to as a \u201cdelivery link\u201d. On clicking the link, the receiver is led to Vanoma\u2019s website where they can easily geolocate themselves thanks to their smartphone\u2019s built-in GPS capabilities. Once their exact location is established, a rider is sent out to pick up the package from the seller and deliver to the buyer. The seller never has to bother about the logistics beyond that initial action of supplying the receiver\u2019s phone number on the Vanoma website.\n\nIn July 2021, Mucunguzi invited his longtime friend Theophile Nsengimana, 30, to join him as co-founder; and in October, Nsengimana agreed.\n\nFriendship and partnership\n\nMucunguzi and Nsengimana\u2019s friendship is older than Vanoma. They met in 2011, as 2 of 32 high schoolers selected for the annual Rwandan Presidential Scholars programme. Mucunguzi would go on to study chemistry with a minor in mathematics at the Belhaven University, Jackson, Mississippi, while Nsengimana would move to Little Rock, Arkansas to study computer science and mathematics at the Philander Smith College.\n\nFour years later, the pair teamed up to work on a music streaming platform for Rwandan music in 2015. Mucunguzi lived in Indiana at the time and was about to begin his master\u2019s in physical chemistry. Nsengimana had just graduated from Philander Smith and worked in San Francisco.\n\nYeyote failed to gain traction because, Mucunguzi says, \u201cit is difficult to monetise media\u201d in Rwanda.\n\nThey rested the idea in 2017 and moved on to other projects. Mucunguzi was rounding off his master\u2019s degree at Notre Dame and Nsengimana was preparing to begin his, in computer science, at Tennessee State University.\n\nThe \u201cdead end\u201d\n\nI find Mucunguzi\u2019s decision to start Panavis curious, as he is no lawyer by training. (Law is a very technical discipline requiring dedicated training, I maintain.) He laughs at my question, and warns me that we\u2019re about to \u201cget into rabbit holes\u201d. He then tells me the reason he got into the legal business: Yeyote, the music streaming app he\u2019d worked on with Nsengimana.\n\nWhile building the app, he discovered that he had to constantly study laws around licensing, copyright, and incorporating a company, across several countries.\n\nThe legal research platform did not succeed as a business because its biggest could-be client, the Rwandan government\u2019s ministry of justice, had a stringent budget that planned expenses for 2\u20133 years at a time. What this means is, the ministry couldn\u2019t decide in April (or even January) of a given year that they\u2019d need Mucunguzi\u2019s service in July. Panavis would have to wait until the next budgetary allocation round to fit into the government\u2019s budget.\n\nOn top of that, the law firm market in Rwanda is small, he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have more than 15 legitimate law firms. Even if each one is paying a subscription fee of $100, or even more, that\u2019s not enough to pay 3, 4 people Unless you are about to get government clients. Even the law schools were not willing to pay substantial money. So, it was really a monetisation problem.\u201d\n\nThe business was a \u201cdead end,\u201d he concluded. He shuttered up Panavis in 2020 at the onset of the lockdown\u2014a year before founding Vanoma.\n\nA second try\n\nIn July 2021, when Nsengimana got the invitation from Mucunguzi to join him at Vanoma, he was working out of Seattle as a software engineer for Amazon. It was a great job, but he wanted more. He wanted to leave paid employment and return to entrepreneurship. He and Mucunguzi had stayed in touch after Yeyote folded up. In fact, 3 years before, Mucunguzi had asked him to co-found with him at Nisawa, but Nsengimana refused; he was busy balancing school and his work.\n\nStill, the years he\u2019d spent with Mucunguzi building the music streaming app were some of the most fulfilling of his life, he tells me. So, when Mucunguzi approached him to be his co-founder at Vanoma, given their history of working together and his yearning to do work that was \u201cmuch more rewarding\u201d, he agreed and relocated to Kigali to co-run the business.\n\nExpanding competition\n\nVanoma startup employs 12 full-time drivers who make deliveries all over Kigali, the city that is the extent of their coverage, as of today.\n\nI want to know what their expansion plans are. Mucunguzi tells me their approach is to avoid markets such as Nairobi, Kenya, that are \u201cextremely competitive\u201d. Nairobi, he explains, already has plenty of delivery products\u2014Uber and Bolt, for example\u2014so Vanoma will not be expanding there just yet. But they could expand into Uganda, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, or Cameroon any day now, once they feel ready, as their findings show these markets are ripe for an ecommerce boom.\n\nMy Life in Tech (MLIT) is a biweekly column that profiles innovators, leaders, and shapers in the African tech ecosystem, with the intention of putting a human face to the startups and innovations they build.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "Today on Everyday People, we meet Rita Anwiri Chindah, an intellectual property and information technology lawyer and an arbitrator based in Port-Harcourt, Rivers State. A random decision at the university led her down a path that would eventually turn her into an educationist. Now she hosts the IPSERIES podcast, a mini blog series on Twitter, and publishes a Substack newsletter to educate people on how much intellectual property is a part of all we do.\n\nI published my first [IPSERIES] episode on May 18, 2020. I think I had about 65 plays in how many days, but the feedback I kept getting from people was that I was sniffing and truthfully I was sniffing because I have allergies.\n\nI started getting comments from people on how to record. Someone suggested I should record in a quiet place. So sometimes when I want to record, I have to tell my family, cause I stay with my parents.\n\nI tell them, \u201cI\u2019m recording today. Please, can you guys, you know, tone down the noise,\u201d and they do that.\n\nThen someone else suggested, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you get a mic?\u201d\n\nAnd I was like, \u201cWhere am I going to get a mic?\u201d I tried to get one from Jumia, and when they did not deliver after one month, they said I should go to the nearest post office.\n\nI went there the first time and they said, \u201cOkay, maybe come back next week.\u201d\n\nAnd I went back the following week.\n\nThey said, \u201cAh, Madam, we never receive anything [we haven\u2019t received anything].\u201d\n\nI was like, \u201cAh!\u201d\n\nSo I think I sent an email or I called. And they said if I couldn\u2019t wait, I should cancel the order.\n\nI was like, \u201cAfter waiting this long, are you people joking?\u201d I had had enough. Like, seriously, why are we not moving forward? Why do we always look for ways to frustrate people?\n\nThen this year, I think I saw someone on Instagram selling a mic, and I was like, \u201cOkay, let me try her,\u201d and I bought it, and it was excellent.\n\nBuilding blocks\n\nRita Anwiri speaking at a South South Media event. Source: Instagram\n\nI did my LLB at Madonna University, Okija, and in 400 level, they introduced three elective courses: oil and gas, banking and finance, and intellectual property (IP). And I was like, \u201cWhat is intellectual property?\u201d\n\nI just decided to do the random one I\u2019d never heard of.\n\nIP education for me started when I was at Infusion Lawyers. Senator Ihenyen, my boss at the time, and I had this conversation about IP awareness and educating people. And then, the firm came up with a Frequently Asked Question blog called IP ABC.\n\nThat was where the interest started to build up. Then I started dropping IP bits on Twitter and tagged it IPSERIES. I\u2019m not sure if that was the first major case I analysed. It wasn\u2019t much of a case, but I saw someone post something that I felt was untrue because Deola Sage put up a notification saying her Komole design had been registered as a design under the Nigerian Design Act.\n\nSomeone said she didn\u2019t have the right to do that, \u201cHow can you protect aso oke [traditional Yoruba fabric]?\u201d\n\nI thought about it and concluded it was not ordinary aso oke. So I sat down and compared the original Yoruba aso oke and Deola Sage\u2019s Komole [Kandids].\n\nI went on Instagram and I stumbled on this post and it makes me very excited because creatives such as Deola has taken a bold step in the fashion industry to protect her designs.\n\nNow the not clearly states that any infringement of any sort would be prosecuted \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe pic.twitter.com/qdshVQz92w \u2014 ANWIRI (@esmeraldo99) October 23, 2019\n\nI did that tweet, and people received it well, so I started building on that.\n\nThen during the pandemic, LolA With The Duffle Bag on Twitter shared a link to her podcast and said that she uses Anchor to do her recording.\n\nHere\u2019s the trailer for my new podcast where I\u2019d be sharing and answering your questions. Watch, listen and enjoy!\n\n\n\nFirst episode drops May 4, links would be available then. Get ready to subscribe on Spotify, Apple podcast, google podcast and other platforms.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f, \ud83d\udca1 and \ud83d\udcbc pic.twitter.com/covcNVmnrh \u2014 LolA With The Duffle Bag\u2026 (@L3galtool) April 27, 2020\n\nSo I checked it out, and when I realised it was very easy to record and share, I decided to try doing a podcast.\n\nAfter the podcast, I began considering a newsletter. Telema Davis, one of my friends who always pushes me to do more, told me to do it if I wanted to. Expectedly, he edited my first newsletter publication.\n\nI didn\u2019t know which platform to publish on, and he suggested Substack? So I got my Substack account. So far, I have 66 or 67 podcast episodes, 12 newsletters, and over one hundred mini blog series on Twitter.\n\nSomeone who has listened to all my podcasts suggested I put my microphone in a pillowcase and, you know, talk into it, and the background sound would be muffled.\n\nSo I\u2019ve done all those things just to make sure that I put out good quality content.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s not easy staying consistent; it\u2019s a bit overwhelming because each content must have a different storyline. So it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re just copying, pasting, and resharing.\n\nContent is key, and everything is content. When you\u2019re just starting, you don\u2019t get likes or retweets, and at such times, you wonder if you\u2019re making sense. But once you keep at it, people get to know and interact with you.\n\nWalking through the process\n\nRita Anwiri (third from the left) speaking at a panel at the Africa NXT 2022 event\n\nFirst up for me is usually the research, where I have to study the case and look out for things people didn\u2019t notice while reading or talking about the case because I\u2019m giving a Nigerian/African perspective. So I also have to read and compare many documents and conversations.\n\nThe next step is structure. How do you want the story to flow? Are you going to tell a very witty story? I write and then type because I\u2019m used to capturing my thought processes on paper first. As I type, I figure out what is relevant and what to discard.\n\nOnce I\u2019m done with research and typing for the Twitter series, I start posting. Sometimes I try to throw in pictures to help people better understand the conversation.\n\nWhen that is done, I share the link on LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram.\n\nSometimes, depending on how complex it is, I decide to have a guest on my podcast. I remember we had this Tracy Chapman and Nicki Minaj case when I started, and I was wondering how to discuss it. So I reached out to Mark Jaffe, a colleague and friend who is more into copyrights. Interestingly, this connection was not physical, and that is the beauty of the Intenet \u2014 it is easy to connect with people.\n\nI\u2019ve noticed that foreigners always want to help, so I was not surprised when he asked what I needed. We had a very interesting conversation and he said he was willing to come back and talk about something else if I needed him to.\n\nDealing with Internet connection issues\n\nRita was selected as a Trailblazer by the World Intellectual Property Review (WIPR) magazine in 2020\n\nIt\u2019s not easy, especially with network issues; I once went in and out of a session with a guest ten times.\n\n\u201cLook, I hope the last episode recorded?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cFingers crossed,\u201d I replied\n\nWhen I was listening to the recording, I did not hear anything that I said, I didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\nThere was this time when it was a football matter and I wanted to interview two guests, but only one of them could log in. After many attempts, we cancelled and did not try to record afterwards; I felt bad because I was really looking forward to that conversation, which was going to shed light from the eSports sector to the regular sports sector\n\nSo while the Internet is good, the technical issues are not fun. It\u2019s kind of embarrassing sometimes because you\u2019re all hyped up. You have your router or your MiFi on standby. You have your mobile data, just in case. And before you know it, something unexpected happens. I sometimes ask myself why I am in Nigeria.\n\nI was so upset once that I tagged Anchor on Twitter.\n\n\u201cWhy are you guys doing this to me, today of all days? I can\u2019t even log in. I can\u2019t do anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cApologies, maybe check your Internet,\u201d they responded.\n\nAnd I was like, \u201cOh gosh, the Internet again!\u201d\n\nThe thing is you are trying to task yourself mentally while doing many things simultaneously, but people have no idea what goes into producing content. When you\u2019re Googling and reading different documents, make sure give a brief summary of everything because that is really where the work is.\n\nAnd the thing is, you are trying to tax yourself mentally while doing all of this and people don\u2019t see behind it. When you\u2019re trying to Google, trying to read different documents, make sure that you give a brief summary of everything. That\u2019s where the work is.",

This will not allow any man or woman to become bigger than any institution.\n\n\u201cI thank you for your role in the development of the state and country.

While other countries don\u2019t have natural resources, they leverage on their human resources, which is the greatest of all resources, but the quality of these resources have been a challenge.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour organisation has a major role to play as far as skill development, training and retraining, capacity building for our personnel is concerned. When we have a knowledgeable and dedicated workforce that is skilled to carry out its function, the issue of our dwindling economy will be a thing of the past,\u201d he noted.\n\nOn his part, Chairman, Edo CIPM, Osahon Omole, hailed the government for its people-centric projects across the state, urging increased collaboration between the state and the organization.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

Comrade Philip Shaibu, on Friday, led other top government functionaries to pay last respects to late Rev. Fr. Christopher Odia, who was gruesomely murdered by suspected kidnappers, with clerics at the event decrying the worsening spate of insecurity in the country.\n\nOdia, a catholic priest, was allegedly murdered by his kidnappers in Ikabigbo, Etsako West Local Government Area (LGA) of Edo State.\n\nAt the funeral mass and interment held for the clergy at the Priests\u2019 Cemetery, Immaculate Conception Seminary, Ivianokpodi-Agenebode in Etsako East LGA, the National President of the Nigeria Catholic Diocesan Priest Association (NCDPA), Very Rev. Fr. Johnbosco Ezehi, charged President Muhammadu Buhari to take urgent steps to guarantee the safety and security of Nigerians.\n\nHe noted that the Federal Government has failed in its primary duty of protecting the lives and property of Nigerians, adding that the President should step down or proffer a solution to the increasing spate of killings and kidnappings across the country.\n\nEzehi said, \u201cWe condemn the increasing attacks by suspected herdsmen who have turned the country into a massive graveyard. If the President cannot keep our country safe, then he automatically loses the trust of the citizens. He should no longer continue to preside over the killing field and mass graveyard that our country has become.\n\n\u201cNigerians call on the President to take drastic and urgent steps to reverse the ugly tragedy that threatens the foundation of our collective existence and unity as a nation. It\u2019s clear to the nation that the president has failed in his primary duty of protecting the lives of Nigerians.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Shaibu noted, \u201cI must agree with our cleric that the government has failed in its responsibilities of securing lives and properties. If the issue of security was tackled earlier enough, we would not get to where we are today. We must turn to God to help us now as our land is troubled and only God will heal our land.\u201d\n\nReassuring improved security in the state, the acting governor added, \u201cAs a state government, we have decided to take our destiny into our own hands and not push the blame. We are collaborating with security agencies and stakeholders in securing our state.\n\n\u201cWe have involved religious leaders and vigilante groups, among others and have adequately equipped them to strengthen our security architecture. We want to secure the property and lives of our people.\u201d\n\nShaibu noted that the state is localizing security and working with all security stakeholders in the state to ensure a peaceful, safe and secured environment, adding, \u201cWe can\u2019t isolate ourselves from the federal security and calling on everyone to be security officers collaborating with the government to secure our land.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Catholic Bishop of Auchi Diocese, Most. Rev. Dr. Gabriel Dunia stated, \u201cI appeal to both the federal, state and local governments, as the Lord has entrusted the leadership and security of Nigeria into their hands, to do the needful by protecting the lives and property of the people which is their primary responsibility.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

We have witnessed the deterioration of democracy in established democracies, like the United States. Democratic norms are faltering as autocratic leaders and politicians with subversive intentions have found ways to use mainstream and social media to control cognitive outcomes through disinformation and manipulation.\n\nDemocracy presupposes the existence of an educated electorate, who are able to evaluate information. Indeed democracy thrives when there is a well-informed and engaged citizenry. However, for a well-informed and engaged citizenry to exist, the media must not just inform the public, but analyze and present information and unbiased date that can and should shape policy.\n\nThe AUN-Premium Times Data Hub is is a unique collaboration between higher education and media to inject more data-driven analysis into civic discussions and journalism. The Development Hub will use data and analysis to build an evidence base for change.\n\nThe purpose of this Hub is to present data and analysis and a platform for discussion on every major sphere of development, including gender, poverty, education, health, economic growth and employment, governance and democracy, peace and security and the role of technology. On each platform, the best available data on Nigeria\u2019s current status will be presented and analysed and solutions to specific problems will be proposed.\n\nOur goal is to present and analyze data in a way that will educate you, our readers, guide you toward action and, over time, guide the decisions of policymakers. We hope to build an evidence base for positive economic, social and political change.\n\n\u2013 Margee M. Ensign",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s broadband penetration recorded a quantum leap in the last seven months from November 2021 with a record of seven million new subscriptions, indicating a steady rise in nation\u2019s quest to achieve 70 per cent national coverage by 2025.\n\nExecutive Vice Chairman (EVC) of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Prof. Umar Danbatta, who presented the figures in Lagos yesterday (Thursday, June 7, 2022), at the launch of a book on the impact of broadband on the economy, said the steady growth in broadband penetration is positively impacting other sectors of the economy such as healthcare, education, agriculture, finance, transportation, commerce, governance, and other sectors.\n\nDanbatta said the sector has impressive statistics as he presented the keynote at the 11th eWorld Forum, which featured the launch of a book: \u201cNigeria Drivers of Digital Prosperity: The Trajectories of the Digital Evolution, Sector Analysis and Players Contributions\u201d, authored by the Convener of the forum, Mr. Aaron Ukodie, a veteran Information and Communication Technology (ICT) journalist and publisher of eWorld News Online.\n\n\u201cInternet subscribers have grown from 90 million in 2015 to 150.36 million as at May 2022. Also, within the period under review, broadband penetration increased from 8 per cent to 43.67 per cent, indicating that over 83.3 million subscribers are on broadband networks of 3G and 4G. Indeed, between November 2021 and May 2022, the networks have added 7 million new users,\u201d Danbatta said.\n\nAt the event, chaired by the former EVC of the NCC and current Chairman of MTN Nigeria, Dr. Ernest Ndukwe, Danbatta, who was represented by NCC\u2019s Head, Spectrum Administration, Abraham Oshadami, informed the audience that in the fourth quarter of 2021, the sector contributed 12.61 per cent to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), a reasonable leap from 8.50 per cent in 2015. Active mobile voice subscription also increased from 151 million in 2015 to over 204 million as at May 2022, while teledensity is 107.17 per cent.\n\nOn universal access and service, the NCC chief executive said the Commission, through the Universal Service Provision Fund (USPF) has recorded huge successes towards ensuring that telecommunications services are accessible to a large number of people (and communities) at affordable prices, in addition to various projects being implemented by the Commission to increase universal access and service as well as to enhance government efforts in poverty reduction.\n\nHe said that through the Commission\u2019s Strategic Vision Implementation Plan (SVP) 2021-2025, also known as NCC\u2019s 5-Point Agenda, a number of steps have been taken towards implementing all the digital economy-oriented policies that require the attention of the Commission, including the Nigerian National Broadband Plan (NNBP) 2020-2025, and the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS), 2020-2030. \u201cIt is our belief that the communications industry will continue to experience more quantum leaps that will be beneficial to the nation\u2019s economy and its citizens,\u201d the EVC stated.\n\nMeanwhile, Ndukwe has applauded the progressive steps that the Commission has taken since the solid foundation laid with the transparent auction of 2001 and the Nigerian Communications Act 2003 as an enabling law, thus giving a solid foundation upon which the current strides are being made.\n\nThe event was attended by other eminent personalities in the ICT industry, including the Secretary to the Government of Akwa Ibom State, Dr. Emmanuel Ekuwem, who was President of Association of Telecom Companies of Nigeria (ATCON); Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Future Software Resources Ltd, Nkem Uwaje-Begho; CEO of New Horizons, Tim Akano, who made a presentation on the significance and benefits of 5G services.\n\nFrontline and veteran journalists, other specialised communication professionals in the ICT industry and many stakeholders in the telecommunication ecosystem also attended the event, and all of them spoke glowingly about Ukodie\u2019s courage and devotion in chronicling landmarks in Nigeria\u2019s telecom history.",

The Guidelines stipulate the eligible enterprises for which guarantees could be issued under the Scheme.\n\nBetween 1978 and 1989 when the government stipulated lending quotas for banks under the scheme, there was consistent increase in the lending portfolios of banks to agriculture, but after the deregulation of the financial system, banks started shying away by reducing their loans to the sector due to the perceived risk.\n\nIn order to reverse the declining trend, several innovations and products were introduced under the scheme such as the Self-Help Group Linkage Banking, Trust Fund Model and Interest Draw Back.",

          "text": "The Federal Government has disclosed its readiness to sell the majority interest in the Benin, Kaduna, Kano and other ailing electricity distribution companies to competent investors.\n\nThe Director-General, Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE), Alex Okoh, disclosed this in a statement he personally signed while reacting to the resistance by some Discos on the move by Fidelity Bank and the government to take over and restructure poor-performing Discos.\n\nAccording to the BPE boss, Benin, Kaduna and Kano electricity distribution companies were the worst-performing discos among the 11 power distributors in Nigeria.\n\nHe also stated that based on this, the government through the BPE and the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission has decided to sell them to new investors.\n\nIt would be recalled that the receiver/manager\u2019s nominee of Integrated Energy Distribution and Marketing Company had insisted on Wednesday that it was the legal and beneficial owner of 60 per cent (controlling and managing) shareholding interests in the Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company.\n\nLikewise, the management of Benin Electricity Distribution Company Plc had argued on Wednesday that there was no legal basis for the takeover of the company following the purported activation of the call on its collateralised shares by Fidelity Bank.\n\nBoth firms had disclosed this in reaction to the announcement of the Federal Government on Tuesday regarding the takeover of Kano, Benin and Kaduna electricity distribution companies by Fidelity Bank Plc after the bank initiated action to take over the boards of the three Discos.\n\nThe government had also announced on Tuesday through its Bureau of Public Enterprises that with the takeover of Ibadan Disco by the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria, the BPE had obtained approval from NERC to appoint an interim managing director for the distressed power firm.\n\nThe government further stated in Tuesday\u2019s restructuring notice that it was restructuring the management and board of Port Harcourt Disco to forestall the imminent insolvency of the utility. The notice was signed by the Director-General, BPE, Alex Okoh; and Executive Chairman, NERC, Sanusi Garba.\n\nHowever, the government\u2019s stance was confronted by resistance by some affected power firms, a development that made the BPE declare on Friday that it would go-ahead to sell the majority interest in Benin, Kaduna and Kano Discos.\n\n\u201cIt is envisaged that the majority interest in these Discos would be sold to competent private sector investors with the requisite technical and financial capacity to re-capitalise and manage these entities efficiently.\n\n\u201cAs an interim measure, NERC and BPE met on an emergency basis and activated the business continuity process and appointed interim Managing Directors in the affected Discos.\u201d\n\nFor Kano Disco, the interim Managing Director was named as Ahmad Dangana; Benin Disco, Henry Ajagbawa; and Kaduna Disco, Yusuf Yahaya.\n\n\u201cIt must be reiterated that some of the publications from the core investors of these Discos have been quite disingenuous. Beyond the financial issues I have just discussed, the Discos affected happen to be the worst-performing ones.\n\n\u201cIbadan is currently being managed by a so-called receiver manager as a sole administration. The receiver manager has absolutely no capacity to manage a utility and has not been authorised by the regulator as a manager of a Disco.\n\n\u201cIbadan is the worst performing Disco as per the performance assessment review conducted in December 2021.\n\n\u201cIbadan Disco has actually retrogressed in terms of their critical performance parameters as contracted in the performance agreement signed with the bureau.\n\n\u201cIn fact, the Disco under the management of the core investor, Integrated Energy Distribution and Marketing Limited, has performed worse than before it was privatised.\u201d\n\nHe said the performance of Benin, Port Harcourt, Kano and Kaduna Discos \u201chave also been abysmal.\n\n\u201cIt is necessary to state categorically that the poor performance of these Discos represents a clear and present threat to the power sector as a whole and no responsible government and shareholder, would stand idly by and allow this situation to persist.\u201d\n\nThe BPE boss stated that notwithstanding the challenges in the sector, the government remained fully committed to ensuring optimal performance in the power sector and would not shy away from taking the necessary decisive action to achieve this.\n\nHe explained that the bureau considered it imperative to clear the air on the insinuations and statements emanating from some of the electricity distribution companies which were restructured following the collaterised shares of some of the Discos.\n\nHe stated that as the bureau had earlier informed the public, BPE which midwifed the sale of the power companies and NERC, being the industry regulator, were informed by Fidelity Bank Plc on July 5, 2022, that a call on the collateralised shares of the core investors of Kano, Benin and Kaduna Discos had been activated by the lenders.\n\nOkoh said the lenders\u2019 consortium include AFREXIM Bank, Keystone Bank, Stanbic IBTC, as well as Fidelity Bank.\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that the action is a contractual and commercial intervention and is between the core investors in these Discos and the lenders. BPE\u2019s involvement is to protect the 40 per cent shareholding of the Federal Government in the Discos,\u201d he stated.\n\n\u201cIt was on this basis that new boards reflecting this action were constituted as follows: Kano Disco \u2013 Hasan Tukur, Chairman; Nelson Ahaneku, member; and Rabiu Suleiman, member.\n\n\u201cFor Benin Disco, KC Akuma is the Chairman; Adeola Ijose, member; and Charles Onwera, member; while Kaduna Disco has Abbas Jega as Chairman; Ameenu Abubakar, member and Marlene Ngoyi, member.\n\n\u201cBPE has nominated Bashir Gwandu (Kano Disco), Yomi Adeyemi (Benin Disco), and Umar Abdullahi (Kaduna Disco) as independent directors to represent government\u2019s 40 per cent interest in the aforementioned Discos, during this transition.\u201d\n\nHe stated that as the agency, representing the interest of the Federal Government in the Discos, BPE had already engaged with the Central Bank of Nigeria (as the banking sector regulator) for an orderly transition.\n\nThis, he said, was to also ensure that the lenders did not hold the the collateralised shares of the core investors in perpetuity given that they lacked the technical capacity, nor had they been duly authorised to operate an electricity distribution company.\n\n\u201cThe lenders have also assured BPE and NERC that they would participate fully in all the ongoing market initiatives aimed at improving the sector, e.g. the National Mass Metering Programme,\u201d Okoh stated.",

          "text": "The Delta State APC Gubernatorial Campaign Organisation has described the recent defection of PDP leaders to the All Progressives Congress (APC) as a testament to Senator Ovie Omo-Agege\u2019s attractive style of politics.\n\nThis is even as the campaign organisation congratulated the Deputy Senate President and Delta APC governorship candidate, Omo-Agege, on the flagging off ceremony of five projects at his Alma Mater, St. George\u2019s Grammar School Obinomba, Ukwuani LGA, Delta State.\n\nA statement by the director, Communications and Media Strategy, Delta APC Gubernatorial Campaign Organisation, Ima Niboro, on Friday, said during the week, Senator Omo-Agege had led other APC stalwarts to welcome Chief (Barr.) Gabriel Eko, Alhaji Mohammed Umaru, Arinze Mboka and over 1,000 PDP faithful into APC family in Abraka, Ethiope East local government area of the State.\n\nWhile Chief Eko was a two-time PDP chairman, Abraka Ward 3 (2012 to 2020) and Special Adviser to the chairman of Ethiope East LGA Council from 2020 until his recent defection, Alhaji Umaru is chairman of Arewa Community in Ethiope East even as Mboka led the Igbo community in the area.\n\nIn congratulating the Delta Central lawmaker on the defections, the Director, Communications and Media Strategy of the organisation, Niboro, noted that the development was a huge gain not only for APC but lovers of good governance in the state.\n\nThe campaign spokesperson commended the new members for their uncommon courage in identifying with the Obarisi of Urhoboland and joining hands with him to rescue the state from alleged PDP\u2019s strangulation and misgovernamce.\n\nHe said the defectors have made the right choice for their political future and in the interest of the state.\n\nOn the flagging-off ceremony of projects at his Alma Mater in Delta North Senatorial District, Niboro noted that if he could facilitate projects outside his senatorial district without executive powers, he would do more if given the mandate to lead the state as governor.\n\nThe APC standard bearer, he said, had also facilitated projects to Delta South, making him the first lawmaker in the history of the state to influence projects across the three senatorial districts.\n\nAccording to him, with his background in both the Executive and Legislative arms of government, Senator Omo-Agege is the most prepared of all the governorship candidates, stressing that he has the experience and capacity to hit the ground running upon assumption of office.\n\nHe said the federal lawmaker has over 400 constituency projects in 2021 across the state, spanning all sectors including roads, schools, electricity, solar, rural electrification, water projects, educational and ICT infrastructure, primary healthcare, human capital development and empowerment.\n\n\u201cSenator Omo-Agege\u2019s impact stretches beyond his direct constituency. He facilitated the rehabilitation of Asaba/Ugbolu/Illah road in Delta North; renovation, rehabilitation and furnishing of the Nanna Living Museum in Koko, Delta South among others. These records remain unmatched in the 30-year history of our dear state.\n\n\u201cThe EDGE Agenda is committed to halting the weaponisation of poverty, marginalisation of our people and underdevelopment of our communities that lay the golden egg by successive PDP administrations,\u201d Niboro said.\n\nHe described Omo-Agege as a promise keeper, noting that the projects at his Alma-Mater, St. George\u2019s Grammar School Obinomba, were in fulfilment of his promise made in November 2021.\n\nThe projects include construction and equipping of an E-Library, Administrative Block, a storey building containing 12 classrooms block, rehabilitation of the existing Dinning Hall/Refectory, and 200 bed spaces for male and female hostels respectively.",

This was revealed in a statement yesterday in Abuja.\n\nSpeaking on the development, the Executive Vice-President in charge of Business Development and Corporate Banking, Afreximbank Mr. Amr Kamel said, \u201cThe intervention by Afreximbank will help, Nigeria, one of its member states, to invest in natural gas as part of its pathway towards a just energy transition and achieve a more sustainable and climate resilient economic development.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe holistic approach deployed by the Bank in the UTM project is a model that Afreximbank aims to replicate across its member countries. It is through such interventions that we can ignite transformative actions that will spur industrialization and export development activities across the continent\u201d.\n\nThe deal marks Afreximbank\u2019s ongoing support in leading UTM\u2019s fundraising efforts to secure the necessary investment required for the projects\u2019 implementation. This project is of historical significance as it is the first FNLG project developed by an African-owned company on the continent.\n\nUTM is undertaking the development, design, and construction of an FLNG facility with a Liquified Natural Gas LNG nameplate production capacity of 1.2 million metric ton per annum and a storage capacity of 200,000 cubic meters, as well as ancillary facilities to be located 60km from the shore of Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria.\n\nAs well as representing a \u201cfirst\u201d as an African-led intervention in the FNLG sector, the project aligns with Afreximbank\u2019s strategic aim of advancing activities which boast strong climate finance credentials. Most importantly, the project paves the way for a just energy transition in line with the reduction of carbon emissions as prescribed at COP26.\n\nMoreover, this project has economically transformative potential \u2013 establishing trade-enabling infrastructure which will allow Nigeria to pivot from a crude oil export-based economy to a gas-based processing industrial economy in turn unlocking significant development impacts.\n\nTo advance the timely implementation of the project, Afreximbank is leveraging its diverse product suite to provide end-to-end solutions. During the pre-investment stage, the project preparation facility will be deployed to de-risk the project and rapidly progress it towards bankability.\n\nIn addition, under the PPF, the Bank will be appointed as mandated lead arranger (MLA) and lead in syndicating the debt raise \u2013 with the ability to incorporate credit enhancements, if required.",

Gbemisola Saraki, made this known at the 16th International Maritime Seminar for Judges, organised by the Nigerian Shippers Council NSC under the Auspices of Federal Ministry of Transportation in collaboration with the National Judicial Institute NJI on Tuesday in Abuja.\n\nHighlights of the event was hinged on the importance of Nigerian ownership of shipping activities within the country in order to reap the full economic benefits of the maritime sector.\n\nRepresented by the Director of Procurement, Useni Adamu, Saraki emphasised the need for capacity building in the maritime industry.\n\n\u201cIt is a common knowledge that most of our maritime transportation is conducted by foreign shipowners, thereby limiting the economic benefits accruable to the nation and the sub-region in areas such as creation of jobs, freight and insurance earnings etc\u201d she noted.\n\nThe Minister explained that it is in the above regard that the development of a national fleet becomes imperative.\n\n\u201cThe present administration is looking into ways of encouraging the establishment of a private sector-driven national shipping line to ensure maximum exploitation of the potentials in our maritime industry.\n\n\u201cA Ministerial Committee has been working on this important initiative and I look forward to having their concrete recommendations for immediate implementation\u201d she stated.\n\nWhile welcoming Judges of Federal High Court, Court of Appeal, Supreme Court, the Chief Judge of Sierra Leone and the Representatives of Supreme Court Judges from Ghana, Kenya and other West African countries, Saraki explained the need for continues engagement with the judiciary in ensuring smooth development of the maritime sector.\n\n\u201cMy Lords, the lacuna created by the low penetration level in Maritime Law at the undergraduate levels of our Universities, coupled with the fast pace of development in international trade, exerts a lot of strain on our judicial officers some of whom are confronted with this special area of the law for the first time when Admiralty matters are brought before their courts for adjudication.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore commendable that this seminar has created a veritable forum where prominent jurists and legal luminaries come together to rub minds on how to enhance the competitiveness and economic viability of our maritime industry, not only through the capacity building of the judicial officers, but indeed also in tackling some of the crucial issues on the front burner of maritime discourse both locally and globally.\n\n\u201cThis will no doubt increase the confidence of investors in the industry, since it is obvious that an efficient, lucid, predictable and stable legal system plays a very significant role in attracting investors\u201d the Minister noted.\n\nIn his Address, the Acting Chief Judge of Nigeria, Justice Olukayode Ariwoola said the seminar is designed among other things to acquaint participants with emerging trends in the sphere of Admiralty Law and the challenges that digitalisation and globalisation may throw up on the adjudication of admiralty matters.\n\n\u201cI can say without contradiction that Judges who have experienced and participated in this Seminar in the past, have become better equipped with knowledge of rudimentary maritime laws necessary in handling compicx maritime claims/cases\u201d.\n\nIn his vote of thanks,, the Executive Secretary of NSC, Hon. Emmanuel Jime said \u201cthe task of organizing and maintaining a high quality event like this, is understandably, not an easy one.\n\nIt requires enormous commitment, sacrifice, dedication and patriotic duty and responsibility.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore in this light that I want to thank the Chairman and members of the International Maritime Seminar for Judges Organizing Committee led by the Honourable, the Chief Justice of the Federal High Court, Honourable Justice John T. Tsoho for their untiring and priceless work done in putting all this together in spite of the unusual late start of the preparations.

          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nDirector General, National Steel Raw Materials Exploration Agency, NSRMEA, Engr, Dr. Umar Albarka Hassan, has said that value addition in iron and steel production was not only for the purpose of revenue generation but will also spur industrialization and investment rates in the country.\n\nHassan during an interview session with journalist in Abuja on progress made in the steel and minerals sector noted that the country has established smelting companies that will produce in large sums steel metals that had exportable characteristics to the world and which investors have come to reckon with.\n\nSpeaking on the resuscitation of the Ajaokuta Steel Company located in Kogi State, he stated that, \u201d there is hope for the Ajaokuta Steel Company, not only for it but for others of which Ajaokuta is one of the many steel plants in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFor Ajaokuta, it has perculiar challenges and we are aware of the MOU the government has signed for the development of the steel company this is not only for the blast furnace functions. Our key plan is not only for Ajaokuta. We also have these hub that produces iron ore for most of the private owned steel companies in the country that produces steel through scrap metal, that hub will help to reduce the amount of money expended in materials required to produce steel products.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately the plant has still not come on steam. But the reason are pretty straight forward. Subsequent administrations simply failed to put in place some components required to make it functional. For instance logistics challenges. The blast furnace requires thousand tonnes of liquid steel for the first phase. Some of these materials like 1.3million tonnes of coking coal that needs to be imported annually for the 1.3million tonnes annual production of liquid steel require ships sailing to nearby ports.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that the agency has been able to establish the production of manganese which will definitely step up the importation of that resources for the production of steel in Nigeria emphasising that, \u201cwe don\u2019t produce steel, we produce steel, we establish local sources to facilitate the local producers to boost their capacities to produce steel there by bridging those gaps.\n\nSo if we do that along with the processing of some local sources for our raw materials especially for iron ore, then we will improve the sector.\u201d\n\nDiscussing the role of the Agency in exploration and sourcing for raw materials for economic development, he explained that, \u201cas for my agency, our minerals resources are found and majored under iron and steel minerals. When you talk about steel production it is actually extracting iron ore and converting it into steel which is also value addition. And our mandate is to source for materials for iron and steel production and ofcourse adding value. When you talk about other minerals that are exploited example gold and other minerals we have established smelting companies to create value addition to such minerals.\n\nHe also revealed that some of our achievements of the agency in developing the nation\u2019s economy includes \u201cestablishing the gap of characterising our minerals resources, we explore, establish deposits but are they really suitable for use to produce iron and steel so that agency ensures this using our improve and confirmed laboratories to facilitate characterisation on these raw materials that we established.\n\n\u201cAnd currently these laboratories are apt and in good working conditions. We have the Scintrex( Fluxgate) Magnetometer for magnetic surveys, SARIS Resistivity Meter for Earth Resistivity Measurements, drilling rigs and support equipment and mineral separation equipment that will enable us produce and sample products that we can test their suitability. Similarly for the physical survey activities we have acquired equipment that would empower that department to enable them to establish locations and facilitate determination of real targets to minimize searching for actual locations of these resources.\u201d\n\nHe further stated that the role of the agency in sourcing for local sources of raw materials for example iron ore has fostered the development of the African Natural Resources Steel Plant in Kaduna State noting that, NSRMEA helped in the exploration of iron ore that was used to establish the company similarly for Ajaokuta Steel.\n\n\u201cBuilding upon the previous achievements of the agency, we have discovered and established iron ores in some areas where such had not been established, talking about the Raw Materials industry in Niger State, there is also the establishment of Bauxite in Ekiti State and similarly a very important local sources for Silica Sand resources that we established in five, 5, States of Katsina, batches found in Ogun, Ondo, Akwa Ibom. Also we have established Manganese resources located in Cross River and Kogi State we have also established and earmarked local sources deposits in Zamfara State,\u201d he added.\n\nContinuing on the achievements of the NSRMEA which has been in existence for the past 50 years since its establishment in 1971 with the discovery of iron ore deposits by the agency through the Nigerian Steel Development Authority, NSDA, which led to the creation of Ajaokuta Steel Company which is a major milestone, the Director General also said that the agency has discovered deposits of very necessary raw minerals resources that was required for the production of steel products in Nigeria adding that the essence of this local resources is to ensure that these raw materials were not imported.",

Ben Nwude, a former President of the Nigerian Society of Mining Engineers reviewed efforts made by the governments of 36 States of the federation and resolved that none was satisfactory.\n\nKadiri said state governments were not doing enough in the quest to jointly pursue the realisation of the Roadmap for Growth and Development of the Nigerian mining sector.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cNone of the 36 State governments satisfied the criteria for organisation ten most impactful mining sector entities of 2022. The absence of states in the list is a sad commentary that undermines the realisation of set goals for the sector, especially the economic diversification agenda.\u201d\n\nThe Chairman expressed concern that although the economic diversification agenda was repeatedly adopted by successive federal administrations in the country, \u201cthere is little to show for it as over 80 per cent of Nigerians were still poor despite the abounding multiplicity of solid mineral resources in the thirty-six of the federation.\n\nHe called on states to collaborate with the federal government to realise set goals, and quoted a World Bank poverty assessment report titled, \u201cA Better Future for All Nigerians: 2022 Nigeria Poverty Assessment,\u201d as saying that the number of poor Nigerians is increasing, and it is projected to hit 95.1milloin in 2022.\n\n\u201cThere are so many policies and campaign promises to develop the solid minerals sector but there is hardly equipment or financial support from state governments to indigenous mining operators, and there are too few state government-owned mineral development companies.\u201d\n\nKadiri added that state governments must make commitment to the development of the sector as some of them have accorded the agriculture sector.\n\nHe disclosed that the 10 entities earned the recognition for commitment to global best practices and for working against all odds to put the Nigerian mining sector on the world map and by providing information needed by prospective investors, and needed to support critical projects of government that are designed to facilitate economic diversification.\n\nHe therefore congratulated the entities that made the list and urged them to continue to contribute to the growth and development of the Mining and Mineral sector of Nigeria.",

After Christmas time. Late January to third week of February. You will see that they are getting full. Unusually. I\u2019m into the business of data and statistics. And I decided to particularly look at that. This tells you that social media is going to vote. Even if they are in Antarctica, one person is there and he mobilises 100,000 people here to go out and vote. It has succeeded.\n\nREAD ALSO: Tinubu Has Agreed To Pick A Muslim Deputy \u2013 Ganduje\n\nIn 2023, social media is going to vote.

The bank balance of any big politician is starting to be irrelevant. Those of us who sweated for the little that we have, we are spending it very wisely and carefully. Those of them who made it from government, who will just open the coffers and bring it out; they will continue to splash it and it will continue to mean less and less.\u201d\n\nYoung and bright\n\nThe presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, had announced Baba-Ahmed as his running mate earlier on Friday.\n\nHe made the announcement at an event in Abuja, saying the decision followed a series of consultations with stakeholders.\n\n\u201cI thank all those gathered here today,\u201d Obi said in his address. \u201cThey will bear witness and lay claim to being present on the day when the journey to Nigeria\u2019s rebirth began. It is my honour to inform you, my fellow Nigerians and especially the OBIdients that finally, after very long and wide consultations, we in the Labour Party have found an eminently qualified Nigerian who will be my partner as we embark on our march to a secure, united and productive Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI have the distinct honour of presenting to you, my friend and running mate, and God willing, the next Vice President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria Senator Yusuf Datti Baba-Ahmed, who has been described as \u2018one of Nigeria\u2019s youngest and brightest personalities\u2019 who has distinguished himself in various areas of human endeavours.\u201d\n\n\ufeff\n\nBaba-Ahmed represented Zaria in the House of Representatives from 2003 to 2007, and later Kaduna North senatorial district between 2011 and 2012.\n\nAccording to Obi, a former governor of Anambra State, the vice-presidential candidate brings to the mission great personal, academic and entrepreneurial strengths, as well as impeccable credentials with the added value of rich experience as an academician, businessman, public servant, economic and development expert, and politician.\n\nHe described Baba-Ahmed as a recognised wealth creator and manager who fits well into the mould of a transformative and adaptive leader.\n\n\u201cToday, I will not dwell too much on our national challenges. Yet, I will be remiss to gloss over them completely,\u201d the presidential candidate stated. \u201cThese are extremely difficult times for our country. Nigeria straddles the lowest rungs of the global development indices. We are hugely indebted and the poverty capital of the world. Nigerians are hungry and angry and fed up with bad leadership. Times like this do not call for politics of business as usual.\n\n\u201cAs I have always said, my vision and mission is to give full expression to our democracy by moving our country from consumption to production. Now that the presidential team is complete, we will in the days ahead, unveil our governance principles, priorities, and programmes for turning Nigeria around, which shall be anchored on the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\u201d\n\n\u201cSecuring, uniting, and making Nigeria productive require steady and trusted hands. I am confident that with Dr Yusuf Datti Baba-Ahmed by my side, we shall ensure that in moving Nigeria forward, no state or community will be left behind. Pursuant to its statutory responsibility to protect, our government will promote the rule of law, ensure that governance is inclusive, cost-effective, transformative, less transactional, and national investments regenerative.\n\n\u201cFinally, with human capital development as the core premise, we will pursue proactively, well-articulated strategies and intrusive policy coordination and implementation, aimed at tackling the key challenges that are routine and of utmost concern to domestic and foreign investors.\u201d",

          "text": "Naomi Campbell is now Dr. Campbell after receiving an honorary Ph.D. for her contributions to the fashion industry.\n\nNaomi Campbell just added an honorary Ph.D. from the University for the Creative Arts in England to her list of groundbreaking life achievements.\n\nThe degree is the perfect fit for Campbell\u2019s ongoing legacy in the fashion world. The supermodel attended the commencement ceremony at the Royal Festival Hall in London on Thursday, wearing a beige jumpsuit and black boots beneath her cap and gown.\n\nThe 52-year-old supermodel gave fans a behind-the-scenes glimpse of the day\u2019s festivities on Instagram. While brief, in the video Campbell shows off her cover-girl smile as she simply says, \u201cHi everyone!\u201d while strutting in her cap and gown.\n\nA tweet from Perfect Magazine also revealed the recent graduate wiping tears of joy from her eyes as she spoke to the audience, Campbell recalled attending fashion house Balenciaga\u2019s couture presentation in Paris just a day before, walking the runway alongside Nicole Kidman, Kim Kardashian, Dua Lipa and more while rocking a voluminous floor-length black coat.\n\nFrom runway strut to graduation walk, there is no understating the significance of Campbell\u2019s accomplishments. The icon\u2019s contributions have been deeply felt in the fashion industry and beyond, as she\u2019s used her influence to not only further her own still-strong career, but support the ambitions of others, especially fellow Black models.\n\nThe trail Campbell has blazed in the fashion world began at age 15, when she quickly became one of the most sought-after modelsin an industry notorious for keeping Black women out. Despite becoming one of the most globally famous Black models, she nevertheless received a disproportionate amount of advertising compared to her white counterparts.\n\nDrawing from her own experiences and adversities, Campbell was also vocal during the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests following the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery. During an interview with Reuters that year, she expressed hope that \u201cchange\u201d was, at last, coming as brands made promises to better recognize and value Black lives. This included hiring more Black talent \u201cas designers, stylists and make-up artists,\u201d as well as in editorial and executive roles.\n\nAs an influential voice in couture fashion and now also a mother of a one-year-old daughter, Campbell continues to speak openly and earnestly in 2022 about the ways in which fashion needs to evolve and pave the way for new talent.",

Internet traffic had dropped to around 75% of its normal level by Friday morning, according to NetBlocks, an internet watchdog organisation.\n\nRogers is the mobile carrier of nearly 11 million Canadians, with a stake in everything from hockey to cable television.\n\nToronto\u2019s police department tweeted that some mobile phone users were having trouble calling the emergency services, despite it remaining \u201cfully operational\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf the call connects please stay on the call as long as possible,\u201d the force wrote, adding that people who cannot connect should call back.\n\nPolice in Ottawa tweeted: \u201cIf your call fails, please try again, or call from a landline or cellphone with another provider.\u2033\n\nThe outages have also hit passport offices, courthouses and transit payment systems.\n\nOn-call medical employees for the Scarborough Health Network, which operates hospitals in Toronto, have been asked to come into work until the issue is resolved.\n\nIn the Quebec province, a Montreal court delayed a trial hearing for disgraced fashion mogul Peter Nygard after jail officials were unable to connect him to a videoconference system.\n\nIn urban areas, people have flocked to cafes and places with functioning Wi-Fi.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s tonnes of people here with their laptops just working away ferociously, the same as they would at home, because they\u2019ve got no service at home,\u201d one Starbucks customer in Toronto told Reuters.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, the vice-president of Rogers told CBC that the company was still working to identify the \u201croot cause\u201d of the issue.\n\n\u201cAs of now, we don\u2019t have an ETA of when the problem will be fixed,\u201d said Kye Prigg.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t like to say whether it\u2019s going to be fully online today or not,\u201d he said, also declining to say whether cyberhackers may be to blame.\n\nThis is the second major outage to affect Rogers in just over a year.

          "text": "Some governors elected on the platform of All Progressives Congress (APC) on Friday met with the Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike at his country home in Port Harcourt, apparently to woo him to join the APC ahead of the 2023 elections.\n\nWike, who lost the presidential ticket of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar and also failed to get the Vice-Presidential ticket of the party, has been at loggerheads with the PDP ever since.\n\nThe governors who met with Wike yesterday were Kayode Fayemi, Rotimi Akeredolu and Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Ekiti, Ondo, and Lagos states, respectively.\n\nOthers in their entourage were the Ekiti State Governor-elect, Biodun Oyebanji; former Ekiti State governor and PDP chieftain, Ayodele Fayose, among others.\n\nSources said the APC governors are banking on the recent fallout of Wike with PDP leadership, after the main opposition party\u2019s presidential primary, to get him into their party.\n\nWike has recently been receiving visits from politicians across political parties.\n\nFollowing Atiku\u2019s choice of Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, as running mate, the Chairman of the PDP\u2019s Board of Trustees, Senator Walid Jibrin, said the party had set up a nine-member committee to appease Wike.\n\nThe former vice president is believed to have nominated Okowa, despite the recommendation of Wike for the position by a 17-man committee set up by the party.\n\nThe crisis worsened with the loyalists of Wike threatening to leave the party if their principal defects.\n\nBut Atiku recently allayed fears over the crisis in the party, saying he would ensure reconciliation.\n\nThe crack in the main opposition party came to light after the Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, accused Atiku of failing to honour the democratic choice in the selection of his running mate.\n\nAccording to him, Wike, and others who backed him for the PDP vice-presidential ticket deserve a detailed explanation from the party\u2019s presidential candidate.\n\nOrtom, who said this during an interview on Arise TV on June 29, 2022, said it was surprising that Atiku could jettison the recommendation of 14 out of 17 members of the committee that recommended Wike as his running mate.\n\nOrtom said: \u201cI was among the 17-man committee that was set up by the candidate himself and some of us said Wike should be the vice-president. We discussed that in our meeting and we said it did not matter if he had supported the presidential candidate or not, but all that we need is unity and how to make things work.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the candidate himself picked Okowa. Some of us have resorted to prayers. I was really confused because I felt Wike would have been the VP. He was the second person to Atiku and Wike has charisma. All of us have our weak points.\n\n\u201cWike can be something, but when it comes to mobilisation, impact, value addition and reaching out, Wike is an instrument. Wike is somebody who stood for the party. For some of us, we believed in him, but unfortunately, it was someone else.\u201d\n\nBlessing Ibunge in Port Harcourt",
