          "text": "*Activates emergency operations centre\n\n\n\nBy Joseph Erunke\n\nTHE Nigeria Centre for Disease Control,NCDC,has reported 21 confirmed cases of Monkeypox with one death from nine states and the Federal Capital Territory,FCT.\n\n\n\nThis came as it activated Monkeypox Emergency Operations Centre to strengthen in-country preparedness and contribute to the global response.\n\n\n\nThe NCDC,in a statement late Sunday night by its Director General,Dr Ifedayo Adetifa, mentioned the nine states asAdamawa with five cases, Lagos with four cases, Bayelsa and Delta, Cross River,FCT and Kano with two cases each while Imo and Rivers states with one case, respectively.\n\n\u201cThis year, as at 29th May 2022, a total of 21 confirmed cases with one death have been reported from 9 states and the FCT\n\n\u201cThe death was reported in a 40-year-old patient who had underlying co-morbidity and was on immunosuppressive medications. Genomic surveillance is ongoing at NCDC\u2019s National Reference Laboratory in Abuja and so far all of the cases have been confirmed to be caused by West Africa clade Monkeypox virus,\u201dthe statement read.\n\n\n\n\u201cOn 26th May 2022, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (NCDC) activated a national multisectoral Emergency Operations Centre for Monkeypox (MPX-EOC) at level 2 to strengthen and coordinate ongoing response activities in-country while contributing to the global response.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis was based on the report of a preliminary risk assessment done by a group of Subject Matter Experts from the NCDC, relevant government Ministries Departments and Agencies and partner agencies,\u201dit said.\n\na\u00e7cording to the agency,\u201d The May 2022 Monkeypox situation report can be assessed via it official website\n\n\u201cAmong the 21 cases reported in 2022 so far, there has been no evidence of any new or unusual transmission of the virus, nor changes in its clinical manifestation documented (including symptoms, profile and virulence),\u201dit added.\n\n\n\nThe NCDC explained that,\u201dPrior to the activation of the MPX-EOC, a multi-agency Technical Working Group (TWG) coordinated at the NCDC led Nigeria\u2019s efforts to improve the detection, prevention and control of Monkeypox.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe statement read further:\u201d Nigeria\u2019s national surveillance system, the Surveillance Outbreak Response Management and Analysis System (SORMAS) was first deployed in response to the 2017 Monkeypox outbreak to improve the timeliness and completeness of case reporting, as well as facilitate the overall response (access relevant publication here \u2013\n\nhttp://hdl.handle.net/10033/622144). In addition, this pilot project informed the nationwide scale-up of SORMAS to enable real-time reporting of surveillance data for prompt public health response to infectious disease outbreaks including COVID-19.\n\n\n\n\u201cFollowing the detection of the index case on September 22, 2017 and the effective containment of the 2017 outbreak in Nigeria, the NCDC through the Monkeypox TWG worked on various interventions to gain a better understanding of the epidemiology of the virus to inform preparedness and response in-country (access NCDC-affiliated Monkeypox publications via https://ncdc.gov.ng/research).\n\n\n\n\u201cThe TWG coordinated the development of national Monkeypox guidelines, capacity building of healthcare workers and surveillance officers on case detection, sample collection, laboratory testing for confirmation and sequencing of the virus at NCDC\u2019s National Reference Laboratory and intensified public awareness through risk communication.\n\nThe national Monkeypox response guidelines can be accessed via \u2013 https://ncdc.gov.ng/themes/common/docs/protocols/96_1577798337.pdf.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, a national One-health risk surveillance and information sharing (NOHRSIS) group has been inaugurated to facilitate timely information exchange on all prioritised zoonotic diseases. NOHRSIS will also strengthen the collaborative efforts of the One health/IHR Unit at the Point of Entry to intensify surveillance for the disease in animals as well as ensure minimal contact with suspected animals.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn addition, the One Health Animal Surveillance team including Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Federal Ministry of Environment, National Veterinary Research Institute and partners commenced operational research on Monkeypox virus prevalence in small mammals at the human-animal interface since October 2018. This research has been completed in 7 states with a planned roll out in all other states to commence soon.\n\n\n\n\u201cAlthough Nigeria\u2019s risk of exposure to the Monkeypox virus is high based on the recent risk assessment conducted at NCDC, the current situation in-country and globally has shown no significant threat to life or the community that can result in severe disease or high case fatality rate. The EOC will continue to monitor the evolving situation to inform public health action accordingly.\n\n\n\n\u201cSymptoms of monkeypox include sudden fever, headache, body pain, weakness, sore throat, enlargement of glands (lymph nodes) in the neck and under the jaw, followed by the appearance of a rash (often solid or fluid-filled at the onset) on the face, palms, soles of the feet, genitals and other parts of the body.\n\n\n\nThe Monkeypox public health advisory can be accessed via \u2013 https://ncdc.gov.ng/news/367/public-health-advisory-on-monkeypox.\n\n\u201cThe NCDC emphasises that members of the public should remain aware of the risk of Monkeypox and adhere to public health safety measures \u2013 specifically, report to the nearest health facility if you notice the known signs and symptoms of the disease.\n\n\n\nHealthcare workers are to maintain a high index of suspicion for Monkeypox and report any suspected case to the relevant state Epidemiology Team for prompt public health intervention including sampling for confirmatory testing.\u201d",

          "text": "Former Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the Ohanaeze Ndigbo political organization, Chuks Ibegbu, on Sunday accused the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, of betraying the Igbos.\n\nIbegbu made the remark while reacting to the emergence of former Vice President Atiku Abubakar as PDP presidential candidate.\n\nSpeaking exclusively with DAILY POST, Ibegbu said PDP went contrary to the nation\u2019s mood by picking Atiku as its presidential flag bearer.\n\nHe, however, said the Igbos should not rely on political parties but on individuals if the Southeast must achieve its goal of producing Nigeria\u2019s president.\n\nAccording to Ibegbu: \u201cThe mood of the nation is for power to shift to the Southeast, and contrary to the nation\u2019s mood, the PDP has betrayed the Igbos, which we paid the price to sustain. The PDP betrayed the Southeast and the Igbos.\n\n\u201cAb initio, we have always advocated that for the sake of peace, equity, stability, the progress of the nation, and power should shift to the Southeast political zone and Igbos in general.\n\n\u201cSo, PDP went against the mood and current of the nation. However, the door is not yet closed; other political parties are there. And I think we should not be relying on political parties but on individuals if we want to move Nigeria forward.\n\n\u201cPDP has done its own, and other parties are expected to do their own, then Nigerians should decide if we want to continue to be the world\u2019s poverty capital, Nigerians must decide if they want to continue with the insecurity in the Northern part of the country. The insecurity is more in the Northeast, where Atiku hails from. There is insecurity in Daura, where Buhari hails from. We also have insecurity in the Southeast and all over Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe delegates that went to the PDP convention and decided to be swayed by financial inducement, they and their children would face the challenges of tomorrow if we don\u2019t get things right.\n\n\u201cI challenge APC presidential delegates to shun money. Is it not better that Nigeria is progressive and developmentally controlled for the benefit of their children? Or they want billions as a bribe to bring about the wrong leadership. We have been gnashing our teeth for the past seven years due to this collective betrayal, and we are suffering the consequences. Atiku has emerged, and other parties would do their primaries. At the end of the day, Nigerians should shine their eyes and decide if they want to continue in religious and tribal sentiments.\u201d",

          "text": "From Fred Itua, Abuja\n\nLeaders drawn from different parts of the country, have called on the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to give its 2023 presidential ticket to a Christian from Southern Nigeria, in order to create a balance.\n\nThe leaders who condemned the emergence of former vice president Atiku Abubakar as the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), wondered why another Northern Muslim will be given the ticket after eight years of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s time in office.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nNational convener of Nigeria Equity Group, Dr. Emeka Nwosu and national secretary, Mohammed Mubarak, in a statement made available to newsmen in Abuja, said for a country as complex as Nigeria, retaining power in one part of the country will not promote unity.\n\nThey promised to mobilise for the APC nationwide and ensure that the PDP is not returned to power for ignoring the complex and diverse nature of Nigeria.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cWe wish to respond to the emergence of the former Vice President, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar as the Presidential candidate of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) for the 2023 presidential election. Alhaji Atiku, a northern Muslim, defeated a plethora of PDP presidential aspirants in a contentious primary election in Abuja to lead the PDP charge for the general elections.\n\nBreaking!!!

In our several interventions over the years, we have appealed to the major political parties to be mindful of the complex heterogeneous Nigerian society and to work out a political solution that will be fair, inclusive and equitable to all.\n\n\u201cIn this case, we believe what is just and fair is for presidential powers to be zoned to the South, specifically to a southern Christian, after the eight-year rule of President Muhammadu Buhari, a northern Muslim. We consider it to be very inequitable, unfair and potentially dangerous for the Presidency to remain in the North after President Buhari\u2019s tenure.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\n\u201cWe wish to note that the various crises that have plagued the Nigerian society lately stem from the feeling of neglect, marginalization and inequity. These cries of marginalization seem to have some validations and have been amplified under the tenure of President Buhari who apparently has favored the North in key appointments and interventions.\n\n\u201cFor instance, all the leaders of the various arms of government are Northern Muslims, starting from President Buhari himself; Ahmad Lawan, Senate President and Chairman of the National Assembly, and Ibrahim Tanko Muhammad, who is the Chief Justice of Nigeria. Key appointments in the military and paramilitary agencies are also skewed in favour of the north.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\n\u201cThis atmosphere has heightened the call for a more equitable distribution of political offices and appointments in a manner that reflects the complexity and diversity of the Nigerian State. We, at the NEG, have been at the vanguard of this campaign because of our love for Nigeria and understanding that it is in the country\u2019s strategic and long term interest to put issues of equity and inclusion at the centre of our politics.\n\n\u201cWe therefore totally condemn the decision of the PDP to elect a northern Muslim presidential candidate at this point of our national life. This is a potentially dangerous decision that has serious implications for national unity and security. We strongly believe this decision does not bode well for our country and would lead to further crises and aggravate the growing fissures of the Nigerian society.\n\n\u201cWe will therefore mobilize Nigerians of goodwill everywhere against this act of arbitrariness by the PDP. We note that one man\u2019s ambition cannot be greater than the security and stability of our country.\n\n\u201cWe call on the ruling Party, the All Progressives Congress (APC) to be deliberate about its search for a Presidential candidate and to work towards a consensus around a southern Christian, for the sake of the peace and long term good of our country. This would demonstrate that the APC has better understanding of the Nigerian society and is a Party built on trust, goodwill, and diversity.\n\n\u201cWe assure the APC of total victory if they do this as we will mobilize Christians and Muslims, northerners and southerners, and all men and women of goodwill to back this ticket.\n\n\u201cFinally, we note that Nigeria is on the precipice and we should be careful not to push it down the cliff.\u201d\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

Aminu Tambuwal had stepped down from the race and asked his supporters to vote for Atiku.\n\n\n\nTambuwal also congratulated the former vice president after he emerged victorious.\n\nThe National Leader of All Progressives Congress (APC) and frontline presidential aspirant, Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has congratulated Atiku on his victory and welcomed him to the presidential contest in the 2023 general election.\n\n\n\nIn the result of the primary election announced by the Chief Returning Officer and former President of the Senate, Senator David Mark, Atiku polled 371 votes to defeat his main challenger and Governor of Rivers State, Mr Nyesom Wike, who scored 237 votes. Former President of the Senate, Dr Bukola Saraki came a distant third with 70 votes, while Governor of Akwa Ibom State, Mr Udom Emmanuel and his counterpart in Bauchi State, Senator Bala Mohammed scored 38 votes and 20 votes, respectively.\n\n\n\nThe delegates cast 763 votes; 12 votes were voided while the number of valid votes was 751.\n\nA former Senate President, Senator Anyim Pius Anyim got 14 votes while Mr Sam Ohuabunwa and the only female aspirant, Terila Diana Oliver, got one vote each.\n\n\n\nA former Governor of Ekiti State, Mr Ayo Fayose got zero, while the Publisher of Ovation, Mr Dele Momodu, also got zero votes.\n\n\n\nFollowing the alleged inducement of delegates in the ongoing primaries being conducted by political parties, the operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) yesterday stormed the venue of the PDP national convention in Abuja.\n\n\n\nThe officers who were in red jackets with the \u201cEFCC\u201d crested at the back, were seen in their numbers walking around and inside the venue.\n\n\n\nSome of them were caught on camera searching the bags of some delegates.\n\nBefore the commencement of the voting, Tambuwal withdrew from the race and urged his supporters and delegates to vote for Atiku.\n\n\n\nHe said having consulted widely across the country, he decided to withdraw from the race for posterity.\n\nDr Nwachukwu Anakwenze and Mr Mohammed Hayatu-Deen also withdrew from the race.\n\nWhile Hayatu-Deen withdrew on Friday, Anakwenze announced his withdrawal during his remarks at the venue of the convention yesterday.\n\n\n\nAnakwenze, however, urged the delegates to vote for aspirants that can develop the country.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Atiku pledged to unite the country, which he said, has been divided by the APC-led administration.\n\n\n\n\u201cToday, we are making another history which we believe will bring fundamental changes in the country, both by providing adequate security and fixing the economy,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nHe described the election as one of the freest and a milestone to bring about democratic changes in Nigeria.\n\nAtiku sought the cooperation of his fellow contestants, promising to give them a sense of belonging in his administration.\n\n\n\nHe promised to deal decisively with insecurity and revive the economy.\n\nAtiku also appealed to all aggrieved members of the party to return to the party, adding that the internal conflict resolutions would be reactivated to address and resolve all disputes.\n\n\n\nThe former vice president had in 1993, contested the Social Democratic Party presidential primary, losing to Moshood Abiola and Baba Gana Kingibe.\n\n\n\nHe was a presidential candidate of the Action Congress in the 2007 presidential election, coming third to Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua of the PDP and Muhammadu Buhari of the ANPP.\n\nHe contested the presidential primary of the PDP during the 2011 presidential election losing out to incumbent President Goodluck Jonathan.\n\n\n\nIn 2014, he joined the APC ahead of the 2015 presidential election and contested the presidential primary but lost to Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\n\nIn 2017, he returned to the PDP and was the party\u2019s presidential candidate during the 2019 presidential election, but lost again to incumbent President Buhari.\n\nPDP Focused to Win 2023 General Elections, Says Ayu\n\nIn his remarks, the National Chairman of the party, Dr Iyorchia Ayu, said the focus of the party is to win the 2023 general election.\n\n\n\nAyu said the victory of PDP in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) area council elections and other by-elections was a signal that Nigerians wanted PDP back to power in 2023.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur focus is on 2023, but we seek to retake both Osun and Ekiti states in July elections as our low-hanging fruits.\n\n\u201cThe electoral triumphs from there will sustain our momentum, boost the morale of party members and amplify our notice to the overwhelmed All Progressives Congress (APC) that PDP is coming.\n\n\u201cWith PDP, Nigeria shall rise again,\u201d Ayu said.\n\n\n\nHe added that his leadership had worked to unite, rebrand and reposition the party, while also reviving the intellectual arm of the party, the Peoples Democratic Institute (PDI).\n\nPDP Convention, Call to Salvage Nigeria, Says Mark\n\nSpeaking during the convention, a former President of the Senate and Chairman, of the 2022 PDP National Convention Organising Committee, Senator David Mark, described the convention as a call to salvage Nigeria and offer solutions to its present challenges.\n\n\n\nMark said the country is currently faced with challenges: including over three months strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), insecurity, unemployment and poverty.\n\nHe said that history beckoned on PDP to rescue the nation.\n\n\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s convention is beyond the ordinary, it is a call to salvage Nigeria from the brinks. Nigeria has had chequered socio-economic and political problems but never has it descended so low.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe 2023 election is not a contest between the PDP and other political parties, it will be a moment of historic decision of all Nigerians to right the wrongs at the moment and faith in the PDP as the vehicle to redeem the situation and give them a chance to live again.\n\n\n\n\u201cNo wonder, our logo the umbrella, is a veritable shade and shield for Nigerians and Nigeria as an entity.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore a call to patriotic national service, for all of us; delegates to make the wise decision which will ultimately save Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nTinubu Congratulates Atiku, Says former VP will Be His Opponent\n\nMeanwhile, the National Leader of APC and frontline presidential aspirant, Tinubu, has also congratulated Atiku for emerging as the flag bearer of the PDP.\n\nTinubu commended Atiku for his patriotism and commitment to Nigeria\u2019s progress.\n\n\n\nIn a signed by the Director of Media and Communication of his campaign organisation, Mr. Bayo Onanuga, the former Governor of Lagos State also congratulated the other contestants for the orderly and peaceful way they conducted themselves and for pledging to rally round the winner, in the true spirit of democratic sportsmanship.\n\nTinubu said he expected Atiku to be his worthy opponent, by the Grace of God and the support of APC delegates, in the coming 2023 presidential election.\n\n\n\n\u201cI welcome the victory of Alhaji Atiku Abubakar as the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the just concluded primary. I look forward to squaring up with him as a worthy opponent in the coming election. I have known the former Vice President as a formidable politician and a patriot who believes in the unity and progress of our dear country,\u201d Tinubu said.\n\n\n\nTinubu, however, added that the PDP and its candidate would be burdened to explain why Nigerians should give them another opportunity, after squandering 16 years at the central government, without much to show.\n\n\u201cNigerians are yet to forget the national ruin and mismanagement of our country for 16 years by successive PDP administrations and this bad memory will dog the campaign of the PDP Candidate,\u201d Tinubu added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*Buhari may unveil consensus presidential candidate this week\n\n*Jonathan option unsettles other aspirants\n\n*Zoning presidency to North unacceptable, Clark, Adebanjo, other leaders insist\n\nDeji Elumoye, Adedayo Akinwale, Udora Orizu in Abuja and Amby Uneze in Owerri\n\nBarely two months after the Senator Abdullahi Adamu-led National Working Committee (NWC) of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) was elected into office, a fresh crisis may tear the committee apart over Adamu\u2019s leadership style, THISDAY has learnt.\n\n\n\nThis is coming as President Muhammadu Buhari may unveil the consensus presidential candidate of the party this week, just as indications that former President Goodluck Jonathan may emerge as the president\u2019s preferred candidate have unsettled the other presidential aspirants of the ruling party.\n\n\n\nAs the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) concludes its presidential primary today in Abuja, the Southern and Middle Belt Leaders\u2019 Forum (SMBLF) has restated its opposition to zoning the presidency to the North. Indications of the looming crack in APC\u2019s NWC emerged following a letter by the party\u2019s National Vice Chairman, North-west, Salihu Mohammed Lukman to the National Chairman, Adamu, which THISDAY sighted in Abuja yesterday.\n\n\n\nIn the letter dated May 27, 2022, titled: \u2018Rebuilding APC: Need for new Initiatives,\u2019 the former Director-General of the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF) stressed the need to take every measure to avoid past pitfalls.\n\n\n\nIn the letter, Lukman alleged that the new NWC under Adamu is gradually toeing the old path of the leadership style of Comrade Adams Oshiomhole and Hon. Mai Mala Buni where decisions were left unimplemented and NWC members not carried along.\n\n\n\n\u201cUnder your leadership, the current NWC is gradually snowballing into similar circumstances whereby decisions taken are allowed to lay bare and, in some instances, changed without necessarily taking needed steps to carry members along,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\n\nLukman also frowned at what he described as the old approach of dropping President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s name as the sole determinant of crucial activities in the party.\n\n\n\nHe argued that the approach was not only unfair to the president but an attempt to use his name to give excuses for failure.\n\n\n\n\u201cPresidential aspirants are yet to be screened. The official explanation is that you are awaiting final consultation with President Buhari. At the risk of sounding agitated, this is unfair to President Buhari because to the best of my understanding it is an attempt to use the president\u2019s name to give excuses for failure, if it happens, which should not be the case.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe three-page letter read: \u201cIt is now two months since we came into office and you have so far raised a lot of expectations given that some of the problems, which undermined the support base of previous leadership, would appear to have been minimised.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor instance, meetings of the NWC are now held almost every week. Members participate actively and where necessary engage and contest issues. It is to your credit that you accept the positions of members even when you disagree. This is a remarkable departure from what was obtained in the past where the National Chairman conduct meetings of party organs as Chief Executive and to that extent, therefore, exercises prerogatives and overrules members.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe big challenge is ensuring that decisions taken are faithfully and implemented,\u201d Lukman said.\n\nAccording to him, the inability of the party under Oshiomhole and Buni to implement decisions taken was partly responsible for the leadership crisis that confronted the party.\n\nHe advised Adamu to avoid taking unilateral decisions, describing the setting up of the transition committee to take stock of what the NWC inherited as a singular initiative.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe report of the committee was, to say the least very shocking. Apart from the fact that there were more than 200 employees in the party\u2019s National Secretariat, most of whom without valid letters of employment, there were no standardised conditions of service. Statutory requirements for taxations, pensions and insurance benefits as provided by relevant labour laws are not being respected. There were claims by legal firms about liability owed for legal cases handled without valid contracts.\n\n\n\n\u201cAll these were partly responsible for why many of the party\u2019s bank accounts were blocked by subsisting court judgments, most of which copies are not available at the National Secretariat, which with your guidance the Party\u2019s Legal Department can resolve,\u201d Lukman explained.\n\n\u201cAt the rate, we are going, we are walking back to the old spot of over-centralised implementation of party decisions around the national chairman.\n\n\n\n\u201cYour Excellency, I wanted to meet you to discuss these matters. Unfortunately, it has proved difficult, and I feel very strongly about these matters,\u201d Lukman added.\n\nBuhari May Unveil Consensus Presidential Candidate This Week\n\nMeanwhile, indications have emerged that Buhari will meet with all APC presidential aspirants this week to inform them of the consensus arrangement ahead of the party\u2019s primary election.\n\nA presidency source who did not want to be named told THISDAY that the aspirants would be informed individually that the ruling party would adopt a consensus arrangement that would produce a consensus candidate for the party in the 2023 election.\n\n\n\n\u201cAPC will not do what PDP is doing today. There won\u2019t be all of those delegate elections and all that. But the delegates will come. Just that it is going to be a consensus and all that.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey (aspirants) have been informed. Once the president is back in the country, he will have a meeting with all the presidential aspirants,\u201d the source explained.\n\nJonathan Option Unsettles Other APC Presidential Aspirants\n\nMeanwhile, the alleged plan to adopt former President Jonathan as APC\u2019s consensus presidential candidate at the June 6 -8 presidential primary has continued to unsettle other presidential aspirants.\n\n\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the postponement of the primary election from May 29-30 to the new dates has heightened anxiety among the aspirants over the alleged plan to adopt Jonathan as the candidate of the party.\n\n\n\nThough the former president has neither confirmed nor denied his intention to contest for president on the platform of APC in 2023, a strong indication had emerged that he submitted his form to the National Chairman of the party, Senator Adamu.\n\n\n\nJonathan\u2019s chances to be on the ballot in 2023 brightened after a Federal High Court in Bayelsa State on Friday ruled that he is eligible to contest the 2023 presidential election.\n\n\n\nReacting to the alleged plan to adopt Jonathan, a presidential aspirant and Governor of Ekiti State, Dr Kayode Fayemi, had while featuring on The Good Morning Show on ARISE News Channel, said he was not aware that the former president is a member of the ruling party.\n\n\n\nOn its part, Tinubu Support Group (TSG) said a national leader of the party and a frontline presidential aspirant, Senator Bola Tinubu was ready to contest with any aspirant at the party\u2019s primary.\n\nThe Head of Media of the group, Mr Tosin Adeyanju told THISDAY that all they are demanding is a free, fair and transparent primary election.\n\n\n\nHe stated: \u201cWe wait and see. As of now, he is not a member of our party and we will deal with such issues when it arises. Alhaji Ahmed Bola Tinubu is a democrat and ready to face any aspirant at the primaries. All we want is a transparent process and let the popular person win which is the hallmark of democracy,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur eyes are on the ball and we keep counting our numbers. The extension will further help us to reach out to more delegates in southern parts of Nigeria during the week. We are confident of victory \u201c.\n\n\n\nAlso, reacting, the Osinbajo Support Group told THISDAY that foisting Jonathan on others as a consensus candidate would be a huge risk and it might be the end of APC.\n\nThe Spokesperson of the group, Badmus Olawale insisted that the former president would not make the screening process.\n\n\n\nHe noted: \u201cI am not worried in any way. Jonathan will not make the screening process of the APC. We cannot afford to take the path of technical risk that can jeopardise the victory of the APC 2023 presidential elections.\n\n\u201cThe law is clear that a person cannot take the oath of office of the President of Nigeria more than twice.\u201d\n\nOlawale noted that despite the court ruling in favour of Jonathan, the ruling party would be at risk until the Supreme Court decides.\n\n\n\nThe Director of Media, Governor Yahaya Bello Campaign Organisation, Ms Yemi Kolapo, however, told THISDAY that the alleged plan was mere speculation.\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about this. People are just speculating wildly. Those driving the affairs of APC are men of integrity and their sound experience is not in doubt. At any point in time, they would not do anything against the interest of the party,\u201d she explained.\n\nZoning Presidency to North Unacceptable, Clark, Adebanjo, Other Leaders Insist\n\nIn a related development, the SMBLF yesterday restated its opposition to the zoning of the presidency to the North by any political party and urged the delegates to cast their votes for only credible aspirants from the South.\n\nThe leaders warned that the unity and peace of Nigeria could be jeopardised if the consent of the delegates to the unwarrantable determinations were being paraded.\n\n\n\nThe leaders in a statement signed by Chief Edwin Kiagbodo Clark; Afenifere Leader, Chief Ayo Adebanjo; President-General of Middle Belt Forum, Dr Pogu Bitrus and President-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Ambassador George Obiozor, further warned that it would be unacceptable for the major political parties in the country to choose candidates from the North as flag bearers for the 2023 presidency.\n\n\n\nThis, they said, is given the fact that the northern part of the country would have fully enjoyed the Presidency of the country for the full statutory period of eight years by 2023, under President Buhari.\n\n\n\nThey argued that the next President of Nigeria should come from the South, particularly the South-east.\n\nThe SMBLF cautioned all persons from Southern Nigeria not to accept, on any justification, the position of Vice President, adding that this will be a dishonourable legacy for them and generations after them.\n\nSMBLF added that it would also be tantamount to slavishly mortgaging the political future of the people of Southern Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt bears reminding the political class that the basis of any viable democracy, especially in a diverse and complex country such as Nigeria, is fair and even sharing of power, accordingly, we restate our call on all lovers of peace and equity in Nigeria, particularly our people of Southern Nigeria and Middle Belt region, to reject any political party that fails to zone its presidential ticket to the South,\u201d SMBLF explained.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*AfDB plans youth entrepreneurship banks in Nigeria, 12 others\n\n*Gets the nod to develop Index Bond to address insecurity in Africa\n\nFestus Akanbi\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has urged Nigerian banks to support indigenous companies to increase foreign exchange inflows and boost economic growth.\n\n\n\nThis is coming as the African Development Bank (AfDB) has embarked on the designing of youth entrepreneurship investment banks in 13 African countries, including Nigeria, even as it disclosed that it had obtained approval from its Board of Governors to develop a Security Index Investment Bond to address insecurity in Africa.\n\n\n\nA CBN team on inspection of projects funded through Deposit Money Banks in Lagos advised the banks late on Friday.\n\n\n\nIt noted that the apex bank was counting on these companies to expand export earnings and achieve the goal of $200 billion in foreign exchange repatriation in three to four years.\n\n\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported that the CBN team visited the Pinnacle Oil and Gas FZE, Candel Company Ltd., Lagos Free Zone and Sana Building Systems, all in Ibeju-Lekki, Lagos State.\n\nThe Head, Legal Services Department of CBN, Mr Kofo Salam-Alada, during a visit to Candel Company Limited., called on banks to support Nigerian companies to grow production in the country.\n\n\n\n\u201cWith what the company is doing I believe that bankers should start coming for them; it\u2019s not just the Central Bank\u2019s Intervention Funds, Nigerian banks should seek them to see how they can partner with them to drive it forward.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe key thing that Nigerians must also know is that we need to support our own, not just in terms of employment generation; for the CBN that is interested in increasing foreign exchange in this country, it is something that needs to be supported,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nDirector, Banking Supervision Department, Haruna Mustapha, said what the company was doing was quite complementary to the apex bank\u2019s RT200, designed to boost the non-oil sector.\n\n\n\n\u201cCandel stands at two critical junctures; it is a manufacturing outfit. CBN recently introduced the RT200 designed to boost the non-oil sector and what Candel is doing here is quite complementary to that policy.\n\n\n\n\u201cAgain, it is providing the needed support to the agricultural sector, which will feed into the policy of the government to diversify the productive base of the Nigerian economy.\n\n\n\n\u201cUltimately we expect to see a solid impact, especially when you consider the various value chain this business touches.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, we need more support for companies like Candel and if we can have them in sufficient critical mass, the future looks great for Nigeria,\u201d Mustapha said.\n\n\n\nDirector of Development Finance, CBN, Yila Yusuf, noted that the bank, under its Commercial Agro Credit Scheme, disbursed N2 billion to Candel, adding that they were impressed with what the funds were used for.\n\n\n\n\u201cCandel is a company that we are aware of, we have given them N2 billion under our Commercial Agro Credit Scheme, fully paid through First Bank.\n\n\u201cWe came here to see, essentially the manufacturing line; they have new products and we are impressed with what we have seen.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Central Bank will continue to support and work with them, quite a number of jobs, both direct and indirect that we have seen on the floor line,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nCharles Anudu, Chairman, Candel Company Ltd., who noted that manufacturing companies suffered a lot of difficulties doing business in Nigeria, urged banks to be development-oriented as CBN.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe suffer a lot of disadvantages manufacturing in Nigeria; our cost profile is very prohibitive. You know in Nigeria you have to generate your own power and do everything, everything is expensive.\n\n\u201cYet, we are still competing against countries, exporting to Nigeria, whereas my competitors elsewhere are getting an export rebate.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen somebody exports from China, for instance, he already makes a profit because he gets the 15 per cent paid to him or her by his government, I get no such support.\n\n\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, here all sorts of regulators are on our neck; the exchange rate is a bottleneck because we still have to import a lot of the materials we use, and the interest rate is prohibitive,\u201d he said.\n\nThe team stressed the need for private sector involvement to grow and develop the economy.\n\nAfDB Plans Youth Entrepreneurship Banks in Nigeria, 12 Others\n\nMeanwhile, the AfDB has embarked on the designing of youth entrepreneurship investment banks in 13 African countries to create wealth in the continent.\n\n\n\nPresident of the AfDB Group, Dr Akinwumi Adesina, said this at a news conference to conclude the Bank\u2019s 2022 Annual Meetings in Accra, Ghana.\n\n\n\nAdesina said the move, to be finalised by June, would help youths get capital and create wealth for the younger generation for the development of the continent.\n\n\u201cWe are designing renewed financial institutions that will invest into the business of the youths and Ghana is one of the benefitting countries.\n\n\n\n\u201dWe have 13 countries and we expect to finish that design by the end of June.\n\n\u201dIt will create youth-based wealth for the continent,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nOn post-harvest losses, Adesina said the Bank had invested one billion dollars in special agro-industrial processing zones to curb food losses.\n\nHe listed some countries to benefit including Zambia, Nigeria, Ghana, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Mauritius, and Mozambique, among others.\n\n\n\n\u201cThese are the new investments the bank is making to be close to the areas that the farmers are producing enabled with water, infrastructure, and logistics so that the food and agriculture processing companies can be located close to the zones.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe processing companies in most countries are not located in the rural areas because there is no infrastructure in the rural areas\n\n\u201cWhat we are trying to do with the processing zones is to reduce the cost of doing business for the food and agriculture companies, so that they can offtake from the farmers and process them there.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe lose too much of our food and the consequence is that we start complaining about carbon emissions, producing and not having any impact and that affects the prices of food that eventually gets to the market.\n\n\n\n\u201cPost-harvest losses are what I can describe as pouring water into a bucket that has holes, you have to stop the leakage but in developed countries, post-harvest losses are as a result of too much food, you can\u2019t eat it, you throw it away but in Africa, it is not like that,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported that Egypt will host the next Annual Meetings of the Bank.\n\nMr Tarel Amer, the Governor, of the Central Bank of the Arab Republic of Egypt, was appointed the new Chairperson of the AfDB Board of Governors.\n\n\n\nThe bank also disclosed it has obtained approval from its Board of Governors to develop a Security Index Investment Bond to address insecurity in Africa.\n\n\n\nAdesina disclosed this at a news conference to wrap up the 2022 Annual Meetings of the Bank in Accra.\n\nAdesina said security was an issue in the continent, noting that development thrived in a secured continent.\n\nHe said that the meetings discussed the support for the private sector which he said the Bank was actively involved in with the private sector equity investments.\n\n\n\n\u201cDevelopment can only happen when we have security.\n\n\u201cSecurity is now part of our thinking in the AfDB because we will support the countries to address security.\n\n\u201cThere must be a link between security, investment, growth, and development,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the Bank\u2019s meetings also focused on the debt management for Africa.\n\n\u201cWe must have sustainable, transparent debt in Africa by ensuring that the private and commercial debt of Africa is fair.\n\n\n\n\u201cAfDB should do more on agriculture.\n\n\u201cIn the meetings, we talked of the African Development Fund (ADF).\n\n\u201cAs you know, the ADF is 50, nine out of 10 most vulnerable countries of climate change are in Africa, 100 per cent of them are ADF countries,\u201d he added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

If the organisers give my award to someone else, they will die.\u201d\n\nThe artiste was nominated in two categories at the 15th edition of The Headies which is billed to hold later this year in the United States of America.\n\nIn the petition, the organisers of the award demanded a retraction from the up-and-coming artiste. Moreso, he is to be invited to the police headquarters to give an undertaking not to engage in any unlawful act that will cause a breach of peace.\n\nFurthermore, it was demanded by the organisers of The Headies that Portable should publish a written apology to all the nominees in the two categories.\n\nThe organisers of the award further stated that if the singer does not meet their demands, they will not only disqualify him from participating in the Headies but \u201calso enforce the instrumentalities of the law to the fullest.\u201d",

Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

It\u2019s also the ideal time to bill that tech bro or sis.\n\nThis type of weekend only occurs once a month. If you miss it this month, you\u2019ll have to wait until the next. I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t want to wait. Just kidding. No, I\u2019m not .\n\nBy the way, today is Children\u2019s Day in Nigeria. It\u2019s an excellent opportunity to fulfil that promise to take them out or buy that ice cream. \ud83d\ude09 I mean, make a child happy today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis weekend, I\u2019m also following my advice and billing you. Just kidding. I still don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do this weekend, but I know it will be fun.\n\nEnjoy your weekend however you can. You know I\u2019m always concerned with your overall health and wellbeing. Take care of yourself during this short break!!!\n\nSo today, I\u2019m going to talk about two stories:\n\nJumia\u2019s partnership with CGAP\n\nProducts for people with disabilities\n\nJumia\u2019s partnership with CGAP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt goes without saying that Jumia is one of the dominant players in the African eCommerce market. In Nigeria, the company made $33 million in revenue in the first quarter of 2021, with a $14.6 million increase in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nAlso, the Central Bank of Nigeria recently granted it a Payment Service Solution Provider (PSSP) licence.\n\nThe licence will enable it to process payments for Nigerian third-party businesses. This development pits it directly against Paystack, Flutterwave, eTranzact, and Remita.\n\nIt also provides an additional revenue stream when the company desperately needs to increase revenue.\n\nInterestingly, the company is testing a healthtech play through a partnership with the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis collaboration will provide users with access to doctors for a $1 monthly subscription fee.\n\nWell, Chimgozirim thinks it\u2019s a fantastic move that will allow Jumia to leverage its existing customer base and infrastructure.\n\nI do not think we have enough doctors in this country, though. I mean, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends one doctor for every 600 people in a country.\n\nHowever, in a country with one doctor for every 5,000 people, the WHO\u2019s recommendation appears a long way off.\n\nFurther, the Nigerian Medical Association reports that only 35,000 of the 72,000 registered doctors are practising in Nigeria.\n\nIn his article, Chimgozirim discusses what the collaboration could mean for healthtech startups. You can find it here: Dear healthtech startups, Jumia is coming for your bread!\n\nKenya\u2019s digital products for people with disabilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to a report, approximately 40% of Africa\u2019s population is disabled, including 10-15% of school-age children. This implies that there are over 300 million people with disabilities in Africa.\n\nEven though people with disabilities are often referred to as the world\u2019s largest minority, in Africa, they face exclusion, discrimination, and barriers to exercising their fundamental rights and participating in development.\n\nHowever, Kenya, an African country, is changing the narrative.\n\nHow? Kenya has developed a standard for digital accessibility for people with disabilities.\n\nThis means that people with disabilities, and older people who are largely disconnected from most e-government services and business-owned digital platforms, will be connected, supported, and empowered by digital products to increase their digital inclusion.\n\nHow? It will be accomplished by providing computer assistive technology to the blind and visually impaired. Also, public and private sector digital products and services (like websites and mobile applications) will be more accessible and usable by all Kenyan citizens.\n\nThis follows the announcement by the Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS) of a partnership with inABLE to develop a national information and communication technology (ICT) accessibility standard.\n\nThis is similar to EnableMe Kenya, an online platform, aimed at providing community-oriented technological support and increasing digital inclusion for people with disabilities.\n\nAccording to Bernard Njiraini, KEBS Managing Director, \u201cTo accommodate all people in the society, inclusive design and universal design principles should be integrated into digital products and services.\u201d\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nThe African Leadership Group and Udacity are offering 5,000 scholarships to African citizens who want to advance their careers in tech. by learning new digital skills. Scholarship recipients will enrol in one of the following Udacity Nanodegree programmes: Data Analyst, Full-Stack Web Developer, or Cloud Developer. Apply here.\n\nGrant Master has announced the start of its second Creative Writers Fellowship cohort. The Fellowship for Creative Writers will take place virtually from July 4th to August 26th, 2022. Apply here.\n\nMOBI Automation, a startup that uses Web3 technologies to solve business problems, is looking for a Chief Technology Officer, UI & UX Designer, Senior Frontend Developer, and Creative Designer. Send your resume here.\n\nDo you breathe crypto or are you simply crypto-curious? Apply for the Coinbase Community Ambassador Program (CAP) \u2014 Summer 2022 here.\n\nHave an amazing weekend!\n\nVictoria Fakiya for Techpoint Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictoria Fakiya A writer with ADHD who is interested in mental health and how technology is improving the lives of Africans with mental disorders.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, May 17, 2022, Nigerian eCommerce giant, Jumia released its financial report for the first quarter of 2022.\n\nCo-CEOs Jeremy Hodara and Sacha Poignonnec shared that orders, revenue, and gross merchandise value (GMV) saw significant growth compared to the last nine quarters. Comparing Q1 2021 with Q1 2022, orders grew from 6.6 million to 9.3 million, GMV grew from $198.9 million to $252.7 million, while revenue went from $33 million to $47.6 million.\n\nEven with this growth, it\u2019s not all rosy for the company as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) loss was $53 million. On a call with TechCrunch, Poignonnec shared that the company plans to keep EBITDA loss below the $70 million it recorded in Q1 2021.\n\nNow to some good and potentially exciting developments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJumiaPay, its fintech product, has secured a payment service solution provider (PSSP) licence, which will allow it to process payments for third-party businesses in Nigeria. This development puts it in direct competition with Paystack, Flutterwave, eTranzact, and Remita. It also provides another revenue stream when it desperately needs to increase revenues.\n\nPSSPs usually make their money by charging a transaction fee for every transaction they facilitate, and these fees often vary depending on the transaction\u2019s value. Per the report, 34% of orders placed on Jumia were completed using JumiaPay, and with its licence, JumiaPay\u2019s numbers could significantly increase in the coming quarters.\n\nHealthcare at the drop of a hat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: AMISOM via Iwaria\n\nPerhaps the most interesting thing about the developments shared in the report is Jumia\u2019s decision to venture into the healthcare space. Via a partnership with Consultative Group to Assist the Poor, the company is testing a service that will allow users to access doctors with a monthly subscription of $1.\n\nViewed in isolation, this is a great move that could see Jumia tap into its existing customer base and infrastructure. It also represents a more formidable competitor for existing healthcare startups.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) recommends 1 doctor per 600 people in a country, but Nigeria has 1 doctor for 5,000 people. Furthermore, the Nigerian Medical Association reports that only 35,000 of the 72,000 registered doctors are practising in Nigeria, while the healthtech industry in Africa is projected to be worth $259 billion by 2030.\n\nAlthough little detail was provided about the move, its foray into an area that is notoriously difficult in Africa and is not remotely related to its core business warrants some questions.\n\nExisting telehealth startups in the country include CribMD, iWello, and WellaHealth. As private companies, their records are often not in the public domain, but in a 2021 interview with Techpoint Africa, iWello reported that it had 140 clients, with CribMD reportedly serving 2,800 patients as of 2021. WellaHealth\u2019s CEO also shared that the company hit 10,000 unique users in 2017, with thousands on its waitlist.\n\nThese companies are significantly less funded than Jumia, with Africa\u2019s healthcare sector raising $392 million in 2021. However, these companies have to combat low Internet penetration, dwindling household incomes, and cultural norms to get paying customers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdditionally, Jumia has no expertise operating in the healthcare sector and would likely have to go through a learning curve for this venture to succeed. Even with the option of hiring experienced professionals, things will probably not go their way immediately.\n\nThe fragmented nature of the healthcare space is another challenge that existing players face. For example, there are only a handful of hospitals with digitised records and even fewer still that share this information. This makes it imperative that healthtech startups build solutions for this purpose.\n\nBuilding partnerships for effective healthcare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile these could pose challenges to Jumia\u2019s healthtech plans, Yomi Kazeem, Senior Consultant, Salient Advisory, believes that Jumia has what it takes to succeed, especially if it goes the partnership route.\n\nIn a chat with Techpoint Africa, he said, \u201cJumia can potentially build out its healthtech play through more partnerships to facilitate diagnostics. It can also partner with pharmacies, leverage its logistics network, and pair medication delivery with its telemedicine service, so patients are not only speaking to doctors remotely but also receiving needed medication seamlessly.\n\n\u201cThis approach is important because, ultimately, providing access to consultations is only one part of healthcare. With more of these companies emerging, user acquisition becomes more competitive. In essence, third-party partnerships that facilitate access to patients on a larger scale are vital.\u201d\n\nUnlike existing healthtech players, Jumia has an established logistics service that could help it deliver medications faster than startups that have to depend on third-party providers. While this means Jumia could potentially cut into their market, it also presents an opportunity to expand healthtech services in the country while unlocking one more revenue stream for Jumia.\n\nHealthtech startups, for example, can provide faster and more efficient services by partnering with Jumia. Such partnerships could also expose them to Jumia\u2019s considerably larger customer base.\n\nAn example of such a partnership is Airtel Kenya\u2019s partnership with MyDawa, an online pharmacy in Kenya that allows Airtel\u2019s customers log into the MyDawa website without incurring data costs while MyDawa provides an option to pay for products with Airtel Money.\n\nDespite being boosted by the COVID-19 pandemic, healthtech startups are still a long way from meeting Africa\u2019s healthcare needs. However, partnerships such as this could be key going forward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

Ask around and tell me what other people are saying.\n\nToday\u2019s episode is a lot of fun to listen to!

Why? The CAR adopted bitcoin as a reference currency.\n\nAlso, a Nigerian, Chidi Nwaubani, launched the \u201cLooty\u201d project to reclaim African artefacts stolen by European colonists.\n\nThe project will create 3D images of these artefacts, sell them as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and use the proceeds to support young African artists.\n\nPlease listen to the podcast to hear these gists in particular. Bolu spoke last, so you\u2019ll have to listen till the end.\n\nYou can find today\u2019s episode here.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nHow Traction wants to stop fake alerts\n\nCanza Finance\u2019s journey\n\nEsaal\u2019s $1.7m seed\n\nJABU\u2019s $15m series A\n\nTraction wants to stop fake alerts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraction Founders: Dolapo Adejuyigbe and Mayowa Alli (L-R)\n\nOn Monday, I had to use a PoS kiosk because I had problems with one of my banks. Currently, I have two active accounts, but only one has an ATM card.\n\nThat was intentional. I had no idea the other ATM card would come in handy. I have, however, learnt my lesson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, at the kiosk where I was supposed to transfer money to get cash, I asked if they accept mobile transfers, and the attendant took a long look at me before responding reluctantly in the affirmative.\n\nWith her response, I knew they don\u2019t accept mobile transfers. But, because I am someone she knows, she reluctantly agreed.\n\nOf course, the attendant isn\u2019t the only one who has reservations about accepting mobile transfers. In fact, there are small business owners in my neighbourhood who refuse to accept mobile transfers.\n\nSo, before I went there, I mumbled some incantations because I had no money. \ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\ude39 I\u2019m kidding. But that money was urgently needed, though.\n\nAlthough the transfer was successful, she did not give me my money until she saw and confirmed the alert. I was slightly vexed, but I understood why.\n\nReceiving fake alerts isn\u2019t new for merchants in my neighbourhood, so they\u2019d rather you give them cash for every item you buy over making a mobile transfer.\n\nI waited about 15 minutes before she gave me my money. Fear of fake alerts cost me 15 minutes of my time! \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude22 I\u2019m not crying, but I believe this is a problem.\n\nI\u2019m sure you know someone or have heard of someone who has been a victim of receiving fake alerts. Consider a merchant receiving fake alerts for every item they sell or service they render. That\u2019s cruel, in my opinion.\n\nHowever, there appears to be a solution. What is it? Traction! The Nigeria-based fintech startup believes its proprietary solution can solve this problem.\n\nHow? It has a unique feature that allows merchants to confirm that every alert is real. Isn\u2019t this interesting?\n\nBusiness owners can use the app to accept payments, generate invoices, manage inventory, and track payments. It also enables merchant employees to confirm payments without calling their boss. Aren\u2019t you curious now?\n\nIf you are, please read Ogheneruemu\u2019s story to learn more about the startup: Traction is building an ecosystem for Nigerian small businesses, starting with stopping fake credit alerts\n\nCanza Finance\u2019s journey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL-R, Pascal Ntsama, Canza Finance CEO and Co-Founder and Oyedeji Oluwole, Canza Finance CTO and Co-Founder.\n\nWith the volatility of cryptocurrency, I won\u2019t even look at you twice if you ask me to buy, not to think of launching a crypto business with you.\n\nIt\u2019s simply too risky, if you ask me. It\u2019s high today, low tomorrow; please don\u2019t give me a heart attack. \ud83d\ude0f\n\nThis reminds me of something that happened last Monday. Please accept my apologies if you are a crypto trader or investor. But, I couldn\u2019t stop laughing when the guy next to me on the bus was glued to his screen, checking his crypto app. \ud83d\ude39\ud83d\ude02\n\nSincerely, this guy didn\u2019t even close the app for a second. He was just staring. His expression was sad. That could be due to the drop in cryptocurrency that week.\n\nToday\u2019s story, on the other hand, features two Co-founders, Pascal Ntsama and Oyedeji Oluwoye, who began working together after Oluwoye advised Ntsama to buy cryptocurrency. That was bold, if you ask me.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t convinced initially, but after seeing Oluwoye\u2019s success with cryptocurrency two years later, he agreed.\n\nThat\u2019s when the pair realised there was more to cryptocurrency than just trading. They established Coincentrix in 2017 and received a grant from the Zcash Foundation in 2018.\n\nThen, in 2019, they launched Canza Finance, a crypto neobank that connects African businesses to the global economy.\n\nIn other words, the startup makes cryptocurrency transactions easier. It also allows for payments and peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions within the country. Besides, it intends to include treasury management in its suite of services.\n\nChimgozirin described the startup\u2019s journey in detail here: Canza Finance is a neobank enabling decentralised cross-border payments for Africans\n\nEsaal\u2019s $1.7 million seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to mental health, there is a common misconception that only people suffering from mental disorders see therapists. This is because some of us mistake mental health for a mental illness, which it is not.\n\nMental health is more than just the absence of a mental disorder. It includes how you think, feel, and act.\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re having trouble thinking clearly, stressed, or feeling depressed, it can affect your productivity at school, work, or at home, indicating poor mental health.\n\nConsequently, it would help if you spoke with a trusted person who can keep your information confidential while also providing a safe space to express your emotions and possibly offer advice. You can also talk with someone who is trained in counselling or psychiatry.\n\nMoreover, due to the stigma surrounding mental health, most people are afraid of physically going to a centre to see a therapist or psychiatrist\n\nIn Egypt, Fadi Doss, Founder and CEO of Esaal, launched a platform that connects users to experts, allowing them to receive personalised and genuine answers to health concerns straightforwardly and smoothly.\n\nAnd yesterday, Esaal \u2014 an online health and wellness consultation platform \u2014 announced a $1.7 million seed round, led by Egypt-based A15.\n\nEsaal claims that it has over 350 consultants. Also, the company offers consultations on a wide range of topics, like anxiety, physiotherapy, paediatrics, and nutrition.\n\nUsers use an app to access these services via texting, video/voice calls, and in-person visits. They can pay with cash, credit cards, Vodafone, and Fawry.\n\nPer the CEO, the services are available in seven other countries across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries: Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Palestine, and Iraq.\n\nThe funding will be used to expand across MENA, invest in product and brand development, and hire more people. Between 2021 and 2025, Esaal anticipates a revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 50-60%.\n\nJABU\u2019s $15m series A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNamibian B2B eCommerce retail platform, JABU, announced a $15 million Series A round yesterday, Wednesday,May 25, 2022.\n\nThe round was led by Tiger Global and saw participation from Box Group, Knollwood, D Global Ventures, Afore Capital, Oldslip and FJ Labs.\n\nFounded in 2020 by David Akinin (CEO), JABU claims to be the solution to Namibia\u2019s inefficient and nearly non-existent supply chain and distribution.\n\nThe company has a fleet of vehicles and eight distribution centres, with a platform connecting over 6,000 retailers to local and multinational suppliers like Namibia Breweries Limited, ABInBev, Bokomo, Coca-Cola, and Namibmills.\n\nWhat\u2019s new? Akinin stated that JABU intends to build around its Jwallet, a wallet system that is currently available as a standalone product. It enables Southern African merchants to use their physical flows to provide cash withdrawal and deposit services to their customers.\n\nIs this similar? Yes. It\u2019s identical to agency banking, a branchless banking system in Nigeria and West Africa where human agents serve as ATMs to provide financial services in outlying areas. And in Morocco, Chari provides a similar service.\n\nJABU will use the Series A funding to expand its presence in Southern Africa and enter new markets like Botswana and Eswatini later this year.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nThe African Leadership Group and Udacity are offering 5,000 scholarships to African citizens who want to advance their careers in tech. by learning new digital skills. Scholarship recipients will enrol in one of the following Udacity Nanodegree programmes: Data Analyst, Full-Stack Web Developer, or Cloud Developer. Apply here.\n\nGrant Master has announced the start of its second Creative Writers Fellowship cohort. The Fellowship for Creative Writers will take place virtually from July 4th to August 26th, 2022. Apply here.\n\nMOBI Automation, a startup that uses Web3 technologies to solve business problems, is looking for a Chief Technology Officer, UI & UX Designer, Senior Frontend Developer, and Creative Designer.

Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team doesn\u2019t write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email business@techpoint.africa\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nby Abdullahi Fawale\n\nShort answer? Apply to AltSchool Africa.\n\nIt\u2019s the perfect avenue. Within 12 months, you would have learnt a highly sought-after tech skill and obtained a top-rated diploma. The knowledge and experience gathered during the program adequately prepare you for your first tech job.\n\nReady to begin that journey? Get started HERE.\n\nYou\u2019re reading this for one of two reasons:\n\n1. You\u2019ve made the decision to switch careers and you have your eyes set on the tech space. You\u2019re now on the lookout for key pointers on how to start.\n\n2. You\u2019re yet to decide on transitioning though you\u2019ve been giving it a lot of thought. You however seek more information in the hope that you get all the clarity and green light you need.\n\nA third possibility could be that you know someone who is at that phase of their life\u2014yearning for a career change and real opportunities for growth. This piece answers some of your questions about pursuing a career in tech and how to transition.\n\nBefore we dive in, what is your \u201cWhy\u201d?\n\nThe tech space undoubtedly holds a myriad of opportunities for skilled talent worldwide. Global ecosystems continue to witness exponential growth. In Africa, solution-driven startups keep springing up & raising rounds to help drive growth and expansion.\n\nTech news platforms are often inundated with announcements of funds raised by startups which sometimes run into several millions of dollars. More jobs are getting created. Top tech talents are being enticed with juicy compensation packages and then poached. Junior employees are now taking up more responsibility and securing promotions. It\u2019s Career Christmas!\n\nHowever, it\u2019s quite easy to get distracted by this zeitgeist. Away from the exciting announcements and fascinating Twitter conversations, the growth and successes of these tech ecosystems are powered by the blood and sweat of deeply passionate and hardworking people who put in their absolute best to make things work.\n\nIn other words, working in tech is not a walk in the park. Your \u201cwhy\u201d mustn\u2019t be influenced by the current ecosystem zeitgeist, but by a genuine readiness to learn, contribute and grow.\n\nYou also must define what you want to do going forward. Are you looking for core tech/code roles (e.g Software Engineering) or no-code roles like Product Design, Product Management, Product Marketing, Technical Writing, Customer Success, Recruitment etc,?\n\nHave you looked into what it takes to be successful in this new path and are you ready to give what it takes?\n\nAnswer these questions as truthfully as you can. Don\u2019t worry if you fear your answers aren\u2019t convincing enough at the moment. You can always look up more information on these roles to guide your final decision.\n\nWith that said, here are 5 Proven Tips to Help You Transition Into Tech:\n\n1. What transferable skills do you have?\n\nA sizeable number of people that transition to tech do so by leveraging their previously acquired skills\u2014though these skills are mostly no-code or non-technical. For instance, a Customer Service Representative at a local bank could easily transition to a similar role at a FinTech startup. A journalist or creative writer could try out technical writing and pick up really fast. Human Resource Managers/Recruiters in conventional companies would easily settle in as technical recruiters after a few months of training. The list goes on.\n\nWhat you should do is identify the skills you already possess and see what roles those could get you in tech. If you have your eyes set on an entirely different role (one that doesn\u2019t align with your current skills), check out the skills required for that role and how to go about acquiring them. Then go for it.\n\n2. Search for opportunities in industries where you have prior experience\n\nThis is in many ways similar to what we discussed above\u2014about seeking opportunities in tech where your previously acquired skills are a match. Say you\u2019re a Risk & Compliance Officer at a local bank; you can work the same job at a FinTech startup. A seasoned chartered accountant can head the Accounts & Finance unit at a tech startup. Medical doctors could, for instance, work as consultants at HealthTech startups offering home services. Product Managers can easily function across numerous industries. Conventional journalists and content creators could niche down and focus on reporting/producing content on tech and so on.\n\n3. Take courses & write a certification exam\n\nOne of the sure-fire ways to transition to tech is to learn the skill(s) required to function in specific areas of interest. A great way to achieve this is by taking online courses, registering for and joining boot camps and writing certification exams. Thanks to the internet, there now seems to be unlimited access to information allowing us to learn on our own.\n\nThe democratization of the internet has also brought about a rise in the number of digital platforms that help people acquire knowledge and learn new skills. Within a few months, you can go from being a complete outsider to becoming an entry-level professional, anywhere in the world.\n\nThis is where AltSchool Africa comes in. At AltSchool Africa, you can learn some of the world\u2019s most sought after tech skills and earn a top-rated diploma within 12 months. The school runs a number of coding and no-code learning programs that are stand-alone specialisations under its School of Engineering and School of Product respectively.\n\nFor instance, when you apply to the School of Engineering, you will have to select a specific area of specialisation among the following:\n\nFrontend Engineering Backend Engineering & Cloud Engineering\n\nHowever, for the no-code School of Product, you can choose to learn either Product Design, Product Management or Product Marketing.\n\nIs it possible to land a job in tech by just taking courses without certification? Yes. However, earning a certification badge from an institute of repute certainly opens more doors and gets you in much bigger rooms.\n\n4. Be on the lookout for Internships\n\nMany careers that began as internships have blossomed into highly successful vocations. Some of the most revered, most admired professionals today, started out as interns and managed to build their careers into the success we currently know them to be.\n\nInternships offer great learning opportunities and direct pathways to getting your first job in tech. Not only do you get the opportunity to learn directly from much more experienced professionals\u2013you could also be on your way to getting your first offer of employment. This, of course, is dependent on how well you perform during the period.\n\n5. Network. Network. Network\n\nThe opportunities you seek aren\u2019t coming to pay you a visit in the comfort of your home. You have to get out there and grab them. Your social capital will, to a large extent, influence your career trajectory.\n\nWho do you know? Who do they know? What do they know? What do they do?\n\nUnderstanding the power of networking and actively making time to build connections will help you grow personally and professionally. So, here\u2019s what you\u2019ll do:\n\nIf your LinkedIn has been inactive, it\u2019s time to power it up: That is a good place to start. Find people doing great work in your preferred field and connect with them. Genuinely engage them in conversations and keep an open mind during these discussions.\n\nYou could also look up startup founders and hiring managers in companies you have an interest in: Try to connect with them and send a properly worded message. Briefly introduce yourself and why you\u2019re reaching out. Remember to be courteous.\n\nAttend tech events: These events are the perfect place to network as attendance is primarily physical. You can walk up to stakeholders, politely introduce yourself and tell your story. If you\u2019ve completed all the necessary training and are now in search of a job, that would be a perfect place to pitch to startup founders and execs too.\n\nYou should also consider volunteering: A good number of startups are in the business of building communities and organizing events. Due to the workload which sometimes could get overwhelming, these startups seek to onboard volunteers to help out on a project temporarily. In some cases, volunteers are paid a stipend for the work they do. In reverse scenarios, they aren\u2019t. However, monetary benefits shouldn\u2019t be your primary concern here. Your focus must be on learning as much as you can, gaining insights into the workings of the space, identifying key players and expanding your social circle.\n\nVolunteering, when done right, puts your name on the lips of persons that have the capacity to get you your next job.\n\nJoin Tech Communities: As the ecosystem grows, stakeholders are beginning to appreciate the power of community; the need to bring key players and intelligent outsiders together to look inwards and map out strategies for continued growth.\n\nOne of the strategies designed to ensure said growth is the creation of smaller groups or communities dedicated to knowledge sharing, resource sharing, mentorship and access to opportunities. The primary targets of these communities are entry-level & intermediate professionals who are then guided by more experienced tech talent. Members of these communities often have a shared sense of responsibility to help each other grow.\n\nThere are communities for everyone. So, whether you\u2019re a Software Engineer, Data Analyst, Product Manager or Technical Writer, there is a place for you.\n\nOn a final note:\n\nIt is very much possible to transition into tech within one year. As a matter of fact, some have managed to make the switch in just a few months. Bear in mind that if you must transition and do it fast, you will have to simultaneously employ more than one of the methods mentioned above. For example, you could have direct, transferable skills but you may have to network and volunteer to access even bigger and better opportunities.\n\nThese methods also aren\u2019t set in stone. You could come up with other creative, honest ways to move several steps further and get to work.\n\nIn the meantime, let\u2019s circle back to where we began:\n\nA quick guide on How to Transition into Tech in 1 Year?\n\nApply to AltSchool Africa\n\nApplications to the School of Product are currently open.\n\nReady to begin that journey?

          "text": "Bola Tinubu, former governor of Lagos State and presidential aspirant of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has said he looks forward to squaring up with Atiku Abubakar, as a \u201cworthy opponent\u201d in the 2023 elections.\n\nTinubu said this while congratulating Abubakar on his emergence as the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nIn a statement by Bayo Onanuga, director, media and communication of Tinubu Campaign Organisation, Tinubu commended Abubakar for his patriotism and commitment to Nigeria\u2019s progress, but warned that Nigerians would ask him pertinent questions during the campaigns.\n\nHe said Abubakar must be prepared to tell Nigerians how he planned to reverse his party\u2019s ruination of Nigeria\u2019s prospects during its 16 years governance between 1999 and 2015.\n\n\u201cI welcome the victory of Alhaji Atiku Abubakar as the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the just concluded primary. I look forward to squaring up with him as a worthy opponent in the coming election. I have known the former Vice President as a formidable politician and a patriot who believes in the unity and progress of our dear country,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the PDP and its candidate would be burdened to explain why Nigerians should give it another opportunity, after being in government at the centre for 16 years without much to show.\n\nAccording to Tinubu, Nigerians are yet to forget the national ruin and mismanagement of the country for 16 years by successive PDP administrations.\n\nThe two-term Lagos State governor stressed that this bad memory would dog the campaign of the PDP candidate.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, I once again congratulate our former vice-president for his victory at his party\u2019s primary election,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nHe added that Abubakar\u2019s victory did not come as a surprise to Nigerians because of his vast experience as a statesman and veteran of many presidential contests since 1993.\n\nHe welcomed the PDP candidate to the race, saying the 2023 election campaigns should be about issues that would improve the quality of life of Nigerians.\n\nHe added that the election should also bring peace, progress, political stability and solve the myriad of socio-political challenges and insecurity currently facing the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cI welcome the victory of Alhaji Atiku Abubakar as the candidate of the PDP at the just-concluded primary election. I look forward to squaring up with him as a worthy opponent at the coming election.\n\n\u201cI have known the former vice-president as a formidable politician and a patriot who believes in the unity and progress of our dear country. As we move further into the election season, I charge the PDP presidential candidate and all political actors across party lines that we should make this election season one that is devoid of bitterness, rancour and strife.\n\n\u201cWe should make our campaigns peaceful and issues-based; election season should be a festival of ideas that will uplift our country and improve the living condition of all our people.\u201d\n\nHe also congratulated the other PDP contestants for the orderly and peaceful way they conducted themselves and their resolve and pledge to rally round the Abubakar in the true spirit of democratic sportsmanship.\n\nAbubakar polled 371 votes to emerge as PDP\u2019s presidential candidate at the party\u2019s primary election.\n\nHe defeated Nyesom Wike, governor of Rivers State, who polled 237 votes; Emmanuel, governor of Akwa Ibom, who polled 38 votes and Bala Mohammed, governor of Bauchi State, who polled 20 votes.\n\nRead also: Tinubu is going to emerge as President Buhari\u2019s successor in 2023 \u2013 Arisekola\n\nTwo former senate presidents, Bukola Saraki and Anyim Pius Anyim, polled 70 votes and 14 votes, respectively.\n\nAnyim has urged the party to seek ways to address burning national issues, irrespective of the outcome of the contest.\n\nIn a statement on Sunday after conceding defeat, he commended the PDP 2022 Special Convention Committee for doing a great job and congratulated Abubakar for clinching the party\u2019s ticket ahead of the 2023 presidential elections.\n\nAnyim said he is proud to have gone through the race to the end, but regretted however, that delegates voted based on the same old primordial sentiments, while avoiding how to use the exercise to resolve burning national issues.\n\nPrior to the election, he had been a proponent of zoning of the Presidency to the South East, as a way of addressing marginalisation and social injustice in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI am shocked that consideration for voting the PDP presidential candidate was not based on burning national issues and how to resolve them, but still on the old primordial sentiments.\n\nIt appears doubtful if our search for nationhood is yielding any results.\u201d\n\nHe expressed his appreciation to all those who stood by him throughout this race, \u201cespecially those that voted for me at the primary election.\n\n\u201cI want to assure all of you that we shall continue to stand tall until we birth the Nigeria of our collective dreams,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "Atiku Abubakar, a former vice-president, has emerged the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate for the 2023 general election, amid horse trading and strong determination to wrest power from the incumbent All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nThe desperation by the party to win informed its decision to take some drastic measures, chief of which is the zoning arrangement that is also enshrined in its constitution.\n\nAtiku was declared victorious after a keenly contested primary held at MKO Abiola Stadium in Abuja, Saturday.\n\nAbout 767 delegates elected from across the country voted in the presidential primary.\n\nThe chairman of the Convention Organising Committee, David Mark, announced the result of the election Saturday night/early morning Sunday, which saw Atiku, defeating 12 other aspirants to pick the party\u2019s ticket.\n\nIn the result, Atiku scored 371 votes to defeat his closest rival, Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, who polled 237 votes.\n\nFormer Senate president, Bukola Saraki scored 70 votes; governor of Akwa Ibom State, Udom Emmanuel scored 38 votes; Anyim Pius Anyim, former Senate president, scored 14 votes; Bala Mohammed \u2013 20; Sam Ohabunwa \u2013 1 and Olivia Tariela \u2013 1. There were 12 void votes.\n\nInitially, 17 aspirants purchased the party\u2019s nomination form at N40 million each but two aspirants, Cosmas Ndukwe, a former lawmaker, and Nwachukwu Anakwenze, a United State-based medical doctor were disqualified by the screening committee.\n\nPeter Obi, a former governor of Anambra State, had resigned his membership of the PDP just few days to the presidential primary, citing hanky-panky dealing.\n\nAlso, a few hours to the primary, investment banker, Mohammed Hayatu-Deen announced his withdrawal from the presidential race.\n\nAbout 24 hours to the primary two aspirants, Charles Ugwu and Chikwendu Kalu announced their decision to step down from the race and support Governor Wike.\n\nFew minutes before the commencement of voting, Aminu Tambuwal, governor of Sokoto State, announced his decision to step down from the race and give his support to Atiku.\n\nThere were intrigues hours to the convention after a meeting among key leaders of PDP from the North failed to broker a consensus deal among aspirants from the North as several of them declined to shift ground; preferring to participate in the primary.\n\nThere was also a long hours of closed door meeting Saturday at the Transcorp Hilton Abuja by top members of the party, which created apprehension that the party may shift its convention in continuation of the mind game with the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nThe last few months leading to the presidential convention had been trailed by debates on whose region the PDP presidential ticket should be zoned to.\n\nThere was intense pressure from the South-East for the presidential ticket of the PDP to be zoned to the region since it was the only zone among the three leading ethnic groups in Nigeria which had not produced a president since the return to democracy in 1999.\n\nInitially, the party was undecided on the issue, but later decided to throw the race open and gave every aspirant an opportunity to test their popularity in the presidential primary.\n\nWith the victory, Atiku is set to face whoever will emerge as the APC candidate from the 25 aspirants jostling to be president of Nigeria from May 29, 2023.\n\nBids for six times\n\nIn a recent interview, optimistic Atiku had said, \u201cI\u2019m the best of them all,\u201d alluding to his astuteness in the game of politics.\n\nHe had recently pointedly told the leadership of the party that what the party really needed was an individual that could deliver victory to the PDP and not about zoning.\n\nAtiku has since he joined politics in 1993, contested for the office of the president five times, without success.\n\nHe tried it in 1993, 2007, 2011, 2015 and 2019. This is the sixth time he would be taking a shot at the presidency. Would he score the bull\u2019s eye this time around?\n\nWhy Atiku\u2019s victory was expected\n\nMeanwhile, Atiku\u2019s victory was eagerly expected in some quarters, as he was seen as perhaps, the only aspirant, with the most formidable structure with national spread, mileage and popularity across the country capable of winning the presidential election next year. He was also seen in many quarters as capable of mustering the war chest that can give the ruling party a serious fight. These, pundits say, may have informed the party\u2019s leadership decision to jettison the zoning arrangement that is enshrined in its constitution.\n\nAtiku was also the party\u2019s presidential candidate for the 2019 general election.\n\nRead also: The ruling party has ruined all our achievements \u2013 Atiku\n\nWike pledges to cooperate\n\nGovernor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State, earlier before the voting, vowed to support whoever may emerge as the PDP presidential candidate.\n\nHe said, \u201cI want to speak on two subjects. One is the party. Let me vow, today, anybody who emerges here, I\u2019ll support the person to the fullest. I\u2019ll support the person to the fullest because I\u2019m a committed party person. Because I love this party. Because since 1998 I\u2019ve been in this party. I work for this party. I\u2019m not going anywhere. This is my party.\u201d\n\nWith PDP Nigeria shall be great again \u2013 Ayu\n\nIn his remarks at the convention, the PDP National Chairman, Senator Iyorchia Ayu called on Nigerians to vote for the main opposition party in the 2023 general election, saying that the country will rise again under its administration.\n\nAyu made the call on Saturday during the 2022 Special National Convention which was held at the MKO Abiola International Stadium in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nHe berated the All Progressives Congress (APC) led Federal Government for its handling of the nation\u2019s economy, lamenting that Africa\u2019s most populous country is now the headquarters of poverty in the world.\n\nAccording to the PDP National Chairman, Nigerians are yearning for the return of the opposition party at the federal level.\n\nThis, to Ayu, is because the indices under the current administration from terrorism to job creation, debt as well as security challenges has shown that things have worsened.\n\n\u201cIn December when we took over, I urged you all to keep hopes alive that with PDP, Nigeria shall rise again. Today, as I welcome all you delegates, observers and stakeholders to our national convention, I repeat the same words to you. Don\u2019t lose hope, don\u2019t give up on Nigeria. PDP is coming to the rescue,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe have done fairly well in the byelections that have held across the country. If we competed on level-playing grounds, if INEC were resisted to external pressures and if security agents did not militarise some of the election\u2019s environment, your great party \u2013 the PDP \u2013 would have done much better.\n\n\u201cThe by-elections serve as a very important point, they are a referendum on APC\u2019s misrule. The outcomes of the elections show that Nigerians want us back in power. The reasons are obvious.\n\n\u201cNigeria is now both the poverty capital of the world, also Nigeria is the third most terrorized country. The economy has collapsed, the government now prints or borrows money to pay salaries, unemployment is about 35 per cent, the government now shares sovereignty with terrorists.\u201d\n\n767 delegates to decide ex-VP, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, Governor Nyesom Wike, ex-Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki and others\u2019 2023 presidential fate.\n\nThe breakdown is as follows:\n\nBayelsa: 8; Cross River:15; Delta:25; Rivers:23; Edo:18; Abia:17; Anambra:21;\n\nEbony:13;Enugu:17; Imo:21; Oyo:33; Osun:20; Lagos:20; Ekiti:16; Akwa Ibom:13; Ondo:18; Ogun:20; Adamawa:21; Bauchi:20; Borno:27",

          "text": "When Jim O\u2019Neill, the renowned British economist who coined BRICS, popularised the term \u2018MINT\u2019 in 2013, he had high expectations of the group of four countries \u2013 Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria and Turkey.\n\nThe four countries were billed to be the next economic giants, thanks to their favourable demographics and resources.\n\nThe former Goldman Sachs chief economist, O\u2019Neill, travelled to all four countries and described Nigeria at the time as one with \u201cenormous challenges and problems\u201d and a \u201cvery complex country but harbours immense opportunities.\u201d\n\nYears later, only one of those countries is performing better than in 2014 but it is Nigeria that has performed the worst.\n\nNigeria\u2019s economic output per person, otherwise known as GDP per capita, has slumped by 32 percent between 2014 and 2020, according to the most recent World Bank data.\n\nTurkey and Mexico have seen their GDP per capita shrink 29.79 percent and 23.78 percent respectively while Indonesia, the only country to have recorded growth in economic output in that period, recorded an increase of 10.8 percent.\n\nO\u2019Neill did not immediately respond to an email seeking comments particularly about Nigeria\u2019s economic trajectory in that period.\n\nHowever, nothing better captures the worsening state of Nigeria\u2019s economy and its fading promise than these figures: The country\u2019s GDP slumped from $546 billion in 2014 to $432 billion as at 2020 while GDP per capita, a measure of the living standard of the people, has collapsed from over $3,000 to only $2,097.\n\nNigeria looks unrecognisable from the country that was forecast in 2015 to be the first African country to hit a GDP of $1 trillion. Today, African peers like South Africa and Egypt are closing the GDP gap in the continent\u2019s largest economy.\n\nSouth Africa and Egypt have been able to steal a march on Nigeria because while the latter\u2019s GDP has been shrinking since 2014, South Africa and Egypt\u2019s GDP have gained 9.6 percent and 31.8 percent respectively.\n\nMost of the damage to the economy was done in the seven years of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration so far.\n\nThe economy has slipped into two recessions since the 79-year-old first came into power in 2015, and insecurity has worsened, with killings and kidnappings on the rise. Foreign investments have dried up and the naira has tumbled.\n\nNigerians have had to bear the brunt of an economy stuck in a rot. With businesses groaning from rising production costs, which have worsened this year amid spiralling inflation, job creation has suffered and unemployment ballooned.\n\nRead also: Nigeria\u2019s economy to grow average of 3.2% till 2023- AfDB\n\nWhile it would appear that the economy has improved in the last one year after an exit from recession and six straight quarters of growth culminating in a 3.11 percent growth in the first quarter of 2022, most of it is elusive, according to multiple interviews with businesses and individuals.\n\nThe economy\u2019s recent recovery is eluding the vast majority of Nigeria\u2019s 200 million people because it has not been able to reduce poverty or lead to the creation of sufficient jobs.\n\nForeign investment, which countries like Indonesia, a member of the MINT, have relied on to boost their economies, has dried up in Nigeria due to a complex foreign exchange management system and weak economic growth.\n\nWhile the oil price downturn in 2016 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 contributed to a recession in both years, Buhari\u2019s critics blame his lacklustre approach to the economy for making a bad situation worse.\n\n\u201cBuhari has set a number of ugly economic records that may well define his administration,\u201d a university professor who did not want to be named said.\n\n\u201cNigerians are tired and can\u2019t wait for his tenure to be over,\u201d the professor said.\n\nAt no point in its 60-year history has Nigeria\u2019s economy expanded slower than its population for a longer period than between 2015 and 2020, an indictment on Buhari\u2019s administration.\n\nAfrica\u2019s largest economy failed for six years to match its average population growth rate of 2.6 percent. When economic growth fails to match population growth, it means the economy is not creating new opportunities to accommodate a fast-rising population and is a sign of worsening poverty levels.\n\nWhen Buhari became president in 2015, he promised to reform an economy hooked on petrodollars, reduce poverty and create jobs, yet the numbers show he achieved the exact opposite.\n\nNigeria\u2019s GDP per capita declined by 0.02 percent, 4.16 percent and 1.78 percent in 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. In 2018, 2019 and 2020, it declined by 0.68 percent, 0.38 percent and 4.57 percent, a painful squeeze for Nigerians whose average incomes are less than half the $5,000 of South Africans.\n\nOf the four presidents who have led Nigeria since it returned to democracy in 1999, Buhari holds the worst record in terms of economic growth.",

          "text": "The efficient functioning of capital markets in the West African Region demands a regular assessment of policies and programmes to fit current realities, and address the region\u2019s peculiar challenges.\n\nThis was stated by Director General of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Lamido Yuguda at the West African Capital Markets Conference with the theme: \u201cDeepening and Strengthening the Capital Markets Across West Africa through Effective Regulation\u201d held in Accra, Ghana. The conference was organised by the West Africa Securities Regulators Association, (WASRA).\n\nThe SEC DG who is also the WASRA Chairman, said the need for regular assessment necessitated the revision of the WASRA/WACMIC (West African Capital Markets Integration Council) Road Map to reflect current developments and include specific initiatives that will further improve the successful implementation of integration and other efforts.\n\nHe reiterated that against the backdrop of innovation and dynamism in the capital markets, there is the need for regulators to keep pace with this trend.\n\nYuguda stated that the WACMaC periodically presents members with an opportunity to explore the role that financial markets should play in supporting the growth of the real sector of the respective economies and indeed the sub-region in general.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe are not unaware that in some member states, capital markets activities are still in their nascent stage. In collaboration with ECOWAS, efforts are being made to encourage these jurisdictions to join WASRA. We intend to engage and partner with them to build capital markets that will support the growth and development of their respective countries while advancing our regional market integration efforts.\n\n\u201cAs the region continues to expand in market size and influence, it becomes increasingly more important to focus our attention on developing world class markets by looking at innovative ways to address critical issues such as systemic risk, market integrity, investor protection, Fintechs and disruptive technologies. We must also be steadfast in our collective efforts to close the geographic distance between our markets through ways and means that facilitate regional integration.\n\nYuguda expressed delight at the high level of participation at the meeting emphasizing that the biennial Conference is geared toward promoting robust discussions on how to harness resources and effectively optimize collective efforts towards the integration of markets in the region.\n\nThis he stated, will no doubt lead to the realization of a key outcome, namely, an increase in capital markets\u2019 contribution to economic growth and development of the region.\n\n\u201cYou will recall that at our inaugural conference in Abidjan, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, we resolved to continually strive to create an environment that facilitates cross-border securities transactions; strengthen investor protection; build capacity; be more innovative with our processes, among others. To this end, we have made significant progress by adopting strategic initiatives aimed at boosting the economy, generating wealth, improving infrastructure development and growing trust and confidence as we strive for a deeper and more resilient capital market\u201d he added.\n\nIn his address, Director General of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Ghana, Rev. Daniel Ogbarmey Tetteh said the journey to achieve an integrated capital market in the West Africa sub-region began some nine years ago with the overarching goal of creating a regional capital market that would create the platform for various issuers including corporates, governments, regional development bodies, agencies and multilaterals to raise relatively cheap capital to fund regional infrastructural projects, corporate expansion and private sector development, cross-border trade and overall economic development of the sub-region.\n\nAccording to Tetteh, \u201ceveryone who is participating in this conference has a sense or an appreciation of the important role capital markets play in the mobilization of long term capital in the financing mix of any economy so there is no need to preach to the choir here. The focus of this conference, and rightly so, is on how effective regulation can enable the deepening and strengthening of the capital markets in the sub-region.\n\n\u201cAny weak link in the regulatory regime in an integrated market can spell doom and hence the need for a lot of effort to be channelled into developing a harmonized set of rules and regulations, the application of best practice in the regulation of securities markets and pursuit of robust cooperation to avoid regulatory arbitrage, protect investors as well as the integrity of the capital markets.\n\nThis he stated is even more critical in this age of innovative finance and technology, sustainable finance, the emergence of sophisticated financial solutions and the utilization of virtual platforms.\n\nTetteh therefore called on all the member states of ECOWAS, to get on board as the pursues this noble path to achieve an integrated market in the sub-region.\n\n\u201cNo one would do it for us so we owe it to ourselves to assume the responsibility. The good news is that we can do it so let\u2019s go for it. Your very strong participation in this conference says something about commitment to the cause so there\u2019s hope that the dream would become reality\u201d he stated\n\n.",

The complete set of results is currently being compiled.\n\nAminu Tambuwal, the governor of Sokoto state and a fellow presidential candidate, had previously withdrawn from the contest. Mr Tambuwal asked delegates to vote for the former vice president, putting him ahead of his major rival Nyesom Wike.\n\nMr. Abubakar formally stated his intention in running for President of Nigeria in 2023 in March. Security, the economy, education, and devolving greater resources and authorities to the federating units were all major themes in his campaign.\n\nIf elected president in the 2023 general elections, Mr Abubakar pledged the people that his administration would combat the theft of public funds. The presidential candidate promised to give the educational sector the attention it deserves.\n\nHis victory followed the comments of Doyin Okupe, a former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, who revealed that the presidential primary election will be a money market as presidential aspirants, like Messrs Abubakar and Wike, would persuade delegates with money.

The consequences of the 2022 PDP convention will be a discontinuity of milking of Igbo votes by a party that butchered the Igbo\u2019s dream.\n\n\u201cWe are waiting for the APC presidential primary to take the final decision on whether or not Igbos will participate in the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cAtiku Abubakar will be opposed in the South-East, and no Igbo is anticipated to champion or project Atiku Presidency in the East. Nobody is going to take the risk of campaigning for Atiku in the East since the PDP is now a regional northern political party. Atiku will not have Igbo support him in 2023; he cannot be the President of Nigeria in 2023.\n\n\u201cNdigbo will rise against PDP and Atiku Abubakar as a prize for PDP\u2019s ingratitude and dishonesty against Igbo.\u201d\n\nWork with me, Atiku begs Wike, Saraki, others\n\nNotwithstanding the opposition from the Ohanaeze, Alhaji Abubakar has urged his fellow contestants in the primary election to work with him for the party\u2019s victory.\n\nAbubakar said this Sunday morning in Abuja in his acceptance speech after he was declared the winner of the PDP primary and the party\u2019s candidate.\n\nHe described the primary election that produced him as free and a well-fought election, promising to work with the co-aspirants and give them a sense of belonging if elected.\n\n\u201cLet me also use this opportunity to call on my fellow contestants and to assure them that I am ready to cooperate and work with them and give them a sense of belonging in this party and our next government.\n\n\u201cTherefore, my fellow compatriots, I want to appreciate your efforts in deepening our democratic processes in this party. It was a well fought primary election.\n\n\u201cSo, I commend you for that and I look forward to working with you very closely. So that together we can build this party to a level where we can take over the government,\u201d Abubakar said.\n\nThe party\u2019s standard bearer also appealed to aggrieved party members to return to the PDP, pledging that their grievances would be addressed.\n\n\u201cToday, we are making another history. The history, which we believe will bring about fundamental changes in governance and also in our political processes.\n\n\u201cToday, we have witnessed another one of the freest elections to be conducted by our great party.\n\n\u201cToday marks another milestone in the process of our democratic gains,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his plan for the country, the ex-VP said: \u201cI am going to deal decisively with our security challenges in this country. I also pledge to confront our economic challenges, which were caused by the APC government.\n\n\u201cThe PDP made Nigeria one of the most prosperous countries on the African continent. We implemented economic reforms that brought about jobs, and prosperity in this country.\u201d\n\nThe gains according to him had been wiped out, pledging to return them.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Mr Abubakar polled 371 votes to defeat his close contender, Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers, who polled 237 votes. Ex-Senate President Bukola Saraki scored 70 votes to come third.\n\nA total of 15 aspirants were cleared to contest the PDP presidential primary although some of them withdrew before the contest started on Saturday.\n\nNorthern youth leaders congratulate Atiku\n\nMeanwhile, the Northern Youth Leaders Forum (NYLF) has congratulated Alhaji Abubakar on his success at the PDP presidential primary.\n\nNYLF, a coalition made up of over 40 groups, then vowed to work in ensuring Atiku wins the 2023 presidential election.\n\nA statement signed by the NYLF President, Comrade Eliot Afiyo, and made available to newsmen Sunday said: \u201cWe are not particularly surprised by the victory of Alhaji Atiku Abubakar at the PDP primaries which ended early this morning; we are excited that his victory gives hope to ordinary Nigerians who have gone through a lot of recent.\u201d\n\nNYLF said it is also congratulating the PDP \u201cfor producing a winning candidate, Nigerians hope of a brighter future and the North, which has not had its fair share of the presidency under the PDP.\n\n\u201cWith the primaries done, NYLF will immediately swing into action to mobilise support from the grassroots for our adopted candidate for the 2023 Presidential election,\u201d NYLF said.\n\nThe group expressed appreciation to the Northern Elders for their intervention to ensure the victory of Atiku.\n\n\u201cWe also thank Governor Aminu Tambuwal for putting the Northern interest above any other interest.\n\n\u201cWe extend our appreciation to Teecom under the Chairmanship of High Chief Raymond Dokpesi,\u201d they said.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "The emergence of former Vice President Atiku Abubakar as the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2023 general elections is unsettling the camp of the governing All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nSpecifically, the APC, which at the moment has 25 presidential aspirants eyeing its ticket, is facing an \u2018uphill task\u2019 on how to ensure the emergence of a candidate that can stand Abubakar in the presidential contest.\n\nAt the presidential primaries held weekend in Abuja, Vice President Abubakar defeated Rivers state Governor Nyesom Wike, former Senate President Bukola Saraki and Bauchi state Governor Bala Mohammed among others to emerge the PDP standard bearer in next year\u2019s general election.\n\nOf the 767 accredited delegates out of the 774 expected, Abubakar polled 371 votes while Wike got 237, with Saraki having 70 votes.\n\nAPC, PDP game plan?\n\nPrior to this time, the APC had at different times, altered its timetable of its primary elections and congresses, a move believed to be a cat and mouse game between the governing party and the opposition PDP.\n\nFor instance, the two had to reschedule their activities to ensure no one beats the other to it in their bids to elect their presidential candidates.\n\nAlso, the APC had on two occasions or thereabouts, postponed the screening of its presidential aspirants.\n\nAs at the time of this report, the party, in a bid to get it right on who should be the right candidate, has fixed June 6 as its new convention date as against the May 29/30 date earlier announced.\n\nAnd even at that, it is still silent on the date for the screening of the presidential aspirants, a development that has continued to generate some row among stakeholders, including Moh\u2019d Salihu Lukman, the party\u2019s national vice chairman (North-west) who has accused the Adamu Abdullahi-led National Working Committee (NWC) of unilaterally \u2018running the show.\u2019\n\nAll calls put through by Blueprint to Felix Morka, the APC spokesman, were not answered as at the time of this report.\n\nBut a top party source told this medium that \u201cAtiku\u2019s emergence has sent us back to the drawing board and we have to work round that and ensure a credible and capable candidate emerges.\u201d\n\nWhat option?\n\nOn the options before the party on best way to confront the PDP candidate, Blueprint gathered that the APC is \u201cre-strategising\u201d in this regard.\n\nTinubu\n\nIt was gathered that putting forward Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, a leading aspirant with the financial muscle to prosecute the campaign is one of the options on the table.\n\n\u201cThe party, as a matter of necessity must re-strategise and ensure the right thing is done. Atiku\u2019s emergence must give us a serious cause for concern. With strong financial base, we will need a Tinubu to prosecute this \u2018war\u2019, otherwise we may not find it easy,\u201d said another party source.\n\nBut reminded that a northerner would have been the party\u2019s best bet, the party chieftain said \u201cthough from south west, but Tinubu has a strong network in the north and across the country. So, combined with a strong financial base, the party stands better chance fielding him, via consensus.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo\n\nBut a pro-Osinbajo supporter and leader of IdentifytheRightLeader, a political cum civic organisation, Temi Okesanjo, believes Vice President Yemi Osinbajo is better fit to tackle the former vice president.\n\n\u201cYes, H.E Atiku is strong financially and was there before. What we require is beyond the financial muscle. While we are not ruling out the role of money in prosecuting the campaign, I want to say here that we need more than money. We need character and loyalty to the principal as well as competence to handle the myriad of the nation\u2019s challenges. Yes, Vice President Osinbajo is not a man of wealth because he doesn\u2019t believe in using the office to enrich himself, but Nigerians are ready to rally round and support him to ensure he attains victory first at the level of primaries and the election proper. So more than anyone, Osinbajo is eminently qualified to stand up to His Excellency Atiku Abubakar during the 2023 general elections,\u201d she added.\n\nAPC risks defeat in 2023 \u2013 Orji Kalu\n\nAlso speaking in similar vein, Senate Chief Whip Orji Kalu, says Abubakar\u2019s emergence as the PDP standard bearer has made it compelling for the APC to choose its candidate from the north if the party must retain power in 2023.\n\nIn a statement Sunday, Kalu specifically said the APC should pick its candidate from the North-east where Abubakar comes from.\n\nHe therefore narrowed the choice to an APC presidential aspirant, Senate President Ahmad Lawan, who is from Yobe state in the North-east.\n\n\u201cCongratulations to the PDP for electing a North Easterner,\u201d Kalu said in the statement posted on Facebook page.\n\n\u201cNigerians must have seen what I saw yesterday. For our party the APC, it is no longer feasible to talk about Southern candidates except the APC wants to go on political retirement,\u201d he said.\n\nThe lawmaker, who recently got his party\u2019s nod to contest the Senate seat next year, urged the APC national leadership and President Muhammadu Buhari to force the APC to pick its presidential candidate from the North-east.\n\n\u201cI urge the National Chairman of the party and the entire NWC to stamp their feet and zone APC presidential ticket to the North East.\n\n\u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari has a right to choose his successor, and I call on him to pick Senator Ahmad Lawan as his successor,\u201d he said.\n\nThe senator further explained why Mr Buhari should \u201cforce\u201d the APC to pick its candidate from the North-east.\n\n\u201cIn every democratic setting, presidents and governors support and pick their successors.\n\n\u201cI call on President Buhari to pick a successor from the North East and that will be the equity the South-East needs.\n\n\u201cWith the North East, the cycle will be closest to completion of regions producing the president of Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nHe urged other APC presidential aspirants to drop their ambition and support Lawan, whom he is supporting after dropping his own presidential ambition.\n\nJonathan not an option \u2013 Lukman\n\nMeanwhile, following speculations in some quarters that some persons were considering the former President Goodluck Jonathan as flag bearer for the ruling APC, the party\u2019s National Vice Chairman, North-west, Malam Salihu Mohammed Lukman has dismissed it, saying former president \u201cis not qualified to be the presidential candidate of APC.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with Blueprint on the telephone last night, Lukman described the suggestion as unthinkable for anybody to conceive the idea of the former president as the APC candidate.\n\n\u201cThere are clear guidelines in terms of how individual members of the party are qualified to emerge as the candidate of the party. One, through the sale of nomination forms. Assume Jonathan claimed to be a member of the party; he has not bought the forms to the best of our knowledge. How do you come from the back door?\n\n\u201cSecondly, as far as our memory can recall, the party became popular on the basis of the campaign against the bad governance of Jonathan and nothing has changed that we can now say has qualified him to emerge as the arrowhead of our campaign in 2023.\n\n\u201cAs far as I am concerned, these two reasons disqualified Jonathan from even aspiring to become the candidate of the party. I don\u2019t know where he is coming from. Unfortunately, in this country, where there is the mentality that everything is possible, but it must be clearly stated that as far as the leadership of the party is concerned, the person of Jonathan can\u2019t be under consideration,\u201d he said.\n\nLukman also dismissed the claim Jonathan submitted the party\u2019s nomination forms bought for him by some Fulani groups.\n\n\u201cI am waiting for anybody to present evidence that a form has been submitted for Jonathan before the deadline for submission. I am waiting to see such evidence. You know, such a form will contain all details including the membership details of Jonathan. That I have not seen. Maybe somebody is hiding his form somewhere else. I am not aware Jonathan bought the nomination form,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the alleged plan to settle for a consensus arrangement to elect APC\u2019s presidential candidate, the North-west APC leader said such move will hit the rock.\n\n\u201cAs far as the leadership of APC is concerned and I am a member of that leadership, that (imposition) is not going to be possible. As far as the majority, indeed all of us (NWC) are concerned, everybody that bought the nomination form will be given a level playing field, so that such person is qualified to be a member of APC and is qualified to aspire for such an important position.\n\n\u201cThe campaign leading to the emergence of the candidate and the eventual trend of delegates to the convention will be driven based on the aspiration of bringing out somebody that is acceptable to Nigerians on the bases of which the party can win. It is not on the bases of individual scheming,\u201d the party leader further said.\n\n\u2018Consensus our best bet\u2019\n\nBut an APC chieftain, Osita Okechukwu, has said the emergence of Abubakar as PDP candidate will have little or no impact on the re-election of the governing party.\n\nTo this end, the Voice of Nigeria (VON) Director General pleaded with President Buhari to quickly come to the rescue of Nigeria\u2019s currency, the Naira, before politicians depreciates it out of recognition.\n\nOkechukwu, who urged consensus arrangement in the choice of the party\u2019s presidential candidate, noted that a nation\u2019s currency is one of the critical indices of measuring the general health of its economy.\n\nHe said when the nation\u2019s currency nose-dives, it leads to hyper-inflation, gross unemployment and abject poverty, thereby worsening the nation\u2019s security.\n\nSpeaking with newsmen, Sunday, in Abuja, Okechukwu decried the alleged dollar rain during the PDP presidential primaries at the National Stadium Abuja.\n\n\u201cMethinks His Excellency Atiku Abubakar\u2019s opportunistic victory will have little or no impact on APC\u2019s election of a presidential candidate from among Ndigbo aspirants or by extension the southern belt aspirants. I don\u2019t think Mr President I know even going by consensus will deny the south their turn,\u201d he said.\n\nReminded of the possibility that with an APC southern presidential candidate Abubakar would sweep the northern votes, OKechukwu wondered what new tangible thing the former VP was bringing to the table in the face of prevailing daunting economic scenario.\n\n\u201cMost importantly, one, northern voters are sophisticated, having voted for Chiefs MKO Abiola and Olusegun Obasanjo, with all indicators they will vote southerner this time around so as to shame the PDP for breaching the rotation convention in their constitution.\n\n\u201cSecondly, there are number of northern voters who are patriots who believe sincerely on the ancient doctrine of equity, natural justice and the imperative of unity of our dear country. For going south is the best solution to smoothen the polarisation in the land. Thirdly, the dormant Igbo voters in Kano, Lagos and other towns plus core non-Igbo APC voters will be woken up to trounce Waziri Adamawa at the polls,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the alleged sharing of dollars during the primary, he said: \u201cif that could happen in a party with about 731 delegates, imagine what will happen if APC with about 2, 322 delegates is allowed to indulge in Dollar Rain.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the Naira is already bleeding because of Dollar Rain on 731 delegates; please better imagine the degree of depreciation of the Naira if another blitz of Dollar Rain is allowed to be splashed on 2,322 delegates? This is the farming season; as such the Buhari\u2019s Agrarian Revolution would also be at risk if the Naira is allowed to depreciate further. Prices of fertilizer, seedlings and other farm implements will hit roof top,\u201d he said.\n\nOn why he is calling for consensus instead of direct and indirect mode of primary election, which is more democratic than consensus, the DG VON said: \u201cAll the three are democratic and are in our law books. Please, is it not paradoxical that the governors and ex-governors who oppose consensus had adopted same consensus and even outright imposition to select their successors? To me they have lost the moral high ground to oppose Mr President from adopting such legal mode of primary election. One\u2019s appeal is that politically correct aspirant should be consensually presented.\u201d\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "BY ONU OKORIE\n\nLagos: May 26, 2022: To encourage and simplify vehicle ownership for personal use by millions of Nigerians, First City Monument Bank (FCMB) now offers auto loans of up to N30 million at a reduced interest rate. The FCMB auto loan supports acquiring brand new and pre-owned vehicles (popularly known as \u201cTokunbo\u201d), with N500,000 as the minimum loan amount that a customer can access for a repayment duration of up to 5 years.\n\nThis affirms FCMB\u2019s commitment to improving the social well-being of individuals and enhancing access to credit for higher standard of living for families.\n\nCommenting on the unique value proposition, Divisional Head, Personal Banking of the Bank, Mr Shamsideen Fashola, said, \u201cvehicle ownership is one of the most exciting moments in a person\u2019s life. Yet, many people struggle to save up for a long time to make this dream come true. To bridge this gap, we created a value proposition that is flexible, convenient and empowers individuals, families and businesses to achieve the dream of vehicle ownership. Nigerians can now finance their dream vehicle with an auto loan from FCMB at a low-interest rate with monthly or yearly payment options depending on their income. We, therefore, urge the populace, including, but not limited to salaried individuals, to take advantage of this opportunity to fulfil their vehicle ownership dream\u201d.\n\nFCMB Auto Loan empowers qualified Nigerians to part-finance the purchase of brand-new and pre-owned vehicles while spreading the repayment between one and five years. The loan, which is dependent on the type of vehicle to be purchased, is open to salaried individuals and self-employed Nigerians.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the number of registered vehicles in Nigeria is 13 million. However, vehicle ownership in the country has been declining because of increased prices. This is due to foreign exchange and importation challenges, leading to a drastic reduction in purchasing power and sales decline in the auto industry.\n\nA purpose beyond profit commercial banking institution, First City Monument Bank is a member of FCMB Group Plc, led by Ladi Balogun as Group Chief Executive. The Bank is committed to COVID-19 recovery, income equality and poverty reduction by easing credit constraints to disadvantaged individuals and small businesses. The intervention of FCMB in the automobile sector aligns with Goals 3 and 10 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which focus on well-being and reduced inequalities.",

Our country is on the threshold of greatness because for the first time since our independence, we would have successive administrations of a progressive and visionary government; a government of integrity, a government which sole interest is the well-being of Nigeria and Nigerians\u201d.\n\nSteve Bayode, while canvassing for Asiwaju Tinubu, posited, APC delegates are lucky to be here at this time; in this great party, in a time when our country is hoping to be led by a selfless individual who has the progress and prosperity of our people as his major objective, we are here, he said, as a witnesses to the success story of APC because Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu has been a very key part of this story.\n\nBayode calls on the APC ad-hoc delegates across the 36 states and Abuja to make history by unveiling the dawn of a greater nation through their preference for Asiwaju Ahmed Tinubu in the party\u2019s presidential primary; to not only elect him as the party\u2019s flag bearer but to celebrate the incoming dawn in Nigeria; to celebrate the next level in the party where every party men and women will be served and given what is due to them.\n\nBayode, particularly, hailed Tinubu for his political dexterity, doggedness, undoubted courage and political acumen, saying the attributes of the national leader played key part in the electoral victory of APC at the Federal, National Assembly, Governorship and State Assembly elections across the federation.\n\nAsiwaju he said has worked assiduously over the years to put most politicians in office, it is only fair and logical to accord him say opportunity to serve at the highest capacity for our nation being his long time known political ambition to serve the nation as its next president.\n\nWhile describing the presidential ambition of Asiwaju Bola Tinubu as timely and perfectly conceived and apt for the moment, Prince Iyantan noted that it is instructing that it was coming at a time when Nigerians are eagerly looking forward to a revolutionary transformation in key sectors and sections of the country.\n\n\u201cAsiwaju Tinubu\u2019s presidency is coming at a time when the APC has spread its political tentacles even, further in the country and is coming at a time when Nigerians are eagerly looking forward to the next level in progressive politics, economic growth, social welfare and increased national security ensured,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAsiwaju Tinubu is one who knows the way, goes the way and shows the way. A person that does what he says; a pragmatic person. The servant-leader type headship that talks, participates and leads his followers to achieve expected group goals as demonstrated in the way he used his positions as Governor to impact lives, opened up Lagos State to further developments and also ameliorated the sufferings of the downtrodden.\n\nAsiwaju\u2019s story is like that of many numbers of men rising from a humble beginning, struggling from birth to political stardom, a man with strong philosophy, his values and contributions to the nation building as well as his acumen as an administrator, will\n\nmake a role model for anyone including the youth to emulate.\n\nLike the change we all clamour for that brought President Mohammed Buhari to power in 2015; in moving forward beyond 2023, there is need to consolidate the gains, and the next level would require a pragmatic leader, someone with great vision the type of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu to take our nation to an Eldorado of boundless riches.\n\nSo, as APC delegates file out to effect their franchise, they should put the interest of the party first and foremost by voting wisely and casting their votes for the man who can truly win the presidency for the party \u2013 ASIWAJU BOLA AHMED TINUBU.",

          "text": "A report by the United Nations International Children\u2019s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) has projected that Nigeria will have 29 million child brides by 2050.\n\n\n\nThe report, which also raised concern that millions of children in Nigeria are victims of violence, was contained in the document \u2018Situation Analysis of Children in Nigeria: Ensuring equitable and sustainable realisation of child rights in Nigeria\u2019 launched by the federal government in conjunction with UNICEF over the weekend in Abuja.\n\n\n\nThe report put the country\u2019s current number of child brides at 22 million, representing 40 per cent of such cases in West and Central Africa, warning that seven million more child brides will be added by 2050.\n\nWhile referencing the Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) 2013, the report said 58.2 per cent of Nigerian girls were married before they attain 18 years of age.\n\nIt noted that although a comparison of data for the period 2013 \u2013 2017 indicated a decline in child marriage in Nigeria is declining, the rate of decline is, however, slow as Nigeria ranks among the countries with the slowest declining rate of child marriage in West and Central Africa.\n\n\n\nIt stated that the North-west geo-political zone had the highest proportion of women who married before 15 years or 32.5 per cent, while the South-east recorded the lowest proportion of women who married before this age or 4.1 per cent.\n\nThe report further said that by 2018, the percentage of women marrying before 18 years had declined from 48 per cent to 43 per cent while the percentage of women aged 15-19 marrying before age 15 declined from 12 per cent to eight per cent.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe rate of decline is also not enough to significantly reduce child marriage in Nigeria under current conditions. Even if efforts are redoubled, Nigeria will add about seven million child brides by 2050. This is because the statistically observed decline will be upended by population growth and the prevalence of child marriage in some regions and cultures, erasing whatever little progress is made in reducing child marriage in Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\u201cTo effectively reduce child marriage in Nigeria, some challenges would need to be overcome. These include the lack of domestication of the CRA by many states in the federation (particularly in northern Nigeria) and the failure of the federal government to legislate and enforce 18 years as the minimum age for individuals seeking or contracting any marriage recognised by the constitution of the federation,\u201d the report averred.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has backed the recommendation of the African Union Commission for the setting up of a Standby Force on Terrorism in the continent.\n\nThis is just as he charged African leaders to muster the political will that will fuel synergy, enhance intelligence gathering and bring more urgency in tackling violent crimes.\n\nAlso, President Buhari charged African political leaders to respect the right of citizens to make their choices in elections, saying the right to vote and determine who leads them should not be treated lightly.\n\nSpeaking Saturday in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea during the 16th African Union Extra-ordinary Session of the Assembly of African Union on Terrorism and Violent Extremism in Africa, the president said resources meant for development of countries had been channelled into fighting violent crimes, leaving many governments with less options on investing in people to meet the targets of Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nWith the presentation of a report on Terrorism and Violent Extremism in Africa at the meeting, President Buhari highlighted four items on the recommendation for immediate action.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cIn the West African region, we are working very hard through the instrumentality of ECOWAS to combat terrorism. The Multi National Joint Task Force in the Lake Chad region and the G5 in the Sahel have continued to degrade the insurgents by substantially reducing their capacity to inflict harm on our citizens.\n\n\u201cMr. Chairman, these efforts however, need to be strengthened and complemented by the African Union, through the African Union Peace and Security Architecture.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is for this reason, Mr. Chairperson, that we endorse the key recommendations contained in your report. Some of the recommendations which we believe should be implemented immediately include;\n\n\u201cIncreasing troop levels in situations of combating terrorism, and enhancing intelligence capabilities of deployed troops, including improving the operational cooperation of contingents in the operation areas;\n\n\u201cEnsuring the readiness of the African Standby Force for immediate response when a member state is under terrorist threat;\n\n\u201cStrengthening the fight against cybercrime, money laundering, drugs and arms trafficking, smuggling of persons and counterfeit goods, which facilitate terrorist financing; and\n\n\u201cEnsuring that specialised institutions like the African Centre for the Study and Research on Terrorism and AFRIPOL, are adequately resourced in order for them to effectively discharge their mandate\u201d.\n\nWhile validating the report on terrorism, the president underscored the need for political will to forge a \u201cCoordinated Continental Approach to tackling insecurity.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cIt is for this reason, that we commend the Chairperson of the Commission for his comprehensive report on Terrorism and Violent Extremism in Africa. The report is very enriching, resonating and it behoves on us as the Assembly of the African Union to show the political will and forge a Coordinated Continental Approach to tackling insecurity, as we must entrench peace and stability on our continent,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nAccording to him, the recommendations, if implemented, will go a long way in increasing the capacity of affected states to respond to the threats posed by terrorists and violent extremists in their respective countries.\n\nHe said: \u201cYour Excellencies, this summit affords us yet another opportunity as leaders of the continent to rub minds and take far reaching decisions to address the challenges of terrorism and violent extremism on our continent.\n\n\u201cThe activities of these sinister groups have not only led to the loss of valuable lives and property.\n\n\u201cThey have equally taken a drastic toll on our national economies. The capacity of Governments to address infrastructural needs and other developmental challenges, in line with our Sustainable Development Goals is grossly diminished.\n\n\u201cThe resources meant for developmental programmes are being channeled to fight terrorists and violent extremists, who are currently rampaging our continent\u201d.\n\nEarlier, the Chairperson of the African Union Commission, H.E. Moussa Faki Mahamat, had presented the Commission\u2019s Reports on the Prevention and Combating of Terrorism and Violent Extremism and on Unconstitutional Changes of Government in Africa.\n\nThe report looked at persistent threats, evaluated current response mechanisms, and decided on the specific actions and measures necessary to strengthen the collective security of Member States facing terrorism and violent extremism.\n\nThe report also recommended actionable measures needed to stem the upsurge on the continent.\n\nBuhari Urges African Presidents to Respect Citizens\u2019 Right to Choose Their Leaders\n\nIn related development, speaking at a bilateral meeting with the President of Malawi, Lazarus Chakwera, President Buhari charged African political leaders to respect the right of citizens to make their choices in elections, saying the right to vote and determine who leads them should not be treated lightly.\n\nHe said in a move to strengthen the continent\u2019s democratic fabric and ensure smooth conduct of elections, \u201cwe must convince the people that we respect them, and this is by allowing them to choose whoever they want.\u201d\n\nThe president acknowledged that the path to democracy in African countries had not been a smooth one, recalling that he had been to the Supreme Court three times before he became President.\n\n\u201cI had to openly disabuse the minds of our colleagues. We are a developing country, that we should not be demoralised.\n\n\u201cWe have to go through these processes. We must trust these institutions to do what is right. Present the evidence. Don\u2019t give up. Keep on pushing,\u201d Buhari explained.\n\nHe explained that the merit of one\u2019s case, not religion, or ethnicity or section would determine success in political endeavors. He stated that his meritorious cases in court were thrown out by judges who more or less shared the same sentimental backgrounds with him.\n\n\u201cSo, I say go for merit. Don\u2019t stand on ethnicity or such other divisive factors,\u201d the president said.\n\nCommenting on the relationship between Nigeria and Malawi, and that of the Southern African Sub-region in general, President Buhari said his predecessors in office, especially the late General Murtala Muhammed laid out the continental rule of engagement placing Southern African countries on Nigeria\u2019s priority list.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are acutely aware of the problems of Southern African countries, more than most others.\n\n\u201cMurtala virtually left the country to General Olusegun Obasanjo, then, and faced up to Europe and America on the problems of apartheid. He was very energetic and patriotic. We will continue on that path,\u201d Buhari added.\n\nPresident Buhari said he greatly valued his meeting with President Chakwera, giving assurances that he would pay attention to the issues brought to the meeting.\n\nThe Foreign Affairs Ministers of the two countries were directed to take the matters forward.\n\nIn his remarks, President Chekwara described President Buhari as a statesman and role model. He added that his country was willing to learn from Nigeria\u2019s experience in agriculture, infrastructure development and in managing security and violent extremism, which, he said, were creeping into the South African sub-region.\n\nAccording to him, while both countries were together in the framework of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement, his country\u2019s wish was for a speedy trade relationship with Nigeria.\n\nPresident Chekwara asked for the convening of a meeting of technical experts to discuss trading pacts, Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) and agreements.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere is no way we won\u2019t relate to the biggest economy in Africa. Our older brother should hold our hands and we walk together\u201d.\n\nPresident of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9, Carlos Vila Novo and his spouse also met President Buhari and the First Lady, Mrs. Aisha Buhari.\n\nThe Sao Tomean President got assurances that Nigeria will continue to play a brotherly role in the affairs of sister African countries.\n\nPresident Buhari also received in audience the President of Equatorial Guinea, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo who came to thank him for honouring the invitation for the Extraordinary African Union Summit in his country.",
          "summary": "President Muhammadu Buhari has backed the recommendation of the African Union Commission for the setting up of a Standby Force on Terrorism in the continent.\nChairman, these efforts however, need to be strengthened and complemented by the African Union, through the African Union Peace and Security Architecture.\nPresident Buhari said he greatly valued his meeting with President Chakwera, giving assurances that he would pay attention to the issues brought to the meeting.\nIn his remarks, President Chekwara described President Buhari as a statesman and role model.\nPresident of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9, Carlos Vila Novo and his spouse also met President Buhari and the First Lady, Mrs. Aisha Buhari.",

          "text": "The world\u2019s richest man, Elon Musk has revealed that the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has issued its firm, Starlink Internet Limited, with two licences to operate in Nigeria.\n\nStarlink Internet Limited, which is operated by SpaceX, will be trading as Starlink Internet Services Nigeria Limited.\n\nThe company received the two licences, which include the International Gateway licence and Internet Service Provider (ISP) licence, after months of negotiations with the NCC.\n\nHowever, the Director of Public Affairs at NCC, Dr Ikechukwu Adinde, could not be reached by telephone to confirm it, and he did not respond to WhatsApp chat, which THISDAY sent to him for confirmation.\n\nHowever, a reliable source at NCC, who confirmed it, told THISDAY that Starlink applied for three licences last year, while the NCC considered two of the licences as of last week after Starlink met certain requirements.\n\nThe source, however, said NCC would issue an official statement when it concludes the approval process for the two licences.\n\nBut Musk, via his Twitter handle, said NCC had confirmed and approved the two licences, before issuing Starlink the operational licences.\n\nThe licensing followed a visit to Nigeria by the company\u2019s team in May last year.\n\nStarlink offers satellite internet access coverage to 32 countries where its use has been licensed. It also provides high-speed, low-latency broadband internet across the globe.\n\nWithin each coverage area, orders are fulfilled on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the International Gateway licence has a 10-year tenure while the ISP licence is to last for five years. Both licences take effect from May 2022 and may be renewed after the expiration.\n\nWith high speeds and latency as low as 20 minutes in most locations, Starlink enables video calls, online gaming, streaming, and other high data rate activities that historically have not been possible with satellite internet.\n\nUsers also have the option to take Starlink with them via the Portability feature or Starlink.\n\nIn May last year, Starlink\u2019s Market Access Director for Africa, Ryan Goodnight along with SpaceX consultant, Levin Born, had paid a visit to the NCC where they expressed interest to obtain a licence to operate the satellite internet in the country.\n\nPrior to the visit, the NCC and the space company had been discussing the issue virtually before approval for a physical meeting was granted by the NCC.\n\nAfter SpaceX representatives provided an overview of its plans, expectations, licensing requests, and deployment phases, the Executive Vice-Chairman, NCC, Prof. Umar Danbatta, represented by the Executive Commissioner, Technical Services, NCC, Ubale Maska, had promised that the NCC would work on necessary modalities to ensure that it balanced the need for healthy competition vis-a-vis the entry of new technologies, to protect all industry stakeholders.\n\nHe had said, \u201cas the regulator of a highly dynamic sector in Nigeria, the commission is conscious of the need to ensure that our regulatory actions are anchored on national interest.\n\n\u201cWe have listened to your presentation and we will review it vis-\u00e0-vis our regulatory direction of ensuring an effective and sustainable telecoms ecosystem where a licensee\u2019s operational model does not dampen healthy competition among other licensees.\u201d\n\nMaska further stated that the commission was interested in making necessary regulatory efforts to drive the coverage of rural, unserved, and underserved areas of the country through the accomplishments of the targets contained in the Nigerian National Broadband Plan, 2020-2025\n\nEmma Okonji",
