          "title": "FG to sue airlines breaching Disability Act, signing anti-PLWDs policies",
          "text": "The Federal Government has threatened to take legal action against airlines and other operators who fail to comply with the extant laws concerning persons living with disabilities in Nigeria. It condemned the situation where it becomes difficult for the category of persons to enjoy public facilities, especially the airports.\n\nThe National Commission for Persons with Disabilities said it is already in talks with the Ministers of Aviation, Hadi Sirika; Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola; as well as the China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation engaged to construct new airport terminals across the country.\n\nThe commission\u2019s Executive Secretary, James Lalu, made this known in Abuja on Tuesday at an investigative hearing organised by the House of Representatives\u2019 Committee on Disabilities on \u2018The Need to Investigate the Alleged Violation of the Discrimination Against Persons with Disabilities (Prohibition) Act by the Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria and Private Airline Operators.\u2019\n\nLalu said, \u201cSincerely speaking, for us in the disability community and the National Disability Commission, we find this act by this airline completely disappointing. To discriminate against a PWD, you must have that very strong negative perception towards PWDs before you could be able to do that.\n\n\u201cWe see this as something of national interest and we thank the committee for raising this. The right of PWDs today in Nigeria is non-negotiable. We are here as a commission to defend this right. Therefore, when we receive some of these complaints, we try to look into these policies that most of these airlines continue to sign. The policies remain worrisome to us as a disability community.\n\n\u201cWe want to bring to their notice that the existence of the Discrimination Against Persons with Disability (Prohibition) Act already criminalises any form of discrimination of towards persons with disabilities in totality.\u201d\n\nLalu noted that the commission had been engaging with the aviation ministry on how to address the issue of policies being introduced by airlines which lead to abuse of the law.\n\nHe stated that the commission was ready to assist regulators and operators in facilitating movement and services for PLWDs at the airports.\n\nLalu said, \u201cWe are ready to train even the staff from the airlines and staff from Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria and the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority. We are ready as a commission. There are a lot of partners that approach us on this. We are ready to partner with them.\n\n\u201cOn Thursday, we are meeting with the Minister for Transportation and the Ministry of Aviation to address this. It is a matter of accessibility in the airports and a matter of accessibility for our own railway services. So, our people would be comfortable where they go.\n\n\u201cWe want to tell the airlines that are here that enough is enough. We try everything possible to address this through the administrative way but once it gets out of hand, the commission is ready to take any airline to court.\n\n\u201cThe provisions in the Act, it does not take any rocket science for you to be able to read and understand. It is clear there. It is a thing that all the airlines must be able to provide these services. If you can provide the steps for people with their legs to climb at the airport, why must you not provide things for PWDs?\n\n\u201cThis is the time for us to address this. Our people have suffered. Enough is enough! For many years, we have been discriminated against in airports. Once I leave Nigeria to another country, you see how they try to handle me; I feel like a king anywhere I go. But once I get back to Nigeria, it becomes difficult.\n\n\u201cWhy are we trying to make life difficult for our own people? If you are complete, does that mean you are better than some of us? God can move you to any place. As soon as you are alive and you have not entered the grave, then, God has not finished your creation. In one minute, you can become a member of the disability community.\n\n\u201cI was born, I did my primary and secondary school; I was hearing completely. Then, sickness struck me and I lost my hearing abilities. If I am not hearing, then, are you more intelligent than us?\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Chairman of the committee, Miriam Onuoha, in her opening remarks, decried that most of the airlines failed to attend the hearing despite public notices and invitations to them.\n\nShe said, \u201cIt was extended to them but we have just about three of them. It is just for the records. Before the end of the meeting, we hope to have them in attendance. But if we do not have them in attendance, then, the committee will decide on the necessary steps to take, going forward.\u201d\n\nOnuoha added, \u201cI want to use this opportunity to address and make a passionate appeal to the general public that one of the core mandates of this House committee is to advocate the welfare and rights of persons with disability. This committee will stop at nothing or letting anything deter us from carrying out this mandate.\n\n\u201cWe use this opportunity to enlighten the general public on the provisions of this Disability Act and the need for the public to respect the provisions and the rights and welfare of persons with disability. I don\u2019t think issues and matters concerning the rights and welfare of persons with disabilities should be treated lightly or with disdain.\n\n\u201cWe will like the general public to take away any form of discrimination and stigma that is attached to disabilities. Persons with disabilities are first humans and Nigerians.\u201d",

          "title": "APC denies suspending Ayogu Eze",
          "text": ".\n\nBy Omeiza Ajayi, ABUJA\n\nThe All Progressives Congress APC has debunked reports in a section of the media to the effect that it has suspended a former Enugu North senator, Ayogu Eze, saying there has been no such action.\n\nAPC Chairman in Enugu State and Secretary of the Forum of APC Chairmen, Dr Ben Nwoye made the declaration at a news conference Wednesday in Abuja.\n\nHe said; \u201cYesterday we saw reports in a section of the media misinforming people that the distinguished Senator Ayogu Eze was suspended from the party. That cannot be further from the truth. The distinguished Senator Ayogu Eze is a well respected member of APC in Enugu State and indeed South East and at the national level. He joined the party and he ran for Governorship, got the ticket and because of his popularity has taken the party to greater heights.\n\n\u201cVery recently, he received a vote of confidence based on what he had done to grow the party beginning with most recently, our membership registration. His efforts cumulated into tripling the number of registered members of APC in Enugu State. We have independent people who could verify that. The chairman of the registration committee for the state, distinguished Senator Jonathan Zwingina was in Enugu State and he hosted him and other members of the committee. He made sure we had a great turn out of members.\n\n\u201cThrough the help of the leadership of Sen. Ayogu Eze and other leaders, we have risen from 63, 000 to 184, 294 registered members. These are real members and not made up.\n\n\u201cBefore that, during the pandemic, Sen. Eze donated immensely to our purse making it possible for the outreach which we did in 2020 and early 2021. We were able to procure relief materials and visited hospitals, homes for the elderly, disabled and orphans. He also regularly provided for members of the party\u201d.\n\nNwoye accused a former chairman of APC Ward 7, Mr. Nwokedi Ugwuoke of allowing himself to be used to embarrass the APC.\n\nHe said; \u201cSo, it came to my notice that a former Chairman who had been removed may have connived with people and started peddling falsehood, fake news that the distinguished Senator has been suspended from the party. So, this is not true. This is pure falsehood, sponsored news item that is only meant to finish the already risen profile of the senator.\n\n\u201cHis caretaker executive of the ward had duly removed him according to our constitution. The fact is that his own caretaker executives passed a vote of no confidence against him unbeknownst to Sen. Eze or anyone including myself. They brought a letter that following the due process, they had removed him and brought in another gentleman, Comrade Obeta as Chairman of the Ward. Sen. Eze has no hand in whatever happened to the former Chairman. It was the handiwork of mischief makers to embarrass him.\n\n\u201cAs of the time he wrote the letter purportedly suspending Sen. Eze, he was no longer the Chairman of Ozzi, Ward 7. We have 260 wards and 17 local governments in Enugu State. So, one out of 260 rushed down somewhere to Abuja and engaged fake news merchants. It was a hatchet job and we won\u2019t allow that to stand because we have grown this party to this point.\n\n\u201cI have reached out to the national secretariat and other leaders and I have not been able to find out who identifued this individual as Chairman of Ozzi Ward 7\u201d.\n\nMr Ugwuoke had on Tuesday reportedly written to the national leadership of the party accusing Sen. Eze of anti-party activities and consequently announcing his suspension.",

          "text": "In further effort to help the Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to be rightly guided as it finally takes the bold step to screen and confirm the President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s nomination, Lauretta Onochie, among others, as National Commissioner for Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), legal practitioners from YUSUF DANKOFA & CO have written the Senate President, Dr. Ahmed Lawan in support of the woman of integrity.\n\nThis was contained in a letter addressed to the Senate President title, \u201cLEGAL ISSUES IN SUPPORT OF PRESIDENT MUHAMMADU BUHARI\u2019S APPOINTMENT OF LAURETTA ONOCHIE AS A NATIONAL COMMISSIONER OF INDEPENDENT NATIONAL ELECTORAL COMMISSION (INEC)\u201d, and copy of which was obtained by Vanguard.\n\nThe lawyers, according to the letter, said: \u201cWe have observed with dismay, the the ferocious and atrocious attempt s at misleading this august body by some NGOs through some of their petitions against the nominee, which is neither rooted in Law nor Equity.\n\n\u201cSome of the interpretations of the Constitutional provisions on the grounds of their demands are no doubt perverse interpretation of law to suit their prejudices and personal idiosyncrasies.\n\n\u201cWe are of the view that keeping quiet in the face of this misleading legal submission by the petitioners will not promote justice, hence this intervention by us.\u201d\n\nOn Onochie possessing dual citizenship (Nigerian and British citizen) as pointed by the petitioners against her nomination, the Legal Practitioners argued that the point is baseless and does not apply in the case of Onochie, who is a Nigerian by birth.\n\n\u201cWith all sense of professionalism, we emphatically assert that this is not only incorrect, it has no basis under our Jurisprudence. It is axiomatic that a Nigerian with dual citizenship can contest for any election in Nigeria or given appointment to hold any office in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cTo resolve this logjam, the provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) on citizenship must be examined.\n\n\u201cSection 28 of the Constitution clearly provides that a person who is a Nigerian citizen by birth can have dual citizenship and be a citizen of another country.\n\n\u201cIt is only a Nigeria citizen by naturalisation or registration who is also a citizen of another country that loses his citizenship of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThus, the key determinant here is citizenship by birth. A person that is a citizen of Nigeria can afford to have another citizenship from another country and this will not jeopardise his or her citizenship\u2026.\u201d\n\nClarifying on her non-partisanship, the legal practitioners submitted that the fact that Lauretta Onochie is a serving public servant to Mr. President does not make her partisan.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of sound democratic practice, a President can appoint any personal or public aide across party lines or affiliation and that will not confer partisanship in that person.\n\n\u201cBesides, what confers partisanship ? The Courts have opined that before partisanship can be determined, such a person must be a card carrying member of a registered political party. The onus to prove whether Lauretta Onochie is a card carrying member of any political party therefore rest on her accusers. From what we can gather from our own investigation as Public Interests\u2019 Advocates, Lauretta Onochie is not a card carrying member of any political party and being a Presidential aide to Mr. President does not confer any party affiliation on her,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThe Human Rights Lawyers concluded that the entire petitions against Onochie are \u201cunmeritorious, frivolous, mundane, profane and an attempt at irritating and rubbishing the image of a patriotic Nigerian.\u201d\n\nThey urged the Senate to consider their submission and discountenance the grounds of the petitioners against Onochie\u2019s nomination, \u201cas all are empty without proper foundation of Law.\u201d",

          "text": "The Christian Lawyers Fellowship of Nigeria (CLASFON) has urged the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government to ensure strict compliance of the Federal Character principle in all its appointments as enshrined in the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999.\n\nThe lawyers believed that the compliance would give Nigerians every sense of belonging and reduce all forms of agitations emanating from different parts of the country.\n\nThe lawyers\u2019 view was contained in a communique issued by National President, Dr. Arome M. Okwori, and National Secretary, Olatunji Omole Esq, at a physical and virtual President-in-Council meeting of the fellowship held in Warri, Delta State, and made available to DAILY POST.\n\nSpeaking on insecurity, CLASFON observed with dismay the unabating and rising incidences of kidnapping, banditry, coordinated armed attacks, among others that have seriously threatened the security of the nation.\n\nIt voiced its support for the agitation for state police as a panacea to tackle the prolonged problem of insecurity and wanton destruction of lives and properties across the country. It also recommended that compensation be paid to families who have lost loved ones.\n\nJUSUN strike: Financial autonomy of judiciary not-negotiable \u2013 CLASFON\n\nThe fellowship also called on the National Assembly to expeditiously conclude legislative action by passing the Electoral Act Amendment bill into law and for the President to assent to it without any delay to inspire the confidence of the citizenry in the electoral process as the nation prepares for the forthcoming general elections.\n\nOn open grazing, \u201cThe Christian Lawyers Fellowship of Nigeria supports the ban on open grazing by the Governors of the Southern States in Nigeria and recommends ranching which is the modern way of cattle rearing.\n\n\u201cThe Fellowship further asserts that encouraging open grazing or grazing routes as is being done by the Federal Government might occasion incessant clashes, violence and wanton destruction of lives and properties and other worrisome developments which are inimical to the constitutionally guaranteed rights to preserve lives and protect properties.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the agitation for constitutional amendment, the participants applauded the recent initiative of the National Assembly for steps being taken to further alter the provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 and appealed to members of legislative arm to ensure that the exercise is pursued to a logical conclusion and fully actualized so that it would not turn out to be an exercise in futility.\n\nCLASFON commended the efforts made by the Nigerian Bar Association and other relevant actors over the suspension of the strike action by the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) and suggested speedy implementation of the recommendations and agreement reached by the relevant stakeholders (Governors of various States and the State Houses of Assembly) on financial autonomy.\n\nIt also condemned the suspension of Twitter, saying it is a violation of the fundamental human right of the citizens enshrined in section 39(1) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and People\u2019s Rights.\n\nAccording to the lawyers, the action taken by the Federal Government has adversely affected the flow of foreign direct investment into the country and is also having a negative impact on the means of livelihood of the teeming youths thereby causing them untold hardship in view that the youth are unemployed by governments and the organised private sector having undertaken gainful activities using Twitter social media platform.\n\nThe fellowship urged the Federal Government to rescind its decision immediately and urged the management of Twitter to ensure effective monitoring of its platform in preventing the spread of hateful, offensive and damaging posts/tweets.\n\nOn the demilitarization of the South East by the federal government, the lawyers passionately appealed to the government to immediately relieve the people of the South Eastern part of Nigeria of military harassment..\n\nCLASFON urged the President to refrain from utterances which might dampen the morale of law-abiding and loyal citizens of Nigeria from the South East in particular and other parts of Nigeria in general, stressing that some statements are inimical to the stability of Nigeria and therefore inconsistent with the fatherly role of the President and exemplary leadership expected of this high office\n\nInnovation: Enugu govt partners Oxford University on students\u2019 mentorship",

          "text": "By Sanni Onogu, Abuja\n\nSenate President Ahmad Lawan on Wednesday said that the National Assembly Complex is overdue for rehabilitation, adding that the leakage and flooding of the complex vindicated the position of his leadership.\n\nLawan spoke following a point of order moved by the Deputy Chief Whip of the Senate, Senator Aliyu Sabi Abdullahi.\n\nAbdullahi had complained that some media reports about the leakage and flooding of the chambers due to a heavy downpour on Tuesday were full of inaccuracies and therefore impugned the integrity of lawmakers.\n\nWhile citing orders 14 and 15 of the Senate Standing Orders, Abdullahi said: \u201cThe issue of the rainfall as it happened Tuesday which was heavy was reported in various media. However when I listened to the reportage on the Channels Television, there were many issues that were raised in their report that I felt has impinged upon my privilege and of course, the privilege of my colleagues.\n\n\u201cIn that report, three things were reported which were very inaccurate. That there was heavy downpour or leakage even in the chamber. That was not correct. There was leakage of course around the premises outside the chamber. Also it was reported that because of that leakage it delayed our sitting. That also was not correct.\n\n\u201cThe leadership had house-keeping matters and of course, until the leadership comes into the chamber sitting will not begin. Thirdly and the most critical was that they reported the sum of N37billion has approved for rehabilitation of this building. This is nothing further from the truth.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWhen the Ninth Senate came on board, the leadership noticed dilapidation and the need for the rehabilitation of the National Assembly complex.\n\n\u201cThe Senate President and Speaker of the House of Representatives approached Mr. President to report this matter and we were all briefed that Mr. President was willing to ensure that something is done about it.\n\n\u201cAs we all know when the sum of N37billion was made as provision in the initial 2020 budget, the media went to town castigating and calling the National Assembly members all sort of names.\n\n\u201cNow at the end of the day it was reduced to N9billion in view of the pandemic. So that they can take the rehabilitation in phases. As we speak nothing has been done until Tuesday as we all saw leakages across the complex.\n\nThis is a vindication of what the leadership and indeed the Senate and members of the House of Representatives saw with respect to this edifice.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, the Senate President said the leakage and flooding of the foyer of the National Assembly witnessed on Tuesday was a vindication of efforts being made by the leadership to get the complex rehabilitated.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLawan said: \u201cLet me also say that Channels TV reporter may not be responsible for that report, our members of the press corps are in tune with what we do here and what happens around us.\n\n\u201cLet me advise the media, this is irresponsible. I must say, seek the truth, investigate properly before you compile and send your report.\n\n\u201cThe fact there was a leakage to me is a clear testimony, confirmation and vindication of the position the National Assembly took initially.\n\n\u201cEveryone knows that this place is overdue for rehabilitation. We went to see Mr President and he was gracious and he asked us to meet with FCTA, the owners of the building.\n\n\u201cMyself, the Speaker, late Chief of Staff and Minister of Finance met to look for money for the rehabilitation of the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cWhen the N37billion was approved it was not a National Assembly budget, it was an FCDA budget.\n\n\u201cWe expect the press to inform the people responsibly.\n\n\u201cThis house is the house of Nigerians. It belongs to Nigerians and it deserves to be rehabilitated.\u201d",

          "title": "FG, Reps fight over Twitter ban as ECOWAS Court stops FG",
          "text": "From Ndubuisi Orji, Godwin Tsa and Aidoghie Paulinus, Abuja\n\nThe Federal Government and the House of Representatives clashed yesterday over the suspension of Twitter.\n\nOn June 4, government banned Twitter after the microblogging site pulled down a tweet by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nIn reaction, the House mandated its Committees on Information, Communication and Justice to investigate the legal backing for government\u2019s action.\n\nAt the resume hearing yesterday, government said it suspended operations of the micro-blogging and social networking site in line with the Terrorism Act 2011 and other extant laws.\n\nMinister of Information and Orientation, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, who appeared before the lawmakers, alongside the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) and the Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC), insisted that the suspension had nothing to do with the pulling down of Buhari\u2019s tweet.\n\nHe also read the riot act to Facebook and other social media operators saying government would not hesitate to wield the big stick if they crossed the red line.\n\n\u201cWe suspended Twitter because Twitter became a platform of choice for those that want to bring down this country. If any other platform does it, we will suspend their operations too. It is because there is a country called Nigeria that they have business here. Social media is a menace everywhere in the world. We believe that the best way to start is regulating them.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIncidentally, the Twitter suspension is indefinite; it\u2019s not banned. The doors are not closed. We are willing to speak to Twitter. Twitter has written a letter seeking for government dialogue and just today, I did issue a statement which I announced the government\u2019s team that is ready to meet Twitter.\n\n\u201cWhen I leave here, I intend see whether we can have a preliminary meeting of that committee. We hope that the committee will be able to meet first and that the committee would have a good dialogue with Twitter. But like we said, there are two basic things that Twitter or any OTT or social media needs to do: they must first be registered as a Nigerian company after which they will apply for license. Other conditions will come up as we go along.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the minister had said that the Federal Government has said that it suspended the operations of micro-blogging and social networking site, Twitter, in the country in line with the Terrorism Act 2011 and other extant laws.\n\n\u201cIf you look at section 3 of the National Security Act which cloth the State Security Service with the powers to preserve the internal security of Nigerians, it is very instructive that any platform that threatens the internal security of Nigeria will not be allowed to operate.\n\n\u201cThis is a case where the Federal Government deemed it necessary that the activities of twitter in Nigeria in particular is inimical to stability in the country.\n\n\u201cThe right to freedom of expression on the Twitter platform is further qualified by section 45 of the constitution in light to the provisions of section 5 (1) and (2) of the Terrorism Act 2011 which states that any person who knowingly, in any manner directly or indirectly solicits or render support or the commission of an act of terrorism or to a terrorist group commits an offence under this act.\n\n\u201cWe all know that IPOB is proscribed by a High Court in Nigeria and yet, twitter is the platform of choice through which IPOB direct its people to kill soldiers, kill policemen and burn public institutions.\n\n\u201cSo, it is clear that Twitter operations in Nigeria is inimical to our growth, both in common law and national security and so, we had to suspend their operations.\u201d\n\nHowever, a member of the joint committee, Shaba Ibrahim, said while he agreed that everything pales into insignificance when national interest and security is at stake, government\u2019s action smacked of incipient totalitarianism.\n\n\u201cWe are at the mercy of people who handle social media irresponsibly. All it took to wake to that responsibility was for Twitter to bring down Mr President\u2019s tweet. With all due respect sir, I don\u2019t think that was good enough.\n\n\u201cI agree that no right is in absolute terms. But again, we must mind the timing of it so that proactive actions are taken to nip these things in the bud, because what you have done whether you like it or not looks like symptoms of emerging totalitarianism.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the court of the Economic Community of West Africa States (ECOWAS) has restrained President Buhari and agents of the Federal Government from unlawfully imposing sanctions or doing anything whatsoever to harass, intimidate, arrest or prosecute Twitter and other social media service providers, media houses, radio and television broadcast stations and other Nigerians who are Twitter users, pending the hearing and determination of the suit.\n\nThe ruling of the court was predicated on the suit filed against the government by Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) and 176 concerned Nigerians where they argued that \u201cthe unlawful suspension of Twitter in Nigeria, criminalisation of Nigerians and other people using Twitter have escalated repression of human rights and unlawfully restricted the rights of Nigerians and other people to freedom of expression, access to information, and media freedom in the country.\u201d\n\nThe court gave the order after hearing arguments from Solicitor to SERAP, Femi Falana (SAN) and lawyer to the government Maimuna Shiru.\n\nLai, Pantami make govt\u2019s reconciliation team\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has approved a Federal Government\u2019s team to engage with Twitter over the suspension of its operations in the country.\n\nMinister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, announced the composition of the team in a statement in Abuja by Segun Adeyemi, special assistant to the President on Media, office of the Minister of Information and Culture.\n\nThe team which is chaired by Mohammed the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami; Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Pantami; Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama; Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola and Minister of State, Labour and Employment, Festus Keyamo, and representatives of relevant government agencies as members.\n\n\u201cFollowing the indefinite suspension of its operations in Nigeria, for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence, Twitter wrote to President Buhari seeking to engage with the Federal Government over the suspension, with a view to charting a path forward,\u201d the statement read.",

          "text": "From Godwin Tsa, Abuja\n\nA High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) has sentenced former chairman of the House of Representatives\u2019 probe panel, Farouk Lawal, to seven years imprisonment for demanding a $3 million bribe from an oil magnate, Femi Otedola.\n\nJustice Angela Otaluka, in her judgment, yesterday, convicted the ex-lawmaker on all three count charges the Independent Corrupt Practices Commission (ICPC) preferred against him.\n\nLawan was the chairman of the committee probing the multi-billion naira fuel subsidy fraud in 2012.\n\nHe was accused of demanding $3 million from Femi Otedola to remove Zenon Petroleum and Gas Limited (Otedola\u2019s company) from the list of oil companies allegedly involved in the fuel subsidy fraud in 2012.\n\nThe ex-lawmaker was alleged to have collected a $500,000 bribe from Otedola. The charge was later amended to three counts.\n\nOtedola, while giving evidence as the fifth prosecution witness, said the defendant demanded $3 million from him with a threat to indict his company.\n\nThe businessman said he proceeded to report the issue to the Department of State Services (DSS) and was given $500,000 in marked notes. Also, the DSS had planted a camera in Otedola\u2019s house.\n\nEarlier, Justice Otaluka dismissed the preliminary objection filed by Farouk Lawan against his trial to set the stage for his conviction.\n\nDismissing his preliminary objection to trial, yesterday, Ms Otaluka said the argument of the defence lawyer, Mike Ozekhome, that Mr Lawan was not a public officer going by the Section 2 of the ICPC Act was untenable.\n\nThe judge held that a public officer is anyone who occupies a public office and who is remunerated with public funds as against Mr Ozekhome\u2019s argument that Mr Lawan was a \u201cmere political office holders.\u201d\n\nJustice Otaluka held that Lawan acted in breach of section 17 (1) (a), section 8(1) (a) (b) (ii), and section 23 (i) of the Corrupt practices and other Related Offences Act, 2000, and committed an offence punishable under section 8 (1) 17 (1) and 23(3) of the same Act.\n\nThe court said it was satisfied that the ICPC successfully established a criminal case against the defendant.\n\nWhereas the defendant was handed seven years jail term on counts one and two of the charge, the court sentenced him to five years on count three.\n\nJustice Otaluka held that the sentence would run concurrently. Lawan was the chairman of an ad hoc committee set up by the House in 2012 to investigate massive petrol subsidy fraud.",

          "text": "\u2022Calls for equity in distribution of key political posts\n\n\u2022Seeks incorporation of security chiefs\u2019 positions in FCC document\n\nEmmanuel Addeh\n\nFormer President Goodluck Jonathan yesterday attributed Nigeria\u2019s failure to properly manage its diversity and continuing inability to give ethnic and religious minorities their proper place in the country as part of the reasons for disenchantment in the polity.\n\nThe former president, in his address at the 13th Joe-Kyari Gadzama Public Lecture said aside from the South-west, no other area in the country has been able to balance religion and development.\n\n\u201cThat is the only part of Nigeria where we feel has been able to manage religion and development very well. So, we must look at our own unique circumstances and come up with the right form of government,\u201d he said.\n\nHis address during the event, which held both virtually and physically in Abuja, was titled: \u201cRedefining Democracy: Yearnings of the Minority in a Democratic Setting.\u201d\n\nJonathan stated that he decided to honour the invitation to speak on the state of the nation, despite the likely misinterpretation of his treatise, out of his respect for the host, Mr. Joe-Kyari Gadzama (SAN), and because a society that does not respect the rule of law would breed anarchy where life becomes nasty, brutish and short, making real progress difficult.\n\nAccording to him, in Nigeria, the complications associated with the marginalisation of minority groups and tribes were identified many years ago and efforts have been made across generations to solve the problems, including the Willinks Commission set up during the colonial era.\n\nHe added that although the Federal Character Commission (FCC) is a product of such efforts, it has not fully rectified the anomalies, having been tailored to deal with mainly the civil service.\n\nJonathan said: \u201cThe Federal Character Commission over many decades may have been doing its best to give everyone fair representation and a fair sense of belonging, but there are still many who feel that this agency of government has not fully addressed the challenges of accommodating minorities.\n\n\u201cThis is because it has managed to pursue with varying degrees of success emphasis on the civil service. However, many are of the opinion that it does not really go far enough, since it currently does not address inequalities in political appointments into sensitive areas such as the military and public sector appointments.\u201d\n\nHe stated that Nigeria now faces the challenge of managing diversity and minority interests, and even in the parliament, it has been struggling with the task of accommodating disadvantaged groups like women and people with disability.\n\nHe traced the country\u2019s problems to its foundation, saying that the growing dissent cannot be divorced from the country\u2019s failure to manage its differences and play down on its fault lines.\n\n\u201cFrom the independence and post-independence crisis, the coups and the counter-coups and the different republics to date, the swelling disenchantment is the fallout of our inability to manage our diversity and downplay our differences. It is obvious that calls for fragmentation seem to be getting louder among some segments of our nation.\n\n\u201cThis is because we have not been able to positively harness and harmonise our enviable size and the ingenuity of our people and project our greatness,\u201d he stated.\n\nBut beyond the grandstanding from some quarters, the former president stated that Nigeria needs to unite and face the problems that have been holding it down, further pinning it down to \u201ca failure to properly manage our diversity and harness our potential.\u201d\n\nFor a multi-ethnic country to make progress, Jonathan said that there must be a conscious effort to give a democratic sense of fairness, equity and justice and guarantee minority groups access to the political space.\n\nHe added that the refrain that Nigeria is potentially great was going out of tune, as the younger people had begun to query whether Nigeria will ever operate within its full capacity.\n\n\u201cBy now, we should be running an advanced economy and the social system and standard services that support that economy just like other nations like Singapore or Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates who share the same political and economic evolution with us. However, we are lagging behind so far away from them.\n\n\u201cThe stories of these countries clearly confirm that the journey to the transformation of a nation does not take a lifetime. That Nigeria still remains potentially great after over 60 years of independence shows that there are fundamental lessons in the political evolution of our nation that we have not really learnt,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, although there is a school of thought which blames the country\u2019s colonial experience for its seeming backwardness, while the proposition may have some element of truth, Nigeria was not the only country that was colonised.\n\nHe said a second school of thought blamed the huge size of the nation, describing it as the dilemma of the whale, which is feared for its weight, and yet dies by its weight.\n\nHe added: \u201cI share the sentiments of many political commentators that at the crux of our challenge of national transformation is the problem of our political and governance structures and the inability to harness our diversity towards shared prosperity.\n\n\u201cI believe that from independence, the political evolution of leadership in Nigeria has been too concentrated along tribal and religious lines and that is still haunting us today.\u201d\n\nHe said it was the reason he conveyed a national conference in 2014 which sought to look at the political leadership structure, saying that the nation is currently trapped in the dilemma of an \u201cimperceptible giant\u201d that needs to work harder to realise it\u2019s destiny.\n\nHe said what many countries might be doing better than Nigeria was that they had developed systems and institutions that ensured that the political recruitment process offered a space for all, including the minorities.\n\n\u201cWhere the minority feels that they are not relevant, there\u2019s always the tendency to fulfil their destiny with a different approach. This is the beginning of the unending agitations and resistance movements across the world,\u201d he added.\n\nHe decried the winner-takes-all approach to politics, stressing that enough space must be created for those who may be at a disadvantage, a situation that has fuelled the practice of cross-carpeting in the country because there\u2019s usually nothing for the loser.\n\nHe also stated that bestowing maximum powers on one individual may not be the right form of government.\n\nAccording to Jonathan, the inequity in the polity runs from the federal to states to local governments and even in wards where certain minorities can never dream of becoming top leaders because of their areas of origin.\n\n\u201cLooking to the future, I can say that our leaders can do a lot more to eliminate ethnic sentiments in our society, enthrone merit and build a system that gives citizens equal opportunities to excel.\n\n\u201cThere has to be a united, strong and cohesive Nigerian nation of patriotic citizens for any structure or system to yield the promise of our shared prosperity,\u201d he added.\n\nEarlier, Gadzama, who praised Jonathan for averting bloodshed by handing over peacefully to his successor had said that in every democracy, majority rule was endorsed and guided by the constitution, which also protects the rights of the minorities.\n\nHe stated that the participation of persons belonging to the minority in public affairs and in all aspects of the political are essential to preserving their identity as a minority.\n\nHe added that democracy is likely to develop and endure when all members of society are free to participate and influence political outcomes.\n\nAside from Jonathan, other dignitaries at the event included the National President of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Mr. Olumide Akpata; Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Alhaji Mohammed Bello; Chairman, House Committee on Judiciary, Mr. Onofiok Luke, former Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Mohammed Adoke (SAN) and members of the diplomatic corps.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022ECOWAS Court restrains FG from prosecuting users\n\nOlawale Ajimotokan, Adedayo Akinwale and Udora Orizu in Abuja\n\nThe federal government yesterday kick-started the process of resolving its dispute that led to the suspension of the operations of the microblogging platform, Twitter, in Nigeria, with President Muhammadu Buhari raising a team to negotiate with the United States-based company.\n\nThe team, comprising cabinet members, will be led by Minister of Information and Culture, Mr. Lai Mohammed.\n\nAccording to a statement yesterday by the Special Assistant to the President (Media), Office of the Minister of Information and Culture, Mr. Segun Adeyemi, the Attorney-General of the Federation and the Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami (SAN); the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Pantami; the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Geoffrey Onyeama; the Minister of Works and Housing, Mr. Babatunde Fashola (SAN), and the Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Mr. Festus Keyamo (SAN), will join Mohammed in the talks.\n\nThe engagement followed a letter from Twitter informing the federal government of its readiness for talks following the suspension of its operations on June 5 for deleting the president\u2019s tweet, warning the Igbo of a potential repeat of the civil war that might result from the escalation in insurgency traced to the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB).\n\nBesides, the federal government accused Twitter of being part of a plot to destabilise Nigeria for allegedly funding and promoting last October\u2019s #EndSARS protests, that Buhari considered an agenda to oust him from power, and for condoning Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) Leader, Mr. Nnamdi Kanu, tweets inciting attacks on security personnel in the South-east.\n\nAlso yesterday, the federal government, again, defended the suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in the country, saying it was done under the National Security Act, Terrorism Prevention Act, Cyber Space Act and Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA).\n\nHowever, Twitter users got a legal cover to continue tweeting, despite the federal government\u2019s threat to prosecute violators of the ban on using the platform, as the ECOWAS Court of Justice in Abuja restrained the federal government from imposing sanctions, or doing anything whatsoever to arrest or prosecute any Nigerian and media houses using Twitter, pending the hearing and determination of a suit before it.\n\nAgain, FG Defends Suspension, Says Freedom of Expression Not Absolute\n\nThe federal government has again justified the suspension of the operations of Twitter in Nigeria, insisting that the freedom of expression is not absolute.\n\nMohammed, who appeared before the House of Representatives Joint Investigative Committee on Twitter Suspension, yesterday told the lawmakers that the federal government suspended the operations of micro-blogging platform, under the National Security Act, Terrorism Prevention Act, Cyber Space Act and Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA).\n\nHe referred to the provisions of Section 45 of the 1999 Constitution as altered, which he said left no one in doubt that the provisions of Section 39 of the constitution on freedom of expression was not absolute.\n\nAccording to him, the right to free expression within the contemplation of Section 39 makes it a qualified right in light of the aforementioned Section 45, which allows restrictions of civil liberties in the public interest.\n\nRelying on Section 45 (1) of the 1999 Constitution, he said: \u201c45 (1) Nothing in Sections 37, 38, 39, 40 and 41 of this Constitution shall invalidate any law that is reasonably justifiable in a democratic society: (a) in the interest of defence, public safety, public order, public morality or public health or; (b), the purpose of protecting the rights and freedom of other person.\u201d\n\nThe minister also justified the Twitter ban by relying on Section 3 of the National Security Act.\n\nHe quoted the section as charging the State Security Service with the duty to preserve the nation\u2019s internal security and prevent and detect within its borders any crime against its internal security.\n\nHe stated that the ban of Twitter was pursuant to security reports of the SSS.\n\nMohammed added: \u201cFurthermore, the right to freedom of expression on the Twitter platform is further qualified by Section 45 of the constitution in light of the provisions of Section 5(1) and (2) of the Terrorism Act of 2011. For clarity, the section reads:\n\n\u201cAny person who knowingly in any manner directly or indirectly solicits or renders support for the commission of an act of terrorism; or to a terrorist group, commits an offence under this Act and is liable on conviction to imprisonment for a term of not less than 20 years.\u201d\n\nHe interpreted the \u201csupport\u201d in the sub-section 1 to include incitement to commit a terrorist act through the internet or any electronic means or through the use of printed materials or through the dissemination of terrorist information.\n\nHe added that Section 14(2)(b) of the Constitution provides that the security and welfare of the people shall be the primary purpose of the government.\n\nMohammed stated that from the purview of the Companies and Allied Matters Act, 2020, as it regulates the operations of a foreign company in Nigeria, Twitter is not licensed to do business in the country.\n\nAccording to him, having failed to register as a separate entity in Nigeria, as required by Section 78 (1) of CAMA Act 2020, Twitter cannot do business in the country or exercise any powers of a registered company.\n\nMohammed said the operations of Twitter in the Nigerian social space was not legally permissible when it was used in airing information that endangered the lives and security of the majority of Nigerians.\n\nHe said the principles of the law were clear on the exercise of personal human rights in the face of national security threats affecting the larger citizens.\n\nThe minister added that provisions in Articles 24, 25 of the African Union on Cyber Security and Personal Protection, Article 19 (2) and (3) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as well as Section 1,2, 3 and 4 of the Cyber Crimes Prevention Act provide the requisite legal backing for the federal government to regulate and protect the country\u2019s cyberspace, including social media such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram as well as applications, internet platforms, and cloud computing platforms.\n\n\u201cFollowing the above, the Federal Government of Nigeria is further empowered to take all reasonable steps to defend its cyberspace where it perceives or finds that a cybercrime is threatened to be committed, has been committed, or is being committed on and through its cyberspace,\u201d he added.\n\nThe minister, however, dismissed claims that the operations of Twitter were suspended because it pulled down Buhari\u2019s tweet.\n\nHe said: \u201cI want to make two clarifications. The first is that we did not ban Twitter; we simply suspended indefinitely the activities of Twitter. The second is that we did not suspend the activities of Twitter because they deleted Mr. President\u2019s tweet. Not at all. We are very unambiguous on why we suspended Twitter.\u201d\n\nAsked if the federal government took into consideration Nigerians doing business on Twitter, the minister stated that it is because there is a country called Nigeria that people can do business on any platform.\n\nAsked why the federal government waited for the president\u2019s tweet to be deleted before the suspension even though the government knew all along that IPOB has been using the Twitter platform, Mohammed spoke of the federal government\u2019s efforts to rid Nigeria of fake news and disinformation, which started in 2017.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhen we organised a national council on information in Jos, Plateau State, to address the issue of fake news and disinformation, there we said that the next war would be caused by fake news.\n\nHow prophetic we were! In 2018, we started an advocacy programme whereby we went from one media house to the other, seeking their support in weeding out fake news. Some supported us, some did not. When we were convinced that they were not going to listen, we said that we were going to regulate social media. We wrote to the NUJ; we wrote to the Guild of Editors. They snubbed us.\u201d\n\nECOWAS Court Stops FG from Prosecuting Twitter Users\n\nMeanwhile, the ECOWAS Court of Justice in Abuja has restrained the federal government from imposing sanctions, or doing anything whatsoever to arrest or prosecute any Nigerian and media houses using Twitter, pending the hearing and determination of a suit before it.\n\nThe court gave the order after hearing arguments from solicitor to Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP), Mr. Femi Falana (SAN), and lawyer to the government, Mr. Maimuna Shiru, following a suit filed on June 8 against the government by SERAP and 176 concerned Nigerians.\n\nThe court said: \u201cThe court has listened very well to the objection by Nigeria. The court has this to say. Any interference with Twitter is viewed as interference with human rights, and that will violate human rights. Therefore, this court has jurisdiction to hear the case. The court also hereby orders that the application be heard expeditiously. The Nigerian government must take immediate steps to implement the order.\u201d\n\nReacting to the ruling, Falana said the intervention of the ECOWAS Court was a timely relief for Nigerians using Twitter who had been threatened with prosecution.\n\nHe said: \u201cContrary to the assurance credited to the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice Mr. Abubakar Malami (SAN), that violators of Twitter would not be prosecuted, the federal government filed processes in the ECOWAS Court threatening to prosecute Nigerians using Twitter for violating the suspension under the provisions of the Penal Code relating to sedition.\n\n\u201cIt is extremely embarrassing that the federal government could threaten to jail Nigerians for sedition, which was annulled by the Court of Appeal in 1983, in the case of Arthur Nwankwo vs The State.\u201d\n\nThe substantive suit has been adjourned till July 6 for hearing.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Extra expenditure to cover COVlD-19 vaccine programme, procurement of military equipment\n\nDeji Elumoye and Juliet Akoje\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has transmitted a 2021 Supplementary Appropriation Bill of N895.842 billion to the Senate for passage into law.\n\nThe Federal Executive Council (FEC) at its virtual meeting last Wednesday in Abuja had approved the supplementary appropriation bill for onward transmission to the National Assembly for approval.\n\nThe bill was transmitted via a letter dated 15th June 2021, and addressed to the President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan.\n\nBuhari, in the letter which was read yesterday at plenary said the amount captured in the bill was proposed to fund the COVID-19 vaccine programme.\n\nHe added that part of the supplementary budget would be used to also fund health-related expenditures for the treatment of additional 50,000 patients under Nigeria Comprehensive AIDS Programme in states and to procure additional equipment to tackle security challenges nationwide.\n\nAccording to the president, the supplementary budget will be funded through facilities sourced from the World Bank and available new facilities.\n\nBuhari said the supplementary budget was promoted by the need to make provision for procurement and administration of COVlD-19 vaccines.\n\n\u201cThe availability of COVlD-19 vaccines and the procurement terms were still uncertain as at the time of finalising the 2021 budget. Hence, there was no provision in the 2021 Appropriation Act for the procurement and administration of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n\u201cHowever, the Federal Ministry of Health and the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency (NPHCDA) has now developed a COVID-19 vaccine programme for the country. Under the vaccine programme, 70% of eligible Nigerians are to be vaccinated between 2021 and 2022.\n\n\u201cIn addition, our security and law enforcement agencies urgently need to procure additional equipment and other resources in response to the prevalent security challenges across the country.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Defence has carefully scrutinised these procurement needs, which the military authorities claim to represent the minimum requirements to secure our country and address current external and internal security challenges,\u201d he added.\n\nPart of the funds required will also be used to meet the federal government\u2019s commitment to treat additional 50,000 patients under the Nigeria Comprehensive AIDS Programme in States (NCAPS), due to the reduction in the amount provisioned in 2021 Appropriation Bill by the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cIn order to address the urgent problem of oxygen availability in the country and avoid the potential loss of lives, provision was made for the procurement and installation of new oxygen plants nationwide and repairs of oxygen plants in FCT hospitals.\n\n\u201cIt is also necessary to provide additional funds for public service wage adjustment to cater for sundry wage-related issues in the health and other sectors, which if not resolved can add to the prevalent sense of instability in the polity,\u201d Buhari stated.\n\nOf the N895,842,465,917 proposed, N45.63 billion is for the COVlD-19 vaccine programme, which will be sourced from existing World Bank loans and other grants totalling US$113.22 million.\n\nBuhari said: \u201cThe balance of N37.93 billion required for COVlD-19 vaccines, salaries and other health-related expenditures totalling N41.69 billion and the N48.20 billion recurrent components of defence/security expenditure will be funded by drawing N135 billion from some Special Reserve/Levy Accounts, which will be captured as revenues to the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN).\n\n\u201cWe propose to fund the balance of N722.40 billion for capital expenditure on defence/security and capital supplementation from new borrowings, in the absence of any supplementary revenue sources.\n\n\u201cUnderstandably, needs currently abound in many other sectors. However, we have limited the supplementary budget proposal to just these critical and emerging areas of need due to our severe fiscal constraints.\n\n\u201cAll other needs would be deferred to the 2022 budget, which we plan to present in September of this year.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

But I can tell you that it was between the 20th and 24th that we had to do all the cases,\u201d he had noted.\n\nAfterwards, Obafunwa had also explained the findings of the autopsy for each body.\n\nAccording to him, the first person was brought in from Lekki bridge, and was discovered to have suffered laceration on a side of his skull, but died as a result of bleeding on his \u201cchest cavity and \u201cblunt force trauma to the chest\u201d.\n\nObafunwa explained that the second male was declared dead in the early hours of October 21, after suffering an open skull fracture, but the pathologist added that there was no sign of gunshot injury.\n\nHe said the second body showed signs of having suffered hypertension, as well as rib fracture, but noted that the cause of death was \u201cskull and brain injury which was due to blunt force trauma\u201d.\n\nFor the third body, the pathologist said examination revealed that the person died of severe blood loss as a result of complications suffered, following a gunshot injury.\n\nAfter giving his testimony, Obafunwa was asked to appear again before the panel on June 19 with reports on the 96 remaining bodies.",

          "title": "ANALYSIS: How misinformation \u2018fuelled\u2019 second wave of COVID-19 spread in Nigeria",
          "text": "Being a novel virus, the arrival of COVID-19 in Nigeria on February 27, 2020, elicited mixed reactions. For some, the infection was more or less as potent as malaria which can be treated with the use of over-the-counter drugs. For others, it was a deadly infection; hence the need for precautionary steps to guard against it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was widely-circulated misinformation concerning the infection. Myths were circulated on social media platforms and instant messengers. Among the myths circulated include a claim that the hot weather in the country suppresses the virus. Also, some said the infection was not an \u201dAfrican disease\u201d because of the higher number of cases and casualties recorded in Western countries. According to the circulated claim, the hot temperature in Africa worked against COVID-19 by limiting its spread, but other countries with cold temperature are more susceptible.\n\nIn a vox pop by LegitNG, some respondents said they were not afraid of the virus because they believed it had a very low chance of survival in the country\u2019s hot weather. Others said they relied on herbal concoctions to fight the infection.\n\nCOVID-19: THE MISCONCEPTION ABOUT HOT WEATHER\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a research study conducted by NOI Polls in March 2020, the results showed that 26 percent of Nigerians believed they were immune to COVID-19. While 40 percent said it was because they are \u2018children of God\u2019, 30 percent ascribed their immunity to strong genes. The country\u2019s weather, 17 percent said, is too hot for COVID-19 to survive, while 8 percent said the strong herbs they drink could deal with the virus and 5 percent were of the opinion that it was a foreign disease.\n\nAdeola Fowotade, a clinical virologist at the College of Medicine, University of Ibadan, also claimed the hot weather in the country could suppress COVID-19, adding that the infection was most prevalent in temperate climates during winter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat is an extrapolation from what happened with influenza virus also known as the flu, which is most prevalent in colder climate during winter. We believe that if COVID-19 is a Respiratory Tract Infection, probably it will follow the same pattern,\u201d Fowotade said.\n\n\u201cThere is a very high chance there will be some remission as temperature gets warmer in those temperate places. But for us with tropical climate, we believe that this outbreak might not go on for too long and might abate very soon.\n\n\u201cThis is because the droplets generated by the virus cannot travel far and this virus is an envelope virus. Envelop viruses are very susceptible and cannot survive very long in hot climate.\u201d\n\nJeremy Brown, a public health expert with George Washington University, noted that warmer weather may curb the spread of the infection. Corroborating this, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, under the administration of former President Donald Trump, issued a report that hot temperatures could slow down COVID-19 spread.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, other academic studies have dispelled the claim that hot weather has a role to play in checking the spread of the infection. Researchers at the University of Texas revealed that the impact of weather on the virus is insignificant.\n\n\u201cThe effect of weather is low and other features such as mobility have more impact than weather. In terms of relative importance, weather is one of the last parameters,\u201d Dev Niyogi, professor and lead researcher at the University of Texas, said.\n\nFor Kano, one of the states with hot temperature in Nigeria, the infection claimed many lives. In April, 979 residents died in eight municipalities of the state with 43 deaths recorded daily. Osagie Ehanire, minister of health, said more than 50 percent of the strange deaths in Kano were due to COVID-19.\n\nSome countries with hot weather, like India, are currently battling severe cases of the coronavirus infection. In March, climate scientists including the India Meteorological Department predicted that the country would experience hotter weather and intense heatwave during most parts of the year. Yet, the hot temperature has not kept the country\u2019s rising COVID-19 infections on the low as the virus keeps mutating.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn April, India recorded more than 300,000 cases of COVID-19 \u2014 the highest single-day tally in the world. A month later, the Asian country recorded 401,229 new coronavirus infections in one day \u2014 with a single-day fatality count of 4,191 deaths.\n\nCurrently, India is the second country in the world with the highest rate of coronavirus infections \u2014 with about 29 million infected and 349,229 dead.\n\nVERIFYING THE CLAIM\n\nDespite the divergent claims, renowned global and local health organisations have said weather has no prominent role in suppressing the virus.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) said though temperature and humidity may influence how long the virus survives outside the human body, it has no influence in slowing down the spread.\n\n\u201cNo. There is currently no conclusive evidence that either weather (short term variations in meteorological conditions) or climate (long-term averages) have a strong influence on transmission. The SARS-CoV-2 virus which causes COVID-19 disease has been transmitted in all regions of the world, from cold and dry, to hot and humid climates,\u201d WHO said in reaction to the widespread misinformation.\n\nIn May 2020, Nigeria\u2019s presidential task force (PTF) on COVID-19 said the claim about the role of weather as regards the infection has no scientific backing. As of that time, Nigeria had recorded thousands of COVID-19 infections and fatalities, including the death of prominent figures like Abba Kyari, chief of staff to the president; Abiola Ajimobi, former governor of Oyo state; Buruji Kashamu, former senator from Ogun state; Suleiman Achimugu, former managing director of the Pipelines and Products Marketing Company (PPMC), a subsidiary of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), and Wahab Adegbenro, then commissioner of health in Ondo state.\n\n\u201cThe first one has to do with climate: Hot climate prevents the spread of COVID-19. No matter how sunny or humid the weather is, anybody can get COVID-19. Nigeria has recorded a total of almost 5,000 cases to date irrespective of the fact that we are actually a hot country,\u201d Sani Aliyu, the PTF national coordinator, said.\n\n\u201cThere is also no scientific evidence to show that coronavirus cannot survive hot weather. The best way to protect ourselves against COVID-19 is maintaining physical distancing, washing our hands, use of face masks, etc.\u201d\n\nThe Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) had said based on available evidence, \u201cthe virus causing COVID-19 can be transmitted in ALL AREAS, including areas with hot and humid weather\u201d.\n\nTHE BREACH OF COVID PROTOCOL AND SECOND WAVE OF INFECTIONS\n\nDespite the set of guidelines published by the federal government to contain the spread of the infections and its devastating effects on the population, Nigerians continued to flout the directives.\n\nPassengers were packed in public buses; markets were crowded with no recourse to social distancing. Worshipers trooped to religious centres en masse without face masks. Some travellers who came into the country from nations with high infection rates disregarded self-isolation. Social events were held with many people in attendance and huge crowds were also present at political events.\n\nThe negligence and disregard for safety precautions contributed to the second wave of COVID-19 spread in Nigeria.\n\nBy December 2020, the presidential task force said Nigeria was experiencing a second wave of infections. Two weeks later, Nigeria recorded six deaths within 24 hours \u2014 owing to complications from the infection. In January, more deaths were recorded. Official data indicate that one in five persons tested for COVID-19 in the country turned positive.\n\nAs of June 17, the country recorded 167,103 infections \u2014 with 163,528 discharged patients and 2,117 deaths. The daily infection figure has, however, dropped significantly as the country keeps vaccinating its citizens against the disease. According to the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), 1,981,091 people have taken the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine as of June 16.\n\nThis report was produced as part of the Africa Resilience Network (ARN) programme with support from the Institute for War and Peace Reporting (IWPR), in partnership with the Centre for Information Resilience (CIR), the International Centre for Investigative Reporting (ICIR) and Africa Uncensored.",

          "title": "SEC approves Chaka as first licensed stock trading app in Nigeria",
          "text": "After months of uncertainty regarding regulations, Chaka has received a license from Nigeria\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to operate its digital platform for buying and selling stocks.\n\nChaka becomes the first to acquire the digital sub-broker license introduced by SEC in April of this year. As part of a major amendment to its Consolidated Rules and Regulations, SEC recognised sub-brokers who use digital platforms to serve multiple brokers.\n\nTosin Osibodu, the startup\u2019s CEO, said on a call on Wednesday that the acquisition took \u201ca tremendous amount of effort\u201d and is the fruit of frequent engagement with the capital markets regulator.\n\nOn the 19th of December 2020, the SEC published a statement that effectively barred Chaka from offering its services in Nigeria. SEC\u2019s complaint was that Chaka operated \u201coutside the regulatory purview of the Commission and without requisite registration, as stipulated by the Investment and Securities Act 2007.\u201d\n\nSEC ordered Chaka to stop advertising to users, justifying it as a need to prevent \u201cunscrupulous actors\u201d from harming the investing public. Though the order was particular to Chaka, it was the first major signal that regulation was coming to the investment-tech sector.\n\nThat December warning enabled Chaka to take the lead and open talks with the SEC. With the license now acquired, Osibodu says it affirms Chaka\u2019s commitment to full regulatory compliance and provides clarity to the market.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve built a great relationship [with SEC] that we think will be beneficial for the whole ecosystem moving forward,\u201d Osibodu said.\n\nHe said the license also means Chaka could now enable other stockbroking firms who want to have a digital presence. \u201cWe want this benefit to accrue to as many stockbrokers as possible.\u201d\n\nUntil now, Chaka\u2019s operations were based on a partnership with Citi Investment Capital Ltd, a Lagos-based broker licensed by the SEC. An official license now places the startup directly under SEC\u2019s supervision.\n\nChaka\u2019s app hosts over 4,000 stocks from publicly traded companies in Nigeria and the US. Founded in January 2019 by Osibodu with Olaolu Ajose as the chief technology officer, the startup bills itself as an \u201cinvestment passport\u201d which powers borderless investing for users.\n\nAnyone with an internet-enabled smartphone can download the app, sign up and begin investing with $2 or \u20a61,000. Chaka is only available in Nigeria at the moment.\n\nOsibodu did not specify what Chaka did, in terms of fees or filings, to receive the license.\n\nBut according to the SEC\u2019s recent amendment (pdf, page 3), a sub-broker license for digital platforms involves a minimum capital of \u20a610 million and a Fidelity Bond covering at least 20% of the minimum capital.\n\nOther requirements include four separate fees totalling \u20a6500,000, a number of SEC forms, company documents and other documentation about people involved with the company.\n\nDigital sub-brokers are also required to fully describe the technology that their infrastructure is built on, including details about security, backup and recovery processes.\n\nThey should have adequate Know Your Customer processes and have documented policies for managing technology risks. Also, they are expected to show how they assess the capacity of potential customers to use its platform for transactions, plus clear explanations of the features, risks, responsibilities, obligations and liabilities that come with using the app.\n\nIt is not clear if this license officially permits Chaka (and other fintechs in the sector) to offer stocks listed in foreign markets \u2013 like Tesla and Google \u2013 to Nigerians. In April, SEC sounded a warning that seemed to declare such offerings as being illegal.\n\nOsibodu\u2019s coy response was that Chaka is committed to SEC\u2019s objectives for financial inclusion in Nigeria by, among other things, increasing retail investor participation in the financial markets.\n\n.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "From Konga to mPharma, logistics for health products is growing in Africa",
          "text": "\u201cPeople order drugs on Jumia?\u201d\n\nThat was the reaction from the most ardent online shopper I know. She buys running shoes, mom jeans and hair products but doesn\u2019t understand why anyone would buy drugs online. It just doesn\u2019t feel right for her to buy ingestible medicines on the same website she shops for underwear.\n\nBut a search under Jumia\u2019s \u2018medications & treatments\u2019 tab reveals syrups, nasal sprays, and pain relief capsules. At the bottom of their healthcare page, a blurb assures visitors that products listed on the website are from \u201cvarious trusted brands that will meet your health needs.\u201d\n\nIndeed, African e-commerce marketplaces are venturing into the delivery of health care products as part of a strategy to broaden their value to customers.\n\nThese platforms are part of a broader crop of innovators at an interesting intersection of healthcare and logistics on the continent. Going by recent data, this sub-sector has grown over two years.\n\nAt least 61 companies are using tech for health distribution across sub-saharan Africa, a growth of over 100% in the number of active players (28) captured in 2018. That\u2019s according to a report by Salient Advisory, an Africa-focused healthcare consultancy.\n\nThese health logistics companies include e-commerce players like Jumia, Copia and Konga, and also core health startups like mPharma, Lifestores Pharmacy, Chekkit and Sproxil. Salient\u2019s report focuses on companies delivering over-the-counter products, hence it does not include LifeBank which specializes in blood and oxygen products.\n\nMost of these companies are in Nigeria, Ghana and Uganda, with only 6 spotted in the francophone region. 31% of the companies surveyed were founded within the last two years and 62% operate in a single African country.\n\nSnapshot of innovators in the health products distribution space in Africa. Source: Salient Advisory.\n\nSalient categorizes the landscape of companies into three groups by the type of service they deliver: consumer-facing companies, producer-facing companies and product data companies.\n\nThe first group of companies (like Drugstore.ng) deliver over-the-counter and prescription drugs as well as virtual patient care to individuals. Provider-facing ones serve healthcare businesses either by delivering to them, hosting an online marketplace, providing inventory management tools (an example here is Lifestores Pharmacy) and/or offering financing.\n\nThe third group offers data related services like product analytics and drug authenticity verification. An example in this category is Chekkit, a verification technology startup that was recently accepted into Google for Startups accelerator programme for 2021.\n\nTraditional e-commerce platforms like Jumia, Copia and Konga are able to play in the consumer and provider-facing buckets. Because of their presence in multiple African countries, all three companies surpass the combined reach of other direct-to-consumer startups in the health product distribution space.\n\n\u201cWhat they are doing can accelerate access to medicines and have an incredible impact on public health,\u201d says Yomi Kazeem, one of the authors of Salient Advisory\u2019s report.\n\nAccording to Konga\u2019s co-CEO Nick Imudia, the e-commerce company\u2019s plan to deliver health products started shortly after they were acquired by the Zinox Group three years ago.\n\n\u201cWe started building warehouses and logistics assets to enable us to reach every local government area in the country,\u201d Imudia says to TechCabal.\n\nKonga.com is a marketplace where pharmaceutical companies can list health products like medicines. Konga delivers orders from those pharmacies to individual consumers.\n\nBut beyond fulfilling orders to individuals, Konga plans to go bigger by working on bulk orders between pharmacies and businesses or government agencies, Imudia says. That will require some investments on infrastructure for cold distribution and ensuring warehouses are of the right temperature.\n\nSalient Advisory\u2019s report notes that \u201cclear and harmonised regulations\u201d could boost this entry of e-commerce players into the health products distribution space.\n\nKonga has two licenses to directly distribute products for drug manufacturers and import drugs from the Pharmaceutical Council of Nigeria, Imudia says. But he clarifies that Konga will not act as a pharmacy by selling drugs directly to consumers \u2013 but will rely on its marketplace platform that allows merchants to sell on Konga.com\n\nHow big can this new business line be for Konga? Imudia declines to share what health products logistics currently contributes to Konga\u2019s overall business. But he believes it will be \u201ca major part\u201d of Konga\u2019s business in the future.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "A Nigerian-Taiwanese couple, on their love for online gaming",
          "text": "In Hero Mode, all Troy wants is to work at Playfield, his mom\u2019s 12-year-old gaming company. But she insists he focus on a dull computer science course at school. The real reason, however, is that she wants him to have a \u201cnormal\u201d childhood away from video games.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem: Playfield is sinking. Their only potential angel investor bailed because their latest game sucked. A cheap buy offer from a rival is on the table.\n\nBut Troy convinces his mom to let him rebuild the game. He adds a rainbow that talks and a Barack Obama feature. And the rest is\u2026 actually, go watch the rest.\n\nReal life Troy stories are rare in Nigeria but an active gaming community is growing. Platforms like Twitch and Discord are spurring a global gaming economy and a means for financial independence for young Nigerians \u2013 like Olaide and Ying-Yi Akanji.\n\nThey met in 2012 at a GCE exam hall. When they started dating, Olaide introduced Ying-Yi (who is half-Nigerian, half-Taiwanese) to online gaming. Now married, they are an ardent gaming couple.\n\nWhile speaking with them on Tech Republic \u2013 a weekly radio show produced by 88.5 UFM Lagos in collaboration with TechCabal \u2013 I felt nudged to pick a controller and earn some recharge card money, at least. But how does a rusty Millennial get started?\n\nBelow is an excerpt of the chat with the Akanji\u2019s, edited for clarity. Most questions are from Tech Republic hosts Jay and Didi.\n\nJay: What\u2019s the situation with gaming in Nigeria?\n\nOlaide: I have been playing video games since I was a kid. My first Playstation 2 was from my dad. I became very good at gaming but I felt it couldn\u2019t take me anywhere because our 300kbps internet was so bad. Playing online was just impossible.\n\nThen I moved to the UK to study software engineering and everything was better. I dived into e-sports and built a following on Twitch. But I was not comfortable with a foreign audience. Gaming was more fun when I moved back. I could chat and banter on my streams in Pidgin and Yoruba.\n\nBut then came the issues \u2013 internet and electricity. It was demotivating to the point where I almost quit. The main problem was ping \u2013 a measure of how fast you get responses when you click to pass or shoot or any other action.\n\nOur problem here is that when you click on a button for any of those actions, it needs to travel to a server in Europe before it returns to Nigeria. And if you are playing against someone in Europe, their ping is much faster. I may shoot him first but it may not get to him when I do; then he shoots a second later and wins. That\u2019s why you have not seen Nigerians breakthrough internationally.\n\nDidi: Okay, how do I get into gaming? Can I start now even if I didn\u2019t play as a kid?\n\nOlaide: Yes you can! That\u2019s what I love about gaming. When people tell me they don\u2019t like video games, I say you haven\u2019t tried it out. There are so many games out there, it\u2019s impossible for you to hate them all.\n\nA 16-year-old kid won $3million playing Fortnite in 2019 and I actually played in that tournament. I made it into the top 1,000 from the initial 80 million people. The top 100 played in the finals in the US.\n\nBut that prize money shows how this sport has grown. I think the biggest prize money ever won in Nigeria was around \u20a65million.\n\nJay: This is really an untapped market in Nigeria\n\nOlaide: Oh my God, there\u2019s so much potential. I\u2019ve had many conversations with companies that want to get into online gaming but they fear the risks. And it\u2019s understandable because you need 24/7 electricity.\n\nI\u2019ve heard stories about NEPA taking power in the middle of a tournament. It\u2019s painful. When we compete against South Africans, they win because their internet is better.\n\nStill, the Nigerian gaming community is growing.\n\nDidi: How many female gamers are in Nigeria?\n\nYing-Yi: We have quite a few, but the gaming scene is saturated with guys. Girls in Nigeria have less time to play video games because they are more likely to do house chores, while guys can keep playing. Women gamers have to put in more effort. That means we are not a lot but we are getting there.\n\nParents also need to understand that gaming helps to improve cognitive reasoning of both boys and girls. Yes it can be sedentary but parents can set the balance between gaming and other activities.\n\nAlexander: So how do you pitch online gaming to people in government, as something good for the digital economy?\n\nOlaide: People are investing in electronic sports (esports) because every competition provides a level playing field for amateur and expert gamers. No connections needed.\n\nAnybody can buy a console, start playing and competing. Gamers like TimTheTatman are terrible at gaming but make millions because they make entertaining gaming videos. That opportunity should be open to all Nigerian youth looking for jobs and alternative income streams.\n\n\u2014\n\nListen to Tech Republic every Thursday at 2pm WAT on 88.5 UFM Lagos.

          "title": "How to avoid investment scams in Nigeria",
          "text": "\u201cDo you want to double your money in 10 days?\u201d\n\nInvestment scams tend to start off the same way.\n\nWhether it\u2019s a social media advert or a video of a celebrity telling you that an \u2018investment platform\u2019 made them millionaires overnight.\n\nThey all echo an alarming promise: \u201cgive us your money and we will give you more returns than you\u2019ve ever seen in the market \u2013 oh and did we mention your money is sure to come back to you?\u201d\n\nThese offers always seem too good to be true. And they usually are.\n\nOver the past few weeks, two different scams have been uncovered in Nigeria. Insha-Allahu Investment is the latest of them.\n\nWith a business name that roughly translates to \u2018If God Wills\u2019, the company\u2019s CEO is currently on the run after promising investors up to 20% Return on Investment (ROI) in two months. Many of the investors put in their life savings and in one case, their inheritance in a bid to multiply their money.\n\nInvestment is not a get-rich-quick scheme. It requires work. The work on your part as the investor is to perform due diligence and ensure your money is going to the right place.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that many more investment scams will continue to spring up. Days after Brisk Capital\u2019s CEO was arrested for fraud, a tweet featuring a popular celebrity made the rounds.\n\nThe power to become a millionaire is in your hands. Start your journey to become a millionaire today by Joining the great @mcivip known as Millionaire Club where you can invest and earn big.\n\n\n\nOfficial website: https://t.co/HMfsRY9aCspic.twitter.com/i0gqGXYzjJ \u2014 Instablog9ja (@instablog9ja) May 28, 2021\n\nIn it, the actor claimed that the company, Millionaires Club Investment, would give you 50% ROI (Return on Investment) in 3 days.\n\n\u201cOkay, but how?\u201d\n\nThis is a question that should follow every claim of returns. If a company tells you they plan to give you 30% of your money back in say, a month as Brisk Capital did, it\u2019s important to ask for details of how exactly they plan on making those returns.\n\nI spoke to Adedayo Bakare, COO of Money Africa and Oluwatomi Solanke, CEO of Trove Finance to get an idea of how to gauge if a deal is too good to be true.\n\nThey both agree that there is a relative benchmark to employ when discussing investments in the country \u2013 it\u2019s called the MPR (Monetary Policy Rate) \u2013 it\u2019s usually around the price of most of the government\u2019s debt instruments \u2013 like bonds and treasury bills.\n\nAs of March 2021, the MPR for Nigeria was 11.5% per year. To find out how much that is monthly, we just need to divide by 12 and we have roughly 0.96% per month.\n\nSo as a rule of thumb, if you have any \u2018investment platform\u2019 offering you significantly more than 0.96% ROI per month then you should proceed with caution. If they\u2019re offering less, then you shouldn\u2019t bother with them at all because you could get more by buying debt instruments directly from the government.\n\nInvestment is, by nature, risky. Legitimate investment platforms are usually keen to inform you of the risks involved when you\u2019re putting your money with them. If a person is promising you 30% monthly and telling you it is low-risk then they are already lying to you and you should not bother doing business with them.\n\nThis is the first step in finding out if an \u2018investment opportunity\u2019 is a scam \u2013 investigate their ROI claims and how they intend to turn them into a reality.\n\nIf a company tells you they are investing in the stock market \u2013 which admittedly can give you high returns \u2013 you must be aware of the risks. The market is volatile and can move up or down very quickly.\n\nIf they say they are investing in real estate then, as an investor, the onus is on you to ask questions about the real estate offerings. Are they selling land? Renting out buildings? How exactly are they able to make that much money from renting or selling land within a short time frame.\n\nIf you find that a company\u2019s explanation for the \u2018how?\u2019 is satisfactory, then you should go on to the next item on our checklist: Regulation.\n\n\u201cAnd you are licensed by\u2026?\u201d\n\nThis is probably one of the most essential checks you must perform before you hand over funds to an investment company.\n\nIt is not enough that a company is \u2018registered\u2019 as a business. Any street-smart hustler can register a business.\n\nAn investment platform you are considering must be either: registered with the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), licensed by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), or be affiliated with a company that is licensed by the SEC or the CBN.\n\nA company claiming to be a financial services company of any kind that has no connection to the SEC or CBN is one to approach with extreme caution.\n\nTo be extra sure, when a company tells you they are licensed with the SEC or gives you their affiliate company (or trustee), you can click here to confirm their eligibility.\n\n\u201cWho did you say you were again?\u201d\n\nContinue your due diligence by looking into the company\u2019s track record.\n\nIt is important to find out what credentials the owners or managers of these companies have. In the case of Dominic Joshua, a quick search would have raised some doubt about the veracity of a 21-year-old investment wunderkind with no real track record.\n\nThis step is especially important when you speak with referees or the company\u2019s brand ambassadors. You shouldn\u2019t put your money into a company just because a friend or family member told you it was great.\n\nYou should also check the company\u2019s track record and find out if fraud allegations have been levelled against its founders, senior leaders, or board members.\n\nPlatforms like ours, Nairaland and even Facebook have been around long enough to have picked up news on all kinds of scams and their perpetrators. It would be good to search for the names of those people and companies and see what comes up.\n\nFinally, making wise and well-informed investment decisions is a great idea but the journey to financial freedom is no walk in the park and requires careful research.\n\nSo the next time you or a loved one are faced with a new \u2018investment opportunity,\u2019 we recommend you share this article with them.\n\n*This is not investment advice\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

We also know that some brought their private jets under a temporary import certificate, which has expired and not renewed. These are infractions.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the verification, some of the things we want to expose will come to light. We will make our findings known on July 6 after the expiration of the 30-day grace window. Those in default risk detention of their aircraft as nobody is above the law.\u201d\n\nAttah added that the Customs management believes that owners of private aircraft are highly placed individuals who would be willing to comply with extant laws governing the importation of the aircraft they own; including payments of all appropriate duties and taxes.\n\n\u201cAs an agency of government responsible for enforcement of laws governing imports and exports in Nigeria, NCS will not hesitate to invoke appropriate sanctions on any defaulting private aircraft owner immediately after the expiration of the verification period on Tuesday 6th July, 2021.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, private aircrafts owners or their representatives are to report to room 305, Tariff & Trade Departments, Nigeria Customs Service headquarters, Abuja, from 10am to 5pm. Between Monday 7th June to Tuesday 6th July, 2021\u201d, Attah explained.\n\nHe added that the required documents for verification are; Aircraft Certificate of Registration; NCAA\u2019S Flight Operations Compliance Certificate; NCAA\u2019S Maintenance Compliance Certificate; NCAA\u2019S Permit for non- Commercial Flights; and Temporary Import Permit where applicable.\n\nThe Customs Spokesman emphasized that the ongoing verification was not intended to inconvenience any owner of a private aircraft, as such individuals or representatives can come with the documents for verification.\n\n...",

          "text": "A self-styled Yoruba activist, Sunday Adeyemo, also known as Sunday Igboho, has announced his plan to lead a \u2018Yoruba Nation\u2019 protest in Lagos.\n\nMr Igboho said the rally would hold on July 3 at Freedom Park in Ojota. The proposed rally was announced through the acclaimed activist\u2019s spokesperson, Olayomi Koiki, on Facebook.\n\n\u201cWe are sending a peaceful message to Governor Sanwo-Olu. We do not mind any other person who is saying we should not come to Lagos. Sanwo-Olu is the chief security officer of the land and we are coming to Lagos.\n\n\u201cJuly 3rd is the most important date; nobody cannot say we should not come to Lagos. It is a peaceful rally.\u201d\n\nPREMIUM TIMES in the past reported that Mr Igboho\u2019s rally had taken place in Ogun, Ondo, Osun, Ekiti and Oyo States. In some cases, police forcefully dispersed the agitators.\n\nThe Lagos police spokesperson, Muyiwa Adejobi, said he is not aware of the rally.\n\n\u201cI am not aware of Sunday Igboho\u2019s planned Lagos rally. When the command is aware, the command will react to that. For now, we are not aware of that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018Shelve your rally\u2019\n\nBut the All Progressives Congress (APC), UK Chapter, has urged Mr Igboho, to shelve the rally. The group, in a statement by its chairman, Phillip Idaewor, argued that the rally might be hijacked by hoodlums to unleash terror on Lagos residents.\n\n\u201cWe are not opposed to the ideas of making Nigeria work better for the many and not the few,\u201d the group said in a statement.\n\n\u201cIndeed, our party promised restructuring of Nigeria in our manifesto and it is our view that this remains the best course of action to reclaim the narrative from citizens who now feel alienated both from the government and country.\n\n\u201cConsidering the state of insecurity that the government is battling across the country, we feel that the rally is ill-timed.\n\n\u201cNo doubt, people have rights all over the world to peaceful protests but the situation in the country is such that all efforts must be geared to stop any gathering or association that may further worsen the security situation in the country.\n\n\u201cWe urge Yoruba youths and supporters of Ighoho to encourage him to pull back on this mission as it may lead to loss of lives and destruction of property. Our main concern is about our Lagos,\u201d part of the group\u2019s statement read.\n\n\u201cWe believe in one Nigeria and we must not allow those calling for its breakup to tear us apart irrespective of challenges currently faced by the nation. This is the historical beckoning to Nigerians to keep working hard towards a united country.\n\n\u201cAs diaspora Nigerians, we know from the experience of mixing with people from around the world, that Africa more than ever before, needs Nigeria to become a strong, stable and prosperous country.\u201d\n\nYoruba Nation agitation is a political ideology to realise the independence and sovereign country for the Yoruba race in Nigeria but many political leaders in the region have rejected and kicked against the idea.\n\nFormer Governor of Lagos, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, alongside Speaker of the House of Representatives Femi Gbajabiamila, Bisi Akande and all leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the South-West, in a meeting in Lagos last month, strongly opposed the agitation.\n\nThey called for ethnic and religious unity instead of a divided nation.\n\nADVERTISEMENT",

          "text": "Tunde Opalana, Abuja\n\nThe Senate has ordered a hike in importation duties on syringes and needles into the country and therefore recommended 75 percent port duties.\n\nThis is as the upper chamber mandated full implementation of the policy on usage of locally manufactured syringes and needles by federal government owned hospitals and health institutions across the country.\n\nThe two directives were meant to protect local manufacturers, give them enabling environment to contribute to the revenue base of the nation and to reduce unemployment.\n\nThese mandatory recommendations followed the consideration and approval of the reports of the Senate Committee on Health presented by chairman, Sen. Yahaya Oloriegbe (Kwara Central).\n\nAccording to the chairman, the committee discovered that majority of the imported syringes and needles are substandard, unsterile (used and rewashed syringes from Asian continent) hence endangering the lives, health and safety of Nigerians.\n\nHe said \u201cdespite several policies of the Federal Government especially the introduction of 75% import duties on imported Syringes and Needles to deter importation, the Nigeria Customs Services has not been able to enforce this effectively, thereby leading to mass importation of cheap, substandard and\n\nunsterile syringes and needles.\n\n\u201cImportation of syringes and needles is killing local manufacturers making them to lay off staff and preventing them from contributing effectively to the economy.\n\n\u201cNAFDAC regulates seven (7) products including Syringes and Needles. NAFDAC has a 5+5 policy which means at the end of 5 years the importer must migrate from importation to manufacturing. This policy is just 2 years in operation hence it has not been applied to this sector.\n\n\u201d The Federal Ministry of Health lacks policy on the procurement and utilization of Syringes and Needles by government-owned Hospitals and agencies. This has led to government-owned hospitals to sometimes procure and use substandard Syringes and Needles in their hospitals and medical centres.\n\n\u201cCompulsory requirement for manufacturers to register to pre-qualify for the World Health Organisation\u2019s certification costs about $1.5bn. This has been an impediment to local manufacturers attaining this status and preventing their being patronized by organisations using donor funds\u201d.\n\nThe committee therefore recommended that \u201cthe Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment should finalise the process of approval of the Backward Integration Policy(BIP) (for the sector) by the Federal Executive Council and commence the implementation of the Policy by 1#t August 2021.\n\nThat \u201cas a matter of urgency, the Federal Government should fully implement 75% import duties on the Importation of syringes and needles and put stringent measures to the defaulters thereby encouraging local manufacturers and ensuring employment opportunities. Towards this end, the Nigeria Customs Services should enforce this policy.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Health should develop a policy on the procurement and utilization of Syringes and Needles by government hospitals and offices by 1st July 2021. That is within six (6) weeks all Federal Government owned hospitals are to use locally manufactured Syringes and Needles in order to strengthen local manufacturing.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Health should develop and implement a Policy Guideline that will ensure that all hospitals projects and programmes funded with the government of Nigeria\u2019s funds to procure and use Syringes and Needles approved by relevant Nigerian Regulatory Bodies without a requirement for World Health Organisation\u2019s pre-qualification.\n\nThe Senate also asked syringes and needles manufacturers to take the advantage of the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s Special Intervention Fund for the Health sector to improve and extend their capacities.\n\nRecalled that the Medical Device Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MDMAN), producers of syringes and needles sought the intervention of both the Senate Committee on Health and of Industry Trade and Investment on the implementation of exiting policies meant to protect local manufacturers.\n\nThe association in its petition, had alleged that government at all tiers were not patronizing local manufacturers but instead patronize foreign syringes and needles.\n\nPresident of the Medical Devices Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MEDMAN), Mr Akin Oyediran had during interface with the Senate committees and the Health minister, Dr. Osagie Ehanire and NAFDAC Director General, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye said the implementation of the policy would stop importation of low quality medical devices that may expose patients to health dangers.\n\nOyediran explained that the Backward Integration Policy (BIP) entails Nigerian manufacturers\u2019 right to produce syringes for local market and can import same to meet local demands if their factories could not produce enough quantity to satisfy local needs .\n\nREAD ALSO: Igala Will Not Be Part Of Biafra \u2013 Group Tells Nnamdi Kanu\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have the capacity to produce the required syringes and needles that we need in the country.\n\n\u201cOne of the manufacturers in Nigeria, the Jubilee Syringe of which I am the MD is the largest manufacturers of Syringes in Africa.\n\n\u201cThe local manufacturers are actually the highest supplies of syringes and needles for hospitals. There is no point in why government hospitals should use imported syringes when we have locally manufactured ones.",

          "text": "The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) said smugglers increased the daily consumption of subsidised petrol to 103 million litres per day in May.\n\nThe Group Managing Director (GMD), NNPC, Mele Kyari, made this known at stakeholders meeting organised by the corporation to discuss how best to stop smuggling in the country.\n\nKari said the current situation had kept the country in a state of bleeding, as it could not sustain the payment of subsidy that accompanies the volume, being spirited across the borders.\n\nHe said that the introduction of Operation White and involvement of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) had helped the situation.\n\n\u201cFrom the truck out report from the PPPRA data base , we have seen collapse of load out average move from 70 million litres to 60 million litres just in one month, that means we can do with less than 70 million, the balance, I don\u2019t know where it goes to but we know for sure that it is not consumed in this country .\n\n\u201cIn very recent data, we see what we really want in the beginning of May and June, there was a day we loaded out about 103 million litres of PMS within one day across the depots.\n\n\u201c We know it is not required, we know it is inappropriate and we also know that something wrong is happening that somebody is chasing something.\n\n\u201cBut we in NNPC, we are not in control of that, we are not in every depot, we don\u2019t keep products in all the depot but when the volume goes down, it comes down to us, when there is tight in supply, it comes back to the NNPC and we solve the problem,\u2019\u2019 he said\n\nHe said that President Muhammadu Buhari had directed that smuggling must stop adding that it was the reason for inviting all stakeholders to chart the way forward.\n\nHe said that the corporation had incorporated the EFCC, the Department of Security Services (DSS), the Nigeria Customs services (NCS), the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), on a platform to achieve this.\n\n\u201cMr President has directed us that we must stop smuggling or round tripping if there is anything like that, and so we must stop it by every means necessary, and we must do anything to stop it, that means we have to work outside the box.\n\n\u201c We know that there are layers of controls that have been there that is not working and that is why we must work outside the box.\n\n\u201cThat is why we are happy to drag in the EFCC, DSS, NSCDC, and even the NCS on a different platforms that will enable us to control this volume and we have seen it work,\u2019\u2019 he added\n\nCommenting on the current PMS and subsidy payment, Kyari explained that with the current exchange rate, the pump price of petrol should be N256 per litre.\n\n\u201cIf we are to sell at the market today at current exchange rate, we will be selling the product at about N256 to a litre. What we sell today is N162, so the difference is at a cost to the nation,\u2019\u2019 he said\n\nAccording to him, with the high volume of daily consumption, the country cannot sustain subsidy payment.\n\n\u201cAs long as we don\u2019t regulate volume, until we are able to exit this current level, which I know so much work is going on, then we have to manage the volume that we are exposed to between this price of N162 and N256.\n\n\u201cThe difference comes back to as much as N140 billion to N150 billion cost to the country monthly.\n\n\u201c As long as the volume goes up, that money continues to increase and we have two sets of stress to face, stress of supply and stress of foreign exchange for the NNPC. We may not see foreign exchange cheque taking place for importation,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nIn his remarks, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resource, Chief Timipre Sylva, said smuggling was not a business and would never be a business.\n\n\u201cI will like to put it on record that whatever we are trying to do in the area of deregulation will not make sense without us exactly knowing the actual consumption of PMS.\n\n\u201cWhen I first came in as minister, I was informed that the daily consumption in the country was around 60 to 62 million litres a day, which to me sounded a little bit outrageous considering the number of cars we have on the road .\n\n\u201cBut somehow, the figures, I understand today have come down to around 52 million litres, may be the number of vehicles have suddenly reduced, but you will agree with me that something is wrong that is why the tracking of trucks loading products is essential for us to move forward on this issue of subsidy removal,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nHe added that illegal export of products through the borders whether the land or sea must be stopped, adding that Operation White that was commissioned in 2020 had not worked effectively until the EFCC came into the picture.\n\n\u201cI believe that with the EFCC in the picture, I think that the system will work better and know that Petroleum Equalisation Fund, is also working on product tracking arrangement.\n\n\u201cFor me, I am happy to see that the EFCC is working with us and if we can get this right, I think our movement toward deregulation will be better assured,\u2019\u2019 he said\n\nAlso, the EFCC Chairman, Abdulrasheed Bawa, said the commission was happy to be part of Operation White since part of its duty was to ensure closure of financial crimes in the country.\n\n\u201cIt is quite disheartening to see what is happening. In 2012, we were faced with petroleum subsidy fraud, we at the EFCC were able to unravel a lot of fraud going on there.\n\n\u201cFrom volume falsification to alteration of bill of laden, to the non-payment of over recovery and to what I call single importation and double subsidy payment.\n\n\u201cWe are still trying to recover about N50 billion we have identified in the fraud but now it is a different ball game, NNPC has taking responsibility of importation of products but the issue of smuggling is there.\n\n\u201cWe are assuring Nigerians that anything we have to do to stop smuggling, we will do to ensure that perpetrators are brought to book and justice is met for the benefits of Nigerians,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the oil marketers and industry players present at the meeting pledged to support government to curb smuggling.

          "title": "EXPOSED: Buhari busted for financing Adamu Garba\u2019s Crowwe",
          "text": "The Buhari administration contributed startup cash to Adamu Garba\u2019s Crowwe social media platform, anticipating that the company would enable the government control internal narratives while also posing a serious challenge to Facebook and Twitter for the Nigerian audiences.\n\nMr Garba\u2019s IPI Solutions, a software engineering firm controlled by Mr Garba, was the beneficiary of a transfer of monies from the Central Bank of Nigeria to Mr Garba\u2019s IPI Solutions, according to bank documents obtained by The Gazette. Crowwe, a social media app, was created and launched by the company.\n\nThe CBN on May 21, 2019, transferred N136.8 million to Mr Garba\u2019s IPI Solutions, documents said, marking one of several transfers that our sources said the Buhari regime advanced to Mr Garba in the course of building the Crowwe app.\n\nAlthough a major beneficiary of the social media storm that weakened the Jonathan administration and amplified the opposition\u2019s messages ahead of the 2015 presidential election, Mr Buhari has relentlessly railed against the negative influence of social media since coming to power. After realising the enormous control that social media has in shaping public opinion, even amongst citizens with little education or financial ability to be on the Internet, Mr Buhari started introducing different tactics to regulate online speech.\n\nA few months after assuming office in 2015, members of his ruling APC pushed a so-called social media bill that civil liberties campaigners said was too offensive to be accepted in a democratic system. The bill was summarily defeated, but the government pushed at least two other similar bills, including one that proposed death penalty for online speech, that were defeated under the Bukola Saraki-led parliament.\n\nBut shortly after narrowly securing a second term, Mr Buhari agreed with his aides that it was necessary to control social media, according to sources familiar with the matter. Several ways to ensure that the government\u2019s message dominated the public space with little to no pushback from citizens were suggested.\n\n\u201cIt was while the government was trying to find ways to control the media space that Adamu Garba\u2019s company was picked as one of the promising businesses that could proffer solutions,\u201d an administration official said. \u201cThe seriousness of controlling social media cannot be overplayed.\u201d\n\nMr Garba earned instant name recognition in 2018 after showing interest in running for president against Mr Buhari. He summarily abandoned his campaign and became a recognisable voice in support of the president. The regime provided hundreds of millions to Mr Garba\u2019s firm in anticipation that its Crowwe platform would make a sufficient dent on the appeal of Facebook and Twitter, officials briefed on the matter said under our policy on anonymous sources.\n\nBut two years after funding began and several months after Crowwe was introduced to the public, the app has not appealed to Nigerians on the scale expected by both the regime and its developers. Only a few thousands users have signed up, and even then the app has been riddled with complaints around its functionality.\n\nAs part of efforts to give life to Crowwe, Mr Garba sought to push Twitter out of Nigeria, filing a lawsuit against the platform in the wake of last October\u2019s historic #EndSARS campaign. More than any other social media rivals, Mr Garba saw Twitter\u2019s presence in Nigeria as an existential threat to his own platform and assumed its exit would push Nigerians to his own platform by default.\n\nBut his expectation was again dashed this month when his platform failed to pick up despite the government\u2019s ban on Twitter. Instead, Mr Garba found his Crowwe app removed from Google Play Store a week after the Twitter ban following a deluge of complaints from users. He said the app was taken down to upload, but failed to explain why it was only Crowwe that required being taken down before an update could be pushed to enhance user experience. The app was largely unusable that Mr Buhari, his administration officials and supporters had to move to Indian platform Koo following their exit from Twitter earlier this month.\n\nThe presidency did not return a request seeking comments from The Gazette about its dealings with Mr Garba. Mr Garba confirmed to The Gazette that he received funds from the government, but said it was one of several payments the government paid for a series of \u201cintervention\u201d projects his company executed for the government.\n\n\u201cWe do projects and receive payments from the Central Bank,\u201d Mr Garba said. \u201cI think it is a project we did for the EFCC.\u201d He was silent on whether or not the projects were through competitive bidding in line with extant public procurement regulations.\n\nCrowwe was \u201c100 per cent developed by us internally,\u2019\u2019 Mr Adamu added. \u201cWe are even looking for investors locally and internationally. We are looking for investors to further scale up and improve Crowwe capacity.\u201d",

Decree 2 is only known to the military era. Therefore if El-Rufai wants to return to the era of militarisation of our democracy, I think it is something that should be condemned.\n\n\u201cIt is the Kaduna state government that has violated the provision and sanctity of our laws.\u201d\n\n(NAN)",

          "text": "Tertiary Education Trust Fund, TETFund, has said Nigerian academics undertaking PhD studies at Morgan State University, MSU, in Maryland, USA will, henceforth, prioritise three key areas of specialties, namely; Public Health, climate change, and Computer Technology.\n\nSpeaking at a meeting with authorities of the university in Baltimore, USA, which was also streamed virtually, the Executive Secretary of TETFund, Prof Suleiman Bogoro, said the areas of specialties were in view of the challenges of desertification, flooding, other climate-driven, health and developmental problems confronting the country.\n\nBogoro, who is leading a team from the fund to MSU on a partnership visit from June 21 to 23, said the three key areas were identified during his chat with MSU President, David Wilson, adding that these should be some of the areas of priority incoming scholars should undertake now and in the future.\n\n\u201cHe identified the area of climate change, climatology, as absolutely important. And we know it, with desertification, flooding and sorts of challenges that are climate-driven, with the uncertainties of climate and weather, we will be happy to have some of our scholars to go into that area.\n\nSpeaking on public health, he noted that \u201cthis is very important, not just for the state of Maryland but for United States and perhaps, even more profound, for us back in Nigeria. The issues of public health are so obvious. Once there is population and in our own case, uncomfortably skyrocketing population.\n\n\u201cI am saying so because you know the challenges that go with it. The rate of population that is higher than GDP growth rate is never good for any nation. And if the provision for infrastructure and interventions cannot catch up with the increasing population it is a problem.\n\n\u201cAnd in the case of public health it is very obvious; the challenges for public health are very obvious. There are so many things associated with it. Is it the issue of sanitation, of course, availability or otherwise of portable water? You can go on and of course the obvious public health challenges in terms of the diseases out there are uncountable.\u201d\n\nThe TETFund boss described Information and Communication Technology, ICT, as the master of very other thing and like a vehicle that drives, and shapes most other things.\n\nHe added that \u201cwe are in an era that science and technology, and innovation and cutting edge learning shape the world. These are the areas we want our scholars from Nigeria to come and share the benefit of academic knowledge with a great research university of MSU quality.\u201d\n\nRecall that over year ago, the Tertiary Education Trust Fund signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Morgan State University to enhance research and academic cooperation.\n\nBogoro said he and Wilson, had some moments in his office on Monday to discuss issuers that were profoundly beneficial to the MoU that was signed last year.\n\n\u201cWe had deep reflections; we do that regularly but we needed to compare notes. He spoke and I spoke, and midway, at some point he was saying some things that just look naturally, those kinds of things that I have been reflecting and even communicating out there in the media in Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nHe expressed happiness over the performance of Nigerian PhD scholars in the institution, adding that the team was there to see some of them after TETFund signed the MoU a little about a year ago.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t be more proud for you to join us and make presentations on areas that have been carefully identified. This is one of the greatest moments. Partnership becomes imperative. It is a global trend. No nation, if you thing you are the strongest you make mistakes, if you think you don\u2019t need partners.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, the Assistant Vice President, International Affairs of MSU, Yacob Astatke, expressed hope that PhD scholars from Nigeria will take the opportunity provided by TETFund to major on the areas outlined by Bogoro, adding that at the moment, the university has close to fifty PhD scholars from the country.\n\nAstatke, who was the host of the meeting, has been instrumental to cementing the partnership between TETFund and MSU.\n\nThe MSU official also gave opportunity to a number PhD scholars from Nigeria to make presentations on their Doctoral research being pursued in various fields.",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nThe Lagos State Head of Service, Hakeem Muri-Okunola on Tuesday told the Judicial Panel of Inquiry on Police Brutality other related abuses that injuries recorded in the aftermath of the Lekki shooting were predominantly fractures, machete wounds, and minor cuts.\n\nHe said the #EndSARS protest was hijacked by hoodlums who infiltrated the ranks of the protesters to carry out violence.\n\nAs proof of this testimony, Mr Muri-Okunola showed the panel visuals and slides from the Lekki toll gate protests.\n\nHe also testified that in the wake of the violence, the governor and his team visited the hospitals on the night of October 20, 2020, and saw that most of those who presented for treatment had fractures, machete cuts, and minor wounds.\n\n\u201cThere were about 13 persons injured at Reddington Hospital, and 12 injured at the General Hospital, Marina. The doctors in charge said one of the patients that was being moved to LASUTH, had more severe injuries from machetes\u2019 wounds.\n\n\u201cAt the time we were there, most of the injuries were all in the nature of cuts, bruises from machetes\u2019 wounds, and stampede. Nobody at the hospitals said they were shot at.\n\n\u201cThe next day, the governor appealed to residents in a broadcast to stay calm. He appealed to the youth to stay at home. He also informed Lagosians that they were no casualties that had been recorded in the hospitals in the vicinity of the Lekki based on information from monitoring the incident.\n\n\u201cShortly after this we got reports that one of the patients in Reddington hospital had passed on and died from blunt force trauma and another report came of another death from Yaba.\u201d\n\nOn the actual number of alleged deaths at the Lekki Toll incident, since the 20th October 2020, the witness noted that many of the people reported to have been killed refuted their rumoured deaths.\n\nHe listed Nollywood actress, Eniola Badmus, Stephen Becky, Iraby of Oto-Auch, Joshua Ogbodo as some person who was said to have been killed during the Lekki shooting but who have since come out to deny same.\n\nOthers are \u201cAnthony Chechukwu alleged to have been shot by soldiers at the Lekki tollgate has been confirmed to have died in a motorcycle accident and Lucia Adu who was claimed to have died at the Lekki Toll Gate was confirmed to have been killed in an accident involving a stationary truck on 20th October 2020.\u201d\n\nUnder cross-examination, by Mr Adesina Ogunlana, counsel to some of the #EndSARS protesters, Mr Muri-Okunola reaffirmed that he heard that military men from Bonny camp were at the Lekki toll gate and based on video evidence they were armed and \u201cshots were fired.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt about 6.45pm, on Oct 20, we received feedback via a phone call from a resident in Ikoyi of gunshots in the area, we thought it was a robbery until there was subsequent calls reporting same from the other side of the River, the Ozumba Mbadiwe side and that person confirmed it was from the toll gate plaza,\u201d Muri-Okunola said.\n\nHe added that based on this and subsequent information, Mr Governor called the MD of the Lekki Concession Company (LLC) to ask if there was gunshots at the toll plaza.\n\n\u201cOn social media, based on supposed live broadcasts and comments, they said it was armed soldiers so this led the Governor to call General Ndagi who was the representative of the Army on the Security Council meeting. He informed the governor that it was not his men at the toll gate as they also had been instructed to stand down. At that particular point in time, our concerns were that if the shooting was going on, we needed to deploy emergency services and that was our focus.\n\n\u201cWe also directed the Commissioner of Health to start speaking to hospitals if there were casualties in the neighbourhood of the Lekki toll gate.\n\n\u201cWe were informed that there were casualties at some of our hospitals in Lagos. There were more in the Reddington Lekki and the General Hospital, Marina. We got information from other parts of Lagos where there was also violence,\u201d the HoS explained.\n\nEarlier in the testimony, counsel representing some #EndSARS protesters, Adeshina Ogunlana had argued that the state governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu should have personally come before the panel to testify.\n\nThe chairman of the panel, Justice Doris Okuwobi had however held that the governor is not \u201ccompellable\u201d because he has been conferred immunity Under Section 308 of the constitution.\n\nMr Muri-Okunola\u2019s testimony is coming against the background of a summons sent to him by the panel over the Lekki incident of October 20, 2020.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has inaugurated the National Steering Committee (NSC) of the National Poverty Reduction with Growth Strategy (NPRGS) to be chaired by the Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo.\n\nIn his remarks at the event on Tuesday in Abuja, the President reiterated his commitment to lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years, with a well-researched framework for implementation and funding.\n\n\u201cThis journey began in January 2021 when I directed the Chairman of the Presidential Economic Advisory Council and Secretary to the Government of the Federation to collaboratively work together to articulate what will lift 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years.\n\n\u201cI am happy to note that the process of designing this inclusive poverty reduction strategy recognised and addressed past mistakes, as well as laid the foundation for a sustainable poverty reduction through the wide range consultations held at all levels of government, development partners, the private sector as well as the civil society,\u201d he was quoted as saying by his media aide, Femi Adesina.\n\nPresident Buhari was confident that the NPRGS would address the underlying causes of poverty on the basis of which it developed programmes that would deal with the multi-dimensional nature of poverty within the practical context of comparative advantage of human and natural resources in the various geo-political zones.\n\nAccording to him, the major challenge before the committee is to translate the good intention of the government into a positive impact on the average Nigerian in order to create an appreciative impact on the poverty situation in the country.\n\n\u201cIf India can lift 271 million people out of poverty between 2006 and 2016, Nigeria can surely lift 100 million out of poverty in 10 years. Fortunately, we have already started but we need to unlock the challenges of slow implementation, inappropriate targeting, and absence of adequate resources,\u201d the President said.\n\nThe responsibilities of the committee, he noted, include anchoring collaborative efforts; provide oversight for the implementation of the strategy; provide guidance to Technical Working Group and federal ministries, extra ministerial departments and agencies, subnational governments and other stakeholders on meeting the objectives of the programme; as well as monitor progress and any other effort that would enhance the attainment of the objective of lifting 100 million people out of poverty in 10 years.\n\n\u201cThe performance of our economy despite COVID-19 gives me comfort that we can achieve our goal, but we need to seriously scale up and work more with state and local governments.\n\n\u201cThis call becomes more pertinent in the face of recent forecasts by the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and our own Nigerian Economic Summit Group which all agreed that Nigeria needs to frontally tackle her poverty situation if our economic gains are to be sustained,\u201d he told the gathering at the event.\n\nPresident Buhari asked the committee to commence work immediately to enable the Technical Working Group to begin to put the nuts and bolts together.\n\nHe said the responsibilities were onerous but expressed confidence that the committee would be able to lay the foundation and demonstrate, within the next two years, the practicality of lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in or under 10 years.\n\nIn his remarks, Vice President Osinbajo said the NPRGS would consolidate other efforts of the government to reduce poverty in the land.\n\nHe noted that the President\u2019s position that local governments, states, and the federal government should work jointly to alleviate poverty in the country would be properly reflected in the framework and implementation, stressing the need for access and inclusivity.\n\nThe SGF, Boss Mustapha, who is a member of the committee said the poverty situation in the country assumed an enormous proportion with an increasing population, adding that the situation was compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHe, however, said the administration responded to the COVID-19 poverty fallout swiftly and was able to ameliorate the situation and ensured a quick exit from recession.\n\nThe committee also has as members Chief of Staff to the President, Governors of Ekiti (South West), Delta (South South), Sokoto (North West), Borno (North East), Nasarawa (North Central), and Ebonyi States (South East).\n\nOthers are Ministers of Finance, Budget and National Planning; State for Budget and National Planning; Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development; Agriculture and Rural Development; Industry, Trade and Investments; Labour and Employment, Education and Health.",

          "text": "Governor Nyesom Ezenwo Wike says the curfew imposed in the wake of dastardly attacks on security formations in Rivers State will remain in place despite sponsored criticism against it.\n\nThe governor, who reiterated he is not unmindful of the traffic difficulty experienced by the residence of the State, particularly in Port Harcourt and Obio-Akpor councils while trying to beat the 8:30pm curfew time, argued it is better to suffer inconveniences and be alive.\n\nGovernor Wike defended the efficacy of the night curfew while speaking at the 60th birthday celebration of the federal lawmaker who represents Rivers Southeast senatorial district in the Senate, Senator Barry Barinada Mpigi in Port Harcourt.\n\n\u201cSome criminals who have not been succeeding in kidnapping, have been sending people to go on radio to say the governor should be reasonable, and that they don\u2019t want the curfew again.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: People Taking Advantage Of #TwitterBan As Blackmail Weapon \u2013 Keyamo\n\nHe further continued: \u201cCriminals are the ones who are doing that. I will not agree. Life and property are important for me. All those criminals who have been sending people to go on the radio that they are suffering and that we should extend the curfew to 12am, to enable them to kidnap people from 7pm, will not succeed. Don\u2019t waste your time.\u201d\n\nGovernor Wike explained that the imposition of the curfew is based on security advice by law enforcement agencies, as a precaution to prevent further attacks on security formations in the State.\n\nHe enjoined residence and the people of the State to learn how to make sacrifices, suffer the inconveniences of today to achieve a better tomorrow. According to him: \u201cI want all of us to be alive to take care of our children.\u201d\n\nThe governor also disclosed the cheering news that approval has been given for a Nigeria Law School campus to be sited in Port Harcourt, the State capital.\n\n\u201cWe have gotten approval to have a Law School in Port Harcourt. It is not about me, it is the legacy you leave. This was a Law School that was given to Port Harcourt, but the previous government rejected it and it was sent to Yenagoa.\n\n\u201cToday, we have that approval that there must be a Law School in Port Harcourt. And I can assure you in six months\u2019 time, our Law School will be the best Law School in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe also announced that a Federal High Court in Abuja has awarded $1.1billion to the State in a lawsuit against the Federal Government.\n\nThe $1.1 Billion is entitlements of Rivers State based on the subsisting decision of the Supreme Court over production sharing contracts arising from the Deep Offshore and Inland Basin Production Sharing Contracts.\n\nGovernor Wike thanked God for his grace and benevolence toward Senator Mpigi and his family.\n\nThe governor, who recalled that his relationship with Senator Mpigi dates back to when they were both council chairmen, urged the senator to remain a steadfast Peoples Democratic Party stalwart.\n\nChairman of the occasion and former President of the Movement of the Ogoni People (MOSOP) Ledum Mitee, thanked God for the life of Senator Mpigi, whom he described as a politician with a grassroots appeal.\n\nSenator Mpigi said he decided to celebrate his 60th birthday specifically to thank God for life, sound health, and his reuniting with Governor Wike.",

          "text": "Uefa has declined a request to light up the Allianz Arena in rainbow colours before Germany\u2019s Euro 2020 match against Hungary on Wednesday.\n\nMunich mayor Dieter Reiter made the request in protest against a new law in Hungary that bans the sharing of any content seen as promoting homosexuality and gender change to under-18s.\n\nUefa says it denied the request because of the \u201cpolitical context\u201d.\n\nReiter described Uefa\u2019s decision as \u201cshameful\u201d.\n\nIn a statement, European football\u2019s governing body said: \u201cUefa understands that the intention is also to send a message to promote diversity and inclusion \u2013 a cause, which Uefa has been supporting for many years \u2013 having joined forces with European clubs, national teams and their players, launching campaigns and plenty of activities all over Europe to promote the ethos that football should be open to everyone.\n\n\u201cAnd consequently, Uefa has proposed alternative dates for the illumination which align better with existing events.\n\n\u201cRacism, homophobia, sexism, and all forms of discrimination are a stain on our societies \u2013 and represent one of the biggest problems faced by the game today. Discriminatory behaviour has marred both matches themselves and, outside the stadiums, the online discourse around the sport we love.\u201d\n\nGermany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer will be allowed to wear his rainbow captain\u2019s armband during the game.\n\nUefa has proposed to Munich to light the stadium in rainbow colours on either 28 June \u2013 the Christopher Street Liberation Day \u2013 or between 3-9 July which is the Christopher Street Day week in Munich.\n\nChristopher Street Day is an annual LGBTQ+ celebration held annually in cities across Germany and Switzerland, held in memory of the Stonewall Riots in New York in 1969. It is the countries\u2019 counterpart to Pride.\n\nOn Monday, the German football association (DFB) said it would also prefer any such protest to be held on a date other than Wednesday.\n\nMayor Reiter has dismissed those suggestions and says other Munich landmarks will be lit up on Wednesday instead.\n\n\u201cI find it shameful that Uefa forbids us to send a message here in Munich for openness, tolerance, respect and solidarity with the LGBTQI+ community,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe alternative suggestion of illuminating the Allianz Arena on another day contradicts any message that is supposed to emanate from rainbow lighting.\n\n\u201cTomorrow, as the city of Munich, we will still send a clear sign of our solidarity and our respect for sexual equality to Hungary and the world.\n\n\u201cWe will not only fly rainbow flags at Munich town hall \u2013 I assume that the city council will decide this tomorrow with a large majority \u2013 but also make the wind turbine adjacent to the arena shine brightly and also the Munich Olympic Tower.\n\n\u201cBecause we are concerned with a signal for a non-negotiable basic right for all people: equality and tolerance.\u201d\n\nA number of other German clubs including Wolfsburg, Cologne and Hertha Berlin, say they will light their stadium up in rainbow colours, while Werder Bremen have put up Pride flags outside their ground.",

          "title": "Angela Merkel Receives Moderna Dose after First AstraZeneca Shot",
          "text": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel received a Moderna coronavirus vaccine as her second jab, after getting the first dose of AstraZeneca vaccine, a government spokesman said on Tuesday.\n\nThe 66-year-old took her first dose of AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine in April, more than two weeks after German authorities recommended the use of the jab only for people aged 60 and above.\n\nMillions of doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine have been safely administered in Europe, but concerns linger over a rare type of blood clot seen in an extremely small number of recipients, meaning that some people in early priority groups due to their age or pre-existing health conditions have been holding off on getting it, preferring to wait for another vaccine.\n\nDozens of countries paused the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine in March or restricted them to older adults. However, several of them \u2013 including Germany \u2013 have since resumed use either fully or with restrictions after health regulators said the benefits of the shot outweigh any risks.\n\nGermany recommended in April that people who received a first shot of the AstraZeneca vaccine should receive a different shot for their second dose. Several other European countries made similar decisions.\n\nAfter a stuttering start, Germany\u2019s vaccination rollout has sharply accelerated in recent weeks. As of Tuesday, one in two, or 51.2 percent of the population have received their first dose.\n\nSome experts believe that switching COVID vaccines for second doses could boost immunity and several medical studies are under way.\n\nOne small UK study into using different COVID vaccines in two-dose inoculations found that people who received Pfizer\u2019s vaccine followed by a dose of AstraZeneca, or vice versa, were more likely to report mild or moderate common post-vaccination symptoms than if they received two doses of the same type.\n\nNovavax, which is developing a coronavirus vaccine, said on May 21 it would take part in a mix-and-match COVID-19 vaccine trial to test the use of an additional vaccine dose from a different producer as a booster. The trial will start in June in the UK.\n\nMeanwhile, Canada, which is facing supply shortages, has recommended that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines can be used interchangeably.\n\nThe government said on Monday that Pfizer\u2019s weekly shipment of 2.4 million doses was delayed, leaving provinces switching Pfizer appointments for Moderna, and urging people not to cancel their jabs, Canada\u2019s National Observer reported.\n\nOfficials in Ontario have informed residents that they may receive different mRNA vaccines \u2013 the advanced technology used in shots from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.\n\n\u201cWe want you getting the full protection as soon as possible,\u201d David Williams, a doctor, was quoted by the National Observer as saying.\n\n\u201cThe vaccines are safe to mix,\u201d he said.\n\nOfficials in Alberta, Manitoba and Quebec have urged citizens and residents to do the same.\n\n\u201cOur public health is saying you can have the same one, or a mix, the advantages are a lot higher than the very small risk,\u201d Quebec Premier Francois Legault said on Monday.",
