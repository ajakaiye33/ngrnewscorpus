          "text": "COVID-19 cases are on the increase raising fears that the country is on the verge of the fourth wave of coronavirus, findings by The PUNCH have shown\n\nEpidemiological data obtained on Sunday from the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control showed that from November 28 to December 4, a total of 585 cases were reported.\n\nBut from December 5 to December 11, the cases took a new surge as 2,496 cases were reported, indicating an increase of 1,911 (326.67 per cent).\n\nAmid rising COVID-19 cases, our correspondents on Sunday reported that Nigerians had abandoned adherence to coronavirus protocols such as use of face masks and hand washing.\n\nIn Lagos, it was observed that churches, mosques and other public places were no more enforcing the use of face masks\n\nAlso residents of Jos, the Plateau State capital, said there was no need for them to adhere to the protocols since the virus \u201chas gone.\u201d\n\nIn Zamfara State, visits to public places such as markets, mosques and churches on Sunday showed that the people had completely abandoned the COVID- 19 protocols.\n\nSimilarly, government officials have also stopped wearing face masks in both their offices and officials functions.\n\nIn Ogun state , many residents are no longer adhering strictly to the protocols.\n\nIn a related development, the NCDC showed that 22,863 coronavirus tests were conducted between November 29 and December 11 compared to 103,358 tests conducted between November 22 and November 28, signifying a 77.8 per cent drop in testing rate.\n\nThe NCDC data also indicated that 13 states including Kogi, Kebbi, Yobe, Cross river, Sokoto, Niger, Adamawa, Taraba, Borno, Ebonyi, Anambra, Nasarawa and Akwa Ibom had stopped COVID-19 tests.\n\nEpidemiological data obtained from the NCDC revealed showed that since December 1, 2021 only about 23 states and the Federal Capital Territory had details of their reports with the NCDC.\n\nBut the Sokoto State Government faulted the inclusion of the states among states not carrying out tests for COVID-19.\n\nThe state Commissioner of Health, who is also as the state chairman, COVID-19 taskforce, Dr Ali Inname, said Sokoto must have been listed in error.\n\n\u201cWe carry out COVID-19 tests on prospective corps members deployed to the state before, their entry into the NYSC Orientation camp.\n\n\u201cOur personnel are also, on ground and they administered the Covid-19 tests on the citizens that volunteered to be tested. This includes those that needs clearance to embark on travelling.\u201d\n\nAlso the Adamawa State Commissioner for Health, Professor Isa Abdullahi, said the state was carrying out COVID-19 tests and the results were being sent to the NCDC\n\nMost Nigerians not taking COVID-19 seriously \u2013 Virologist\n\nCommenting on the rising cases, a medical virologist at the Adeleke University, Ede, Osun State, Dr Oladipo Kolawole, said the country was not doing enough to fight the surging Omicron variant of COVID-19.\n\nIn an interview with one of our correspondent on Sunday, Kolawole said it was unfortunate that most Nigerians had neglected the non-pharmaceutical measures of COVID-19.\n\nHe said, \u201cNigeria is not doing enough to ward off the surging of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 because the populace is not taking this seriously. Most Nigerians are not keeping to the rules, they have neglected the non-pharmaceutical measures, no use of facemask, no physical or social distancing, more social gathering, no washing of hands with either soap or alcohol-based hand sanitiser, most of our local airports are always crowded.\u201d\n\nAccording to a renowned Virologist at the University of Maiduguri, Professor Marycelin Baba, the failure of states to engage in community testing and the recent surge could lead to a full outbreak if not properly curtailed.\n\nBaba who spoke to one of our correspondents in Abuja also reiterated the fact that the change of weather could also lead to more cases.\n\nShe said, \u201cFirst, failure to test and send updates will not help us to monitor the trends properly. This could mean that the figures we have far fetched than what we truly have and if this is not probably monitored, there could be a full outbreak. It is also too early to link this surge to the Omicron variant, the WHO has also said they are still monitoring the trends and investigating the variant but one thing is sure, cases are increasing.\n\n\u201cAnother thing is that cold allows for surge in COVID-19 cases. In Europe, they get more cases during winter. While we are waiting for the WHO to conclude it\u2019s investigations, it will be in the interest of all to make sure that tests are being done, public health protocols are adhered to and also continue with speedy vaccination.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Chairman of the Presidential Steering Committee COVID-19, has cautioned Nigerians against letting down their guards because of the deadly nature of Omicron variant of COVID-19 .\n\nHe warned that Nigerians should not drop their guard as the Covid-19 pandemic is not over yet with the discovery of more deadly Omicron variant.\n\nBoss Mustapha, made the call in Yola, at the Christmas Carol Service of Songs organised by Adamawa State chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria, which held at the Ribadu square Yola.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "*\n\nOnly 2% of population fully vaccinated against COVID-19, says Akufo-Addo\n\nBy Johnbosco Agbakwuru\n\nABUJA\u2014PRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari yesterday advocated renewed collaboration among West African leaders to overcome the myriad of common challenges, including state of insecurity facing the sub-region.\n\nThis is just as the President of Ghana and Chairman of Economic Community of West African States, ECOWAS, Nana Akufo-Addo, said only two per cent of the entire population of the subregion had been fully vaccinated against the COVID-19 pandemic. President Buhari made the advocacy in his welcome address at the 60th Session of the Authority of Heads of State and Government of the Economic Community of West African States, ECOWAS, held at the Old Banquet Hall, Presidential Villa, Abuja.\n\nREAD ALSO:APC urges free, fair, credible 2022 LG elections in Enugu\n\nHe noted that the sub-region had, in recent times, managed to stay afloat amid a myriad of crises, which include the negative socioeconomic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, state of insecurity, which has claimed many lives and left millions displaced.\n\nThe Nigerian leader, however, charged leaders of the region to be ready to deliberately work together in the task of finding solutions to the challenges, as a region.\n\n\u201cOur subregion continues to face socioeconomic, political, security, and environmental realities linked to Coronavirus pandemic. Our democracy is being challenged in Mali and Guinea. Furthermore, threats are looming around environmental degradation and climate change on our farming systems. We are facing a network of criminals, including terrorism.\n\n\u201cAll of these challenges require our collective action to work in concert with each other to pragmatically address and provide our people better prospects in life. Today\u2019s realities remind us of the need to continue to forge stronger solidarity in order to address the new challenges, including the current third wave of the pandemic and its Omicron variant.\n\n\u201cI am glad that the Commission of the Economic Community of West African States and the West Africa Health Organization are continuing to work with our respective national disease control centers to mitigate the effects of the pandemic on our people and subregion,\u201d President Buhari said.\n\nHe, however, thanked the Ghanaian President and Chairman of ECOWAS, President Nana Akufo-Addo, for providing the needed leadership to member states, as they mitigate the effects of the pandemic.\n\nIn his opening remarks, President Akufo-Addostre-ssed the need for the subregion to take local production of COVID-19 vaccines more seriously, pointing out that with all the efforts so far made in the fight against the virus, only 2% of the population of the subregion had been completely vaccinated.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs of 8th December, our region has recorded 674,556 cases of infections with some 10,000 deaths. This scourge has impacted our humanitarian, social and economic sectors, and it continues to rage with the emergence of a new variant and the risk of a new wave in our region.\n\n\u201cThe new variant Omicron has already been found in three member states, and has led to unfortunate imposition of travel bans by some countries, which are unjustified and unacceptable. Meanwhile, the availability of vaccines continues to remain a problem. Despite our efforts, we have only 6% of our population receiving one dose, with 2% of the population fully vaccinated.\n\n\u201cWhilst we remain grateful for the support from friends of the community, we must continue to pursue national and regional efforts to fight COVID-19 and move rapidly into the domestic production of vaccines for the protection of our citizens and for the growth and development of our economy\u201d.\n\nThe ECOWAS Chairman, also called for continued mobilization of troops for peace keeping in areas where peace is fragile, noted that all is being done to restore democratic governance in Mali and Guinea, where there were undemocratic change of power\n\nAkufo-Addo restated ECOWAS\u2019 resolve to promote good governance in West Africa, through the sustenance of democratic institutions.\n\n\u201cWe continue to be faced with security trials in the forms of deadly terrorist and kidnapping attacks, particularly in Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso and Nigeria, causing numerous casualties amongst civilians and security forces, resulting in a significant number of displaced persons.\n\n\u201cRecent events in Burkina Faso are matters of the greatest concern. Increased coordination, however, on the part of coastal nations, have recently led to an improved maritime security situation in the Gulf of Guinea.\n\n\u201cLet me on behalf of the authority, condemn in the strongest terms, these attacks that continue to plague our region. Significant efforts are being made at both national and regional levels to fight terrorism and extremism.\n\n\u201cWe must step up our efforts to deal with these tasks which will be imposed upon us and we must act in such a way that no one will doubt our resolve to protect our peoples and the peace and stability of our countries\u201d, Akufo-Addo said.\n\nHe congratulated President Jose Neves of Cape Verde, who was attending the summit for the first time, as well as Adama Barrow of Gambia, who recently got re-elected.\n\nIn a goodwill message, the United Nations Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, represented by the Special Representative for West Africa and the Sahel, Annadif Saleh, pledged more support for ECOWAS, as he sued for more cooperation among member States.\n\nGuterres commended Cape Verde and the Gambia, for holding peaceful Presidential elections recently.\n\nIn another goodwill message, the African Union represented by its Commissioner for Political Affairs, Peace and Security, Nigeria\u2019s Bankole Adeoye, hailed ECOWAS for sustaining democracy in West Africa.\n\nThe AU pledged to continue to work closely with ECOWAS to ensure the promotion of good governance within the region.\n\nThe two-day summit was attended by Heads of State and government of all the member States, as well as Former Nigerian leader and ECOWAS Special Envoy and Mediator to Mali, Goodluck Jonathan, and President of the ECOWAS Commission, Jean Kassi Brou, among others.",

          "text": "Former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, on Saturday raised alarm over the proliferation of universities in Nigeria as well as the high cost of private universities.\n\nA statement made to journalists in Bauchi by Dogara\u2019s media, Turaki Hassan Adamu, informed that the former Speaker stated this at the Achievers University, Owo, Ondo State, at the 11th convention and 14th foundation anniversary of the institution.\n\nDogara, who is representing Bogoro/Dass/Tafawa Balewa Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives, lamented the high spate of approval of private universities by the National Universities Commission (NUC), saying there is a need to stop further approvals.\n\n\u201cWorthy of commenting upon is the spate of approvals and licensing of private universities. The National Universities Commission (NUC) must be quick to have a recess, a break for a period of time to allow the very large number of private universities already licensed to mature.\n\n\u201cI am reliably informed that there are 202 universities in Nigeria, out of which the Federal Government owns 49; the 36 state governments own 54, while the rest 99 universities, including Achievers University, are promoted by private initiatives,\u201d Dogara was quoted to have said at the event.\n\nAccording to him, many of the private universities were still struggling to find their feet, saying that many students could not afford the universities\u2019 exorbitant fees.\n\n\u201cMany of the newly established private universities are still struggling to find their feet, not because there are no prospective university students in JAMB\u2019s pool, but we would be shying away from the reality if we fail to realise that very many of the applicants cannot afford the fees charged by private universities.\n\n\u201cSo many prospective university students would rather wait for a few years to benefit from the public university rather than exploit the vast opportunity available in private universities,\u201d he said.\n\nHe, however, noted that despite their exorbitant fees, private universities are still playing significant roles, particularly in stemming educational tourism\n\nIn his words, Dogara said, \u201cWe must, however, acknowledge the great jobs the private universities are doing for those who can afford it and for assisting the government in stemming the tide of educational tourism.\n\n\u201cHitherto, many Nigerian youths were found in very great numbers in many universities across the globe, particularly in West African countries. In the last 21 years, with the advent of private universities in Nigeria, the story has changed for good.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on incessant strikes by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) as a result of its faceoff with the Federal Government, the former speaker, who is the Chancellor of the Achievers University, urged both government and the association to find other means of resolving disputes other than strikes.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cour public universities are seriously affected by incessant strikes and threats of it. Are there no other ways of resolving disputes between the workers and the government?\u201d\n\nWhile submitting that the government needed to seriously address funding of public universities, he said unions in the institutions should have the interest of their students and the degrees they earn at heart.\n\n\u201cNo doubt, the funding challenges of the public universities need to be seriously addressed by the government but the unions are advised to think out of the box in channeling their grievances in the interest of the students and the quality of degrees they earn,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "Col. Abubakar Dangiwa Umar exclusive: Why Nigeria cannot win banditry, Boko Haram war",
          "text": "From Aidoghie Paulinus, Abuja\n\nFormer governor of old Kaduna State, Col. Abubakar Dangiwa Umar, has said that Super Tucano aircraft won\u2019t end the insecurity bedevilling the nation, insisting that this could be achieved only with ground forces.\n\nUmar also said that the $460 million spent on the procurement of 12 Super Tucanos is enough to recruit, train and pay the emoluments of about 200,000 soldiers for one year.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nUmar, in this exclusive interview with Sunday Sun, wondered what difference the change of Service Chiefs has brought into the fight against insurgency in the country, pointing out that the key in the fight against insecurity is massive increase in security manpower and equipment.\n\n\u201cMore boots on the ground not more fixed wing aircraft like Super Tucano.\n\n\u201cAll the forests of the Northwest and some parts of North-central must be combed and dominated by ground forces and surveilled by helicopter gunships. Wild bombings with the use of aircraft amount to wild goose chase. Fixed wing aircraft are not ideal weapons of choice in the fight against banditry and kidnappings,\u201d Umar explained.\n\nUmar dwelt on this and other thought-provoking issues. Excerpts:\n\nThe year 2021 is running out and the season of politics is beginning from next year. In the last six years, we have seen the All Progressives Congress (APC) that promised to deliver in all fronts, including insecurity. You are a farmer and we know insecurity has gone all high in the country. How do you feel about insecurity in the country? As a farmer, how are you averting problems in your farm?\n\nOf course, like every citizen, I am very much concerned about the growing insecurity in the country. The primary responsibility of any government is the security of life and property of its citizens. People give up most of their rights to the state with the hope that their security will be guaranteed. It goes without saying that nothing else matters in the absence of security. What benefit do people derive from the best physical infrastructure in the absence of security? I, therefore, urge this government and future administrations to pay greater attention to the issue of security. Nigeria is currently facing existential challenge due to growing and rapidly metastasizing insecurity. To the second part of your question. I took the painful decision to shut down operations on my Ostrich farm. You will be surprised to know that I have disposed of all my ostriches due to insecurity and high cost of feed. I have actually not been to the farm in the past three years. That is what I mean by asserting that no economic activity is possible without security. I am currently fully retired.\n\nKaduna which you once governed has been very hostile security-wise, with bandits packing students from time to time. Since all these things are happening and your state, Kebbi is relatively peaceful, have you moved away? And how are you coping?\n\nUnfortunately, Kaduna is not the only state facing this problem. It may be one of the most affected. It is, however, the state of my residence, like many retired military officers and civil servants. I have no intention of relocating. In fact, the greatest problem I face is how to travel to Kebbi through Zamfara State.\n\nPeople are taken aback that Kaduna that is home to several military formations is held by the jugular by bandits and other criminal elements. What is your view about this?\n\nWell, these military formations are not tasked with internal security mission. For example, Command and Staff College, NDA, Depot NA and Air Force Training Command are all training institutions. One Mechanised Division has operational responsibility beyond Kaduna State. Kaduna, like all other states, has the problem of anaemic shortage of security manpower.\n\nEl-Rufai\u2019s policy of not paying ransom to bandits: how do you view it? Is it the right way to go?\n\nIt is not difficult to see El-Rufai\u2019s rationale. There is a direct nexus between the astronomical rise in banditry and kidnappings with ransom payments. But the alternative to ransom payments is the use of force to prevent or rescue victims. Unfortunately, such force is absent. Relatives of victims are left to bear the burden. I really sympathise with governors who have not the wherewithal to marshal such force. Perhaps, this makes a strong case for state police.\n\nHow do you rate the APC on its promises of tackling insecurity, corruption and the economy?\n\nWell, the answer is within your competence as a senior journalist. Luckily, I am only a retired military officer and retired farmer. I have also since joined the late Chief Bola Ige\u2019s sit-down-look party. An honest answer to this question is likely to attract to my person, ad hominem reactions. I beg to pass on this.\n\nWould you say the APC deceived Nigerians with empty promises just to acquire power by all means in 2015?\n\nThis appears to be a leading question. I have already indicated my response earlier. If you are not satisfied, you may direct the question to a PDP member.\n\nThere was fear sometime ago due to happenings in the country that the military may stage a come back. Having been in the military and rose to the top, how do you see this feeling in some quarters?\n\nMilitary rule has always been regarded as an aberration even when people welcomed it in the past. As Winston Churchill aptly opined, \u201cDemocracy is the worst form of government except all the others.\u201d Election continues to be the best form of choosing leaders. Regimes\u2019 abysmal failure is the most efficacious catalyst for mobilising the electorate to vote them out. We must continue to tread the path of democracy instead of undemocratic ways like coups. We must, however, fortify our democracy and make military regimes less attractive by insisting on regular free and fair elections. We must ensure the presence of checks and balances by the different arms of government. Democratic dividends are the fruits of any functional democracy. Africa as a whole must tackle the problem of sit-tight leadership. It is an illiberal form of democracy, worse than military regimes.\n\nNigerians demanded for the removal of Service Chiefs. But when it eventually happened, they were appointed ambassadors. How do you see the move by the presidency?\n\nWell, that shows that the Presidency was satisfied with their performance rewarding them with those appointments. I honestly do not believe mere change of Service Chiefs is the elixir in combating our current security challenges even though it was the right decision for the president to submit to public demand and pressure to effect those changes. You may wish to ask, what difference has that change made? The key is massive increase in security manpower and equipment. More boots on the ground not more fixed wing aircraft like the Super Tucano. All the forests of the Northwest and some parts of North-central must be combed and dominated by ground forces and surveilled by helicopter gunships. Wild bombings with the use of aircraft amount to wild goose chase. Fixed wing aircraft are not ideal weapons of choice in the fight against banditry and kidnappings.\n\nElsewhere, the military is for external aggression, but here, they are battling Boko Haram and bandits and for over a decade, our military who have excelled in various peacekeeping missions abroad, have not defeated Boko Haram. What is happening to our military?\n\nWhat is happening is that our military is overstretched. It is engaged in both military and police duties. Yet, it suffers from shortage of manpower and equipment. It is too thinly spread nationwide. If this trend persists, our security forces will become demoralised and ineffective. Adequate troops strength is key to successful mission performance. It also provides for troops rotation. A situation where manpower shortage necessitates lengthy tour of duty, particularly in a hot war, may also lead to fear and low morale amongst troops. Our troops are doing their best and they need to be commended and encouraged. We need to improve their capacity.\n\nMilitary hardware like the Super Tucano and the conditions given by the United States Government: how will they help to tackle insecurity?\n\nI am not aware that the United States Government gave those conditions. They would not sell those planes if there was any possibility of their misuse, particularly in human rights abuse. As I mentioned earlier, fixed wing aircraft like the Super Tucano have great limitations in the kind of warfare we are prosecuting against bandits and kidnappers. The reports of successful operations against bandits are clearly exaggerated. For emphasis, more ground troops are key. The $460 million spent on the procurement of 12 Super Tucanos is enough to recruit, train and pay the emoluments of about 200,000 soldiers for one year. Enough troops strength and time to flush out bandits from their firm bases in the Northwest forests are what is needed.\n\nFarmers-herders crisis: Southern governors banned open grazing and the North is supporting ranches. What is the best way to stop the farmers-herders clashes? Do you support open grazing or ranches?\n\nYou know the herders-farmers conflict is an age-old problem. It has always been a struggle for the control of diminishing land resource. It is being exacerbated by the astronomical rise in population and expansion of crop farming. There is also the problem of desertification in the North leading to shrinkage of arable land. These elements and the primordial method of livestock farming which has the herder roaming in search of pasture and water intensifies the conflict. Even in the era of abundant vacant land, seasonal conflicts occurred. Very few governments paid attention or even attempted to address this very serious problem. Now that the conflicts are getting out of hand, there are attempts to address the problem albeit in an uncoordinated fashion. Truth is, we need protein and crops. We must, therefore, try to create a sustainable method of producing both. The governors are constitutionally empowered to handle this. They must act. You should, however, note that one of the problems that led to the recent worsening relations between herders and farmers is growing incidence of banditry and kidnappings in which rogue Fulanis as distinct from herdsmen, are largely implicated. The fact that herders and some of these criminals share ethnic identity, being Fulanis, makes the herder culpable in a case of mistaken identity. It is true that the herder is often guilty of trespass, but is hardly involved in banditry and kidnappings. Actually, many herders are also victims of these crimes perpetrated by their kinsmen. We must realise and be aware of this distinction, otherwise all Fulanis are in danger of negative profiling and indiscriminate reprisal attacks.\n\nWhat is the way out of secessionist agitations in the country?\n\nSomeone correctly observed that with all the imperfections and weaknesses of our federation, it provides a security umbrella to all the federating units. In the event of Nigeria\u2019s balkanization, almost all the independent units will face the challenge of heterogeneity or diversity. Nigeria is also endowed with natural resources such as vast land area, minerals and large population. All the federating units stand to benefit from these endowments. But since man does not live by bread alone, there are those intangible needs which must be satisfied for him to want to freely belong in the union. Things like equity, justice and fairness are some of the necessary conditions. They are the pillars, the centripetal forces on which a virile, prosperous and united nation exist. Most rational citizens will protest or even demand to exit from an inequitable union no matter the abundant material benefits they stand to gain. It is in this context we should view secessionist agitations. This must have informed the United Nations\u2019 decision to provide for people\u2019s rights to peacefully demand for self determination. President Buhari\u2019s decision to consider the request of Ndigbo elders to release Nnamdi Kanu is a welcome development. I hope he grants their request. Looking at the pattern of this government\u2019s appointments, particularly in the senior positions of our security agencies, the Igbo are fully justified to complain about being excluded or marginalised. Most Igbo leaders who express satisfaction with the status quo must be doing so out of personal consideration. I, however, recognize the right of any person who disagrees and believes that the case of Nnamdi Kanu should go through judicial process. But sometimes, political compromise and settlement are much more beneficial and preferred means of settling such political disputes. Nigeria has an enviable history of such political settlements which helped immensely in our national reconciliation and political social stability. For example, after our 30 months civil war, July 1967-January 1970, which led to the loss of over two million people, the General Yakubu Gowon government decided to pardon the Biafran secessionist leaders in an effort towards national reconciliation. Although Chief Odumegwu Ojukwu was declared wanted, President Shehu Shagari pardoned him in 1982. He returned from exile and contested election under the president\u2019s party, the defunct National Party of Nigeria (NPN). In the spirit of political compromise and fairness, I appeal to Mr President to grant state pardon to Senator Joshua Dariye and former Governor Reverend Jolly Nyame. I honestly believe that considering their offences, the anti-corruption bar has been set too high for the duo. Judged by the same standard, most serving and retired governors would be in jail.\n\nGoing by happenings in the country, any hope for Nigeria?\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates). Click Here to Apply .\n\nOf course. Countries which faced greater challenges in the past had overcome and taken their pride of place amongst some of the most developed or developing countries. After the World War 1 (WW1), the Allies sought to cripple Germany. The Versailles Treaty of 1919 took away all German colonies and some of its most valued land possessions in Europe like the rich Alsace Lorraine. It was made to pay war reparations which resulted in the crippling of its economy and massive pauperisation of its people. Twenty years later, in 1939, Nazi Germany under the leadership of Adolf Hitler, embarked on a most destructive war, WW11 of 1939-1945 aimed at reversing the Versailles Treaty and expanding its frontiers in Europe. Of course, it lost the war and was left in ruins. Today, Germany boasts of the strongest economy in Europe. Coming closer home, nobody gave Rwanda a chance after its early 1990s civil war in which a genocide that claimed the lives of over 800,000 civilians in less than three months. Today, Rwanda has the fastest growing economy in Africa with an annual GDP growth of over eight per cent. It enjoys socio-political stability. Nigerians are a well determined and industrious people.

          "text": "Governor of Imo State, Senator Hope Uzodimma, is 63 years old today. As part of events to mark this birthday, he presented a book, entitled \u201cReflections on the Igbo Question\u201d in Owerri yesterday.\n\nIn an interview with ONUOHA UKEH, Managing Director/Editor-in-Chief; IHEANACHO NWOSU, Editor, Daily Sun and FRED ITUA, Correspondent, the Imo State governor told a story of his life.\n\nHe talked about his growing up, family life, politics, life as governor and philosophy in life, among others.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nHow do you feel marking 63rd birthday, especially knowing that you are getting older?\n\nI feel very good. I am not afraid that I am getting older. Sometimes, you don\u2019t die because you\u2019re getting old. Our destiny is in God\u2019s hand. However, I must say that when expectations are not met, it makes one feel bad.\n\nThe first thing is to thank God for life. No man is an island. When we were born, others were born too. Many of them were not lucky to attain the age I\u2019ve reached. Many of them are still around, but don\u2019t have the kind of opportunities that have come my way. I attribute everything to the glory of God. I feel strong and healthy. That special grace of God helps me always. It makes me happy.\n\nCould you tell us about some childhood memories that left a mark in you?\n\nI recall as a child, we used to see these research officers, who would come to our village to find out the kind of casava we were planting. They\u2019ll check and tell us the type we can eat and others we shouldn\u2019t, even the ones that were poisonous. That is to tell you the kind of society we had then.\n\nI remember sanitary inspectors who would move from house to house to check our toilets. It is really unfortunate that we have been progressing backwards politically. Since 1999, I can\u2019t remember any brand new road. Roads we\u2019ve today were built by previous governments, yet, we can\u2019t maintain them. Well, one new road I see in South East is the 2nd Niger bridge.\n\nAs I growing child, I knew about the Defence Corporation in Kaduna. The institute was licensed the same time with that of India and Malaysia. Today, that of India is talking of managing atomic energy and construction of missiles. We now go there to buy guns and other security equipment. The only thing our Defence Corporation can do now is to transform to a place furniture are made.\n\nThings are on the decline. It is painful that despite our endowment, we are not progressing. Foreign countries only come here to look for raw materials. M.I Okpara established a palm factory. This gave a value chain. But crude oil which is over 60 years in Nigeria, is still being taken abroad as raw material, whereas in crude oil, you can get other petrochemical things. God gave us this natural resource and it appears we don\u2019t know what to do with it. South Korea doesn\u2019t have one barrel of crude oil, yet, it has 22 refineries.\n\nAt 63, you\u2019ve seen the good, the bad and the ugly. What are those things you enjoyed as a child that are missing now in the country?\n\nMy father lived in Port Harcourt. As children, we would leave Port Harcourt around 5pm on Friday to my brother\u2019s place in Lagos to spend the weekend. We will travel in the night without fear. We had social lives. There was nothing like unknown gunmen. Nobody was being kidnapped. Even armed robbery started like a small thing immediately after the civil war. We thought it was a joke.\n\nThose days, you would graduate and get three different letters of employment from different companies. You\u2019ll begin to consult, to know which one to settle for. These things are missing now. Those days in Lagos, you\u2019ll go to a bus stop and see staff buses conveying workers to the office. In the evening, it was the same thing. Those things have disappeared.\n\nToday, where are those industries? So many things have gone wrong. We had a sense of security and job opportunities. There was respect and value for human life. In 1978-79, if there was an an accident where two persons died, the whole country will mourn. Today, every hour, you see on television, 20 persons dead here, 25 there and 10, in another place. Nobody is interested or affected. People are getting used to very uncommon things.\n\nWe need to sit down and think about these things. If we don\u2019t plan for tomorrow, it will forget about us. Just on Tuesday, I met with President Muhammadu Buhari to apply for additional security so that our people can come home for Christmas. Three years ago, the governor in Imo state didn\u2019t do that. Everyday, things get worse in Nigeria. These things don\u2019t encourage sane minds.\n\nCan you recall when this descent started?\n\nIn 1983, a journalist asked Umaru Dikko why there was poverty in Nigeria and he gave him a sarcastic response. He said he had not seen anybody eating from the dustbin. Since the Second Republic, things started going down, like a child\u2019s play. The public sector management was okay. Politicians then would get contracts and take only 10 per cent. From 1999, when the military handed over power, some leaders were no longer interested in inflating government contracts. They will go to government treasury and take out the money. Nothing has been able to serve as a deterrent. The kind of discipline that should be inculcated into the managers of our economy and leaders is absent. Chinue Achebe wrote that Things Fall Apart and the centre cannot hold.\n\nWhat would say life has taught you?\n\nLife has taught me a lot. In today\u2019s world, if you don\u2019t solve your problem, no one will solve it for you. If you don\u2019t initiate a process, no one will do that for you. I\u2019ve gathered so much experience to the extent that I\u2019m more interested in what will be the end result of every action I take. I\u2019m in a position now to separate my demands from my desires. I\u2019m guided every time by these two factors. I\u2019m also interested in knowing my needs. If only we can go for what we need, there will be some sanity in the country. It is unfortunate that even when some people get what they need, they still keep acquiring things they won\u2019t need. If you can\u2019t manage your greed, it means you\u2019re unfair to humanity.\n\nExperience is very important in everything. People should contribute their experiences to the central platform. I was in the Senate for eight years. During budget consideration, agencies will come with request of 21 computers year in, year out. The only thing that was different was the date. They were copying and pasting. Ministry of Power, for instance, will keep submitting request for 500 transformers every year. Nobody ever cared to ask how many were installed in communities.\n\nWhen I came to Imo State and saw how they were managing payment transaction, it was surprising. I came into a state without credible payroll register. I decided to automate everything. Each step I took, they tried to bring me down. I insisted that I must have the automation completed. I insisted that every staff of Imo State must submit his BVN. They\u2019re still blackmailing me that I don\u2019t pay salaries. I\u2019ve asked them to show me one genuine staff not getting his salary and I\u2019ll bet my money. If you\u2019re not receiving now as a pensioner, it means you were illegally getting multiple pay. It means you\u2019re owing the government because you earned money illegally. Corruption in Nigeria is thick. There is no way you can fight corruption in Nigeria without working on attitudinal change. We must get the buy-in of the people. It appears that many people have been compromised. They don\u2019t want anything to move.\n\nFor the number of years I\u2019ve spent on earth, I\u2019ve garnered so many experiences that shape what I do. I came from the private sector. I\u2019m in the public sector now. The public and private sector administrators need to work together in order for us to move forward.\n\nWhen you look at your life, will you attribute your successes to luck or hard work?\n\nIt is not even luck or hard work. The Canon Principle is faith-based. Everything about me is attributed to God. That\u2019s my faith. If you call it luck, to say that out of about 200 million people, I\u2019ve been lucky, well, well, well. I believe in providence. I ask and the only person I ask is God. Most times, God uses people. Sometimes, people want to help you pass through the gate. If it is not ordained by God, I can\u2019t pass that gate. That\u2019s why I\u2019m friendly with everybody. That\u2019s why I hardly have issues with anybody. Whoever calls himself my enemy, that\u2019s the person\u2019s business. Whenever I stand, I feel fulfilled. I\u2019m not on a wheelchair. I can still exercise for minutes every morning. I\u2019ve good health. I eat what I want. Some people don\u2019t have the kind of health that I have. It is all about God\u2019s grace. If it is not about hard work, I am nor working better or harder than those who push trucks on the street? They\u2019ve more energy and engage in hard work.\n\nFrom your story, it could be assumed that you started learning the political ropes from childhood. Kindly tell us the true story.\n\nI learnt a lot from my father. We was a councillor. My father was an ordinary councillor. His followership was huge. He was nicknamed \u2018chairman of uncommon man\u2019. He was very popular. It was from my father that I learnt not to eat alone. Even in my house, I don\u2019t eat alone. My mother had a large kitchen that was open to everybody. My father did his politics well. He was in Igbo Union. He was a prime minister and died as a traditional ruler. He taught me frankness. Anything I can\u2019t tell you, I won\u2019t gossip about it behind you.\n\nYour book is Reflections on Igbo Question. What message are you trying to pass with the book?\n\nSome times it is good to situate things. People forget easily. If you check, those materials aren\u2019t new. These were my outings during my time in the Senate for eight years. There is none as a governor. Some were done when I attended Igbo congresses abroad or one programme or another in the church.\n\nThese days, some people claim to be more Igbo than others, but contributed nothing in the past. I believe that the Igbo are special and talented breed. I have checked the history of great men in the country. Igbo men were leading. I\u2019ll liken the qualities of an Igbo man to that of the Jews. I\u2019ll like to compare it with the Manhattan project, when Israel never hoped they will become a nation. They didn\u2019t go to any war to get their independence. They sat down and entered into a negotiation. Compromises were made and three years after, the State of Israel was created.\n\nSince Ojukwu tried with his military experience and his father\u2019s money to confront government and was not successful, we shouldn\u2019t think that route. We may not know that what happened before led to a lot of envy for our people. Our neighbours feel highly threatened because of our capacity. But before we are relegated to the background, we can adopt two strategies.\n\nPower can be likened to a lion or a wolf. Those are the only two ways through which you can get power. Like a lion, if you\u2019re sure of your strength, you can pounce and get power. If you\u2019re not sure, you\u2019ve to behave like a wolf. The wolf will befriend you and get what it wants. We can create another system of addressing the inequalities or marginalisation. We tend to always think of war. We can\u2019t even afford it. We need to study our environment and know those we are competing with. If we do that, we will know the right steps to take. Are there those benefiting from our marginalisation? If a particular vehicle can\u2019t take you to your destination, you don\u2019t sit down and wait for it. The most auspicious thing to do, is to get into the next available vehicle and move since the intention is to get to your destination.\n\nI think that the book is another humble way of letting our people know where I\u2019ve always stood. Not because I\u2019m a governor now; this has been my position. Consistently, I have maintained my stance. When we organised a send- off party for Ambassador George Obiozor in Lagos in 1999, though I didn\u2019t have a written speech, I spoke off the cuff. My contribution was about fiscal federalism. I argued in favour of making states semi-autonomous. If a responsible leadership implements all the laws we have in this country, the issue of marginalisation won\u2019t come up.\n\nSome people have talked about denying Igbo major appointment. What\u2019s your take?\n\nWe should look at ourselves well. Sometimes, our inability to be strategic is responsible for the marginalisation. Let me ask some hypothetical questions. As a president, if, for instance the Igbo carry guns and are threatening to secede, would you be comfortable? If there is a vacancy to appoint a Chief of Army Staff, will you, in your good conscience, give the position to an Igbo man? I am just raising posers, but think about that.\n\nIf I\u2019m the president, I\u2019ll be reluctant. I\u2019m the governor of Imo State and I took an oath to protect the people. If somebody starts killing people, do you expect me not to talk or to fold my arms? Sometimes we do things that are actually against us. They\u2019ll think it is in the interest of the Igbo, but certainly not.\n\nI don\u2019t know who determines the interest of the Igbo. In all the meetings, I\u2019ve not heard where the Igbo decided to throw away what they have in anticipation for something they don\u2019t have. The Igbo agenda should be carefully crafted. We should have a summit, where Igbo leaders from different areas of life, will come together and develop a roadmap on how to create an economy. If we use economy as a banner, everybody will join.\n\nIs it safe to say that Igbo are their own enemies?\n\nNo, it is not safe to say that. You remember when Ojo Madueke said those calling for Igbo presidency were idiotic. It took the grace of God for him to get out of it. We need to work. Igbo interest must be collectively designed and defined. It will help us implement.\n\nIn Nigeria before now, we Igbo were the first. We used to take the lead and others would follow. We established the Stock Exchange and many other things. We were the best. We have Zinox, Innoson and others. With a small push, they\u2019ll go far. Our people should be more diplomatic and realistic.\n\nThere are claims that governors are not defending the aspirations of the South East. People believe that there is no confidence in the leadership. What do you think?\n\nI don\u2019t want to blame the people or say that it is wrong. I don\u2019t want to also criticise a governor because I\u2019m one. But our governors should find courage to be tactical. I told you that I was with the president. I told him I needed a dam in Imo State that can give me 10 megawatts. He approved it immediately. If it works, the entire Owerri township will not need to remain with the national grid. We will have a constant power supply. Even if you want Biafra, do it in such a way that your brothers and sisters will be alive to benefit from it, when it materialises. If it is our decision, brains will be put together on how it can be realised.\n\nWe talk about unknown gunmen in South East. I\u2019m the person who came up with the phrase of unknown gunmen. I realised that those caught weren\u2019t Igbo, whereas, people were saying that IPOB and ESN were behind the killings. They were giving us bad names. We needed to find out what was going on. Was it sabotage? Was it because the South East decided to move to the national party to make us strong? Who were behind those killings?\n\nIt was when we worked with DSS that we realised that many of them came from the Niger Delta region. Some were into illegal bunkering business and others worked for politicians to create a false impression. I had to cry out to the president on what I saw. People are killed in villages, but does it make sense that those being killed still turn around to resist an attempt by the Army to intervene? It was just propaganda. When you sit where I\u2019m now, you do what is noble, you don\u2019t fall for sentiments. Sometimes, you\u2019re guided by findings from professionals. You weigh the options and take a decision.\n\nSomeone attacked police headquarters, released prisoners and then someone will oppose us bringing in the Army. That\u2019s nonsense. Those against the Army coming should tell us where these criminals released from prison are. Sometimes, if you listen to people, you\u2019ll derail. Four years will be over and you\u2019ll become a governor who didn\u2019t do anything. You need to be a leader who does the right thing even if people will not see it initially. It is better to hate me when I am doing the right thing than to be blamed for life after leaving office. It is not blackmail. If you follow social media, I won\u2019t do anything. They fabricate things a lot.\n\nBefore you came to office, you knelt down and asked God for help. It is left for you and your conscience. In governance, there are two things. One is ensuring that your people benefit from your policies and the second one is managing public perception. The right thing to do is to ensure that these people are satisfied. Then adopt a strategic communication. You may say Hope didn\u2019t perform, but when you come to Imo, you see good roads. You\u2019ll see all the things I\u2019ve done. Gradually, those funding the propaganda will get tired. I won\u2019t be there forever. That\u2019s the idea.\n\nDuring the Anambra governorship election, there was a new political lexicon, \u2018Anambra is not Imo.\u2019 This was said to denigrate Imo people because of the manner you came to power. How do you feel when you hear such statements? Can you tell us the story of how you became governor?\n\nThere is a proverb in my place. As kids, whenever our parents sent us to the bush to fetch firewood and one of us brought the best and biggest, others who couldn\u2019t, will conclude that you entered the wrong bush. The case in Anambra is pathetic. If you remember, when I was made chairman of the campaign council, I deployed my contacts and goodwill.\n\nWhen I got to Anambra, I created a structure. Out of 30 House of Assembly members, 12 joined APC. These people campaigned and won elections before. Was it the Supreme Court that put them there? No. In the House of Representatives, I convinced eight out of 11 members to join APC. They were members of APGA and the PDP. We got 130 excos from various wards of APGA to join us. We got a serving senator to join us. We were able to talk to the deputy governor and he joined us. If there was a free and fair election, how can we not win? People should think twice.\n\nI don\u2019t want to join issues with anybody. Let anybody come out and say that these people who defected worked against us. I don\u2019t want to join issues with anybody. Let the institutions do their job.\n\nYou can\u2019t liken my case to the Anambra case. I didn\u2019t go to court after the elections to say I was rigged out. I only told the court that INEC conducted elections. We deployed our agents in 388 units. Even in my area of popularity, where I come from, 388 polling units\u2019 results were excluded. Our party agents came back with the results stamped by INEC. We saw clearly that we won the elections. We approached INEC and it didn\u2019t deny the results. It didn\u2019t give us any convincing explanation why the results were not included. We went to the tribunal. INEC came and confirmed the serial numbers on the results. They were the same with what they had. We issued a subpoena to the police. Every polling unit result is distributed to the police. That of police tallied with our own. INEC didn\u2019t deny it. It was only the PDP lawyers that said it was not from INEC. They can\u2019t speak for INEC. They said they were fake and we asked for the original, which they couldn\u2019t tender.\n\nThe lower court admitted the evidence, but it was ignored during judgement. We went to Appeal Court. They used their contacts to get their way. But one of the Justices wrote a minority judgement. He said INEC erred to have excluded our results. It was not a case of just that we overtook the man who claimed to have come first, but we had the spread required by law. But the announcement by INEC came from only five local governments. The PDP man didn\u2019t meet the spread. The votes he used in \u201cwinning\u201d the election came from one local government. I have refrained myself from talking about this issue, but blackmail won\u2019t stop. They\u2019re looking for a distraction.\n\nI like to be underrated. Many of my colleagues in politics don\u2019t know me. I\u2019m one of the most blackmailed politician in Nigeria. That\u2019s the kind of politics we play where we come from. I\u2019m concerned about legality and legitimacy. I can\u2019t remember any guber election from anywhere in the South that didn\u2019t get to the Supreme Court. The man saying that Anambra isn\u2019t Imo, did he not get to the Supreme Court in his own case? Getting to the Supreme Court is part of the electoral process. When you win, your opponents will take you to court. So, if the Supreme Court has confirmed us, is it now an offence?\n\nLet those whose elections were confirmed by the Supreme Court tell us why they accepted the judgement. We were here when a governor in Rivers State was declared by the Supreme Court. The man didn\u2019t even participate in the election. He ruled for eight years. Nobody made issue out of it. The people saying these things today are confused and not truthful to themselves. I think that God must take glory for giving the judiciary the wisdom to give us justice.\n\nAre there things you\u2019ve done that you regret as a person and if given another chance, you do them another way?\n\nI\u2019ve no regrets coming to be a governor. In the Senate, I had a different kind of challenge. I had to think through to get a bill to work. Coming to Imo State, I didn\u2019t imagine that I\u2019ll meet the kind of mess I inherited. The things we thought were on ground were missing. We have limited resources. That\u2019s why we can\u2019t accommodate any distractions. If I come back as a governor, I\u2019ll do the same things I have done so far. No regrets.\n\nAs a handsome man, how do you cope with women?\n\nI\u2019ve told you about my faith in God. As a Catholic, womanising isn\u2019t part of our creed. I lost my first marriage many years ago. I had to wait to pass through the Catholic process before I could remarry. During the period of waiting, if you are seen living recklessly, they\u2019ll not grant the request. All my five big children, I trained them as a single parent. I did school runs in Lagos. I was able to manage that. Today, those five kids are doing well. I trained them all alone.\n\nEnjoyment is a relative thing. You know with the kind of charisma that I have, people will conclude easily that because I always wear white, I like women. Those close to me can attest to my struggles and good way of life.\n\nYou said you don\u2019t keep enemies, but your relationship with Rochas Okorocha isn\u2019t pleasant. The way it is going, Okorocha may feel you\u2019re his enemy. Why has it been difficult to resolve issues with Okorocha?\n\nThat\u2019s not true. The day I was sworn in as governor, Okorocha was there. A few days after, he made a private visit to me and asked me to disband the commission of enquiry set up by Emeka Ihedioha. I asked him if there was a problem. I told him that the people wanted the job done and that we should let it stand. He said as a party man, I should disband it. He came back and sent people to call me.\n\nI\u2019m the man on ground. So much injustice was done to our people. You saw the jubilation that greeted the return of land to people. That\u2019s what he considers as an issue. The white paper came out and we saw everything. He wanted to forcefully gain entry into one of the property and he was stopped by security agents. There is a difference between private and public interest. Okorocha is not my enemy. But my relationship with him should not make me sin against God. I don\u2019t need anything. The only land I have was bought from a family. Government didn\u2019t give it to me. By January, I would have spent two years in office. I\u2019ve not allocated land any how. Those I\u2019ve given are for government institutions. I\u2019m not fighting Okorocha. You know I\u2019m older than him. As his elder brother, he should consult from time to time, according to the traditions of our people.\n\nYou said after one year in office, people will be shocked at what you\u2019ve done. Can you still say that now?\n\nDuring my one year anniversary in office, Catholic Archbishop of Owerri, Obinna, said something. The bishop disagreed with all former governors, but publicly, Bishop Obinna said I had shocked him. Many speakers said the same thing. It is not in my place to assess myself. I would have done better if not for this insecurity. I have awarded two major contracts worth over N60 billion to dualise roads from Orlu and from Okigwe, just like the one in Epe, Lagos. No governor since the creation of Imo State has been able to allocate such funds for road construction.\n\nMbakwe brought the water scheme. After about 27 years, I\u2019ve revived it. We are trying to do reticulation. It is servicing Owerri now. We want to replace the pipes with new ones. Ada Palms is running, doing over 100 tonnes of oil everyday. Efforts in agriculture, infrastructure, and others are going on. We are building 305 health centres. They\u2019ll start working next year. I\u2019ve paid all the counterpart funding of UBEC. We are working on new 105 model primary schools in 305 wards. When people have access to healthcare, good roads and schools, then there is prosperity.\n\nDid you ever think you could be governor before now?\n\nAll the roads in my community and electrification were done by me as an individual. I was just a businessman. At a time, I discovered that the best way to help people was to have a responsive government. I supported Governor Achike Udenwa. What an individual can do in 200 years, a government can do it in two minutes. I started sponsoring people. Sometimes, if you\u2019re not there, there is a limit to what you can go. In 2003, I tried and it didn\u2019t work under AD. I\u2019m 2007, I qualified for a run off and I was not successful and went back to Lagos. In 2011, I contested for Senate and won. I defeated a sitting senator and a former governor. My people know me. Those who are surprised that I convinced people in Anambra to join APC don\u2019t know me. If that election was done properly, we would have won. Sometimes, it is not about the product, but the ability of the salesman to sell.\n\nDo you think the Electoral Amendment Bill is what the president should sign?\n\nThe role of the Parliament is to make laws. We don\u2019t make laws just for today. Based on my experience as a parliamentarian, we have to make laws for today and tomorrow. The Electoral Act should guide our elections. If candidates must be sponsored by the political parties, it means the current amendment will be in conflict with the provisions of the constitution. Going to tell political parties that they must settle for direct primaries without minding if the parties can fund it is wrong. Many political parties can only afford indirect primaries.\n\nThe Electoral Amendment Bill is a good job, but restricting political parties to just one mode of primaries is undemocratic. They should open the political space for a broader inclusion. Not all parties can afford direct primaries. Political parties should be left to decide the mode of primaries they will take. I\u2019ve restrained myself from commenting on this matter. I think that the rights of political parties to field candidates in an election shouldn\u2019t be conditionally determined by a law. This action maybe null and void. People should not come and abuse positions given to them by the people.\n\nWhat informed your fashion style of white and what are the things that make you happy and sad?\n\nWhite represents purity. It means I want to be pure. When I see this white, I remember that I need to work toward being pure.\n\nWhat makes me happy is accomplishments. When I see expectations being met, I\u2019m happy. Disappointments make me sad. I believe that Nigeria can do better.\n\nWhat are your thoughts about how other countries treat Nigeria?\n\nImagine me in London and we were placed on a red list by the British Government. Why the rush? We are not treated fairly. I was the chairman of the Senate Committee on Aviation one time. I did an investigation then on the disparity between airfares to Nigeria and other countries. I discovered that a first class ticket from Heathrow to Accra was cheaper than an economy ticket from Nigeria to the same place. Whereas, from Accra to Heathrow is six hours, 40 minutes, from Nigeria, it\u2019s about six hours or less depending on where you are taking off from. It was during my time that the managing director of British Airways appeared before our Senate panel. I threatened to shutdown their operations in Nigeria. I wrote a letter to British Airways, which they sent to the British Prime Minister. The British PM sent it to President Goodluck Jonathan. Jonathan invited me and I explained to him why this was important. He obliged me.\n\nThe managing director of British Airways landed in Abuja with two senior lawyers from Lagos. I asked him why the charges were higher. I asked why there was no Nigerian pilot or a co-pipot in his fleet. There was also no building of British Airways in over 70 years. No investment. No major employment. It was just extortion. That week, they reversed it. I removed the 25 per cent aviation tax they charged. Two, three months later, they reversed again to the old order.\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates). Click Here to Apply .\n\nForeigners did everything to kill Arik Air.

          "text": "\u202213 countries add UK to their red list over Omicron cases\n\nFestus Akanbi in Lagos and Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja with agency reports\n\nThe federal government is planning to add the United Kingdom, Argentina, Canada, and Saudi Arabia to red list countries, following their decision to impose travel restrictions on Nigeria.\n\nAlso, as the United Kingdom imposed restrictive measures against Nigeria and other countries over the spread of the Omicron variant of COVID19, about 13 countries have also barred travellers from UK from entering their territories.\n\nThe UK had imposed travel restrictions on Nigeria, claiming that 21 cases of Omicron recorded in England were linked to travellers from Nigeria.\n\nBut the travel ban was trailed by global outrage with some national and international stakeholders describing it as racist and discriminatory.\n\nThe federal government had also condemned the decision of the UK, with the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, describing it as discriminatory, unfair, punitive, indefensible, and unjust.\n\nIn a leaked voice note obtained by THISDAY yesterday, the Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika, stated that the decision to ban these countries in retaliation would be made by the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) on COVID-19 latest by Tuesday.\n\n\u201cAlso, there is a case of Saudi Arabia, which put Nigeria on the banned list \u2013 no visa, no travel, et Cetra. So also Canada. So, today, there was a meeting, I participated in a zoom meeting, COVID-19 task force, just for your information also.\n\n\u201cWe have given our input in aviation, it is not acceptable by us and we recommend that those countries \u2013 Canada, the UK, Saudi Arabia, and Argentina be also put on Red List, as they did similarly to us.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t allow our citizens to go into their countries who are their airlines coming to pick from our country?\n\n\u201cSo, I am very sure that in the next few days, between now and Monday, or perhaps Tuesday, at maximum, all those countries will be put on the red list from the PSC (Presidential Steering Committee) from the task force of COVID-19. Once they are put on the red list, which means they are banned, of course, their airlines will be banned.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, we are going through a difficult moment, but we have to do it in the interest of our country,\u201d Sirika explained.\n\nFollowing the 21 cases of Omicron variant of COVID-19 reported in England, which were allegedly linked to travel from Nigeria, the United Kingdom had imposed travel restrictions on Nigeria.\n\nUnder this measure, the UK added Nigeria to the red list of countries from where people arriving must quarantine in a hotel for 10 days, to limit the spread of the Omicron strain of COVID-19.\n\nThis implies that the UK and Irish citizens arriving from Nigeria must isolate in a government-approved managed quarantine facility for 10 days, and receive two negative PCR tests, as further precautionary action is taken against the Omicron variant.\n\nA temporary travel ban was also introduced for all non-UK and non-Irish citizens and residents who have been in Nigeria in the last 10 days, meaning they were banned from entry into the UK.\n\nCanada and Saudi Arabia had also banned travellers from Egypt, Nigeria, and Malawi over fears of the spread of the new Omicron variant.\n\nMeanwhile, about 13 countries have also barred travellers from Britain from entering their territories.\n\nThe measures by the countries came in response to surging cases of Omicron variant in the UK.\n\nAgency reports monitored by THISDAY yesterday indicated that with reports of cases of new Omicron variant rising in the UK, some governments have taken measures to ban UK citizens from entering their countries.\n\nAccording to the latest information from the Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office in London, countries like Australia, Falkland Islands, Indonesia Buhutan, China, Israel, Japan, Laos, New Zealand, and Suriname have imposed travel restrictions on the UK.\n\nIn addition, Malaysia and Taiwan have banned the entry of British travellers and foreign nationals from entry.\n\nChinese authorities have also suspended all direct flights from the UK.\n\nThe Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) had announced that the country had recorded only six confirmed cases of the COVID-19 Omicron variant.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*To meet in Makurdi today after Ayu\u2019s reception\n\n*APC: PDP\u2019s sole intent is to grab power in 2023\n\nChuks Okocha and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nIn a bid to ensure that the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) emerges through a consensus arrangement, the governors elected on the platform of the party have undertaken two European tours in quick succession, THISDAY\u2019s investigation has revealed.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the governors held strategic meetings in those tours as part of their ongoing efforts to ensure that the issue of the presidential candidate of the party does not polarise its members along regional lines.\n\nThe investigation has also revealed that the governors were also billed to meet tonight in Makurdi, the Benue State capital, after a reception to be held in honour of the new Chairman of the party, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu.\n\nMeanwhile, the All Progressives Congress (APC) has said that Ayu\u2019s utterances during his inauguration have shown that the sole intent of the opposition party is to grab power by any means in 2023.\n\nThe first European tour by the PDP governors, it was learnt, was a visit to London moments after the October 30 and 31 national conventions while the second visit was a visit to Spain last week.\n\nThe first visit to London was said to have been undertaken by the governors of Rivers State, Chief Nyesom Wike; Mr. Seyi Makinde (Oyo); Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu (Abia), and Mr. Udom Emmanuel (Akwa Ibom).\n\nAmong the governors on the second trip to Spain were: Wike; Makinde; Ikpeazu; Ahmadu Fintiri (Adamawa); and Dr. Samuel Ortom (Benue).\n\nIt was also gathered that the governors of Bauchi State, Senator Bala Mohammed, and Sokoto State,\n\nHon. Aminu Waziri Tambawul did not attend the meetings due to their ongoing consultations on their presidential aspirations.\n\nA source privy to the strategic meetings told THISDAY last night that Governor Ortom is the architect of a consensus presidential candidate for the PDP and would host the meeting in Makurdi tonight.\n\nAccording to the source, the PDP governors while in London met a former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki.\n\nHe further disclosed that it was from London that Saraki arrived in Lagos last week to receive the Lagos APC members, who defected to the opposition party\n\n\u201cPDP governors from the South agreed at the London meeting that they must play a significant role in the choice of who will fly the party\u2019s presidential ticket,\u201d he said.\n\nHe further disclosed that because of Wike\u2019s relationship with Real Madrid Football Club, he travelled, in addition with other governors, with the Adamawa State governor, Fintiri who did not make the earlier London trip.\n\nReal Madrid has a football academy in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital.\n\nThe governors posed for photographs at Real Madrid\u2019s Santiago Bernabeu Stadium, which went viral.\n\n\u201cAt their Real Madrid meeting, the governors reiterated the need for a consensus presidential candidate to avoid the rancour that could emanate as a fall-out to an elective convention.\n\n\u201cBut the PDP governors have not agreed on any choice of a consensus candidate, whether from South or North,\u201d the source added.\n\nIt was gathered that the Governor of Sokoto State, Tambuwal, and his Bauchi State counterpart,\n\nMohammed was yet to buy into the idea of a consensus candidate.\n\nThe source, who was at the London and Real Madrid meetings, told THISDAY that Oyo State governor, Makinde, has also not bought into the idea of a consensus candidate.\n\nTambawul, it was gathered, said that he was still consulting on his presidential ambition and would soon come up with his decision.\n\nAt the swearing-in ceremony of the new members of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the PDP on Friday in Abuja, the campaign posters of both Tambuwal and Mohammed were struggling for the limited space at the International Conference Centre, the venue of the inauguration ceremony.\n\nAs part of the efforts to smoothen some rough edges on the consensus presidential candidate, the PDP governors will again meet in Makurdi after the reception for the new national chairman, Ayu.\n\nMeanwhile, a former Director-General of the PDP Governors\u2019 Forum, Osaro Onaiwu, has called on all PDP 2023 presidential aspirants to rein in on their aides and their supporters ahead of the 2023 presidential primary election of the party.\n\nThe founding DG of the PDP Governors\u2019 Forum harped on the need for a common front from across the various presidential camps of the party.\n\n\u201cForming a common front as we approach the 2023 presidential poll, even though from the various camps is essential in ensuring we go into the presidential election which is the ultimate for the party, as one house.\n\n\u201cTo this extent, I call on presidential aspirants of our great party, Peoples Democratic Party, to please ensure they show leadership by calling their followers and their aides to order, ahead of their campaigns.\n\nAs consultations and campaigns commence in earnest, I urge the presidential aspirants to do so with the spirit of sportsmanship, which is the hallmark of every democracy.\n\n\u201cAs a party seeking to take power at the centre and across all of the country, we can begin to show leadership now ahead of 2023, with the way we conduct ourselves ahead of the primaries. Every presidential aspirant of PDP is a leader and a potential president, only that we can have only one presidential candidate for the 2023 polls,\u201d Onaiwu said.\n\nNational officers who served as deputies in the immediate past National Working Committee of the PDP had warned the Ayu, to be wary of powerful forces in the party.\n\nThey warned that the strong party leaders who saw to his emergence could also remove him from office.\n\nAPC: PDP Only Desperate to Grab Power in 2023\n\nIn a related development, the APC has said that Ayu\u2019s utterances have shown that the sole intent of the opposition party is to grab power by any means in 2023.\n\nThe Secretary of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Senator John Akpanudoedehe, in a statement issued yesterday, said the new PDP leadership must prove to Nigerians that it is willing and ready to discard its penchant for impunity and not empty rhetoric of 2023 hand-over notes.\n\nHe said: \u201cGoing by the utterances and direction of the new PDP leadership, any hope of a re-focused opposition party expected to atone for misdeeds in the country when it was in government for 16 years and as a failed opposition party following PDP\u2019s sack in 2015 have now been quickly dashed.\n\n\u201cThe PDP\u2019s sole intent is power grabbing by any means, ignoring the need for genuine restitution, return of stolen public funds and assets still in possession of politically exposed persons during its 16-year administration and ultimately providing a truly viable and credible opposition our democracy needs to thrive.\u201d\n\nAkpanudoedehe noted that the Ayu-led PDP has shown early signs that it was not different from the immediate past leadership of the opposition party.\n\nHe added that the sit-tight syndrome headlined by the PDP\u2019s ill-fated third-term agenda has been discarded as an undemocratic template.\n\nHe said President Muhammadu Buhari had assured Nigerians and the international community of free and fair elections in 2023, even as he pledged a peaceful transfer of power, saying, \u201cthat is the stuff of true progressives and statesmanship.\u201d\n\nAkpanudoedehe stressed that the priority of this administration has been clearing the national rot left behind by the PDP\u2019s shambolic handling of insecurity in its early days, its financial heist under the guise of procuring military weapons, fuel subsidy rackets, diverted loans, voodoo economics, abuse of public institutions and electoral fraud.\n\nHe added that despite obvious challenges on the path, the Buhari\u2019s government is successfully clearing the rot and returning the country to its deserved place.\n\nAkpanudoedehe listed Buhari\u2019s efforts to include what he described as continuous electoral reforms and non-interference in the functions of INEC; institutional reforms which have ensured financial autonomy for local government councils; financial autonomy of state legislatures and judiciaries; assenting the long-delayed Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), among others.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "This may be African languages\u2019 best bet against extinction",
          "text": "The novelist Rita Mae Brown once said, \u201cLanguage is the road map of a culture. It tells you where its people come from and where they are going.\u201d If this is true, what then does an extinct language mean for its people? It means they have no culture, ancestral value, or true identity. As hyperbolic as this may sound, many languages have already gone extinct and more are predicted to join in the coming years.\n\nMore than 573 languages are extinct. The National Geographic Society says a language dies every two weeks, ceasing to be actively spoken. In Africa alone, at least 52 known languages have experienced either linguicide\u2014the death of a language due to natural or political reasons\u2014or glottophagy, which happens when a smaller language is absorbed in or replaced by a major language.\n\nIn another disturbing report, UNESCO data indicates that if no efforts are made to conserve them, half of the languages currently spoken today will be extinct by the end of the 21st century. How can this be avoided, especially for African languages? Some young Africans living and schooling in America are taking the lead in answering this question through their startup called Mandla, an app that helps people learn African languages.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nMandla, a Zulu and Xhosa word that means power, is an innovative e-learning language app created for those who seek to strengthen their connection with their African roots. The app combines education with gamification to create an enjoyable and effective experience. With the help of predictive AI, Mandla is able to personalise language lessons for all of its users.\n\nHow it started\n\nDuring the winter break of last year, Wenitte Apiou, a then freshman student of Electrical Engineering and Mathematics at the Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, shared the idea to build Mandla in a text to Boluwaji Odufuwa, another freshman studying Computer Science at Harvard University.\n\nApiou was born in Burkina Faso but moved to America when he was five. Odufuwa, on the other hand, was born in Nigeria but also moved to America in his early childhood. Because of their shared struggle with speaking and understanding their native language, Apiou\u2019s idea organically resonated with Odufuwa, and the duo launched into action.\n\nGrowing up, Apiou\u2019s family only spoke French\u2014Burkina Faso\u2019s official language\u2014and some English in the household. His parents are from two different ethnic groups: his mother speaks M\u00f2or\u00e9, the most spoken indigenous language in Burkina Faso; and his father speaks Kasem, a minority language spoken only by about 100,000 people in southern Burkina Faso and Northern Ghana.\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshots of Mandla app\n\n\u201cThe only language I\u2019m fluent in besides English is French, which makes it difficult to communicate with some of my older family members who never went to school and were not able to learn French fluently,\u201d Apiou told TechCabal in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s harder being in the United States as well. The only people that can help would have been my parents, and they did not speak those languages in the house.\u201d\n\nApiou was stuck in-between two foreign languages: French in the house and English everywhere outside the house. This is the reality of many young Africans, especially those who have parents of diverse ethnic backgrounds.\n\nEven though the idea had stuck with him since high school, Apiou couldn\u2019t do much because of school work and time barrier. He had some coding skills and had built two apps in high school, but he didn\u2019t want to start building the app and then drop it. So the winter break and the COVID-19 lockdown availed them the time to solve the problem for themselves and millions of young people in America and across the world.\n\nA diverse team building a diverse product\n\nAs the duo built, they realised they needed more diverse hands. After all, Africa has 54 countries and over 3,000 tribes. Building a diverse solution should involve a diverse team, they thought. So they sought more hands.\n\nEmeka Ezike, a sophomore Computer Science student at Harvard University, who also originally came from Nigeria, joined as the CTO. Kwesi Afrifa, born and raised in Ghana and an International student studying Computer Science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), joined to lead the web platform effort. Delanyo Mensah, a sophomore student of Human and Organisational Development at Vanderbilt University, originally from Ghana, joined to lead Mandla\u2019s growth and marketing team.\n\n\u201cWe brought a number of smart young Africans to join in the effort\u2014a few engineers and Delanyo, who\u2019s passionately pushing our growth, especially on TikTok where a bunch of our audience are,\u201d said Apiou.\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshots of Madla app\n\nToday, Mandla has grown into a 10-man core team. The startup also accepts volunteers that can help create learning content around the languages currently on its platform and upcoming ones.\n\nGrowth and challenges\n\nMandla currently has more than 15 languages including Nigeria\u2019s Yoruba and Igbo; Ghana\u2019s Twi; Ethiopian\u2019s Amharic; and East Africa\u2019s Swahili on its platform. According to Apiou, the plan is to continue adding more languages until they\u2019ve covered a large extent of African cultures.\n\nAs young founders, the natural thing is to find a way to scale on social media, and that\u2019s what the team has done; they are creating captivating content on social media, especially TikTok, which now houses over a billion users.\n\nThe app is currently growing organically and, according to Apiou, has 5,000 registered users, pegged at about 50 signups per day and about three to 400 daily active users.\n\nThe team thinks it\u2019s time to scale their technology and build a more powerful marketing strategy, from organic to paid. But the problem is funding. Apiou said they\u2019ve reached out to hundreds of investors to no avail.\n\nBut why no funding yet?\n\nApiou stated a number of reasons for this. One is \u201cbeing a black college student. In the United States, there aren\u2019t very many people looking to fund someone who has an unproven track record,\u201d he said, agreeing to his lack of experience as a major barrier. \u201cSecond is the domain, edtech. While there is a lot of VC interest in it, it\u2019s relatively new because many people don\u2019t see a path to profitability, or huge billion-dollar success for edtech companies,\u201d Apiou said.\n\nThis statement may not be completely correct, however, as there are a couple of unicorn edtech companies, like Udemy and Coursera, and even Duolingo, which is one of the startup\u2019s competitors.\n\nThe third Apiou raised is about niche: their product focuses on Africa and African languages and culture. He narrated their experience when they went to college pitch competitions. \u201cWe have not won a single pitch competition, despite the fact that\u2014and I mean no disrespect to the other teams\u2014our product has a more natural need and significant traction than some of the teams that beat us out.\u201d\n\nHowever, they have gotten some support from Angel Onuoha, a graduate of Harvard University, ex-Googler, and a serial entrepreneur who\u2019s somewhat popular for his bullish tweets on African tech.\n\nThe team believes that with more funding, they could build more tech stacks, hire more talent, and go full-frontal on their marketing efforts and then compete on a larger scale.\n\nUnlike other language learning apps that are including African languages just to check a diversity-and-inclusion box, Mandla\u2019s mission is deeper than educational or entertainment purposes; it\u2019s really about cultural preservation.\n\n\u201cAnd what better way to preserve a culture than to preserve its language?\u201d Apiou asked with the signatory laughter he had kept throughout the call.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "This article was contributed to TechCabal by Conrad Onyango, bird\n\nA preference for mobile money, the fast takeup of digital currencies, the growing allure of regulated cryptocurrencies among central banks and now, a call for a continental cryptocurrency. Could this spell the end of paper money in Africa?\n\nThe era of cash could be drawing to an end as central bank-backed digital currencies (CBDC\u201ds) takes root in Africa.\n\nThe cryptocurrency era\n\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly accelerated the use of cashless payments \u2013 mainly through mobile money platforms and online banking \u2013 the period has also ushered in widespread use of cryptocurrencies, with the result that digital currencies are fast becoming mainstream across the continent.\n\nEconomic and financial experts are the latest to rally behind the mainstreaming of cryptocurrencies through a call for a common African digital currency to spur trade and economic development post-pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe need to come up with a cryptocurrency that is acceptable to each member state. It\u2019s better to do it at the continental level, and we have the expertise to do it,\u201d Anouar Hassoune, Professor of Finance and CEO of the West Africa Rating Agency, told delegates at the 2021 African Economic Conference last week.\n\nSo far, it\u2019s only Nigeria that has launched an official, state-backed digital currency \u2013 christened the eNaira \u2013 on the continent as more countries continue to express interest.\n\nLast month, Tanzania\u2019s central bank joined a growing list of African countries to express the intention of launching its own, regulated digital currency, taking its cue from the rising adoption of cryptocurrencies and wanting to avoid \u2018being left behind.\u2019\n\nSouth Africa is currently piloting project Dunbar, an international financial settlement system that uses multiple central bank digital currencies, while Mauritius has a digital currency in the development stages.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nOther countries in Africa \u2013 including Kenya, Morocco, Tunisia and Ghana \u2013 are researching the best model to deploy in their jurisdictions, according to US think tank Atlantic Council\u2019s digital currency tracker.\n\nPanellists at last week\u2019s African Economic Conference, organized by the African Development Bank, the United Nations Development Programme, and the Economic Commission for Africa, said there would first need to be reform in the financial sector through harmonization of national rules and protocols governing the financial systems of individual countries, to make a pan-African cryptocurrency a reality.\n\n\u201cWe should not forget that there is a lot of work to be done on the digital infrastructure, the development of payment systems, payment system interoperability really needs to be worked on, so there is a lot of work to be done in collaboration with the financial institutions on digitalisation of delivery and payment channels,\u201d said Emmanuelle Riedel Drouin, head of the Economic and Financial Transition Department at Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement.\n\nA common cryptocurrency, Hassoune said, would ease the cost of doing business, give the continent an identity and serve as an alternative means to monetise some of the continent\u2019s endowments, such as gold and other commodities.\n\nNestcoin, a new African venture launched last month and headed by former Binance Labs director, Yele Bademosi, has set out to make cryptocurrencies mainstream across the continent, with a promise to make crypto accessible to anyone.\n\n\u201cThe power of crypto lies in its potential to circumvent poorly designed economic infrastructure and connect anyone to a global economy with access to unlimited financial opportunities,\u201d Bademosi said in a statement.\n\nNelly Chatue-Diop and her West African crypto startup, Ejara, made waves earlier this year with the biggest capital raise by a women-led startup in the sub-region, to date. Chatue-Diop\u2019s company provides users with a non-custodian crypto wallet (described in the industry has having your own \u201cbank\u201d) and the company\u2019s markting focus is on women in French-speaking West Africa.\n\nCurrently, three countries are driving the continent towards a cashless era, with a widespread use of both mobile money, or crypto adoption, or both, driven partly by the pandemic.\n\nThe Baobab Network has traced at least 60 cryptocurrency companies in Africa, with the majority (43 percent) of them headquartered in Nigeria, followed by South Africa (18 percent) and Kenya (11 percent).\n\nSimilarly, global digital payments solution provider Visa in a September report showed a growing preference for mobile wallets, particularly in Kenya (56 percent) followed by Nigeria (14 percent) and South Africa (7 percent).\n\nThis is affirmed by another comparative study by GSMA published in March 2021 showing more than half of 310 live mobile money services in 2020 across the globe were found in Africa.\n\nWith over 55 percent of the world\u2019s mobile money services recorded in Africa and a significant population turning to e-wallets and cryptocurrency, the question now becomes whether the continent might ditch paper money altogether.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "CinetPay, an Ivory Coast-based startup that enables merchants in francophone Africa to accept and make electronic payments online or via mobile Point of Sale (PoS) devices, on Wednesday said it has raised $2.4 million seed funding.\n\n4DX Ventures, a pan-African venture capital fund and Nigeria-based unicorn startup, Flutterwave are co-investors in the round.\n\nOn CinetPay\u2019s mobile and web-based platform, businesses can sign up to process payments from over 130 different payment operators\u2014including MTN mobile money, M-Pesa, Orange Money, Visa, Mastercard, etc\u2014via a single interface.\n\nCinetPay thus simplifies the process of accepting payments, eliminating the need for merchants to integrate with different systems for managing sales and revenues. Its solution, which can be integrated into merchant websites, is used by a wide array of businesses, from e-commerce platforms to digital public services, insurance companies, and schools.\n\nFounded by Idriss Monthe and Daniel Dindji in 2016, CinetPay claims to have processed over 30 million transactions for 350 active merchants in nine countries, including Ivory Coast, Senegal, Cameroon, Mali, Togo, Burkina Faso, Benin, and Guinea.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe seed investment is expected to boost CinetPay\u2019s sales and marketing efforts in the countries it operates across West and Central Africa.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve watched firsthand as thousands of merchants waste crucial time, even up to 6 months, getting their payment systems in order,\u201d CinetPay CEO and co-founder, Monthe, said in a statement. \u201cNow we\u2019ve got the resources to market and sell our solution across the region.\u201d\n\nFor Flutterwave, backing CinetPay\u2014a startup it\u2019s partnered with since 2019\u2014marks the unicorn\u2019s first direct investment in the francophone Africa region. According to Olugbenga Agboola, Flutterwave\u2019s founder and CEO, both startups have a \u201cshared vision to simplify payments on the continent.\u201d\n\nAll over Africa, the mobile money market is booming with West Africa being one of the fastest-growing regions in the continent.

          "text": "MainOne, a West African data centre and connectivity solutions provider with a presence in Nigeria, Ghana, and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is set to be acquired for $320 million by American multinational Equinix Inc., the US company said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nThe all-cash transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of next year, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions including the requisite regulatory approvals.\n\nFounded by Funke Opeke in 2010, MainOne is a key provider of enterprise connectivity solutions, with an estimated 800+ business-to-business customers. These include major international technology enterprises, social media companies, global telecom operators, financial service companies, and cloud service providers.\n\nThe company owns and operates an extensive submarine network extending 7,000 kilometers from Portugal to Lagos, Accra, and along the West African coast, with landing stations in Nigeria, Ghana, and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. These provide connectivity to and from Europe, West African countries, and the major business communities in Nigeria.\n\nMainOne also owns digital infrastructure assets that include three operational data centers, with an additional facility under construction expected to open in Q1 2022. These are in addition to key internet exchanges enabling low latency to key global networks, including Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Facebook.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, the management team, including CEO Opeke, will continue to serve in their respective roles.\n\n\u201cThe MainOne team is excited about the partnership created through the acquisition,\u201d Opeke said in the statement. \u201cWith similar values and culture to what we have built in 12 years, Equinix is the preferred partner for our growth journey and will accelerate our long-term vision to grow digital infrastructure investments across Africa.\u201d\n\nFor Equinix, a global specialist in data centres and internet connectivity, the deal marks the first step in a long-term strategy to become a leading provider of digital infrastructure in Africa.\n\nEquinix believes MainOne to be one of the most exciting technology businesses to emerge from Africa, making the acquisition a pivotal entry point for the US company into the continent.\n\n\u201cExpansion in Africa has long been a strategic priority for us. With MainOne, we have found a company that not only has highly complementary data center and connectivity assets but can further accelerate the expansion of our business model and growth objectives,\u201d said Eugene Bergen, EMEA President at Equinix.\n\nEquinix\u2019s data centres around the world.\n\nGiven the huge supply gap in digital infrastructure in sub-Saharan Africa, Ayobami Omole, a Lagos-based telecom analyst at Tellimer, expects more of such transactions in the coming years. \u201cDeals like the MainOne acquisition will keep drawing foreign investors\u2019 attention to the region,\u201d Omole told TechCabal over the phone.\n\nThe UN International Telecommunication Union (ITU) estimates SSA is home to approximately 700 million of the world\u2019s 3.7 billion people without access to the internet. More so, available infrastructure in the region is barely enough for the current internet users.\n\n\u201cWith increasing internet traffic, smartphone penetration, and digitisation, we can only expect demand for cloud services and digital infrastructure to increase with foreign players looking to plug that gap,\u201d Omole added.\n\nGlobally, Platform Equinix is comprised of 237 data centres across 65 metros and 27 countries, providing data centre and interconnection services for over 10,000 businesses, including more than 50% of Fortune 500 companies. When completed, the acquisition will extend Platform Equinix into West Africa.\n\n\u201cMainOne\u2019s leading interconnection position and experienced management team represent critical assets in our aspirations to be the leading neutral provider of digital infrastructure in Africa,\u201d added Charles Meyers, President and CEO of Equinix.\n\nMainOne\u2019s founding shareholders include Nigerian businessman and founder of Guaranty Trust Bank, Fola Adeola, MainStreet Technologies, the Africa Finance Corporation (AFC), Pan African Infrastructure Development Fund (PAIDF), First Bank, Polaris Bank, and the African Development Bank (AfDB).\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nAuthor Mu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 I bully myself because I make me do what I put my mind to.\n\n\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "Enterprise Hotel is democratising real estate investments for regular Africans",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLong before tech startups democratised investing in the stock market, anyone looking to invest in the stock market needed a significant amount of money. But that changed with the entrance of startups like Risevest, Bamboo, and Chaka.\n\nFor the first time, Nigerians could buy stocks with as little as $10 (\u20a65,000). Although most stocks available are of foreign companies, that innovation provided Nigerians with a way to invest small sums of money.\n\nSimilarly, Airbnb upended the hospitality industry when it made it possible for individuals to rent out their homes. In the process, it allowed people to get a slice of the pie that is the hospitality industry.\n\nHelping Africans to own commercial real estate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn some ways, owning a property is the Nigerian dream. However, the absence of suitable mortgage or financing options means one would require a considerable upfront investment to live their dream. With only 2% of Nigerians reportedly having up to \u20a6500,000 ($870) in bank deposits, owning a property is out of reach for most people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFractional investment startup, Enterprise Hotel, hopes to change this by offering Africans the opportunity to invest in commercial real estate with as little as \u20a630,000 ($52).\n\nLike the model used by investment tech startups, individuals can now own properties with minimal investments. The startup offers three product classes, the first being the room sale. Under this arrangement, individuals can outrightly purchase a room.\n\nThe block sale is the second level, and for this, Enterprise Hotel divides a room into ten blocks, allowing people to purchase each block. So, if the price for a room has been set at \u20a630 million, for instance, a block would cost \u20a63 million.\n\nThe unit sale is the last unit, and with this, Enterprise Hotel divides the room into a thousand parts. Consequently, it becomes easy for more people to purchase real estate regardless of their income levels.\n\nHow Enterprise Hotel makes money\n\nEnterprise Hotel makes money in two ways. The first is via the sale of the rooms and the second is through a management fee paid by the investors. With the management fee, Enterprise Hotel covers management costs, including recruitment on behalf of the investors.\n\nSo why real estate? Uche Ajaere is the co-founder and CEO of Enterprise Hotel. You may recognise the surname, and that\u2019s because he\u2019s a director of GIG Group.\n\nWhile the GIG Group is popularly known for the transport company, GIGM, it also has investments in other industries, including real estate. For over eight years, Uche has been involved in the operations of the real estate division. Simultaneously, he has kept an eye on developments in Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nHis time working in real estate showed him that only a handful of people could afford to buy or own real estate. In Lekki, Lagos State, a four-bedroom duplex costs about \u20a6100 million ($173,913). This is out of the reach of most Nigerians who earn less than \u20a6150,000 ($300) annually.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a result, he decided on a startup that gives people a chance to own real estate regardless of how much they have.\n\nChallenges and competition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of the growth in Nigeria\u2019s startup space has been in fintech, with a handful of other industries represented. The real estate sector has seen very little innovation, with startups like Spleet and Muster attempting to solve the issue of rent for Nigerians.\n\nOne reason for this is that technology does not entirely solve the problems in real estate. At best, it only aids processes. Unlike other sectors, the barrier to entry in real estate is high. In addition, it could take as much as 15 years for investors to see a return on their investments. Consequently, it is not surprising that there is less investment going into real estate compared to other industries.\n\n\u201cPeople within the technology space will always think, \u2018how affordable is it to get this product? And how fast am I going to make my profit?\u2019\n\n\u201cWith the promise of higher returns in other industries, why would anyone want to invest in real estate,\u201d Uche asks.\n\nThis high entry barrier is what Enterprise Hotel is working to eliminate. If, for example, a room in an Enterprise Hotel is going for \u20a630 million ($52,173), when it is split into 1,000 units, that amounts to about \u20a630,000 ($60), which is a lot more affordable for most Nigerians.\n\nIn addition to affordability, Enterprise Hotel says it offers investors an opportunity to get a return on their investment within two to four years. That\u2019s impressive because it takes about 15 to 20 years for most real estate acquisitions to return the initial capital outlay.\n\nEnterprise Hotel provides its investors with several ways to earn. The primary route is through hotel bookings. However, that is not all, as investors can make money from every activity that takes place in the rooms they own as well as other services offered in the hotel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, for example, if a guest eats, drinks, or pays for dry cleaning services in the room, the investors also earn a cut of the earnings.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all. One of the reasons many Nigerians buy land is that it often increases in value. Uche reveals that investments done through Enterprise Hotel would be evaluated with the value reflected on the app. Investors can also sell their properties, although Enterprise Hotel would require that they be given the right of first refusal on any property.\n\nAlready, Enterprise Hotel has properties in Lagos, Abuja, Benin, and Port Harcourt, with plans to add more across Nigeria. Uche reveals that the goal is to have an Enterprise Hotel in every major city in the world.\n\nFor Enterprise Hotel, building in a sector with little or no examples to follow could be tough. While there are startups currently offering fractional investment services in Nigeria, the majority are in the financial services space. Yet, a lot can be learnt from their success.\n\nAlthough Enterprise Hotel\u2019s model could see them offer real estate investment for as little as \u20a630,000 ($60), that is still a significant investment for most Nigerians. While the ability to invest small amounts is attractive, the reality is that the returns earned on such investments would be small, and this could discourage potential users. Therefore, it may be that the key to Enterprise Hotel\u2019s success lies in serving a market with higher disposable income.\n\nAttracting investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding a startup like Enterprise Hotel requires enormous investments. So far, Enterprise Hotel has run without institutional investment. Uche discloses that while they are open to receiving investments, at the moment, the focus is on building significant traction before approaching investors.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not just selling an app like other startups. We want to make sure that in the next few months when we\u2019re talking to investors, we\u2019ll be talking based on value. We want to show them the first set of hotels that we have built and investors who\u2019ve bought into them and are already making money. Then we can start talking to investors.\u201d\n\nAside from helping more people gain access to real estate investments, Enterprise Hotel indirectly solves another problem. Uche reveals that users can use it as collateral when applying for loans since they own the properties outrightly.\n\nIn Nigeria, where Enterprise Hotel operates, traditional banks have typically shied away from offering loans to individuals outside their preferred high net worth group. And in cases where they are willing to do so, they require collateral. Enterprise Hotel offers users a way out. They can now invest in real estate while using the assets as collateral.\n\nBuilding a business of any sort is challenging. For Enterprise Hotel, operating in the real estate industry with its high financial requirements poses a significant hurdle.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi there,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nHow Adedeji Olowe initiated open banking in Nigeria\n\nNominees for Techpoint Awards 2021\n\nOther exciting news out of Africa\n\nAdedeji Olowe and the concept of open banking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdedeji Olowe\n\nIf you follow the Nigerian tech scene, chances are you know who Adedeji Olowe is. For me, his name comes to mind whenever I hear or say the words fintech or finance.\n\nFor real? Oh yeah, Olowe has a wealth of experience in finance. He was an early advisor to Wallets Africa, used to be on the TeamApt board, and has spent over a decade in traditional finance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, Olowe did not study anything finance-related. His first and Master\u2019s degrees were in engineering.\n\nBut despite having an academic background devoid of finance, Olowe thrived in the space. From building an intranet platform at Standard Trust Bank to his data analytics system at Access Bank, he quickly became a force.\n\nHowever, the open banking system is arguably one of his most significant achievements. The system helps fintechs integrate with banks seamlessly, reducing a process that should have taken months to a day.\n\nBut what exactly is open banking, and how did one man get the Central Bank of Nigeria and every commercial bank in the country to \u201clike the idea.\u201d\n\nWell, Olowe took the first step and was surprised by the outcome.\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole had a chat with the finance expert, and he dished about his career, life, and the open banking system.\n\nRead: Adedeji Olowe is building a global reputation as Africa\u2019s open banking leader\n\nAnd the nominees are\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy now, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard about the biggest tech event in West Africa \u2014 Techpoint Build 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, we\u2019ve got news for you.\n\nNominees for Techpoint Awards (Nigerian edition) are out!

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigeria-based mobility giant, GIGM, has launched a payment service for its users. This is the first of many services that the company intends to offer as it moves towards being a one-stop-shop for the needs of its customers.\n\nIn September 2019, the company revealed a slight name change, replacing \u2018Motors\u2019 with \u2018Mobility\u2019 as it looked to expand its offerings. Two years after that, it says it is redefining mobility to mean access rather than just movement.\n\nOver a chat with Techpoint Africa, Okhae Enahoro, the company\u2019s new CEO, said, \u201cWhen you look at the word mobility, it means the ability to move freely. Movement in itself may not necessarily mean physically transporting yourself from one place to another.\n\n\u201cIt just basically means advancement. It can mean growth. So when you look at these definitions, you realise that we\u2019re trying to enable lifestyles, so we want to bring services to people that allow them to do things easily.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor now, this service will only be available in Nigeria \u2014 GIGM\u2019s headquarters \u2014 and will allow users to make payments for airtime, electricity bills, cable TV, and Internet data. However, there are plans to launch in other African countries over the next few years.\n\nThe beginnings of a super app?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGozem riders (\u201cChampions\u201d). Source: Supplied\n\nThe super app model has gained popularity in emerging economies following the successes of WeChat and Alipay in China. Several startups have sprung up, especially in Asia, to replicate the model.\n\nIn Africa, Opay, Gozem, Safeboda, and Gokada have positioned themselves as super apps with varying degrees of success, and this latest feature could see GIGM becoming the newest entrant in this space.\n\nTypically, super apps start by offering a core service through which they get a foothold and can provide an array of services to the customer.\n\nThis service could be food delivery, transportation, or payments. For GIGM, this could be building on its tech-enabled transportation platform to offer payment services to its users.\n\nHowever, because its services are mainly for long-distance travel, the company would have to include more services than it currently offers to gain more customers.\n\nA look at its mobile app would provide some insight into how this could work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA screenshot of the GIGM app\n\nOne of the options on the app is called Danfo, named after the famous yellow buses in Lagos State. Tapping on it would redirect you to the app store to download the app.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDanfo is the company\u2019s bus-hailing platform that allows users to book intra-city rides. Although the service is not yet live, it provides insights into the company plans and could see it come up against Shuttlers and Treepz.\n\nLite from GIGM is another offering that will enable the company to onboard new users. Nigeria\u2019s fragmented transportation services mean that users cannot travel comfortably over short distances.\n\nWith Lite, the company plans to provide users with the ability to make short journeys outside a city that would ordinarily not be undertaken by ride-hailing services such as Uber and Bolt.\n\nEven with these offerings, ride-hailing could be the fastest way to attract many users and see it come up against Uber and Bolt.\n\nWith the large war chest available to these two startups in the form of venture capital, it would be a considerable challenge for the company. However, if there is any local player capable of pulling this off, it is GIGM.\n\nIn recent years, the company has focused on developing its technology offerings, deploying data across the business. Its understanding of the local business terrain gained over 20 years of operation gives it an advantage that other local companies lack.\n\nFor super apps to thrive, they must have a robust and frequent core use case, a good payment system, and relevant services close to the core use case.\n\nWith its position as a leading transportation service provider and the addition of a payment option, the company looks to be on the right path. However, the new services it offers could play a role in its success or failure.\n\nNigeria\u2019s low smartphone and Internet penetration also mean that more people would be using the Internet or smartphones for the first time every year. Providing these groups with relevant services could hold the key to success.\n\nAuthor Chimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "With effect from Tuesday, December 14, the Federal Government will restrict airlines coming from Canada, the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia into Nigeria.\n\nMinister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, announced the decision on Sunday in Lagos and explained that it was to reciprocate restricted flights from Nigeria into those countries over the new COVID-19 variant, Omicron.\n\nThe development is part of the decision taken at a meeting of the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) on COVID-19.\n\nSirika said President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration would also place the United Kingdom, Canada and Saudi Arabia on a red list over the outbreak and spread of the Omicron variant.\n\nThe minister noted that if those countries placed Nigeria on a red list, they lacked a moral right to have their airlines fly into Nigeria on commercial operations.\n\n\u201cThere is also the case of Saudi Arabia that put Nigeria on the ban list. On Sunday, I participated in a meeting with the COVID-19 task force. We have given our input that it is not acceptable by us and we recommended that Canada, the UK, Saudi Arabia and Argentina should also be put on the red list.\n\nRead also: Omicron: UK adds Nigeria to its travel red list\n\nThe UK had on November 4, added Nigeria to its red list and imposed a travel ban, citing the Omicron variant.\n\nBritish health minister Sajid Javid, who announced the development, had said Nigeria was second only to South Africa in terms of Omicron cases linked to travel.\n\nCanada and Saudi Arabia had also banned flights and Nigerians from coming into their countries.\n\nNigeria has signed Bilateral Air Service Agreement (BASA) with over 90 countries.\n\nHowever, over the years, stakeholders have lamented that most air agreements between Nigeria and other countries have been one-sided as Nigerian airlines have been unable to reciprocate the agreements due to what they termed, \u201caero-politics\u201d.\n\nAccording to Sirika, Nigeria can no longer fold her hands to overlook the sovereignty of over 200 million of her citizens being taken for granted.",

          "title": "Why Nigerians must vote in 2023",
          "text": "\u201cI can\u2019t remember when last I voted in Nigeria,\u201d a female private school principal in Lagos told BusinessDay on condition of anonymity.\n\nShe however, said that she has her Permanent Voter\u2019s Card (PVC) for any \u201ceventuality.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have always tried to get those national documents that may be needed in critical situations, but not to use them for anything like voting,\u201d she said.\n\nOn her reason for not participating in real voting, despite possessing the PVC, she said: \u201cNigeria is like a hell. Sometimes you wonder if those in power are human beings. They don\u2019t have human heart. So, what is the point going to waste my time voting for a government that neither benefit me nor my family? The saddest part of it all is that whether it is PDP or APC, it is the same story.\u201d\n\nThe woman, who is in her early 50s, also said: \u201cThere is no evidence of government in my entire life as you can see. I went to school on my sweat; I have been working and paying the bills of my children education. I source for the water we use; pay high cost of electric bills, high rent, there are no roads, name it; it is all about sad story anywhere one turns. My husband lost his job owing to bad economy and the company could no longer cope; yet we hear about billions of naira, dollars and other currencies being stolen by those in government. So, tell me, what is the essence of voting?\u201d\n\nThe experience narrated above is widespread in Nigeria. Many citizens have grown weary of voting and that accounts for the increasing voter apathy the country is experiencing since the 2015 elections.\n\nRead Also: 2023: Don\u2019t sit on the fence\n\nNigeria in the last 6 years\n\nBefore the return to civilian rule in 1999, most Nigerians were helplessly enduring many years of servitude by the junta, which as expected, never cared if the \u2018ordinary civilians\u2019, as they derogatorily refer to the masses, are dead or alive.\n\nSadly, 22 years after the return of civil rule, the masses are seeing worse treatments than in all the military regimes of the 70s and 80s put together.\n\nThe talk of the \u2018good all days\u2019 sound fable, while the masses have lost faith in the leadership of the country, especially in the last six years.\n\nIf there are truly dividends of democracy, the masses have not tasted such in the last six years; rather they have been fed with stone in the place of bread and blood in place of water.\n\nThe facts are there.\n\nWith two recessions in the last six years, the economy has been in a very bad shape, with the government helpless at any time it happens.\n\nIn the last six years, foreign exchange has been more volatile, with Naira losing stability of N160 to the American dollar speedily to about N560 today. In the last six years, which captures the present administration, inflation has risen unimaginably, food security is fable, insecurity has taken deadlier dimensions, corruption, which the government swore to fight, is fighting back and winning more converts, poverty is preeminent as the country infamously ranks as the world capital of poverty today.\n\nFor those who encourage the youths to vote in the 2023 elections, there are many reasons not to step out as Nigerian unemployment ranks among the highest in the world at 33.3 percent.\n\nAt 33.3 percent unemployment rate, it means 23.2 million of the about 70 million people who should be working in Nigeria are out of work and these are mainly youths who the government said it is after their future, amid promises of job creation, which are never fulfilled.\n\nOf course, the country is witnessing a very high inflation rate, the worst in six years. Though the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) claimed that Nigeria\u2019s annual inflation rate fell for the seventh straight month to 15.99 percent in October of 2021, from 16.63 percent in September, food prices are still rising daily at a very high percentage in the last six years.\n\nRecently, the NBS reported that the annual food inflation rate rose for the 24th consecutive month to 20.75 percent in October from 20.71 per cent in September this year, owing to further increases in the prices of basic food items.\n\nThere is no need to ask for what the plights of the masses are now. They are getting poorer daily, one square meal difficult, quality education and healthcare far out of their reach.\n\nWith a bag of rice going from less than N10,000 six years ago, to about N30,000 now, fuel pump price being increase more than four times in the last six years, garri now out of the reach of the poor, and building materials untouchable, many are hungry and homeless, and millions have fallen into that category in the last six years.\n\nAccording to the UN Development Programme (UNDP) new study on the war and its effect on livelihoods published this year, over 350,000 have been killed in the 12-years violence in the North East of Nigeria, with more deaths in the last six years.\n\nAccording to data obtained from the Nigeria Security Tracker (NST), a project of the Council on Foreign Relations\u2019 Africa programme, in the first six weeks of 2021, over 1, 525 persons were killed across the country.\n\nThe 1,525 deaths are about half of the 3,188 lives lost between January and December 2019, according to a report by Global Rights.\n\nYet, farmers-herders clashes took a deadlier turn in the last six years, with the class resulting in 10 deaths more than Boko Haram killings in the past six years.\n\nCurrently, Nigeria is the third country most impacted by terrorism, according to Global Terrorism Index 2020 after Afghanistan and Libya.\n\nSadly again, Nigeria increased to 149 out of 180 countries in 2020 from 146 in Corruption Perceptions Index of Transparency International, while observers worry that the country will top the rank before the present administration, which claims to fight corruption, finishes its tenure in 2023.\n\nThe worst still is the rise in religious intolerance and fanaticism as seen in Boko Haram Islamic sect, tribalism, nepotism, among other forms of injustice that have divided the country. As many rightly observed, \u201cNigerian has been more divided in the last six years than in its 61 years as a nation.\u201d\n\nWith all these constraints, electioneering in the country is hugely impacted as many see no reason to vote, when their votes will not count, when their region is neglected, when campaign promises will never be fulfilled and when the masses have overtime given up on the leadership and the country\u2019s brand of democracy.\n\nVoting the only way out\n\nDonatus Okonkwo, founder, Tetrazzini Group of Companies, recently admonished Nigerians that \u201cGetting involved is the only solution. You don\u2019t have to like politics, you have to get involved.\u201d\n\nIn its recent newsletter, EnoughisEnough (EiE), a non-governmental organisation in Nigeria, advised: \u201cDo Not Just Register, Vote!\u201d\n\nIt further said: \u201cCompleting the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) process is a demonstration of your intention to participate in the elections! However, when intent is not converted to action on Election Day, the results can be far reaching.\u201d\n\nBut no matter how genuine the reasons for not taking part in electoral processes in the country, Nigerians have been urged to change the habit in 2023 in order to have a change of narrative.\n\n\u201cOften times, we hear people say \u2018let them go do their voting; I will not get involved\u2019. But these are the same people that would turn around to complain about a government they did not take part in putting into power. Bad governance can be checked at the polling unit. It is not enough to register and collect a Permanent Voter\u2019s Card (PVC) as many Nigerians do today, but they really do not vote on Election Day. 2023 is approaching and presents another opportunity for Nigerians to vote in those they believe have the capacity to turn things around positively,\u201d Tony Uwa, a political scientist, said.\n\nUwa noted that looking at the situation of things in the last few years, it is difficult to convince anybody to go vote, but that \u201cthings can get worse if people decide not to vote. Nigeria is in a critical situation that it must have to be rescued by every well-meaning citizen. This can only be done by our votes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny sincere person who lives in Nigeria in the last six years will tell you that things have gone bad terribly. The killings along going on a daily basis; abduction and all manner of criminality is mindboggling. In my entire life, I have never seen a thing like that. So, there are too many reasons for every Nigerian to go vote in 2023. Nigerians must take back their country. And there is the need for us to have a breath of fresh air; we are really suffocating,\u201d he further said.\n\nElectioneering is a major component of democracy. It is the main yardstick used to determine the level upon which countries in the international system have been able to embrace social equality.\n\nThis process presents the citizens of a given country the opportunity to decide who represents them in governance at the local, state and national levels. It is therefore unarguable that elections are very fundamental to the stability of democracy, as it regulates representation of popular will.\n\nHowever, despite the progress Nigeria has made in its democratic quest in the last two decades, the general lack of interest among Nigerians in exercising their civic responsibility and voting to elect who leads them is widely acknowledged.\n\nIn Nigeria, it is common for people to feel nonchalant and lack concern about the electoral process; the situation has however, become a source of concern to the stakeholders and electoral umpire.\n\nA vivid picture of the situation could be seen in the 2019 general elections where incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari was re-elected with the backing of 15.2 million voters, his main rival Atiku Abubakar also scored 11.3 million votes.\n\nPresident Buhari had 56% of the total votes cast, in a country with a population of close to 200 million people, including more than 84 million registered voters.\n\nHowever, observers say that the 15.2 million votes hardly qualify as a huge mandate. The 35% voter turnout was down from 44% in the 2015 general elections and down from the 54% turnout in 2011.\n\nThe situation is the same for other forms of election in Nigeria; this can be seen in the July 24 council poll in Lagos State, in which the total number of votes cast was 678,324 out of over 6 million registered voters in the state.\n\nPundits say that the lack of inclusion, especially the youth population in the electoral process, and the feeling that whoever wins, nothing would change, the corrupt and fraudulent manner elections are conducted in Nigeria has played a significant role in exacerbating apathy among Nigerians.\n\nThey advised that there was the need for stakeholders to carry out more political education among the electorate, especially during major elections.\n\n\u201cNigerians must come to vote, because when you don\u2019t vote, don\u2019t complain when someone who is not fit is elected. But I think the situation is becoming a crisis, it has gone from bad to worse now when you look at the figures of people who voted in recent elections.\n\n\u201cLook at the recent Anambra election, even the by-election held recently. What is the number of people voting? It is a problem that needs a holistic appraisal, we know Nigerians are not happy with governance; also increased violence during elections played a part in scaring people away,\u201d political analyst Kunle Okunade said.\n\nOkunade added that the government must restore voters\u2019 confidence by delivering on good governance and educating the voters and creating awareness before major elections.\n\n\u201cThese are some of the issues and the authorities must deal with it and carry out education of the electorate, increase information before election\u201d, political analyst Kunle Okunade added.\n\nSimilarly, lamenting the poor voter turnout in last July 24 Lagos council elections, the chairman of the Lagos State Independent Electoral Commission (LASIEC), Justice Ayotunde Phillips (rtd) acknowledge that the commission needs to intensify her voter education strategy to improve on the number of voters\u2019 turnout in subsequent elections.\n\n\u201cThe commission would have her voter education strategy to better improve on those numbers in subsequent elections,\u201d Phillips said.\n\nEddy Olafeso, a former national vice chairman South-west of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) warned that though successive governments had failed Nigeria over the years, there was the need for Nigerians to change their attitude because it is only their vote they can make meaningful change they sort.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI know over the years the government has failed Nigerians, but we can\u2019t keep folding our hands, feeling less concerned during elections, would it help anybody? It is through your vote that you can make that change, it is your voice.\u201d\n\nBuhari should sign the amended Electoral Bill\n\nMounting an advocacy on the Electoral Bill, EiE Nigeria urged President Muhammadu Buhari to give his assent without further delay.\n\nIn its newsletter released Friday night, titled: \u2018Why is the President silent?\u2019 EiE quoted its \u2018Yemi Adamolekun, executive director, as saying: \u201cIt is clear that until Nigerians understand their rights and responsibilities and use that knowledge to hold government accountable, our society will continue to be unjust.\u201d\n\nIt noted that the Electoral Bill had been transmitted to the President by the National Assembly since November 19, 2021, with no response whatsoever from Mr. President. It wondered \u201cWhy the cryptic silence?\u201d\n\nAccording to the group, \u201cTo further complicate matters, the Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, allegedly stated that the reputation of President Muhammadu Buhari would not diminish whether he passes the electoral amendment bill or not. What a joke!\u201d\n\nThe group also wondered if\n\n\u201cOur leaders are up to another mischief.\u201d\n\nIt further said: \u201cChapter 4, Section 58(1) of the Nigerian 1999 Constitution (as amended) provides the National Assembly with the power to transmit a bill passed by the House to the President to sign within 30 days of receipt.\n\n\u201cAgain, Chapter 4, Section 58(5) of the Constitution states that if the President refuses to sign, and the bill is again passed by each House, by a two-thirds majority, the bill shall become law, and assent of the President shall not be required.\n\nDecember 19th is only 9 days away!\n\nYour reputation is already at stake, Mr. President! Break the silence!\u201d",
          "summary": "For those who encourage the youths to vote in the 2023 elections, there are many reasons not to step out as Nigerian unemployment ranks among the highest in the world at 33.3 percent.\nIt is not enough to register and collect a Permanent Voter\u2019s Card (PVC) as many Nigerians do today, but they really do not vote on Election Day.\n2023 is approaching and presents another opportunity for Nigerians to vote in those they believe have the capacity to turn things around positively,\u201d Tony Uwa, a political scientist, said.\nSo, there are too many reasons for every Nigerian to go vote in 2023.\n\u201cNigerians must come to vote, because when you don\u2019t vote, don\u2019t complain when someone who is not fit is elected.",

          "text": "More pain for Nigerian states as FAAC shrinks by N68bn in November\n\nThe ability of Nigerian states and other tiers of government to meet their various obligations is under more risk as gross monthly distribution by the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) to the three tiers of government dropped by N68billion in November.\n\nFAAC allocation to the three tiers of government and public agencies amounted to N671.9bn ($1.62bn) in November (from October revenue), a decrease of 9.2 percent from the previous payout.\n\nData by Coronation Merchant Bank shows that the 9.2 percent decline in November FAAC was due to the decrease in the revenue from companies\u2019 income tax (CIT), petroleum profit tax (PPT), value-added tax (VAT), oil and gas royalties. Only excise duty recorded an increase over the previous month.\n\nThis means various state governments already impacted by low internal revenue may find it difficult to pay government workers or meet electorate promises without enough remittance from NNPC which form a large chunk of revenues shared at the FAAC meetings in Abuja.\n\nRead Also: Publish FAAC disbursements for past 3months, BudgIT tells NBS\n\nBreak down of the report by Coronation revealed that the FGN received a total of N284.3billion, state governments received N209.8billion, including N21.5billion representing the 13 percent derivation for the few oil-producing states and LGCs received N156.3billion.\n\nThe continuous decline in Nigeria\u2019s FAAC allocation to the three tiers of government is also due to the subsidy payment, according to market analysts.\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has been deducting from its remittance to FAAC, a threat to the ability of many Nigerian states and other tiers of government to meet their financial obligations.\n\n\u201cSince June \u201921, the corporation has deducted a total of N939bn from its FAAC remittance. It disclosed that it would deduct its October \u201821 value shortfall of N199bn from its November \u201821 proceeds,\u201d Chinwe Egwim, Chief Economist, Coronation, said.\n\nThe continuous payment of subsidy on petroleum products is likely to reduce the amount the government allocates to states and local governments as well as increase public debt, according to the Nigeria Economic Summit Group (NESG).\n\nThe private sector-led think-tank and policy advocacy group said if the federal government continues to pay the subsidy on refined petroleum products; it could push Nigeria into a debt extension by the end of 2021.\n\n\u201cIncessant payment of subsidy on refined petroleum products would narrow FAAC allocations and widen the country\u2019s budget deficit. If this continues, the action could push Nigeria into a Debt Overhang\u201d by the end of 2021,\u201d the Lagos-based non-profit organization said.\n\nWhile Nigeria continues to channel huge resources to funding petrol subsidies, the country largely depends on borrowing to finance its capital and recurrent expenditure annually.\n\nNigeria\u2019s widening budget deficit has pushed the country\u2019s debt profile to jump 81 percent in four years to N35.465 trillion as of June 2021 from N19.636 trillion in 2017.\n\nAs of June 30, 2021, the Debt Management Office (DMO) says Nigeria\u2019s total public debt amounted to N35.47 trillion (about 86.5 million dollars).\n\nWhile crude oil prices rose by nearly 45 percent from January\u2019s price of $54.77 per barrel to $84.02 in November, Nigeria\u2019s petrol subsidy costs have risen 10 times faster at 488 percent, wiping out the gains of higher oil prices.\n\nThe Federal Government spent an estimated N149.28 billion subsidizing petrol in August, an increase of 488 percent compared with the N25.37 billion spent in January.\n\n\u201cThe federal government reluctant to regulate the downstream sector or even try to reduce the price of petrol has reflected market reality that has continued to be on the deficit on government revenue because the amount they need to subsidize PMS has continued to rise,\u201d Ayorinde Akinloye, Associate Investment Research in United Capital, said.\n\nAccording to Abdulazeez Kuranga, economist, Cordros Securities, the issue of subsidy payment was not in the budget when it was presented by the minister of finance, which means NNPC will continue to deduct the subsidy, and it will affect what NNPC will be remitting to FAAC, which in turn will limit what will be remitted to the government.\n\nWhile Nigeria has, for years, depended on borrowing to fund its revenue shortage, the World Bank says implementation of tax reforms, rationalization of generous concessions, expenditure can help the cash-strapped country raise as much as N10 trillion.\n\n\u201cIn the next three years, such measures can raise the tax-to-GDP ratio to about 7 percent and bring in as much as N10 trillion,\u201d the Washington-based lender said.",

Energy requirement that will keep Lagos economy on the path of growth, Sanwo-Olu noted, has far exceeded the current 1,000 megawatts being supplied from the national grid, necessitating the move to explore alternative sources.\n\nHe said: \u201cGiven Lagos State\u2019s status as the commercial nerve-center and economic hub of Nigeria, it is our firm belief that the attainment of universal electricity access in the State would accelerate the same across other parts of the country. Increased electricity access is one of the priority mandates of this administration, given its significance in driving sustainable economic development.\n\n\u201cThere will be no economic development without sustainable energy. The economy needs energy to run and our objective as a Government is to deliver sustainable, reliable and affordable electricity to all Lagosians. The electricity policy being unveiled today does not only articulate the problems in the sector, it is also futuristic in the implementation of its provisions.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu said the State would ramp up procurement of pre-paid meters for distribution to residents as part of the implementation of the electricity policy. This, he said, would promote transparency in the supply chain, while curbing electricity theft and discouraging estimated billing from the suppliers.\n\nThe Governor stressed that the set objectives of the electricity policy would only be realisable if the private partners showed equal commitment as the Government to boost capacity in off-grid generation and distribution network.\n\n\u201cAs a Government, we believe one person cannot do it all. We need ideas and knowledge from each other, and form real partnership for coordination in the implementation of this framework,\u201d Sanwo-Olu said.\n\nThe State Commissioner for Energy and Mineral Resources, Mr. Lere Odusote, said the electricity policy, apart from clearing out constitutional and legal framework for investors\u2019 assurance, also provided for the establishment of an autonomous regulatory body and independent system operator.\n\nOdusote said Lagos Government would hinge its partnership with the industry players on well-funded and well-managed generation, transmission and distribution.\n\nThe State\u2019s Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Mr. Moyo Onigbanjo, SAN, represented by the Permanent Secretary, Mrs. Titilayo Shitta-Bey, said the framework was the first step to bringing Lagos out from constitutional obstruction that restricted the State from exploring electricity supply options.\n\nThe tone for the Government\u2019s partnership with the private energy investors was set by a panel of discussion moderated by Soji Awogbade, an energy lawyer and founding partner of Aelex.\n\nThe panelists included chairman of Ikeja Electric Plc and Egbon Power Plc, Mr. Kola Adeshina; co-founder of Falcon Corporation, Mrs. Audrey Joe-Ezigbo; Chief Executive Officer, Infrastructure Credit Guarantee Company Limited, Mr. Chinua Azubuike; Deputy Chief of Party, Power Africa, Mr. Tunde Gbajumo and Dr. Dolapo Fasawe, General Manager, Lagos State Environmental Protection Agency (LASEPA).\n\nThe stakeholders praised the Lagos Government for its commitment to boost power supply through the electricity framework; they argued that the implementation must focus more on supply for industrial consumption and productive activities rather than residential for sustainability of the plan.\n\nStakeholders also urged the Government to explore the options of clean and renewable energy infrastructure in order not to worsen environmental challenges facing the State.\n\n...",

The Awards ceremony over the years has become established as one of the biggest gatherings of influential and global African Achievers on the continent. It has been rated by Forbes Magazine as one of the most prestigious award ceremonies at Cambridge University.\n\nLawal, a former Executive Director of First Bank of Nigeria has joined the illustrious list of change agents. He bagged the award under the \u2018Integrity in Corporate Governance\u2019 category and was honoured for his transformative and leadership role in the financial sector.\n\nPrior to the awards, an international colloquium was organised on Thursday, December 9, 2021, which held at the University of Cambridge. The colloquium was hosted by Lord Simon Woolley, Master of Homerton College, Cambridge University.\n\nMr. Lawal was among African leaders selected as keynote speakers at the Cambridge Colloquium. In his speech titled, \u2018Mobilising Diaspora Investment for Sustainable Development in Africa\u2019, the financial expert reiterated that the topic was both apt and timely especially in its relation to finance and development in Africa.\n\nLawal said: \u201cIn a precarious world of global socio -economic upheavals worsened by a most difficult era of coronavirus pandemic, no time is more suitable for the revival and sustenance of the African continent than now.\n\n\u201cAccording to population experts, African diaspora is over 40 million. Nevertheless, the figure is believed to be far higher than estimated, as it does not encompass subsequent generation of migrants as well as those who migrated as a result of the pre-colonial Atlantic movement.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cDiaspora Africans enamored with their homeland go into investments, from their host countries in favor of their origins or heritages. Diasporic Africans are all over the world from Europe to the Americas, Asia, Middle East to Nordic settlements. The mobilization of Diaspora investment across the globe is vital to the economic growth of Africa towards sustainable development.\n\n\u201cA World Bank report (2019) indicates that Diaspora investments in form of remittances to Africa stood at 86 billion dollars. I am glad to inform you that a significant sum ,22 billion dollars were received by my country, Nigeria in 2018.\n\n\u201cThis surpassed her entire federal budget of that year, totaling 18 billion dollars by $2 billion. These exclude remittances through informal and unregistered channels, raising prospects of higher investments.\n\n\u201cI am confident to state that the Nigerian case study represents, notwithstanding in varying proportions, the scenario in virtually all the 54 countries in Africa.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cBeyond financial repatriations, there is also investment through real estate. In fact, the desire to acquire and develop real estate serves as the largest investment either by individuals or groups in relation to Diaspora Africans.\n\nThe preference for real estate is driven by economic considerations on micro and macro levels. The estates fill the gaps of \u2018housing at retirement\u2019 for the home ward bound migrants, place of abode for nuclear and extended families, commercial houses, lease or sale, collaterals for bank loans and related transactions among other values.\u201d",

The colloquium was hosted by Lord Simon Woolley, Master of Homerton College, Cambridge University.\n\nMr. Lawal was among African leaders selected as keynote speakers at the Cambridge Colloquium. In his speech titled, \u2018Mobilising Diaspora Investment for Sustainable Development in Africa\u2019, the financial expert reiterated that the topic was both apt and timely especially in its relation to finance and development in Africa.\n\nLawal said: \u201cIn a precarious world of global socio -economic upheavals worsened by a most difficult era of coronavirus pandemic, no time is more suitable for the revival and sustenance of the African continent than now.\n\n\u201cAccording to population experts, African diaspora is over 40 million. Nevertheless, the figure is believed to be far higher than estimated, as it does not encompass subsequent generation of migrants as well as those who migrated as a result of the pre-colonial Atlantic movement.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cDiaspora Africans enamored with their homeland go into investments, from their host countries in favor of their origins or heritages. Diasporic Africans are all over the world from Europe to the Americas, Asia, Middle East to Nordic settlements. The mobilization of Diaspora investment across the globe is vital to the economic growth of Africa towards sustainable development.\n\n\u201cA World Bank report (2019) indicates that Diaspora investments in form of remittances to Africa stood at 86 billion dollars. I am glad to inform you that a significant sum ,22 billion dollars were received by my country, Nigeria in 2018.\n\n\u201cThis surpassed her entire federal budget of that year, totaling 18 billion dollars by $2 billion. These exclude remittances through informal and unregistered channels, raising prospects of higher investments.\n\n\u201cI am confident to state that the Nigerian case study represents, notwithstanding in varying proportions, the scenario in virtually all the 54 countries in Africa.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cBeyond financial repatriations, there is also investment through real estate. In fact, the desire to acquire and develop real estate serves as the largest investment either by individuals or groups in relation to Diaspora Africans.\n\nThe preference for real estate is driven by economic considerations on micro and macro levels. The estates fill the gaps of \u2018housing at retirement\u2019 for the home ward bound migrants, place of abode for nuclear and extended families, commercial houses, lease or sale, collaterals for bank loans and related transactions among other values.\u201d",
          "summary": "The African Achievers Awards is one of Africa\u2019s most prestigious awarding bodies which honours great African Achievers \u2013 including African Leaders, Young Achievers, and Community Builders to Captains of Industries, whose works have had a meaningful impact on building Africa.\nThe theme for the 2021 ceremony is; \u2018\u2018Initiating Diaspora Investment for a diversified African Economy\u2019\u2019.\nThe Awards ceremony over the years has become established as one of the biggest gatherings of influential and global African Achievers on the continent.\n\u201cAccording to population experts, African diaspora is over 40 million.\nThe mobilization of Diaspora investment across the globe is vital to the economic growth of Africa towards sustainable development.",

Reference to provisional tax has been deleted in recognition of the well-established self-assessment tax regime.\n\nWithholding tax on interest earned from a unit trust to be treated as final tax.

A penalty of N50,000 to be applicable where a company fails to grant access to FIRS in addition to N25,000 for each day the failure continues.\n\nFIRS to be the primary agency of the Federal Government responsible for the administration, assessment, collection, accounting and enforcement of taxes and levies due to the Federation, the Federal Government and any of its agencies except otherwise authorized by the Finance Minister.\n\nAny person or agency of the Federal Government must refer matters requiring tax investigation, enforcement and compliance to the FIRS.

The story some sections of the media are deliberately misquoting to give a picture \u201cthat the brother of the person supporting the bandits has also been kidnapped\u201d is mischievous, misleading and diversionary.\n\n\u201cIt is actually from the content of an interview recently granted to some members of the press where Sheikh Gumi was saying he is surprised that some elements thinks he is unnecessarily supportive of the bandits, telling them that he is equally a victim of their terror as they have kidnapped his own biological brother about three years ago and that the security agents could not do anything which left them with the option of paying ransom before he was released. A driver of his father was also killed by the same bandits.\n\n\u201cFor Gumi, all this is not enough reason to say he will not seek for peaceful resolution of the crisis for the purpose of preserving peoples lives and properties especially if we look back at government\u2019s failure to address issues that will help in bringing last solution. Military power alone or declaring the bandits as terrorists cannot end banditry and killings in Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\u201cMay Allah forbid, in today\u2019s Nigeria where government has failed to address the root cause of the armed Fulani banditry and the security imbroglio particularly in the North West and to explore mediation like the Americans finally adopted after over two decades of failed military offensive in Afghanistan, people or the press should not be surprised if Gumi himself is abducted not to talk of his brother.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the said story as we mentioned is not true and we pray it will never happen not only to Gumi\u2019s brother but innocent Nigerians as a whole.\u201d",

As we suspect the worst ahead under your administration,\u201d the letter reads.\n\nThe letter further reads, \u201cAs an Hausa Association (KUNHAN), we deem it necessary to write you this open letter to portray the true picture of Hausas\u2019 mood during this trying time.

Our people are always incarcerated, killed while our mothers and daughters are being raped mercilessly without tangible measures to tackle the menace. On so many occasions, you have bragged to crush the bandits and proclaimed to take necessary action but all in vain.\n\n\u201cThe bandits are now matured to dictate to our collective population because of your empty threat. It has been happening for over five years and these terrorists are known as we have been seeing them on so many occasions with Sheikh Abubakar Gumi, even with serving Governors yet they could not be apprehended and dealt with. The answer is one, because they are not a threat to this administration while those that seem to be a threat are already in jail; Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Igboho.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why a whole Minister of Information named them just an ordinary criminal but called Nnamdi Kanu a terrorist.

          "text": "The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has urged the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, and Speaker of House of Representatives Mr Femi Gbajabiamila to investigate the N10 billion funds budgeted to the National Assembly said to be missing.\n\nIn a statement issued on Sunday, SERAP Deputy Director Kolawole Oluwadare asked the leadership of the National Assembly to \u201cpromptly probe and refer to appropriate anti-corruption agencies fresh allegations that N10bn of public money budgeted for the National Assembly is missing, misappropriated or diverted.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe grim allegations that N10,051,283,568.82 of public money is missing are documented in the 2019 audited report by the Auditor-General of the Federation.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Imo Traditional Ruler Regains Freedom After Two Nights In Abductors\u2019 Custody\n\nSERAP\u2019s statement followed a letter dated 11 December 2021 wherein the group wants the ninth Assembly to address the allegations that improve public confidence and trust in the ability of the National Assembly to exercise its constitutional and oversight responsibilities and to adhere to the highest standards of integrity in the management of public funds.\n\nAccording to the group, little can be achieved by the National Assembly in the fight against corruption if the leadership and members do not first confront the specter of alleged corruption and mismanagement within their ranks.\n\nThis is even as the organisation asked Lawan and Gbajabiamila to identify the lawmakers and staff members suspected to be involved and hand them over to appropriate anti-corruption agencies to face prosecution, if there is sufficient admissible evidence, and to ensure full recovery of any missing public funds.\n\nSERAP added, \u201cAs part of its legislative and oversight functions, the National Assembly has a key role to play in the fight against corruption in the country. But the National Assembly can only effectively perform its anti-corruption role if it can demonstrate exemplary leadership to probe the allegations of corruption and mismanagement involving the legislative body.\n\n\u201cAccording to the Auditor-General Report for 2019, the House of Representatives paid N2,550,000,000.00 to members as running costs between July and December 2019, but failed to account for the money, contrary to paragraph 1011(i) of the Financial Regulations. There was no evidence to show what the funds were used for, and no documents to back up the spending.\n\n\u201cThe Auditor-General is concerned that the money may have been \u2018diverted.\u2019 He wants the money recovered.\n\n\u201cThe House of Representatives also reportedly paid N258,000,000 as cash advances to 59 officers between February and December 2019 but has failed to account for the money. The officers were paid the money despite the fact that they have not accounted for the previous cash advances.\n\n\u201cThe House of Representatives also reportedly paid N107,912,962.45 as repairs and maintenance allowance for unspecified residential quarters but failed to account for the money. The money spent was also in excess of the cash advances threshold of N200,000.00 as stipulated by the Financial Regulations.\n\n\u201cThese fresh allegations amount to fundamental breaches of the Nigerian Constitution of 1999 [as amended] and the country\u2019s international obligations including under the UN Convention against Corruption and the African Union Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption.\n\n\u201cSERAP is concerned that allegations of corruption continue to undermine economic development, violate social justice, and destroy trust in economic, social, and political institutions. Nigerians bear the heavy economic and social costs of corruption. The National Assembly, therefore, has a responsibility to curb it.\n\n\u201cEnsuring the effective investigation of these fresh allegations, and full recovery of any missing public funds would strengthen the country\u2019s accountability framework, and show that the National Assembly can discharge its constitutional responsibility of amplifying the voices of Nigerians, and act in the best interest of the people.\n\n\u201cWe would be grateful if you would indicate the measures being taken to address the allegations and to implement the proposed recommendations, within 14 days of the receipt and/or publication of this letter.\n\n\u201cIf we have not heard from you by then as to the steps being taken in this direction, SERAP shall take all appropriate legal actions to compel the leadership of the National Assembly to implement these recommendations in the public interest, and to promote transparency and accountability in the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cThe House of Representatives also reportedly collected N1,594,807,097.83 as PAYE, car and housing loans from 17 members between February and December 2019 but failed to show receipt of remittance to relevant revenue authorities. The Auditor-General wants the money recovered.\n\n\u201cThe House of Representatives also reportedly paid N1,010,598,610.97I from salary account but without any document to show for the payment, contrary to paragraph 601 of the Financial Regulations. The Auditor-General wants the money recovered.\n\n\u201cThe Senate reportedly collected N219,645,597.08 as housing loans from 107 senators\u2019 salary arrears between July and December 2019 but failed to remit the money.\n\n\u201cThe Senate also reportedly recovered N123,320,916.72 being car loans to senators between July and December 2019, but there was no evidence that the money was remitted to the treasury. The Auditor-General wants the money recovered and remitted.\n\n\u201cThe Senate reportedly collected N176,267,255.31 as PAYE from staff salaries but there was no evidence that the money was remitted to the relevant tax authorities, contrary to paragraph 235 of the Financial Regulations. The Auditor-General wants the money recovered and remitted.\n\n\u201cThe Senate also reportedly collected N277,411,116.29 as Value Added Tax (VAT), and Withholding Tax (WHT) but failed to remit the money to the relevant tax authorities. The Auditor-General wants the money recovered and remitted.\n\n\u201cThe Senate reportedly paid N1,718,130,630.24 for the supply of vehicle and other office equipment between February and December 2019 but failed to account for the money, contrary to paragraph 110 of the Financial Regulations. The Auditor-General is concerned that the money may have been diverted.\n\n\u201cThe Senate also reportedly paid N657,757,969.05 for the supply of motor vehicles, motorcycles and other office equipment between July and December 2019, but failed to show any document for the payment, contrary to paragraph 1705 of the Financial Regulations. The Auditor-General wants the money recovered.\n\n\u201cThe Senate also reportedly paid N423,370,000.00 for the supply of utility vehicles and production of National Assembly Logo between August and November 2019 but without any documents. The Auditor-General wants the money recovered.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly Service Commission reportedly paid N31,927,760 as cash advances to 59 staff but failed to account for the money. The Auditor-General wants the money recovered.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly Service Commission also reportedly collected N276,749,014.68 as stamp duty from contractors and service providers but failed to remit the money to appropriate tax authorities.\n\n\u201cAccording to the Auditor-General Report for 2018, the Nigerian Institute of Legislative and Democratic Studies deducted N577,634,638,20 as taxes but failed to remit the money to the relevant tax authorities. The Auditor-General wants the money recovered and remitted.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Institute of Legislative and Democratic Studies also reportedly spent N47,750,000.00 to buy a residential building without due process, and contrary to Section 27 (1) of the Fiscal Responsibility Act and Financial Regulation 301.\n\n\u201cSERAP notes that the Auditor-General in 2015, 2017 and 2018 reports documented that over N8bn of public money budgeted for the National Assembly is missing, misappropriated or diverted.\u201d",

          "title": "Young Graduates Can Solve Nigeria\u2019s Biggest Problems, Says Osinbajo",
          "text": "Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on Saturday expressed optimism that young Nigerian graduates can provide solutions to the biggest challenges confronting the nation.\n\nHe made the remark while speaking at the 60th anniversary of the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ile-Ife, in Osun State, according to a statement signed by presidential spokesperson, Laolu Akande.\n\nThe Vice President, who was the Special Guest of Honour at the convocation ceremony of the University, stood in for President Muhammadu Buhari as Visitor, and was accompanied by the Osun State Governor, Gboyega Oyetola. While the Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, delivered the Convocation Lecture at the event presided over by the Etsu Nupe, Alhaji Dr. Yahaya Abubakar, as Chancellor of the University.\n\nREAD ALSO: \u2018Don\u2019t Be Afraid To Say It Out,\u2019 Sanwo-Olu Asks Students To Report Bullies\n\nAccording to the VP, while young Nigerians, particularly the OAU graduands, stood on the shoulders of great men and women before them, the onus is on their generation to \u201cdeal with the biggest issues that confront the world, and our nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd it is big and innovative ideas that will solve those problems. You will have to confront the problems of climate change and a world moving away from fossil fuels, and you will usher in the age of renewable energy and green solutions,\u201d the Vice President said.\n\nHe added that this generation of young Nigerians are equipped and could proffer solutions in the areas of education, agriculture, health care and security.\n\n\u201cYes, the challenges are huge, but you are well equipped to resolve them; and the evidence is there\u2026 Since 2016, despite two recessions, young Nigerians have built 6 unicorns; a unicorn is a company that is valued at over a billion dollars,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe VP added, \u201cYou will deal with the issues of feeding, educating, providing healthcare and jobs for the fourth largest population in the world in a few decades. We will need smarter Agric solutions to feed the huge numbers, technology is already helping to crowd-fund Agriculture and develop more prolific seedlings.\n\n\u201cYou will confront the need to vastly improve our public and clinical healthcare. We must build on the work of the Genomic Centre at Ede, and the local vaccine production efforts going on already and make local drugs for hundreds of millions of Nigerians.\u201d\n\nIn education, while noting that the sector needed several new solutions, including designing methods to teach millions even outside of classrooms, the VP stated that \u201cthere are many young men and women already doing great things using technology to reach children in far flung areas with education.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President added that the use of technology and improvement in nationwide policing would further help the country address its security challenges.\n\n\u201cThe insecurity problems we are experiencing, the rise of terrorism in several parts of this large country and access to modern weaponry by non-state actors tell us that we must be smarter in policing the country, using smart drones and surveillance equipment. The politicization of importation of arms tells us that we must manufacture our own arms.\n\n\u201cAlready Proforce, led by Ade Ogundeyin, is manufacturing APCs and MRAPS in their factory in Ode Remo and exporting. So are Imperium, and the government-owned DICON (Defence Industries Corporation of Nigeria) producing different types of munitions. The future is smart weapons benefiting from A.I. and machine learning,\u201d he said.\n\nProf. Osinbajo then praised the vision of the University\u2019s founders and management in driving the academic excellence for which the Obafemi Awolowo University is known, an institution, which he said has produced great thinkers and leaders throughout its history.\n\nCopiously quoting the late sage, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, for whom the university was renamed, the VP recalled that \u201cChief Awolowo, for many years Chancellor of the University, gave some of the most memorable and consequential lectures on the political economy of Nigeria; and addressed some of its most crucial problems, including the imperative of democracy, national economic development, ideology of governance and national census figures.\u201d\n\nHe also observed that OAU was very much ahead of its time when it named its medical faculty, the Faculty of Health Sciences, and its engineering faculty, the Faculty of Technology.\n\nCommending the achievements of several alumni of the university over the years, Prof. Osinbajo narrated how US-based Prof Oluyinka Olutoye, an alumnus of the faculty of health sciences gained \u201cglobal recognition when he led a team of surgeons, to successfully take a 23-week-old baby out of her mother\u2019s womb, removed a tumour and returned it to the mother\u2019s womb where the injuries from her operation healed and she continued to grow until she was born, the second time at 36 weeks.\u201d\n\nHe also observed that \u201cnot surprisingly, the early leaders in tech and tech-enabled businesses were alumni of OAU\u2019s Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering; Segun Ogunsanya, CEO of Airtel Africa, and Karl Toriola, CEO of MTN Nigeria. Another Great Ife Alumnus and product of this same department, Prof. Akintayo Akinwande, who teaches at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is one of the world\u2019s most respected professors of electrical engineering and computer science.\u201d\n\nMost recently, according to the VP, \u201canother alumnus of the Electronics and Electrical engineering department. Miss Funke Opeke, made global investment news when Equinix, the global conglomerate announced that it was acquiring MainOne, the company she founded, for $320 million.\u201d\n\nContinuing on the feats of OAU Alumni, Prof. Osinbajo recalled that he had \u201cthe pleasure of meeting with Professors Adesuyi Ajayi and Femi Babalola, both OAU alumni, when they undertook ground breaking research and clinical trials into the potential use of Ivermectin as a prophylactic and cure for COVID-19.\u201d\n\nOther notable OAU alumni and lecturers mentioned in various fields of endeavours included Segun Osoba, Sesan Dipeolu, Toye Olorode, Oladipo Fashina, Segun Adewoye, G.G. Darah, Dr. Akinwunmi Adesina (President of the African Development Bank), Dr. Okey Oramah (President of Afrexim Bank) and Prof. Toyin Falola, the distinguished historian now of the University of Texas at Austin, USA.\n\nHe also noted OAU\u2019s new generation alumni, including Nairaland\u2019s Seun Osewa; Jobberman\u2019s Olalekan Elude, Ayodeji Adewunmi and Opeyemi Awoyemi, among others.\n\nThe VP added that \u201cit was while still teaching here also that Prof. Wole Soyinka won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1986. But less well known is the fact that he was also a lecturer at the University of Ife, Ibadan Campus, in the early 1960s.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President congratulated the graduands, who were doctoral candidates bagging their Doctors of Philosophy degrees. He also congratulated the two honorary doctorate recipients at the Convocation: the Ooni of Ife, His Imperial Majesty, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, Ojaja II, and well-known business tycoon, Chief Michael Ade-Ojo.\n\nAccording to him, the calibre of honorary graduands at the ceremony was testament to the University\u2019s high standards.\n\nPaying tributes to the faculty of the university, the VP, himself a professor, paused \u201cto celebrate my colleagues in academia, the great scholars, and fine academics who make up the faculties here at the OAU; you are the thought leaders at a historic moment, whose great task is to guide the present and inspire the future.\u201d\n\nHis speech also highlighted the strategic objectives of the National Development Plan 2021-2025 as including establishing a strong foundation for a diversified economy, investing in critical infrastructure, power and broadband, enabling human capital development and improving governance and strengthening security.\n\nIncidentally, the VP also noted that \u201cone of the crafters of the Plan, Ambassador Yemi Dipeolu, the Special Adviser to the President on Economic Matters, is also an alumnus of OAU, while his father, Mr. Sesan Dipeolu of blessed memory, was Ife\u2019s first African librarian.\u201d\n\nProf. Osinbajo said \u201cthere is much to show and many stories to tell; stories of the institution itself and many of incredible successes of its alumni; stories of the triumphs of human endeavour, the primacy of ideas, the creative force of the introspective mind and the power of vision.\u201d\n\nIn the opinion of the Vice President, \u201cOAU is and continues to be very much a bastion of progressivism and innovation, and not surprisingly you will find the phrase \u201cAluta against all oppression\u201d in the Great Ife anthem. This progressivism is evident in the outlook of staff and students alike.\u201d\n\nPresent at the Convocation were eminent Nigerians, government dignitaries, top officials, traditional rulers, academics, staff and students.\n\nAt the end of the Convocation, the Vice Chancellor of the University, Prof. Eyitayo Ogunbodede, conducted the VP and other dignitaries around an arts exhibition to commemorate the event.",

          "text": "As the omicron variant sweeps through South Africa, Dr. Unben Pillay is seeing dozens of sick patients a day. Yet he hasn\u2019t had to send anyone to the hospital.\n\nThat\u2019s one of the reasons why he, along with other doctors and medical experts, suspect that the omicron version really is causing milder COVID-19 than delta, even if it seems to be spreading faster. \u201cThey are able to manage the disease at home,\u201d Pillay said of his patients. \u201cMost have recovered within the 10 to 14-day isolation period.\u201d said Pillay. And that includes older patients and those with health problems that can make them more vulnerable to becoming severely ill from a coronavirus infection, he said. In the two weeks since omicron first was reported in Southern Africa, other doctors have shared similar stories. All caution that it will take many more weeks to collect enough data to be sure, their observations and the early evidence offer some clues. According to South Africa\u2019s National Institute for Communicable Diseases: \u2014 Only about 30% of those hospitalized with COVID-19 in recent weeks have been seriously ill, less than half the rate as during the first weeks of previous pandemic waves.\n\n\u2014 Average hospital stays for COVID-19 have been shorter this time \u2013 about 2.8 days compared to eight days. \u2014 Just 3% of patients hospitalized recently with COVID-19 have died, versus about 20% in the country\u2019s earlier outbreaks. \u201cAt the moment, virtually everything points toward it being milder disease,\u201d Willem Hanekom, director of the Africa Health Research Institute, said, citing the national institute\u2019s figures and other reports. \u201cIt\u2019s early days, and we need to get the final data. Often hospitalizations and deaths happen later, and we are only two weeks into this wave.\u201d In the meantime, scientists around the world are watching case counts and hospitalization rates, while testing to see how well current vaccines and treatments hold up. While delta is still the dominant coronavirus strain worldwide, omicron cases are popping up in dozens of countries, with South Africa the epicenter. Pillay practices in the country\u2019s Gauteng province, where the omicron version has taken hold. With 16 million residents, It\u2019s South Africa\u2019s most populous province and includes the largest city, Johannesburg, and the capital, Pretoria. Gauteng saw a 400% rise in new cases in the first week of December, and testing shows omicron is responsible for more than 90% of them, according to health officials. Pillay says his COVID-19 patients during the last delta wave \u201chad trouble breathing and lower oxygen levels. Many needed hospitalization within days,\u201d he said. The patients he\u2019s treating now have milder, flu-like symptoms, such as body aches and a cough, he said. Pillay is a director of an association representing some 5,000 general practitioners across South Africa, and his colleagues have documented similar observations about omicron. Netcare, the largest private healthcare provider, is also reporting less severe cases of COVID-19.",

          "title": "Crews Search for the Missing after Devastating Tornadoes Hit Central US",
          "text": "Rescuers combed through fields of wreckage after a tornado outbreak roared across the middle of the U.S., leaving dozens dead and communities in despair.\n\nIn Kentucky alone, 22 were confirmed dead by late Saturday, including 11 in and around Bowling Green. But Beshear said upwards of 70 may have been killed when a twister touched down for more than 200 miles (320 kilometers) in his state and that the number of deaths could eventually exceed 100 across 10 or more counties.\n\n\u201cWe had to, at times, crawl over casualties to get to live victims,\u201d said Jeremy Creason, the city\u2019s fire chief and EMS director.\n\n\u201cI pray that there will be another rescue. I pray that there will be another one or two,\u201d Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said, as crews sifted through the wreckage of the candle factory in Mayfield, where 110 people were working overnight Friday when the storm hit. Forty of them were rescued.\n\nA twister carved a track that could rival the longest on record as the stormfront smashed apart a candle factory, crushed a nursing home and flattened an Amazon distribution center.\n\nIf early reports are confirmed, the twister \u201cwill likely go down perhaps as one of the longest track violent tornadoes in United States history,\u201d said Victor Genzini, a researcher on extreme weather at Northern Illinois University.\n\nThe death toll of 36 across five states includes six people in Illinois, where an Amazon facility was hit; four in Tennessee; two in Arkansas, where a nursing home was destroyed; and two in Missouri.\n\nThe longest tornado on record, in March 1925, tracked for about 220 miles (355 kilometers) through Missouri, Illinois and Indiana. But Genzini said this twister may have touched down for nearly 250 miles (400 kilometers). The storm was all the more remarkable because it came in December, when normally colder weather limits tornadoes, he said.\n\nDebris from destroyed buildings and shredded trees covered the ground in Mayfield, a city of about 10,000 in western Kentucky. Twisted metal sheeting, downed power lines and wrecked vehicles lined the streets. Windows and roofs were blown off the buildings that were still standing.\n\nThe missing at the candle factory included Janine Denise Johnson Williams, a 50-year-old mother of four whose family members kept vigil at the site Saturday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Christmastime and she works at a place that\u2019s making candles for gifts,\u201d her brother, Darryl Williams, said. \u201cTo give up the gift of life to make a gift. We haven\u2019t heard anything, and I\u2019m not presuming anything. But I\u2019m expecting for the worst.\u201d\n\nHe said Johnson Williams called her husband overnight to report the weather was getting bad, the last time anyone heard from her.\n\nKyanna Parsons-Perez, an employee at the factory, was trapped under 5 feet (about 1.5 meters) of debris for at least two hours until rescuers managed to free her.\n\nIn an interview with NBC\u2019s \u201cToday,\u201d she said it was \u201cabsolutely the most terrifying\u201d event she had ever experienced. \u201cI did not think I was going to make it at all.\u201d\n\nJust before the tornado struck, the building\u2019s lights flickered. She felt a gust of wind, her ears started popping and then, \u201cBoom. Everything came down on us.\u201d People started screaming, and she heard other workers praying.\n\nKentucky State Trooper Sarah Burgess said rescue crews were using heavy equipment to move rubble at the candle factory. Coroners were called to the scene and bodies were recovered, but she didn\u2019t know how many.\n\nRescue efforts were complicated because Mayfield\u2019s main fire station and emergency services hub were also hit by the tornado, Creason said.\n\nAfter a wall at a nursing home in Mayfield collapsed, Vernon Evans said he rushed to help firefighters pull people out, only to find one resident lying dead in a few inches of water.\n\n\u201cAll I could do is sit there and hold their head up,\u201d he said. \u201cI never experienced nothing like this.\u201d\n\nPresident Joe Biden approved an emergency disaster declaration for Kentucky on Saturday and pledged to support the affected states.\n\n\u201cI promise you, whatever is needed \u2014 whatever is needed \u2014 the federal government is going to find a way to provide it,\u201d Biden said.\n\nSix people were killed in the collapse of the Amazon warehouse in Edwardsville, Illinois, with another injured worker airlifted to a hospital, fire Chief James Whiteford said.\n\nInvestigators searched the rubble throughout the day for additional victims and 45 people survived, Whiteford said. Authorities were uncertain Saturday evening whether anyone was still unaccounted because workers were in the midst of a shift change when it was struck by the tornado about 8:30 p.m. Friday.\n\n\u201cThis is a devastating tragedy for our Amazon family and our focus is on supporting our employees and partners,\u201d Amazon spokesperson Richard Rocha said in a written statement.\n\nThe Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which has been trying to organize workers at an Amazon facility in Alabama, criticized the company for keeping the Illinois site open during a weather emergency.\n\nMissouri Gov. Mike Parson\u2019s office said the storms killed at least two people in the state and initial assessments indicate they destroyed or did major damage to hundreds of homes and buildings.\n\nWorkers at a National Weather Service office had to take shelter as a tornado passed near their office in Weldon Spring, Missouri, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) west of St. Louis.\n\n\u201cThis was an incredible storm that lasted a long time and covered a lot of territory,\u201d said Larry Vannozzi, meteorologist in charge of the National Weather Service office covering the Nashville area.\n\nMeteorologists haven\u2019t determined whether the storm spawned a single tornado or multiple tornadoes, he said.\n\nIn Arkansas, a tornado struck a nursing home in Monette, killing one and trapping 20 people inside as the building collapsed, Craighead County Judge Marvin Day told The Associated Press.\n\nAnother person died when the storm hit a Dollar General store in nearby Leachville, Gov. Asa Hutchinson said.\n\n\u201cProbably the most remarkable thing is that there\u2019s not a greater loss of life,\u201d Hutchinson said after touring the wreckage of the nursing home. \u201cIt is catastrophic. It\u2019s a total destruction.\u201d\n\nFour storm-related deaths were confirmed in northwestern Tennessee, the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency said.\n\n\u201cThis is about the saddest thing I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said after touring the community of Dresden, which saw its downtown corridor ripped apart. \u201cThe whole town, the whole town.\u201d",

This is expected because you are the father of all.\n\n\u201cAny one of them who says that he is interested in politics \u2013 just pray for him and let them go. Anyone who approaches you and says that he wants to be president or governor, just pray for such a person and let him go.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t direct Yoruba people to support any aspirant, as we don\u2019t all go in the same direction, which is part of our strength in Yoruba land,\u201d Obasanjo said.\n\nThe former president reminded the monarch that as far as politics was concerned, even in the pre-independence era, the Yoruba usually had two strong sides, adding: \u201cPlease, don\u2019t let politicians add to your burden\u201d.\n\nThe former president commended Sanginga for his dedication to agriculture, food, and nutrition security in Africa.\n\nSanginga, a Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) national, and his wife, were honoured with Aare and Yeye Aare Afurugbin-Ola of the Source respectively.\n\nThe former president, who said that the chieftaincy conferment was in recognition of the director-general\u2019s passion for the development of agriculture in Africa, urged Sanginga to see the honour as a challenge to do more for the continent.\n\nObasanjo, who is IITA Ambassador, commended Oba Ogunwusi for the choice of Sanginga and his wife for the chieftaincy titles, saying that they were both worthy of the honour.\n\n\u201cI commend Your Imperial Majesty for the bold step taken to honour this distinguished African who has dedicated his life to agriculture, food security, and nutrition in Africa.\n\n\u201cI want to assure you these new chiefs will not disappoint you; that they will not disappoint Ife indigenes and the entire Yoruba race.\n\n\u201cI know and I am sure that they will live up to the honour that you have bestowed on them,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his part, Oba Ogunwusi appreciated the IITA director-general\u2019s passion for agricultural development in Africa.\n\nAccording to him, despite the balkanisation of Africa by the Europeans, Africans will continue to remain one and indivisible.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m impressed with your modest achievements as a true son of Africa. You have been doing all within your capacity to ensure food sufficiency in the continent.\n\n\u201cAll through the years, you have developed a passion for agriculture and the results are feasible everywhere,\u201d the traditional ruler said.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Sanginga applauded Ooni for the fatherly role he had been playing, not only in Yoruba land but all over the country.\n\nHe also commended Oba Ogunwusi for counting his and his wife worthy of the honour, pledging that he would continue to support him in all ways.\n\nYinka Kolawole in Osogbo",
