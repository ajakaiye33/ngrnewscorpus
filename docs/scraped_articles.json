          "text": ".\n\nDayo Johnson , Akure\n\nThe Ondo State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) has explained that the ongoing audit of all the public and private schools across the state, was not to impose tax.\n\nIt\u2019s Chairman, Hon. Victor Olabimtan, who said this in Akure pointed out that \u201cthe exercise is to enable the agency obtain comprehensive and reliable data of children of school-going age enrolled in primary and junior secondary schools.\n\nOlabimtan, said that the exercise was in line with the provisions of the UBE Act 2004, which mandates SUBEB to conduct regular intervals, personnel audit of pupils, teaching, non-teaching staff, infrastructure, establish a basic education data bank, and conduct research on basic education in Nigeria.\n\nHe appealed to proprietors of private schools to cooperate with enumerators, saying the exercise has nothing to do with taxation.\n\nHe explained that \u201cthe National Personal Audit is the audit of both teachers, students or pupils and infrastructure under the basic education system, which include primary school pupils and junior secondary school students\n\n\u201cThis exercise is carried out every four years and this done to educated the education bank of the country so that they can at a glance know the number of pupils in every schools, the number of teachers.\n\n\u201cThey will also know the adequacy of the teachers, the quality of the teachers and we now go to infrastructure and take the inventory in all the schools, both public and private schools and it will be turned into the education data bank. This is where we will now use it to plan for the basic education in Nigeria\n\n\u201cThe first one was done in 2006 and another one 2010, before the last one in 2018. It was stopped for some time because they felt there was crisis and they were not able to do it. In 2010, it was done just for primary schools pupils and Junior Secondary Schools in public schools but in 2018, private schools were involved.\n\n\u201cWe have a challenge and the challenge is that the private schools did not cooperate because they are thinking the government wants to use it to tax them and it entails a lit of convincing.\n\n\u201cThe exercise has been done for three weeks, we started on the 6th of June and supposed to end on the 26th of June but we have added a week because of logistics problems.\n\n\u201cWe have challenges in Owo where pupils have not been going to schools since the terror attack. But we hope they will resume schools now after t he mid-term break that ends yesterday. We are thinking of starting the Owo local government area by tomorrow.\n\n\u201cWe have personnel in every local government area and the exercise is being done simultaneously and we have people from Abuja who joined our people from the state and also we have our people from local government too while the Zonal Education Officer coordinates and work together with SUBEB officials as a team.\n\n\u201cWhat they ask for is the pupils population, infrastructure, teachers ratio, in order to know the gap because it is this gap that those who will want to assist will study to know the area to assist and this data are taken with pictures , so that if any of our patners or NGO, World Bank, or UNESCO showed interest to intervene they will know easily which area to intervene.\n\n\u201cThis is also done to know the number of out of school children because what UNESCO is planning is that by the year 2030 every child school going age in Nigeria must be in school and that is the target and if we dont carry out this audit and keep in education data bank we might not be able to adequately prepare for these children\u201d\n\nHe implored private school owners to also key in, saying \u201cthis is a unique program, some private schools have benefited from intervention from world bank and they will continue to intervene in so many other private schools because education is a whole and not parts.\n\n\u201cThey will also know the qualifications of the teachers to know if these schools have quality and qualified teachers and not just people frustrated because they couldn\u2019t get job and i am happy to inform you that in all our public schools all the teachers are certified teachere and educators.\n\n\u201cAll private schools will be captured whether registered or not, but once they are operating as schools they will be captured. The basic thing is that we want to know the number of pupils and not for taxation but to ensure education for all by the year 2030\u201d\n\n\u201cEven we go to quaranic schools where they are just learning Quran, we will captured them too bit we might capture them under another acronym. Those who are suppose to be in schools to receive western education but are not receiving. We can find a way to take western education to them, they can be integrated\n\nHe however, said adequate security arrangement has been put in place for safety of the enumerators and other participants which include UBEC State Director, state Chairman of NUT, PTA, AOPSHON as well as the National Association of Proprietors of Private Schools in the state.",

          "title": "Warning shots from kigali, by Femi Adesina The Nation Newspaper",
          "text": "On the sidelines of the 26th edition of Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) holding in Kigali, Rwanda, President Muhammadu Buhari and his team Thursday morning visited the Kigali Genocide Memorial, which is one of the monuments in memory of about a million people that were killed in the 1994 pogrom.\n\nThe Hutus had in 100 days of rage and madness embarked on ethnic cleansing of Tutsis, and the country nearly died. Hatred, malice, evil hearts almost despatched Rwanda to kingdom-come.\n\nBetween April 7 and July 15, 1994, minority Tutsis were systematically eliminated by ethnic militias, and some renegade soldiers and policemen. Hell really came down, and made its abode in the Central African country.\n\nTutsis were killed in cities, towns, villages, in their homes, in churches where they had huddled for refuge, in schools, everywhere. And to make matters worse, the victims were killed by people who had been their neighbors, family friends, and allies. A Hutu pastor reportedly killed hundreds of his church members who were Tutsis, while husbands killed wives, simply because they were not of the same ethnic stock.\n\nAt the site we visited, 250,000 lay buried, about one quarter of the number that died. Some moderate Hutu and Twa people were equally murdered. Hatred boiled over, and that was the result.\n\nWe have always warned about hate speech that is rife in our own country, Nigeria. You hear it from so-called bishops, imams, talk show hosts, phone-in programs on radio and television, anywhere, and everywhere.\n\nI had written before that if Nigeria dies, it is hatred that killed her. And our pastors would not be innocent. Nor the imams, and everyone that trades in hateful language against government and other ethnic groups. Those things pile up continuously, till it boils over, and cascades on an entire country. The heinous crimes we see in the land today cannot be entirely divorced from hateful and incendiary speeches.\n\nThe tour of the Genocide Memorial took the whole of one hour and five minutes. You start from a video account from survivors, who recounted the gory way in which fathers, mothers, siblings, children were slaughtered, and how they were lucky to be alive. Sad. Dolorous.\n\nAnd then we moved to the burial place of the 250,000 victims. A pensive President Buhari lay a wreath there.\n\nThen to a pictorial excursion of the history of Rwanda. They had once been a happy, united people before colonial rule came. They had their monarchical system, and the fissures among them were not emphasized.\n\nThe monarchy was abolished, the country suffered instability and the differences between the people became prominent. The Hutus began to see themselves as superior beings, a kind of Aryan supremacy as espoused by Adolf Hitler. There were killings in the 50s, 60s, 70s, till things first degenerated into a civil war, and genocide in 1994.\n\nCome and see skulls of the dead. In many hundreds. Bones that were exhumed and preserved. In many thousands. Pictures of the dead, adults and children, men and women, in their thousands. Clothes and personal effects of the slain. All kept for posterity to see. It was man\u2019s inhumanity to man at its worst, result of hatred, malice, evil hearts, ill will.\n\nLet us carry those bishops and pastors who spew hatred from the pulpit, and bring them to the genocide museum. And the imams too. Maybe they will \u2018lend themselves some brain.\u2019 And the TV and radio hosts, who make snide, hateful remarks, and allow their guests to do the same. That was the same road Rwanda trod, and genocide was unleashed on the land.\n\nThe media is said to have played a huge role in the genocide, lending itself to being used to denigrate the Tutsis. Till things boiled over. One Hassan Ngeze is on record to have written in a newspaper he owned and edited, about the Tutsis: \u201cLet whatever is smouldering erupt.\u201d\n\nSome broadcasters said on radio: \u201cThe graves are not yet full\u2026Go to work.\u201d They instigated the deaths of thousands of people. Happily, two of them are today cooling their heels in jail, serving life terms. Others are serving equally stiff sentences.\n\nHate speech, or hate media is an ill wind that blows no good. Haters in Rwanda sowed the wind, and reaped the whirlwind. We need to watch it in our country, too. It can happen anywhere, unless we take care.\n\nPermit me to recall some of the things I said in an earlier piece, with the title, If Nigeria dies,hatred killed her:\n\nWhat a week it has been for our own dear native land! Just at the beginning of the month, as the country turned 60 as an independent entity, President Muhammadu Buhari had charged us to \u201cbegin sincere process of national healing, eliminate old and outworn perceptions that are always put to test in the lie they are.\u201d\n\nSome people call it \u2018the mistake of 1914,\u2019 in which what used to be the Northern and Southern Protectorates were forcefully cobbled together by the colonial masters, leading to the emergence of Nigeria. Since then, it has been one uneasy relationship among the people that make up the Union. Suspicion of domination, ethnic rivalry, fear of being given the shorter end of the stick, gaining unfair advantage, and the like, have characterized the relationship. And the overriding sentiment is hatred, fueled and justified by many factors and tendencies.\n\nIf Nigeria dies, whether now or in the future, hatred killed her. How can a people go about, bearing giant-sized grudges against their country, its leadership, against one another, and expect that country to live in peace and prosperity? It won\u2019t happen. \u201cWhen we don\u2019t know who to hate, we hate ourselves,\u201d observed a writer.\n\nThe EndSARS campaign began as an agitation against police brutality, in which there was unanimity of purpose. And suddenly, it became a vehicle of hate. Against leadership, against national cohesion, an opportunity to settle political scores, and equally prepare for power grab in 2023. Hatred came into the mix.\n\nThe agitation by youths against injustice and oppression suddenly took on a variegated nature. Separatists came under the umbrella, and began to advance their cause, working for the dismemberment of the country. Those beaten black and blue in 2015 and 2019 elections also crept in, and asked for pound of flesh, while also plotting for a return to power in 2023.\n\nThe venom, which peaceful protests eventually became, can only be summed up by one word. Hatred. How can you begin to club people to death, in different parts of the country? How can you set fire to national assets and institutions, storm prisons and release prisoners into society, all in the name of peaceful protests? No, peace had fled through the window, and hatred was fully in control.\n\nThere are many factors and agencies of hatred in Nigeria, and until we learn to purge ourselves, the country may never move beyond where it has been pirouetting and gyrating for six decades. Like the macabre dance, it has been one step forward and two steps backwards.\n\nHatred is evinced from many quarters for Nigeria, and for its government and people at any given time. It comes from churches, mosques, professional activists and agitators, interest groups, some elements in the media, so-called analysts who never see anything good, and so on and so forth.\n\nWhen things boil over in graphic demonstration of hatred, it is a culmination of negative sentiments and tendencies. They come in persistent negative postings on social media, which generate and stimulate hate. From hateful messages from the pulpit, as if that was the message of love Jesus Christ handed over to his followers. From unduly critical messages during jumat services. From radio and television programs, in which bile is spewed. From talkshows which become a harangue of government, newspaper articles and columns tailored to instigate and generate dissent, and the like.\n\n\u201cI have decided to stick with love. Hate is too great a burden to bear,\u201d said Martin Luther King, Jr. But not for some Nigerians who have decided to hate their own country. They perpetually stoke the embers of malice, discord and discontent. They bear a heavy burden, which they carry around everywhere, being grumpy, caustic and perpetually driven by ill will.\n\nHatred is a poor prop for anyone to lean on. But to those malicious souls, the more malice they generate for their country, the better they feel. They may carry fancy religious titles, or parade as activists, analysts or newspaper columnists, but what they are is really simple. Hate mongers, and one day, they may ensure that Nigeria dies. Not of old age or other natural causes, but of hatred.\n\n*Adesina is Special Adviser to President Buhari on Media and Publicity\n\nPhoto Credit: Ulli Michel, Reuters",

Our members in Lagos were getting the products at N170 to N173/litre, and that is why they were calling for an increment in price of petrol.

          "text": "From Fred Itua, Abuja\n\nIndications emerged, yesterday, that more senators elected on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), may defect in the coming days.\n\nThis is coming despite Wednesday\u2019s intervention by APC\u2019s National Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, who pleaded with the lawmakers to halt further defections to the PDP.\n\nAdamu, at the meeting with APC senate caucus had expressed worry over the wave of defections rocking the party in the National Assembly.\n\nMultiple sources told Daily Sun that about 20 senators predominantly from the APC have concluded plans to defect to the PDP, New Nigeria Progressive Party (NNPP), and other opposition parties.\n\nThe current configuration of the Senate shows that the APC has 61 lawmakers; PDP, 38; NNPP, three;Young Progressives Party (YPP), two; Labour Party, one; while All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) has one. There are three vacant seats, vacated by APC national chairman, Adamu and two other APC lawmakers.\n\nLast week, Senate Leader and Kebbi Senator, Yahaya Abdullahi resigned his membership of the APC and defected to the PDP. His counterpart from the State, Adamu Aliero, also dumped the party for the PDP.\n\nAt plenary last Tuesday, three APC senators defected to the PDP. They are, Isa Kaita (Katsina North); Lawal Gumau (Bauchi South) and Francis Alimikhena (Edo North) citing internal crises within the local chapters of their party for the action.\n\nA senator who spoke to Daily Sun in confidence said despite Adamu\u2019s intervention, those aggrieved were unwilling to jettison their plans to defect to the PDP.\n\nHe said the lawmakers were miffed that during the recently-concluded primaries, the leadership of the party took sides with governors to deny them return tickets to the Senate.\n\nHe wondered why Adamu who didn\u2019t intervene during the primaries, has suddenly woken up mounting pressure on unhappy senators to remain in the party.\n\nThe source said the fear was that the defections, especially by Northern senators, may affect the chances of the party in next year\u2019s presidential elections.\n\n\u201cThe APC is bleeding. APC lawmakers are defecting. These senators begged APC to be fair to them during the primaries. It didn\u2019t listen; now, it is begging us to stay back. Stay back and do what exactly?\n\n\u201cIf the party doesn\u2019t stop this drift, APC will not win the presidential election in the North. PDP appears to have managed the aftermath of their primary better. So, the defections are minimal. But the APC didn\u2019t do that\n\n\u201cAnother problem is that, if APC loses its majority in the Senate to the opposition, there maybe a leadership change. It means the PDP may take over the leadership of the Senate. We must guide against this. For now, we just have to wait and see how the leadership of the APC will manage these crises. But it is not looking good at all. Too many people are angry and APC will be badly affected.\u201d",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has reiterated his resolve to respect the maximum term limit in the Nigerian Constitution, saying the first person that tried to go for a third term didn\u2019t end well.\n\nFormer president, Olusegun Obasanjo, reportedly in 2006 planned to amend the constitution to extend his tenure.\n\nPresident Buhari reiterated his position yesterday while in a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister of Great Britain, Boris Johnson on the margins of the 26th Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Kigali, Rwanda.\n\nA statement by Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, said, the PM, who obviously is not quite familiar with the maximum two terms limit, had asked if President Buhari would run for office again.\n\n\u201cAnother term for me? No! The first person who tried it didn\u2019t end very well.\u201d\n\nOn the leader of the proscribed Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, not being allowed to see his lawyers privately, the President dispelled such insinuation, saying the detained separatist was being given every opportunity under the law \u201cto justify all the uncomplimentary things he had been saying against Nigeria in Britain.\u201d\n\nBuhari said: \u201cHe felt very safe in Britain, and said awful things against Nigeria. We eventually got him when he stepped out of the United Kingdom, and we sent him to court. Let him defend all that he has said there. His lawyers have access to him. Remember he jumped bail before, how are we sure he won\u2019t do it again, if he\u2019s admitted to bail?\u201d\n\nOn the keenness expressed by the PM to help Nigeria in the area of security, the President said helping to stabilize Libya could be an initial good step, as the fall of Muammar Gadaffi after 42 years in power unleashed his armed guards on countries in the Sahel, \u201cand they are causing havoc everywhere, as the only thing they know how to do is to shoot guns.\u201d\n\nOn Boko Haram insurgency, President Buhari said there was serious effort to educate the people on the fact that only an unserious person could kill innocent people, \u201cand say Allah Akbar (God is Great). God is justice. You can\u2019t take innocent souls, and ascribe it to God. And the education process is working, the people now understand Boko Haram as anti-God, and not about religion.\u201d\n\nPM Johnson said he was delighted about the good news on trade between the two countries, adding that the UK was further reducing tariffs on some goods going to Nigeria.\n\nHe described the relationship between the countries as \u201cvery strong attachment,\u201d adding: \u201cI just want to be sure that we are doing enough. It\u2019s a massive partnership for us, and we need to capitalize on it.\u201d\n\nThe Prime Minister offered condolences on some recent attacks in Nigeria, particularly on churches.",

          "title": "Nigeria is Faced with Serious Refugee Problem at Home and Abroad \u2013 THISDAYLIVE",
          "text": "Babatunde Raji Fashola, Minister of Works and Housing, laments that the fear of more people becoming refugees in Nigeria very soon is real.\n\nWhen my friend and brother, Jimi Olusola, asked me to be the speaker at this event, I had no hesitation in accepting because he indicated that it was Papa\u2019s 10th memorial.\n\nAlthough I was unaware that it was World Refugee Day and neither was I aware at the time that a book was to be presented, my mind was already invoking thoughts about refugees.\n\nWhen he responded to my inquiry about what he would like me to speak about by saying: \u201cTunde he was also your father, choose your topic,\u201d that decided me.\n\nI was going to speak about refugees because that was Ambassador SegunOlusola\u2019s final signature and most compelling work of art that he left us with. (Pun intended. Ambassador Olusola was an artist\u2019s Artist).\n\nHis passion, commitment, sacrifice and dedication to the cause of refugees, a compelling humanitarian undertaking to which he devoted his personal resources, mobilized others to form and to join and contribute, immersed his immediate family and friends in, was arguably his most selfless of his many undertakings while he was with us.\n\nHaving now settled on my subject, a big problem then arose \u2013 What was I going to say about refugees that my audience does not already know about?\n\nAfter all, there are refugees everywhere so what is new? Then I thought to myself speak about the fact that he created Village Headmaster, he was Elsie Olusola\u2019s husband and Nigeria\u2019s Ambassador to Ethiopia.\n\nWhile I was flirting with my options, the casual invitation by Jimi was formalized by way of a letter signed by no less a person than Chief MrsOpral Benson, OON, the Honorary President of AREF, and on the letter was boldly printed the names of the patrons of AREF, starting from Dr. Christopher Kolade to Major General Ike Nwachukwu to AremoTaiwoAlimi.\n\nAnd that stopped me dead in my tracks.\n\nThese were Ambassador Olusola\u2019s peers, many of who stood in Loco Parentis to Jimi and I.\n\nWhat was I going to tell them about Ambassador Olusola, Aunty Elsie, Village Headmaster or his stint in Ethiopia?; events and stories they partook of when I was in my toddling and adolescent years.\n\nIn the hope therefore that I would have something worthwhile to say, I have titled my intervention HOME AND ABROAD.\n\nAround these two words and their simplest and extended meanings, I think there is sufficient elasticity to interrogate my subject, which is the issue of refugees, from multiple perspectives.\n\nI think it is too pedestrian to attempt a definition of what or who a refugee is, except that we can agree that a refugee is one who is seeking refuge, who has lost his sanctuary and in this sense his HOME and depends on the help, charity or benevolence of others.\n\nVery often for us who have a HOME to go to at the end of each day, when we return to our house as a HOME, we return to the embrace of our family as the people that make our house a HOME because they are not strangers, it is easy not to pay attention to the plight of refugees because we are far removed from it.\n\nI got quite close to the world of refugees in very unusual circumstances that provided a rude awakening, over two decades ago. It is a story I find relevant for this occasion. Please permit me to share it.\n\nIt is the worst kept secret that I still attempt to play football long after my school days and myself and a group of friends constantly indulge in veteran football as a way of keeping fit and also strengthening bonds of friendship that were struck decades ago.\n\nOne day, we got an invitation for a friendly veteran match somewhere in Ogun State, in a place called Oru that I had never heard about.\n\nMy recollection of the details is hazy, but my experience remains indelible.\n\nAs we arrived at the destination, I saw a sign indicating that it was a refugee camp, I cannot recollect if it was an AREF camp but my hazy memory suspects that it was.\n\nAs we alighted and we were introduced, we interacted with men who looked as healthy as us. As they spoke, I immediately discerned their accent.\n\nIt was distinctly Liberian (Mrs. Opral Benson has not lost hers and this is something about the place called HOME that I will come to shortly) and the first wave of reality hit me.\n\nThe conflict and war in Liberia were not as far away as we thought when we saw it on the television or read about it in the newspapers.\n\nIt had come to the place we called our HOME. Not only had we sent troops there, they had sent some of our brothers and sisters to us, albeit against their will.\n\nThe conflict had taken their HOME from them and sent them ABROAD against their will.\n\nFootball became immediately unimportant and even though we still played, I don\u2019t remember who won.\n\nMy image of refugees before experiencing Oru, was that of poor people, people at the bottom of the pyramid, dislocated by forces of nature mudslides, earthquakes, tsunamis etc.\n\nThis was different.\n\nAs we interacted, I found there were lawyers like me, professionals of all capabilities who had lost everything but their lives.\n\nTheir HOME has changed from the house they built in Liberia to a contrived shelter in rural Ogun State. Their family members were not necessarily their spouses and children or siblings, it was the nearest person in the boat of their tribulations.\n\nThat experience was and remains numbing to me. A situation that makes me take flight, that makes all the things that we value, become minor distractions except life, and translates one from self-sufficient to totally dependent still sends chills down my spine.\n\nI hope it tells a story that I seek to share about HOME and ABROAD.\n\nThat experience and its known causes, including conflict and war, left in me a quiet resolve never to be consciously a cause of conflict or a promoter of conflict.\n\nI have seen and experienced its consequences in a most fortuitous and humbling way.\n\nFor those who still beat the drums of war and conflict as their preferred solution to disputes and misunderstandings, I say be very careful what you wish for.\n\nI do not wish a refugee status on anybody.\n\nRecent and ongoing events in Ukraine that are creating a global humanitarian crisis of refugees and economic pain and distress is a call to our common humanity to bring it to an end.\n\nI have recent and first-hand experience of the anxiety and anguish that a war in which we seemingly had no stake has caused many Nigerians.\n\nIt speaks eloquently to my subject of HOME and ABROAD.\n\nMany parents who could reach me, called and sent text messages incessantly inquiring what our Government was doing to bring their children HOME from Ukraine.\n\nI can say here confidently that our Government stood in the gap and responded to her citizens ABROAD because she brought them HOME.\n\nNothing speaks perhaps eloquently to the role of our Government at the onset of the Ukraine crises than the text of a relieved parent who had been in anxious and expectant contact with me.\n\nLet me share it with you. He texted on March 13, 2022 at 1:04 p.m:\n\n\u201cHonourable Minister thank you very much. My daughter has arrived on the last flight yesternight. She is with her sister in Abuja, may God reward you immensely thank you.\u201d\n\nRight inside Nigeria, in spite of the best efforts of government, the actions of an obvious minority who have chosen to act outside the law has displaced thousands of people, who albeit are at HOME in Nigeria, but are also ABROAD as internally displaced persons.\n\nBut conflict is only one of the more talked about causes of human displacement that results in people being refugees, whether at HOME or ABROAD.\n\nThere are many more causes of varying degrees of devastation that I think now deserve not only our attention, but also our action, in order to support the work of institutions like AREF; and I will attempt to shed some light on some of them because I cannot be exhaustive.\n\nFor this purpose I invite us to highlight governance, good or bad, and politics as a source of conflict; and let us underline political persecution, genocide, religious intolerance, rising nationalism ethnic or racial supremacy, as State policy undertaken in the name of governance.\n\nThe way some governments deliberately or inadvertently become instruments for political persecution, genocide, ethnic cleansing, religious intolerance, or agents of racial or national dominance create problems at HOME for their people, that result in dislocations and refugee crisis ABROAD.\n\nIn other words, the Government turns against the people it should protect. To whom should they turn for redress?\n\nRegrettably, I do not have a failsafe solution to this problem, neither do I have a silver bullet that guarantees good governance globally and protects our civilization from ourselves, however I believe that if we resolve to find an answer, we will bring many of the problems under control, if not to an end.\n\nOn the brighter side, I can point to a reliable precedent, which is the United Nations Organization and the global charter on human and people\u2019s rights inaugurated at the end of the Second World War.\n\nThis is the global legal order upon which the world has been run with occasional modifications from time to time for a little over seven decades now.\n\nI am convinced that our world has changed significantly over the decades, to remain sustainable on a legal framework designed over 70 years ago, when nuclear capabilities were just emerging and not yet fully harnessed, and there was no globalization, Internet or the social media.\n\nWe are now in a world where everybody can publish and disseminate information whether true or false, and no one is really in control, in spite of government efforts to regulate microblogging sites from which verified, unverified and unverifiable information can travel almost faster than the speed of light and effectively at a push of the one button which reads \u2013 SEND.\n\nIn other words, every one of us, can cause a problem ABROAD from HOME; or cause a problem at HOME from ABROAD at the push of a button. This is a big concern.\n\nI propose therefore, that the global legal order requires urgent and compelling revision to bring about global consensus on matters such as regulating these kinds of things, creating identifiable institutions who can be held responsible and accountable for what is published.\n\nThe global legal order must also evolve new rules for governments worldwide about setting minimal but enforceable standards of protecting citizens and immigrants from genocide, ethnic cleansing, political persecution racism etc as potential sources of conflict, and dislocation at HOME and ABROAD.\n\nI acknowledge the ground-breaking and commendable work behind the establishment of the international court of criminal justice, but it is hobbled by many other well-intentioned principles like sovereign immunity and equality of states around which perhaps a re-think is now necessary.\n\nAfter all the citizen will now ask, yes I accept that my country has the same rights as others and no country can come and overrun our boundary and territory as if we were a vassal state (until Russia entered Ukraine without a deterring military response); but what is the value of protecting my state from another state, when nobody can protect me when my state turns against me?\n\nThe quicker we find answers to this problem, the easier it will be for institutions like AREF to do a lot more; because for now, organizations like AREF with very frugal resources are standing in the gap for people with problems created by state and governmental entities with vast resources.\n\nApart from governance and politics, environmental issues resulting in extreme weather conditions have become a recurring cause of dislocation and displacement of people.\n\nThere are many ways in which these manifest, but perhaps one to which I can advert our collective attention is how extreme shortage of water is not only dislocating people but is also a cause of conflict.\n\nAt HOME in Nigeria, the shrinking Lake Chad is a local example and ABROADglobalIy, there is an estimated 2 Billion people who according to UNICEF live in countries where water supply is not only inadequate; there is also an estimated700 million people which could be displaced by intense water scarcity by 2030.\n\nThese ecological and environmental challenges now commonly discussed under the banner of climate change represent perhaps the most daunting challenges yet of the human civilization.\n\nWhatever views you hold, the science and the evidence of it, is compelling and riveting; things are manifestly no longer the same as we used to know them.\n\nThe impact of these changes will task the resources, adaptability and resilience of institutions like AREF at HOME and ABROAD as they seek to sustain their work of putting their arms around displaced and vulnerable people the world over.\n\nOne thing that I am certain about, is that we alone, the human race, hold the keys that unlock the solution; and the simplest of things that we can do is to restrain our greed, preserve nature\u2019s bio-diversity and what we take from nature, because nature is fighting back.\n\nRight here in Lagos and at this location, we are just a few Kilometres from the South Atlantic Ocean and many are living witnesses to the years when the famous Bar Beach used to wash up as far as Bonny Camp and flood Victoria Island and OzumbaMbadiwe Road.\n\nUnverified reports about how the sea took over and displaced the house of one Mr. Maja were the stories I grew up with in my younger days.\n\nThe whole of Victoria Island was a potential community that was sitting and waiting for ocean flooding, displacement and possibly AREF.\n\nThat has been averted by the solution conceived by the Government of Lagos State and implemented in collaboration with Messrs South Energyx to protect that shoreline, during the time of my predecessor in office, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu.\n\nWithout indulging in self-adulation, I feel proud to say that the administration that I led after his tenure, progressed that work to the point that incidents of those annual flooding agonies were substantially mitigated.\n\nNot a few people here will recall the famous Ogunpa River flooding in Ibadan, Oyo State and the human casualty that it exacted.\n\nThe moral of the recall of these incidents is to remind us all, about the roles we have to play in preventing flooding, by not building on drains, not obstructing them with our waste, in order to reduce incidence of flood induced displacement and support the work of AREF.\n\nPlease indulge me, as I take a little more of your time to share a personal experience in order to recommend what more I think we can do to support AREF.\n\nWhilst the work of protecting the Bar Beach shoreline was going on, I lived in mortal fear of what we would do if it failed or if as some \u201cexperts\u201d predicted, that Victoria Island would be washed away.\n\nI raised the matter at one cabinet meeting of the Lagos State Government and my colleagues and I came to the conclusion that at least we would not be totally helpless if we built a resettlement camp or facility.\n\nSince Victoria Island was measured as lying at 2 metres below the level of the sea, we charged our surveyors to find us suitable higher ground to which people could be evacuated in that eventuality as a first response.\n\nAnd so was born the Ikorodu Resettlement Facility which has proven repeatedly handy on at least two occasions when large settlements of people were displaced by fire in Makoko and Bariga.\n\nApart from shelter and health Facilities, the settlements have, embedded in them, other life continuing services like schools; and every time we had unfortunately used them, we ensured that none of the children lost school time because we moved teachers and educational support services there.\n\nWe added another facility in Alimosho to increase capacity and to diversify risk.\n\nIt is fitting to mention that when the Grenfell Tower fire occurred in the city of London a few years ago, one of our team members rightly pointed out that the displaced people had to be sorted to different hotels because there was no resettlement facility like those of Lagos in London.\n\nMy recommendation therefore is that whilst we must do all we can to avoid situations that result in the displacement of people, we can respond better when they suddenly happen if every local government and state begins to think about building a resettlement centre as a first response mechanism.\n\nAfterall, is that not what UNHCR does when it brings its Tents to displaced communities to set up temporary camps as shelters.\n\nThe Lagos resettlement centres are Lessons from HOME that we can share ABROAD.\n\nThere are other events, incidents and accidents such as economic and health from which hardships, displacements and eventually refugee situations are created.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic was one of such. I remember the people on the cruise ship trapped between Japan and America who became refugees through no fault of theirs, as borders were closed and neither nation wanted ships carrying possible or potentially infected persons berthing at their ports.\n\nI remember also some Qataris who were trapped ABROAD because their HOME government had closed its borders to all incoming traffic without exception. For the period that the situation persisted these persons were essentially stateless because there was no relief from HOME and ABROAD.\n\nCommendably, the Government of Nigeria, while she enforced the lockdown, kept her doors open only to her citizens enabling them to return to the place called HOME, from places where they had been locked out ABROAD.\n\nThis intervention would be incomplete without a mention of economic refugees some of who either deliberately dispose of their assets in search of \u201cgreener\u201d pastures or those who are forced to seek those pastures that turn out to be anything but green.\n\nMany lives have been lost across the desert and others have been captured into slavery or perished at sea.\n\nAgain, one cannot ignore the commendable effort of the federal and some state governments in helping some of these people return back HOME from ABROADeven if only to begin again.\n\nThese pictures I have painted of the diverse and seemingly unending problems of our civilization \u2013 displacement of mankind at HOME and ABROAD and their characterization as refugees, is the work that Ambassador SegunOlusola dedicated his life to, and to which he applied himself till his last breath.\n\nHe became the Refuge of Refugees through AREF.\n\nWhat a man!!! What a life!!! What courage!!! What selflessness!!! What sacrifice!!!\n\nTo him and to all of you who hold the torch of this devotion to humanity aloft through AREF, I doff my hat.",

          "title": "Passionate Plea to Buhari on Inauguration of NDDC Board without Further Delay \u2013 THISDAYLIVE",
          "text": "Charles Aberebiegha shows a strong cause for urgent intervention of the leadership of the All Progressives Congress and President MuhammaduBuhari for the inauguration of the Senate-approved Board of the Niger Delta Development Commission, which appears to be a discouragement to a teeming number of people in the Niger Delta region\n\nAs has been previously predicted by watchers of unfolding events in the volatile Niger Delta region, tension seems to be reaching fever-pitch as the INEC required electoral activities leading up to the 2023 elections are happening across the federation and throwing up issues.\n\nSpecifically in the Niger Delta region, a group, \u201cCommitted members of the APC from the Niger Delta Region,\u201d led by the trio of EbibomoAkpoebide, MenegboNwinuamene, and ItamEdem have, in quick succession fired two strongly-worded letters to President MuhammaduBuhari and the leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC), following the conclusion of the special conventions of the nation\u2019s two leading parties, the PDP and APC, respectively.\n\nAs if to underscore the sense of urgency that they perceive, less than 48- hours after the emergence of AtikuAbubakar, former Vice President, as the Presidential candidate of the opposition PDP, this group of \u201cCommitted APC members from the Niger Delta region\u201d sent in their first correspondence \u201cLetter to President Buhari and the APC Leadership on the Ongoing Illegality in the NDDC and the Implications for the APC in the 2023 Elections.\u201d\n\nIn the extensive and detailed letter, complete with facts, dates and history of what has transpired in NDDC and the region from 2015, when President Buhari took office, till date, the group raised alarm on the looming consequences of the ruling party\u2019s ill-treatment of the region, especially what it described as the \u201congoing illegality in NDDC.\u201d Matter of fact, the group specifically cautioned that \u201cas it stands, the APC cannot win an election in the region except the missteps in NDDC are remedied and the NDDC substantive Board is inaugurated in accordance with the law setting up the Commission.\u201d\n\nThe group in the above letter went to length to state how they believe that Senator GodswillAkpabio, former Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, laboured strenuously to try and subvert the collective will and desire of the authentic stakeholders of the Niger Delta region. According to them, Chief Akpabio, a two-term governor of AkwaIbom State and Senator until 2018 under the PDP, \u201ccame to reverse the bold moves to cement the party in the Niger Delta states. He has set the party back in many respects but we are hopeful that with concerted efforts by stakeholders we can regain our footholds before the next general election, which is very crucial. This is why we are glad that his resignation offers a chance to correct the ills and win back the trust of our people.\u201d\n\nContinuing, the trio of Akpoebide, Nwinuamene, and Edem opined that the resignation of the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Akpabio, \u201coffers your administration the opportunity to reboot and reclaim its connection with the Niger Delta people after three years of the former Minister\u2019s disastrous manipulation of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), which has angered all stakeholders in the region. He has been especially disagreeable even in advancing the interests of the people of our region, not to talk of the damage he has done to your reputation and the All Progressives Congress (APC) among the people, especially the voting population.\u201d\n\nThe APC group then detailed what it described as the \u201ctrajectory of Akpabio\u2019s mischief.\u201d According to them, in October 2019, in exercise of his powers as spelt out in the NDDC Act of 2000, President Buhari appointed a Board for the NDDC which was duly confirmed by the Nigerian Senate on November 5, 2019. Through subterfuge, before the board could be inaugurated, Akpabio came up with the idea of an audit to be supervised by an interim management, so the Board was asked to be on standby for inauguration after a forensic audit originally planned to last three months.\n\nGoing down memory lane, it recounted that Akpabio then ill-advised President Buhari and came up with a grand scheme to suspend the inauguration of the board which was confirmed by the Nigerian Senate on November 5, 2019 and instead employed some interim officials in breach of the NDDC Act, through an orchestrated scheme to conjure an unending audit of the Commission. From three months, he extended the audit to last two years! After contrived delays over two years, the report of the forensic audit of the Niger Delta Development Commission was finally submitted to Mr. President on September 2, 2021, nine months ago, yet the substantive Board President Buhari unequivocally promised to inaugurate is yet to be inaugurated.\n\nThe Committed APC members further recalled and reminded President Buhari that specifically on June 24, 2021, while receiving the leadership of Ijaw National Congress (INC) at the State House in Abuja, he promised that the NDDC Board would be inaugurated as soon as the forensic audit report is submitted.\n\nAt that occasion, he said that \u2018\u2018Based on the mismanagement that had previously bedeviled the NDDC, a forensic audit was set up and the result is expected by the end of July, 2021. I want to assure you that as soon as the forensic audit report is submitted and accepted, the NDDC Board will be inaugurated.\u201d\n\nThe group therefore regrets that the President has not only not fulfilled his promise nine months after, the Ijaw National Congress (INC) which he received in audience when he (President Buhari) made the above promise to Nigerians has been compelled to describe the delay in the inauguration of the NDDC Board as a \u201cclear betrayal of trust and display of state insensitivity on the Ijaw nation and Niger Delta region.\u201d\n\nAccording to them, in the \u201c15-year history of the NDDC, prior to your administration coming in 2015, an interim appointment had never been made outside of the law, even when the Governing Boards were dissolved. Prior to your coming to power in 2015, in the absence of a Board duly constituted in line with the NDDC Act, the most senior Civil servant in the NDDC took over as Managing Director in acting capacity for a brief period until a Board was constituted in line with the NDDC Act. The NDDC Act does not permit the appointment of any external persons from outside the Commission to act as Managing Director or Sole Administrator without compliance with the Act which requires nomination by the President and Confirmation by the Senate. This is the same requirement for Ministers of the Federal Republic. The Law does not permit for anyone to be appointed as Acting Minister in any Ministry. If there is no Minister in a Ministry, the most senior civil servant \u2013 i.e. the Permanent Secretary holds forth until a Minister is appointed by the President and duly confirmed by the Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe orderly succession in NDDC was only breached in 2015 when your Administration dissolved the BasseyHenshaw led Board with Dan Abia as Managing Director, and appointed Mrs. IbimSemenitari as Sole Administrator, a position she held illegally for over one year. The illegality in NDDC continued in January 2019 when the two-year old Victor Ndoma-Egba led Board was dissolved and replaced with an Interim Management team led by Professor Nelson Brambaifa. It was not until August of 2019 that your government ended the illegal Brambaifa interim management team and then, in accordance with the law establishing NDDC, forwarded the list of nominees for the NDDC Governing Board to the Senate for confirmation, and then dutifully appointed the most senior civil servant at that time in NDDC, Mrs. AkwaghaghaEnyia, as Acting Managing Director pending the Senate confirmation of the President\u2019s nominees as NDDC Board members, which list you, Mr. President personally signed and forwarded to the Senate on October 18, 2019.\n\n\u201cBut unfortunately again this administration relapsed to its recourse to illegality in administering NDDC, because as the Senate dutifully screened and confirmed the nominees sent by you in exercise of your powers, as Board and Management of NDDC on November 5, 2019, this same government embarked on another spree of interim managements/sole administrator contraptions, while the Board confirmed by the Senate has been on hold since November 2019.\n\n\u201cSince October 2019 this government has appointed two interim management teams led by JoiNunieh and Professor KemePondei, respectively, and presently the Commission is led by a Sole Administrator, EffiongAkwa.\u201d\n\nIn its second correspondence, \u201cLetter to President Buhari, APC Leadership to Halt the Ongoing Illegality in NDDC and Galvanize the Region for APC in the 2023 Election,\u201d following the successful completion of APC\u2019s special convention and the emergence of its presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, for the 2023 election, the group stated that they are further encouraged to write again to the President and the leadership of APC because they are \u201creasonably informed that the APC presidential aspirants promised to take-up the matter with you, President Buhari to ensure that the Board (NDDC) is inaugurated expeditiously, aware of the negative impact it will have on our party ahead of the campaigns now that the primaries to elect candidates have been concluded, from State House of Assembly members to the Presidential candidate.\u201d\n\nThe APC group further stated that \u201cgiven the various encounters our presidential aspirants had with party delegates from AkwaIbom, Abia, Bayelsa, Cross River, Delta, Edo, Imo, Ondo, to Rivers states, our party should no longer be in doubt about the mood of the people of the region with regard to their genuine angst towards the Federal Government for the way we have been badly treated by certain elements in the Federal Government who feed fat on the resources of our region.\u201d\n\nThe group reminded President Buhari and APC leadership that a notable group in the region, The Niger Delta Rescue Movement (NDRM) has already vowed not to back the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2023 elections following the delay to inaugurate a substantive board of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). The spokesman of NRDM, Jonathan Okwa, speaking in Yenagoa, Bayelsa state, stated that following the prolonged delay of President Buhari to give the Niger Delta people what is rightfully theirs, in accordance with the law, the NDDC Act, the group would ensure the mobilisation of the people of Niger Delta region to vote against the APC in the 2023 presidential and general elections if the board is not inaugurated .\n\nThe \u201cCommitted APC members\u201d also drew the attention of the President, the Federal Government and the APC to the danger in continuing with the interim contraption as this administration winds down. The NDDC Act, provides that each of the nine oil producing states have a representative on the board. In addition, there is one representative for all oil producing companies in the country and one person each from non-oil-producing geopolitical zones. All the members of the Board listed above are on part time basis as clearly stated in Section 2(3) of the NDDC Act. The only full time members of the Board as clearly stipulated in the NDDC Act are three \u2013 the Managing Director and two Executive Directors \u2013 who are responsible for the day-to-day administration of the Commission. However, for close to three years this has been ignored by the Buhari Administration. This has given rise to tension in the Niger Delta region.\n\nPresident Buhari should now rise to the occasion to save the Niger Delta region from those who have deliberately decided to exacerbate the palpable tension in the region. He should heed the call of Niger Delta leaders, governors, youths, women, traditional rulers, civil society organisations, and other stakeholders, comply with the law setting up NDDC, and also fulfill his own promise of June 24, 2021, and inaugurate the board of the Commission to ensure accountability, checks and balances, probity and equitable representation of the nine constituent states.",

          "text": "Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nA member of the House of Representatives Committee and House Committee Chair on Climate Change, Chief Sam Onuigbo, has raised the alarm over alleged attempt by the All Progressives Congress (APC) to substitute his name with one Emeka Atuma.\n\nOnuigbo stated this while addressing journalists yesterday in Abuja, following the recent attempts by the ruling party to upload on the portal of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) names of aspirants that did not participate in valid primaries.\n\nHe stated categorically that the attempt to supplant genuine winners of party\u2019s primaries was tantamount to political gangsterism.\n\n\u201cWe were supposed to hold the primaries on May 28th, which was the date announced by APC national headquarters in the notice for the primary. But, due to some bottlenecks, the chairman of the panel from Abuja, Hon. Izu Okeke, consulted with all of us and resolved, let\u2019s do this tomorrow, so as to overcome the bottlenecks.\n\n\u201cSo, by the next day, we had the election and at the end of the day, I won. I defeated my closest opponent, Chief Henry Ikoh, by 157 to 152 votes. That was it. The Electoral Panel submitted their report signed by all five members to the office of the National Organising Secretary.\n\n\u201cThey listed those of us who were returned or elected as candidates for the three senatorial zones, namely, Chief Sam Onuigbo for Abia Central, Senator Orji Uzo Kalu, Abia North and Blessing Nwagba Abia for Abia South. The office of the National Organising Secretary received the result and acknowledge it,\u201d Onuigbo stated.\n\nOnuigbo said as a confirmation of the fact that he was the candidate of the party, he was issued Form EC9, which was from INEC, and only issued to successful candidates.\n\nHe declared that only nine aspirants were cleared by the APC national headquarters as those who bought forms, completed the forms, returned the forms, invited for screening and were screened and cleared by the party to stand for senatorial primary election in Abia State.\n\nThe aspirants, according to Onuigbo, included, \u201cIjeaku Gift Emaba; Enyinnaya Michael Kasarachi; Samuel Ifeanyi Onuigbo; Henry Ikechukwu Ikoh; Kelvin Chima Ugboaja; Okonkwo Fabian; Sen Nkechi Justina Nwaogu; Sen. Orji Uzo Kalu and Nwagba Blessing Oluchi.\n\n\u201cOut of this nine, four of us came from Abia Central, these are myself, Chief Samuel Onuigbo, Chief Henry Ikechukwu Ikoh, Senator Nkechi Justina Nwaogu and Chief Kelvin Chima Ugboaja. A few days to the election, Senator Nkechi Justina Nwaogu, wrote and withdrew from the election, then Chief Kelvin Chima Ugboaja did not make it to the election. He was not seen because he didn\u2019t come for the election,\n\n\u201cSo it was just Chief Henry Ikoh and myself that stood for the election and at the end of the day, I defeated Chief Henry Ikoh, by 157 to his 152 votes,\u201d Onuigbo said, adding that, it was strange that the name of someone, who did not buy nomination forms for the Senate, never participated in the preliminary processes was uploaded on INEC\u2019s server.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, so strange that someone, who did not buy nomination forms for the Senate, never participated in the preliminary processes, will drop from the sky and had his name listed to substitute my own name. It is one of the strangest things I have ever seen.\u201d",

Three decades ago he fought a lawsuit in which the US government accused him of laundering the proceeds of heroin trafficking and eventually reached a settlement.\n\n\"Atiku Abubakar, his chief rival, brought tens of millions of dollars of \u2018suspect funds\u2019 into the US when he was Nigeria\u2019s vice president in the 2000s, according to a US Senate report, and was implicated in a bribery case that resulted in the imprisonment of an American congressman. Neither episode resulted in charges against Abubakar.\n\nThe Spokesmen for Tinubu and Abubakar didn\u2019t respond to requests made by Bloomberg for comments.\n\nThe report noted that Nigeria\u2019s next president will face a daunting challenge to turn around Africa\u2019s largest economy.\n\nIt further noted that falling oil production threatens Nigeria\u2019s place as the continent\u2019s biggest crude producer.\n\nIt lamented how inflation is soaring in the country with more than half of the working-age population either unemployed or underemployed.\n\n\n\n\"The local currency has depreciated steeply under outgoing President Muhammadu Buhari, falling from around N220 to the US dollar on the widely-used parallel market when he was first elected in early 2015 to about N600 this week.\n\n\n\n\"Nigeria vies with India as the country with the highest number of people living in extreme poverty despite having a seventh of the population.

Abubakar and his then-spouse previously have denied any wrongdoing.\n\nFormer US Representative William Jefferson was sentenced to 13 years in prison in 2009 for taking bribes from American companies interested in doing business in Nigeria and Ghana.\n\nIn July 2005, Jefferson told a cooperating witness that Atiku Abubakar had also agreed to accept a bribe in exchange for his assistance, according to the Louisiana congressman\u2019s indictment.\n\nAtiku, however, denied the allegations, saying he had no personal or business relationship with Jefferson.\n\nAbubakar\u2019s hopes of succeeding President Olusegun Obasanjo in 2007 were torpedoed when the EFCC declared him unfit to hold public office and a Nigerian Senate panel recommended his prosecution for allegedly diverting government funds.\n\nBut Atiku has described it as political persecution.\n\nBoth Tinubu and Atiku will focus on issues other than corruption while campaigning, said Hoffmann. \u201cThey know it\u2019s not part of their political image,\u201d she said.",

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean?

          "text": "Kune, a Kenyan food tech startup that delivered ready-to-eat meals at affordable prices, is closing down today, the company\u2019s founder and CEO Robin Reecht announced.\n\nIn a statement posted to his LinkedIn page, Reecht cited a stifled economy and inflated food prices as circumstances that contributed to Kune\u2019s closure. \u201cWith the current economic downturn and investment markets tightening up, we were unable to raise our next round. Coupled with rising food costs deteriorating our margins, we just couldn\u2019t keep going,\u201d he said.\n\nThe announcement comes just 4 months after the startup began its commercial operations at established meal centers around Nairobi. Around that time, Kune leadership also declared its intentions to raise $3.5 million in its second round of funding.\n\nBut while Kune was well-liked by its customers, the startup\u2019s journey wasn\u2019t without its fair share of controversy. Last June, Reecht faced the mighty lash of Kenyans on Twitter (best known as KoT) after he shared in a TechCrunch interview that he was inspired to launch Kune after taking a trip to Kenya in November 2020 and having trouble finding affordable, ready-to-eat meals.\n\n\u201cAfter three days of coming into Kenya, I asked where I can get great food at a cheap price, and everybody tell [sic] me it\u2019s impossible,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible because either you go to the street and you eat street food, which is really cheap but with not-so-good quality, or you order on Uber Eats, Glovo or Jumia, where you get quality but you have to pay at least $10.\u201d\n\nReecht, who is white and French, founded Kune just one month later.\n\nKenyans were aggrieved by his comments, and did not hesitate to voice their critiques. They argued that Reecht\u2019s ability to secure funding so quickly was due more to his white privilege than his business plan, which some believed aimed to solve a nonexistent problem. Those discussions gave way to a larger conversation about white privilege and favouritism in tech, as well as Kenya\u2019s neglect of its local founders.\n\nIn his statement, Reecht said that even though Kune had sold more than 55,000 meals and acquired more than 6,000 individual customers and 100 corporate customers since the start of the year, its $3 per meal price point wasn\u2019t enough to sustain its growth.\n\nAddressing Kune\u2019s investors, he said, \u201cNot only did you invest in Kune but you gave us your time, brain-width, connections, and emotional support. I am deeply sorry that Kune\u2019s vision didn\u2019t come true. To betray your confidence is something for which I will never forgive myself.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "These founders are helping companies make decisions with data",
          "text": "On a drab January day in 2018, in Pamplemousses, Mauritius, 2 friends, Joseph Rutankangwa and Eric Sewankambo, sat in Rutakangwa\u2019s apartment and decided to start a company. It wasn\u2019t their first time venturing into business together; only the previous year they\u2019d tried building an aggregator to curate data from various African countries which multinational companies could use. The problem was: there was simply no available data to be gathered. Generally speaking, data about Africa is scarce, and even when it is available, it can be inadequate and outdated.\n\nAt the time they decided to give their business aspirations a second chance together, Rutakangwa and Sewankambo had been consulting for multinational consumer goods companies that were looking to expand into African markets. In their work, they often encountered the data gaps. Government ministries and countries\u2019 chambers of commerce (did not have detailed information about consumer persona and behaviour in Africa\u2019s markets. While these offices might, for example, present data on what percentage of a country had electricity, they had nothing on how many homes exactly had power, or how many of them experienced power cuts each month, or how long these power cuts lasted. A solar company entering into many African markets would thus have little information to work with. Such gaps in the data cost businesses money in wasted marketing efforts, and make it tough for the continent to attract further investment.\n\nRutakangwa understands why these costly business errors occur: the data the multinational companies rely on\u2014often collected by market research firms\u2014is assumed African countries to be monolithic and did not provide companies with enough detail with which to make market expansion decisions.\n\nAnd so, when Rutakangwa and Sewankambo launched Rwazi, a Mauritian-based startup that provides multinational organisations with on-ground data to facilitate effective decision making, they decided that they\u2019d collate data that dealt in the specifics. \u201cI want to know the details,\u201d Joseph tells me, firmly. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to tell me the market share of this [brand] is 75%. What is 75%? Is it 6,255 outlets? Is it 10,800? I don\u2019t want the percentage. I want the exact number, exact location, exact contact, and exact images [of these shops].\u201d\n\nDespite Rutakangwa and Sewankambo understanding the problems with multinational consumer goods companies accessing useful data, figuring out the most effective way to collect this data was initially challenging.\n\nAt first, they tried using retailers and sales reps to collect information. But both groups proved inefficient as they are incentivised to falsify the data\u2014retailers because claiming that they stock products they actually don\u2019t have gets them freebies from companies; and sales reps because success in their jobs meant reporting, always, that their products were in stores.\n\nThey changed their approach. They figured companies were trying to sell to consumers, not retailers or sales reps; only a consumer would be truthful about the availability of a product and their access to it. So, Rutakangwa and Sewankambo employed regular local consumers, called \u201cmappers\u201d, to collect the data from shops and households.\n\nThese mappers collect data within the neighbourhoods closest to them at any given time. Think Uber, but for data collection.\n\nIllustration: For shops, when a mapper signed up to the Rwazi platform receives a mapping order from a toothpaste company to find out how many shops around them sell toothpaste and what brands they carry, the mapper accepts the request, then proceeds to locate and count how many shops in the area sell toothpaste. They also document what brands they stock, and at what prices. For households, the mappers meet consumers in their homes and quiz them on the brand of toothpaste they use, why they use it, their experience using it, what it costs them, and so on.\n\nA mapper can only submit data while they are still at a shop or household. Every shop is already geotagged on the Rwazi platform. When a mapper submits the data, Rwazi verifies the information by checking that the shop or household\u2019s geocoordinates matches the mapper\u2019s current location.\n\n\u201cSynergy\u201d\n\nFor this story, I spoke to Rutakangwa and Sewankambo 3 days apart, but some of the things they told me could easily have been convergent thoughts from 2 people in the same room at the same time. The week of our conversation, they are in Los Angeles participating in the Techstars Accelerator, and they have been stunned by how differently from the rest of the world success for African founders is defined. They have met with Western founders whose startups make up to $3 million in annual revenue but who consider this feat modest. \u201cBack home,\u201d Sewankambo says, \u201cif you\u2019re making $3 million dollars [a year], you\u2019re a conglomerate!\u201d\n\nRutakangwa and Sewankambo have been friends for 7 years, having met as business management undergraduates on the Mauritian campus of the African Leadership University, where Rwazi\u2019s story first began to shapen. Their roles as COO (Sewankambo) and CEO (Rutakangwa) may state sharply defined responsibilities\u2014Sewankambo deals with operations and customer delivery while Rutakangwa\u2019s handles customer acquisition\u2014but they are not fussy about the demarcation. \u201cWe tend to switch, depending on who can do it faster or better,\u201d Sewankambo says. \u201cSometimes, I talk to clients, sometimes he talks to the operations team.\u201d\n\nThey both say \u201csynergy\u201d when describing their partnership, painting a picture of complementariness, where, during conflict, one founder\u2019s scepticism is another\u2019s faith. A few months into Rwazi\u2019s launch, they had begun receiving mapping orders from clients from outside the consumer goods industry\u2014medicine, pharmaceuticals, hospitality, fintech. Sewankambo was concerned about them servicing these orders that had nothing to do with consumer goods as that could mean Rwazi taking on work in industries they had no prior experience in. But Rutakangwa saw things differently: in principle, mapping data for hospitals and pharmacies was the same as mapping for beverage and liquor companies. They ended up accepting these orders, which they claim increased their revenue and client base.\n\nWhere next, after Techstars?By 2050, Africa will make up 25% of the world\u2019s population; Rutakangwa and Sewankambo have this at the back of their minds as they use the access granted by Techstars to court more US-based clients looking to understand consumer habits and trends in African markets, raise seed worth $3 million, and evolve Rwazi\u2019s product by incorporating machine learning and AI into it so it can perform simulations, make forecasts, and generate automatic reports. Today they have 20,000 mappers spread across 60 countries and over 100 cities; by the end of the year, they aim to onboard 1 million mappers spread across their current coverage.\n\nMy Life in Tech (MLIT) is a biweekly column that profiles innovators, leaders, and shapers in the African tech ecosystem, with the intention of putting a human face to the startups and innovations they build.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "title": "AAU varsity resumption: Obaseki says suspension of union activities not a witch-hunt \u2013 Nigerian Observer",
          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\n\u2026insists continuous strike action by varsity unions injustice to students\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has said the government\u2019s decision to suspend all union activities across state-owned institutions of higher learning is not aimed at witch-hunting anyone but to protect the interest of students in the state.\n\nThe decision followed the protest by students of Ambrose Alli University (AAU), Ekpoma, over the lingering strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), after which the government directed all cadre of staff to report to their duty posts immediately.\n\nObaseki, while addressing veteran labour leaders who were on a courtesy visit, at the Government House, Benin City, said the workers\u2019 decision to down tools was not justifiable given that the state government has been up and doing in meeting her financial obligations to the school and its workers.\n\nHe noted that their action amounts to injustice against the students whose peers are having unbroken academic calendar in private and other state-owned universities across the country.\n\nObaseki said, \u201cWe don\u2019t play politics with education. We will not compromise education because we are who we are today because of the quality of education that we received. As a government, we are committed to improving education as the reforms we are putting in place are in the long-term interest of the staff of AAU.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur students cried to us begging us to help them go back to school, resume classes and graduate, and we approached the lecturers to go back to class, but they said no. What do you want us to do?\n\n\u201cIf ASUU has a problem with the federal government, how is that our problem in Edo State? This is a deliberate effort to give private universities an edge and advantage over government-owned institutions. If ASUU has a problem with the federal government, why should we suffer in Edo?\u201d he queried.\n\nObaseki added, \u201cWe have done so much in AAU and have embarked on several reforms and wonder why a school like AAU that is about 45 years old with over 30,000 students can\u2019t pay their bills.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to discuss but don\u2019t put someone\u2019s problems on us as we are a small state and want to build modern institutions ourselves, and expect everyone to cooperate and not to fight us for providing quality education to your child. Even some of these union leaders have their children abroad.\u201d\n\nThe governor also appealed to the former labour leaders to intervene by reaching out to the union to reconsider their position as the state government is willing to discuss and resolve any lingering issue.\n\nHe further stated, \u201cWork with us and let us stop this confrontation. We are ready to talk, but go and appeal to them. The state government is not fighting them. It\u2019s time to sit across the table and make sacrifices to improve the educational system. Please, appeal to them; we are not the federal government. If they are fighting the federal government, they should go and do it in Abuja.

Thank you for the building of the Edo State Civil Servant Secretariat, the John Odigie-Oyegun Training Academy, and the construction of Labour House.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are one of the most labour-friendly governors in the country,\u201d the former labour chair added.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 Some folk nitpick about the disconcerting growing culture in some African societies on the \u201ccelebration of life\u201d of people at funerals.\n\nWhy do we people spare birthday parties or appreciate our loved one while alive but give \u201dbefitting burials\u201d when the person has journeyed beyond and cannot hear or feel anything? They quiz.\n\nBirthdays normally offer us that special moment to honour people who have impacted our lives positively. To let the celebrants and the whole world know how grateful and proud we are for the their lives and legacies.\n\nRecently, social media platforms go agog with birthday celebrations of users but most times the celebration stops at the virtual space with only flowery words and pictures. Only few people travel miles to attend birthday parties but no so with funerals.\n\nSo when Benin City was painted red on Sunday for the eighty-two birthday bash of Dcns. Ayo Eguavoen, it dimmed posthumous and sometimes hollow funeral tributes that our society has become so engrossed with.\n\nNow, the worthy mother and grandmother will live to savour the sweet memories of her birthday celebration which was quite magnificent with over one thousand dignitaries far and near looking in their finest styles to honour Iye, a Benin name for Matriarch.\n\nDcns Ayo\u2019s children all attributed their successes in life to the sacrifices of their mother whom they all described as \u201cvirtous woman\u201d. They recalled how their mom would go extra miles to ensure that they were well fed and went to school.\n\nEven after their dad was ill for over a decade and eventually passed on, their \u201cwonderful mother remained a strong pillar for the family\u201d.\n\nThe party also presented an opportunity for them to specially thank their mom for looking after their late dad for the many years he was down with paralysis. \u201cOnly a virtous woman who\u2019s caring, compassionate and hard-working\u201d can do what she did. One of daughters said.\n\nA peep into Dcns. Eguavoen\u2019s biography tells a story of \u201can industrious young woman who is also selfless in relating with people\u201d. Born in 1940, Iye understood early in life the dignity of labour and the benefits of industry.\n\nIt was this quest for self reliance that made her a keen learner when she was enrolled in seamstress training under the direction of Mrs. Uhunnamen Ologboso of blessed memories. She recalled how she was loved by her mistress due to her \u201cdedication to work and being responsible for the different task that was given\u201d.\n\nThe seamstress certificate Dcns. Ayo Eguaveon earned as a teenager remains the only educational qualification of her life that she never stops telling her children and grandchildren about.\n\nWhile paying tribute to her mother, Pastor (Mrs) Gladys Ohenzuwa who is the second child and first daughter of Dcns. Eguavoen said: \u201cthough you never had a former education, you hold PhD in smartness because as a seamstress, you can take measurements of twenty women, never write them down yet will never forget them\u201d\n\nA marvelled Gladys recalled that her excellent seamstress mother hardly made amends to clothes she made for her clients. \u201cMy mother still makes her own clothes. Sometimes I just wonder how she does those things so effortlessly\u201d, she said.\n\nOn a special day set aside to honour to a well deserved Matriarch whom her offsprings said their stories can not be complete without a recurring respect to the great roles she played, they minced no words to tell guests how they felt.\n\nCharles Eguaveon who is the octogenarian\u2019s first child described her as \u201d the rock that I know I can always lean on without hesitation and doubt\u201d. With a reassuring smiles, he said \u201cnothing can separate me from my mother, she\u2019s paid her dues and it\u2019s our time to give her the due respect\u201d.\n\nOtasowie Eguaveon, another son was particularly excited \u201cthat am not here to pay funeral tribute but to celebrate my beloved mother alive, a virtuous woman who has done well for her children and her family at large\u201d. He remembered the sacrifices their mother made to give them good education despite she was not so privileged.\n\n\u201cChildren\u2019s children are a crown to the aged, and parents are the pride of their children.\u201d said the Holy Bible. Dcns Eguaveon no doubt has the rare crown of a fufilled motherhood whose children are proud of.\n\nAt 82, Iye\u2019s \u201cchildren rise up and call her blessed\u201d and was her husband alive today, he would rightly say of her: \u201dMany women have done excellently, but you surpass them all\u201d\n\nThis is the honour of a lifetime accorded a Nigerian mother whose sacrifices for her four sons and two daughters have yielded fruits and today are proud dual citizens of United States of America and Nigeria.\n\nIf the \u201cJoys of Motherhood\u201d a novel written by Buchi Emecheta in 1979 include being taken care of in old age, being surrounded by grandchildren, and being honored as a wife and mother, then Dcns. Ayo Eguaveon has rightly reaped them all in abundance.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

The foundation was set up by a former Inspector General of Police (IGP), Solomon Arase, who celebrated his 66th birthday.\n\nCommending Arase and other residents for their support in tackling insecurity in the state, the governor expressed satisfaction that \u201ccitizens of Edo State on their own spend time to rethink the security situation of the State, task themselves and raise resources to complement the government\u2019s efforts at tackling the security challenges in the state.\u201d\n\nObaseki further charged leaders across the country on selflessness, urging them on the need to give back to society, contributing effectively to the development of their communities.\n\nHe said leaders must invest in giving back to the society that made them, ensuring the empowerment of the less-privileged in society.\n\nCommending the philanthropic gesture of former Inspector General of Police, Arase, the governor said, \u201cWe thank you for your support and leadership. You are not one of the wealthiest of public officers but rich in terms of spirit. It\u2019s not how much you have received but how much you have given back to society.\n\n\u201cOur society requires so much from us. What is important for us now as elites is what we can give back to society. You are one of the best, finest, and most intelligent police officers ever produced in this country. We are proud of your achievements as you are passionate and in love with the profession of policing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe sole responsibility of the government is to provide security. Without security, we have no need for the government. This shows the importance of security in Nigeria. I am glad you are now in the vanguard of pushing for citizens\u2019 policing in the country,\u201d he added.\n\nEarlier, Arase said, \u201cThe people must come together to fight insecurity, which is our common enemy. This should be the model we must use and leave behind for Edo people. We have to team up as there are a lot of ungoverned spaces in this country. We must galvanise our youths to deepen security in the state and ensure the safety of our people.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe items donated include one sienna vehicle, 500 motorcycles, over 1,000 customised T-shirts, face caps, raincoats, torch lights, and ant whistles. These kits should be judiciously utilised to improve the security situation in the state. This foundation was set up in 2016 when I was retiring from the police force.\u201d\n\n\u201cSecurity is capital intensive and we all need to support the government to combat crime in our society as the government cannot do it alone unless through our collaborative efforts,\u201d Arase added\n\nReassuring of improved security in the state, the Edo State Commissioner of Police, Abutu Yaro pledged, \u201cWe will fight crime and criminality to the highest level in Edo State. We will not be reactive but proactive in fighting crime.

          "text": "The Supreme Court has thrown out the suit President Muhammadu Buhari and the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, SAN, filed to void section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022.\n\nThe apex court, in a unanimous decision by a seven-man panel of the Justices led by Justice Muhammad Dattijo, held that it lacked the jurisdiction to entertain the suit which it said amounted to an abuse of the judicial process.\n\nIt held that President Buhari was not a proper person to approach it with such suit, owing to the nature of reliefs that were sought.\n\nPresident Buhari and Malami had in the suit marked SC/CV/504/2022, contended that section 84(12) of the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 2022, was inconsistent with the provisions of sections 42, 65, 66, 106, 107, 131, 137, 147, 151, 177, 182, 192 and 196 of the constitution as well Article 2 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights.\n\nThe Plaintiffs, among other things, sought \u201ca declaration that the joint and or combined reading of Section 65, 66, 106, 107, 131, 137, 147, 151, 177, 182, 192 and 196 of the Constitution, the provision of Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022 which also ignores Section 84(3) of the same Act, is an additional qualifying and/or disqualifying factors for the National Assembly, House of Assembly, Gubernatorial and Presidential elections as enshrined in the said constitution, hence unconstitutional, unlawful, null and void\u201d.\n\n\u201cA declaration that having regard to the clear provision of section 1(3) of the Constitution read together with section 4 of the same Constitution, the legislative powers vested in the defendant do not permit or empower it to make any other law prescribing additional qualifying/disqualifying grounds for election to the national assembly, house of assembly, gubernatorial and presidential election outside the express constitutional qualification and disqualification provisions as already provided in each or all of sections 65, 66, 106, 107, 131, 137, 147, 151, 177, 182, 192 and 196 of the 1999 constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended), and without amendment to any of those sections is for the reason of inconsistency, unconstitutional and therefore null and void.\n\nAs well as, \u201cAn order nullifying the provision of Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022 by application of the blue-pencil rule, for being unconstitutional, illegal, null and void and having been made in excess of the legislative powers of the defendant as enshrined in section 4 of the constitution (as amended).\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, though the National Assembly was originally cited as sole Respondent in the matter, however, Rivers State, through the Speaker of its House of Assembly and its Attorney-General, subsequently applied and were joined as interested parties in the matter.\n\nWhile opposing the suit, Rivers state, in preliminary objection it filed before the apex court, argued that section 84(12) of the Electoral Act, 2022, was \u201cneither a detraction from the provisions of section 84(3) of the same Act nor from the provision of sections 42(1), 65, 66, 107, 131, 137, 177, 182 and 192 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended) and there is no any abuse of the Constitution by the defendant in enacting the provisions of section 84(12) of the Act\u201d.\n\nIt argued that President Buhari, having accented to the Electoral Bill, he, \u201chas conclusively discharged his duty under the Constitution\u201d.\n\nMore so, counsel to the state, Mr. Emmanuel Ukala, SAN, argued that the suit ought to have been filed before a High Court since President Buhari did not challenge the encroachment on his Executive powers by the Legislature.\n\nLikewise, the National Assembly, through its lawyer, Dr. Kayode Ajulo, asked the Supreme Court to strike out the suit, accusing both President Buhari and Malami of abusing the judicial process.\n\nHe argued that President Buhari, having assented to the Electoral Act, he could not turn back to challenge its provisions in court.\n\n\u201cThe crux of our objection is that the plaintiffs as constituted do not have the legal right to invoke the original jurisdiction of this court as provided for in section 232 (1) of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cIt can only be invoked if there is a dispute between the President and the National Assembly, when there is a dispute on the issue of law.\n\n\u201cThere are other places where this issue can be ventilated. It is not in this court.\n\n\u201cIt appears as if the President is suing himself, since he also assented to the Electoral Act in question.\n\n\u201cThe suit ought to have been filed in the name of those appointees and in that case we would not have been in this court.\n\n\u201cWhat they have attempted to do is to use the name of the President to invoke the original jurisdiction of this court, in representative capacity\u201d, Ajulo argued.\n\nOn its part, the Nigerian Bar Association, NBA, brought an application to be allowed into the case as amicus curiae (friend of the court).\n\nThe legal body, which said it was before the court to represent Nigerian citizens, also prayed the Supreme Court to dismiss the suit in public interest, Vanguard reported.\n\n\u201cIt is our submission that there is no conflict between section 84(12) and any other section of the Electoral Act, the 1999 Constitution, as amended, or the African Charter on Human and Peoples Right.\n\n\u201cYour lordships should take note of the ill the said section is meant to cure. The essence of the section is to provide a level playing field for all Nigerians, such that political appointees should not use their office to advance their personal interests\u201d, counsel for the NBA, Mr. Charles Mekunye, SAN, submitted.\n\nNevertheless, counsel for President Buhari and Malami, Mr. Lateef Fagbemi, SAN, urged the court to allow the appeal and nullify the controversial section which he said would deny political appointees the right to participate in election.\n\nIn its lead judgement that was prepared and delivered y Justice Emmanuel Agim on Friday, the apex court, upheld arguments of the Defendants and accordingly struck out the suit.",

Ahmed defected to the PDP, where he was given the ticket to re-contest the seat.\n\nIn an interview, Ahmed said because he was cheated by the leadership of the APC, as such, he was left with no option but to defect to PDP in order to actualize his ambition.\n\n\u201cI was cheated by the APC leadership, as such, I decided to change the party and joined the PDP and I thank God that I got the ticket to contest for the same position.\u201d\n\nAnother APC House of Representatives, Ahmed Fulani, lost the ticket following the reconciliation between Mattawale and a former Governor of the state, Abdul Aziz Yari. He was replaced by Zubairu Abdulmakik. Fulani defected to the PDP where he would contest the 2023 poll.\n\nIn the Kaura-Namoda/Birnin Magaji constituency, the incumbent member, Sani Umar, could not get the ticket to re-contest as he was replaced with Aminu Sani Jaji.\n\nIn an interview, the APC Publicity Secretary, Yusuf Idris, said House of Representatives members who could not get the tickets defected to the PDP even before the primaries.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThose members of the House of Representatives who did not get their tickets under the APC had already left the party before the primaries.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey refused to participate in the primary and returned to their former party, the PDP where they got the same tickets.\u201d\n\nOkowa\u2019s aides triumph\n\nThree PDP House of Representative members, Mr. Nicholas Ossai, Mr. Ben Igbakpa, and Efe Afe failed to secure tickets to contest the 2023 elections.\n\nOssai, a third-term member representing Ndokwa/Ukwuani Constituency, was defeated by an aide of the state Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, Mr. Nnamdi Ezechi.\n\nAlso, Ms. Erhiatake Ibori-Suenu, daughter of former Governor of Delta State, James Ibori, defeated Igbakpa to pick the PDP ticket.\n\nAfe of the Uvwie/Okpe constituency lost to immediate past Commissioner for Water Resources, Evelyn Obiri.\n\nSpeaking to one of our correspondents, Ezechi promised to work hard to win the general election,\n\nEfforts to reach Nicholas Ossai and Ben Igbakpa failed as calls put across to them were not responded to as of the time of filing this report.\n\nEkiti lawmakers\n\nIn Ekiti State, one senator and four House of Representatives members lost their bid to return to their positions following last month\u2019s primaries.\n\nIt was gathered that some of those who won the National Assembly primaries were close to the governor.\n\nSome of the National Assembly members who lost have resolved to seek legal redress to challenge the elections.\n\nThe APC Senator representing Ekiti North Senatorial District, Olubunmi Adetumbi, was defeated by Cyril Fasuyi, the Director-General of the party\u2019s governorship candidate, Abayomi Oyebanji, who won last Saturday\u2019s poll in the state.\n\nAlso, Peter Owolabi ((APC Ekiti North Federal Constituency 1) was defeated in his return ticket bid by Mr. Akin Rotimi, a former Senior Special Assistant on Strategic Communications to the state Governor Kayode Fayemi.\n\nHowever, nothing has been said about the ticket for Ekiti Central Federal, Mrs. Omowumi Ogunlola\u2019s constituency, which was contested by her, Biodun Omoleye, former Chief of Staff to Ekiti State Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, and Mr. Dele Phillips.\n\nHowever, state Publicity Secretary, Segun Dipe, in an interview, said Fayemi did not grab the party\u2019s National Assembly tickets. He said \u201cThose who won and those who lost are governor\u2019s men and governor\u2019s women.\n\n\u201cSo, I don\u2019t know how on earth anybody will think the governor will be interested in collecting tickets from somebody who is with him and giving it to somebody who is with him. People will just come up with conjectures.\n\n\u201cI think people should just allow our internal democracy to work out. At every stage of our election or process, people will always go ahead to make permutations, but they should just allow us to do things our way and stop all these concerns especially if they are not APC members.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any APC member will say that Senator Adetumbi is not Fayemi\u2019s man or that Cyril Fasuyi is Fayemi\u2019s man more than him. I don\u2019t think anybody will say Wumi Ogunlola is not Fayemi\u2019s woman or that anybody is Fayemi\u2019s man or woman than anybody,\u201d he said.\n\nProminent APC members in Kano State, including a former governor and incumbent Senator, Ibrahim Shekarau; a former member of the House of Representatives, Abdulmumini Jibrin, and an ex-presidential aide, Kawu Sulaiman defected to the New Nigeria Peoples Party where they will contest National Assembly elections.\n\nFollowing the APC leaders\u2019 failure to resolve the crisis in the Kebbi State chapter, federal lawmakers, including Senator Adamu Aliero; Senator Yahaya Abdullahi, and a member of the House of Representatives, Mohammed Jega, have joined the PDP. Aliero will contest the Kebbi Central Senatorial seat with the state Governor, Atiku Bagudu.\n\nIn Benue State, three PDP House of Representatives members lost the party\u2019s tickets.\n\nThey are Francis Ottah Agbo representing Ado/Ogbadibo/Okpokwu; Mark Gbilah of Gwer West/Gwer East and Kpam Sokpo of the Buruku constituency.\n\nAn APC House of Representatives, Herba Hembe, dumped the party for the Labour Party, where he contested and won the governorship ticket.\n\nHe, however, defected to the Labour party where he contested and won the gubernatorial ticket.\n\nBut Senator Orker Jev representing Benue North-West failed to seek re-election because Governor Samuel Ortom got the ticket.\n\nThe PDP Publicity Secretary, Bemgba Iortyom, in an interview, said, \u201cHe (Jev) only exercised his right not to contest because as a party member you have the right to contest and not to contest.\u201d\n\nJev\u2019s media aide, Samson Yanor, in an interview, said a zoning arrangement was between two areas of the state; Jemgba and Minda\n\nAccording to him, the senatorial slot which has been in Jemgba for the past 16 years ought to move back to Minda, hence the senator\u2019s decision.\n\nThe Senator representing Kwara Central zone, Dr. Ibrahim Oloriegbe, lost the party\u2019s ticket to the Turaki of Ilorin, Alhaji Saliu Mustapha.\n\nOloriegbe said that he accepted his defeat by Mustapha which he attributed to the wish of Allah.\n\nIn Plateau State, all the three incumbent senators will not return to the National Assembly.\n\nWhile the Senator representing Plateau North, Istifanus Gyang, who was elected on the platform of the PDP failed to secure the party\u2019s ticket as he lost to a House of Representatives member, Simon Mwadkwon; the Senator representing Plateau South, Prof.Nora Daduut, who was elected on the platform of the APC did not contest the party\u2019s primary.\n\nThe state Governor, Simon Lalong, got the APC\u2019s ticket.\n\nSenator Hezekiah Dimka, representing Plateau Central on the platform of the APC, contested the governorship ticket of the state but lost out.\n\nOut of the eight available House of Representatives seats in the state, only the lawmaker representing Shendam/Mikang/Qua-anpan on the platform of the APC, Komsol Longgap, failed to clinch the party\u2019s ticket.\n\nA member of the House of Representatives representing Illela/Gwadabawa Constituency in Sokoto State, Abdullahi Balarabe Salame, in an interview said he had no regret not going back to the National Assembly.\n\nSalame, who is a member of the APC and governorship aspirant, stated, \u201cI joined the race for the governorship primary with belief that every member would be given a level playing field.\n\n\u201cWhen I and some other aspirants saw how the things were being handled, we complained to the national headquarters of our party but nothing was done.\n\n\u201cOn the day of the primary, we held a press conference calling for direct primaries but the leaders of the party never cared.\u201d\n\nAlso Senator Ibrahim Gobir, Senator representing Sokoto East, will not return to the Senate.\n\nGobir lost to Ahmed Aliyu Sokoto, the anointed candidate of the leader of the party in the state, Aliyu Magatakarda Wamakko.\n\nAbiodun\u2019s aides\n\nAlso, five out of nine House of Representatives members in Ogun State and all the three senators are not re-contesting their seats. The Senator representing Ogun Central, Ibikunle Amosun, did not contest the APC senatorial primary.\n\nThose who lost their return tickets are Lanre Edun (Abeokuta South), Jimoh Aremu (Egbado-North/Imeko-Afon), Kolawole Lawal (Egbdo South/Ipokia ), and Kolapo Osunsanya ((Ijebu-Ode/Odogbolu/Ijebu-North-East). All of them are APC members. A House of Representatives member, Adekoya Adesegun (PDP Ijebu North/Ijebu-East/Ogunwaterside) also lost the ticket.\n\nWhile Senator Tolu Odebiyi, Ogun West, was defeated by Senator Olamilekan Adeola, currently representing Lagos West. Lekan Mustapha, Ogun East, was said to have stepped down for a former governor of the state, Otunba Gbenga Daniel.\n\nThe Chief of Staff to the state governor, Shuaib Salis, secured the Ogun Central ticket.\n\nIt was learned most of those who won the party\u2019s tickets were loyalists of the state Governor, Dapo Abiodun, while those who lost out were in the camp of his predecessor, Amosun.\n\nEdun had after the primary threatened to challenge the result, describing the exercise which led to the emergence of the current Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Afolabi Afuape, as the party\u2019s candidate as a charade.\n\nCommenting on the political struggle between the governors and the National Assembly members, a political analyst and Media Specialist, at Caleb University, Mr Olawale Adekoya, berated governors, who would contest senatorial seats.\n\nHe said, \u2018\u2019The trend is dangerous because we have desecrated and abused the parliament. The parliament is the heartbeat of modern democracy. A national assembly is meant for the best brain, that is where the power of scholarship, charisma, intellectualism, and inherent quality must be found. What we have today is that the national assembly has been turned into a retirement ground where old and sick Nigerians are being navigated to spend the rest of their political years. Certain laws should be put in place to checkmate this dangerous trend.\n\nCredit: The Punch",

          "text": "National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Senator Abdullahi Adamu has expressed the confidence that the party will retain Osun state in the coming governorship election and also win the 2023 presidential election as well as others.\n\nThe election, slated for July 16th, will be coming up about a month after the APC coasted home to victory in Ekiti governorship election.\n\nSpeaking Thursday in Abuja during the inauguration of the National Campaign Council for the state, Adamu said Nigerians chose APC, assuring his leadership would do everything possible to retain it.\n\nThe 86-member campaign council is headed by Lagos state Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu and co-chaired by Kano state Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje.\n\nSome other members of the committee include Senator Godswill Akpabio, Hon. Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi, Senator Gbemisola Saraki, Abubakar Malami (SAN) and Jason Sirika, among others.\n\nAccording to Adamu, the plan to win and the ability to execute the plan squarely rests with the leadership of the campaign team, saying this would be brought to bear on their assignment.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no option to winning the national election and these state elections are like I said, forebears to the national election.\n\n\u201cWe must show those who love us by showing those who are our adversaries in the strongest possible way that we are in control.\n\n\u201cNo apologies to anybody, we are the party of government, we are the party ruling the country today, no apologies for anybody.\n\n\u201cThe reality is Nigerians chose APC and we will do everything we can to retain this position of envy,\u201d Adamu said.\n\nWhile urging the campaign council to show commitment, the APC national chairman said: \u201cWe are winning the battle of the states, but the real war to be won is the presidential election in 2023. And I do hope that we will not spare efforts to ensure that we come back victorious.\u201d\n\nGanduje preaches reconciliation\n\nResponding after the inauguration, Governor Ganduje, the co-chairman of the campaign team, called for a total reconciliation in Osun state before the election.\n\nHe said: \u201cReconciliation is totally necessary so that we will believe in each other. We agreed that all stakeholders in Osun state will come together and constitute into one single force in order to win this important election.\n\n\u201cI am happy the secretary of our great party is from Osun state and I think he is very useful to this election in Osun state.\n\n\u201cSome of us who participated in the last election that brought the current governor into office, we knew the interplay of variables that took place, and that led us to a new terminology in election, inconclusive election.\u201d\n\nGanduje, however, assured the party of his commitment, saying \u201cI believe the stakeholders in Osun state will add value to their preparedness and ensure that the 30 LGAs in Osun state leadership were ready for this election.\n\n\u201cWe will take the previous events and unify it and see how things stood at that time and what variables that went in-between the election and now, and see how we can compete for success because this is our efforts to our party.\u201d\n\n\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "The Supreme Court on Friday struck out President Muhammadu Buhari and the Attorney General of the Federation\u2019s suit challenging Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act.\n\nThe case was expunged on the grounds that it lacks the jurisdiction to entertain the suit and is an abuse of court process.\n\nEarlier, a notice for the judgment delivery was served on President Buhari and the National Assembly on Thursday, inviting them to appear before the court today for the judgment.\n\nThe President and his Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, had filed a suit at the Supreme Court, seeking an interpretation of the controversial clause in the Electoral Amendment Act 2022.\n\nIn the suit filed on April 29, Buhari and Malami, who are the plaintiffs, listed the National Assembly as the sole defendant.\n\nSenate, Reps To Appeal Court Order Removing Section 84 (12) From Electoral Act\n\nAppeal Court Sets Aside Judgement On Section 84(12) Of Electoral Act\n\nThere have been several debates regarding Section 84(12) of the amended Electoral Act 2022 which was assented to in February.\n\nUpon assenting to the act, President Buhari had asked the National Assembly to delete the contended clause, however, the parliament declined the president\u2019s request.\n\nSection 84 (12) of the legislation holds that, \u201cno political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the convention or congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election.\u201d\n\nIn their suit marked SC/CV/504/2022 and filed on April 29, 2022, President Buhari and Malami sought an order of the apex court to strike out the section of the Electoral Act, which they argue was inconsistent with the nation\u2019s constitution.\n\nAccording to the court document, the plaintiffs contend that the Section 84(12) of the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 2022 is inconsistent with the provisions of sections 42, 65, 66, 106, 107, 131, 137, 147, 151, 177, 182, 192 and 196 of the Constitution of Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, (as amended), as well Article 2 of the African Charter on Human and People and Peoples Rights.\n\nThe plaintiffs further contended that the constitution already makes provisions for qualification and disqualification for the offices of the President and Vice President, Governor and Deputy Governor, Senate and House of Representatives, House of Assembly, Ministers, Commissioners and Special Advisers.\n\nThey urged the Supreme Court to make: \u201cA declaration that the joint and or combined reading of the section 65, 66, 106, 107, 131, 137, 147, 151, 177, 182, 192 and 196 of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, (as amended), the provision of Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022 which also ignores Section 84(3) of the same Act, is an additional qualifying and/or disqualifying factors for the National Assembly, House of Assembly, Gubernatorial and Presidential elections as enshrined in the said constitution, hence unconstitutional, unlawful, null and void\u201d.\n\nHowever, in its decision on Friday, the Supreme Court held that President Buhari having assented to the bill on February 25 2022, can not turn around to challenge same act .\n\nIn a unanimous judgement delivered by Justice Emmanuel Agim the court said allowing the suit to have it\u2019s way will amount to approbating and reprobating at the same time and no court of law shall allow that.\n\nThe Apex Court unanimously agreed that President Buhari lacked the jurisdiction to bring the suit before it because of the nature of the reliefs sought.",

We eventually got him when he stepped out of the United Kingdom, and we sent him to court,\u201d Buhari said during a bilateral meeting with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on the margins of the 26th Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Kigali, Rwanda.\n\n\u201cLet him defend all that he has said there. His lawyers have access to him.

          "title": "NNPC Must Address Profiteering at Private Depots to Curb Fuel Scarcity, Independent Marketers Say",
          "text": "As the ongoing petrol scarcity in Nigeria bites harder, a factional national leadership of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria, (IPMAN) has urged the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited to intervene and address the profiteering activities of depots owners under the umbrella of Depot and Petroleum Products Marketers Association of Nigeria (DAPPMAN).\n\nThe factional National President of IPMAN, Mr Debo Ahmed and the National Publicity Secretary, Chinedu Ukadike made the call in a joint statement issued on Thursday.\n\nThey also disowned another factional National President of the association, Mr. Chinedu Okoronkwo, who had warned IPMAN members not to sell petrol above the N165 per litre approved pump price.\n\nThis was just as the National Association of Road Transport Operators (NARTO) also disowned the Association of Distributors and Transporters of Petroleum Products (ADITOP) for equally warning marketers not to sell petrol above N165 per litre.\n\nHowever, the two IPMAN national officers in the statement issued Thursday, expressed concern over the sale of petrol to members of IPMAN above the government\u2019s approved template of N148, which they noted was inimical to their survival.\n\nWhile agreeing that IPMAN marketers should stick to the government approved price of N165 per litre at retail outlets across the country, the officers called on the NNPC to save their members from the excesses of DAPPMAN.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cThe government is doing nothing about the private depots that are violating the system by selling higher. IPMAN members have suffered a lot in the hands of private depot owners.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate the efforts of NNPC to make product available but you cannot rob Peter to pay Paul.\n\nWe have really suffered a lot of setback based on the cost of diesel.\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t saying there is non-availability of petroleum products, but what is available isn\u2019t sufficient The cost of diesel has also increased. These two factors have led to profiteering at tank farms, whereby marketers buy petroleum products at the rate of N169, to N170 above government controlled pump price.\n\n\u201cThis non-availability has led to profiteering from the hands of Products Depots Operations along the coastal areas. We are also finding it difficult to move products from Lagos- Kano- Kaduna since we are heavily dependent on private depot owners since they are located along the coastal areas.\u201d\n\nIPMAN contended that after looking at all these factors, it now costs close to N700,000 to move petroleum products from Lagos to Kano, since they are at the mercy of the private depot owners.\n\nAccording to the statement, it was becoming increasingly difficult for marketers to sell petroleum products with this little margin.\n\nThey argued that it was easy for marketers to move products from NNPC depots and sell at N165, adding that they were getting the product at N160 instead of the approved N148, from private depot tank farm owners.\n\nThe IPMAN statement added, \u201cThere is no way a marketer will use N5 to sell petroleum products. It isn\u2019t viable, considering the cost of maintenance of the filling station and also cost of fund.\n\n\u201cThe price of a litre of diesel is very huge and we are borrowing these funds from commercial banks. We want to use this opportunity to tell NNPC on behalf of marketers to ensure that we have sufficient products.\n\n\u201cThese products are being sold to private depots at government approved rates, not above N148.00. If they can\u2019t stick to approved template, they should close down those tank farms selling above what government has stipulated.\u201d\n\nThe IPMAN officials, however, criticised Okoronkwo for speaking on behalf of the association, saying he has no authority to speak on behalf of IPMAN as he was not the president of the body.\n\nAlso disowning ADITOP, the National Chairman of NARTO, Alhaji Lawal Othman, dismissed the claim by the National Chairman of ADITOP, Alhaji Mohammed Danzaki, saying the group was nonexistent as he maintained that only NARTO was known to players in the downstream sector of the oil and gas industry.\n\nDanzaki and Okoronkwo had on Wednesday warned marketers against selling petrol above the government\u2019s approved N165 per litre at the pumps\n\nMeanwhile, the factional president, Okoronkwo, yesterday revealed that the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) had threatened to sanction private depot owners who sell the product above the federal government\u2019s approved ex-depot price of N148.17 per litre.\n\nOkoronkwo disclosed this while speaking to reporters in a telephone interview in Kano, yesterday.\n\nHe said the NNPC issued the warning after a meeting with the officials of the IPMAN in Abuja on Wednesday, saying the NNPC had threatened to stop giving supply to private depot owners who continue to violate the order.\n\n\u201cHenceforth any depot owner who continues to sell the product above the approved ex-depot price will be blacklisted and sanctioned as the government would not fold its arms and allow such unpatriotic depot owners to continue to exploit people,\u201d Okoronkwo quoted the NNPC officials as saying.\n\nOkoronkwo commended the NNPC for taking necessary steps to check the excesses of the private depot owners and urged NMDPRA to ensure total compliance with the NNPC directive so as to return normalcy in the supply and distribution of petroleum products across the country.\n\nPeter Uzoho in Lagos and Ibrahim Shuaibu in Kano",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government om Thursday disclosed that over N10 trillion has been saved since the Treasury Single Account (TSA) was introduced by the Muhammadu Buhari-led administration.\n\nThe Director-General of Bureau of Public Service Reforms (BPSR), Dr. Dasuki Arabi, who made this known at a news briefing at Abuja, declared that government had succeeded in getting the TSA deployed in all ministries, departments and agencies.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cChallenges have come in the implementation at the initial stage, but we are overcoming that and government is able to save over N10 trillion over the years because whatever you\u2019re generating now goes into a TSA that is managed by somebody else, not you.\n\n\u201cAnd government, especially at the top is always able to see what has come into our TSA today and what has gone out of that. So planning has been simplified. Budgeting has been simplified. Our distribution and allocation of resources have been simplified and streamlined.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the performance of the Bureau in the execution of its core mandate particularly in ensuring the full implementation of reform policies and programmes for the government, he said the introduction of Integration Personnel and Payroll Information System (IPPIS) led to the reduction of the Federal Civil Service personnel to 720,000.\n\nThe IPPIS, the DG further explained, led to the weeding out of about 70,000 ghost workers from the service.\n\nUsing video slides to illustrate, Arabi said: \u201cOn the next slide, these are some of the benefits that we think government or Nigerians have benefited out of the work that we have been doing in collaboration with other agencies of government, where they with the introduction of IPPIS about 70,000 ghost workers have been eliminated from the payroll.\n\n\u201cWe have a one shot opportunity to look at IPPIS and say, as at today, we have 720,000 public servants working for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis is a great achievement which I think we need to encode and we need to get it celebrated by all of us. We\u2019ve been able to reduce more than N220 billion wastage through wrong management of IPPIS on payroll by ministries, departments and agencies of government. We have reduced the budget deficits and change the budget composition.\u201d\n\nThe DG said as part of the reforms in the service, the Government Integrated Financial Management Information System (GIGMIS) had made government business paperless and \u201cit has reduced man to man contact and processing, payments in ministries, departments and agencies of government.\u201d\n\nAccording to him: \u201cTransparency has been improved. A lot of things are done even outside the office. But the most important thing is the ability given to central agencies, office of Accountant General of the Federation, and the Ministry of Finance to see what is happening in all ministries, departments and agencies of government because GIFMIS is not controlled by the agencies.\n\n\u201cIt is controlled by the central agencies, but every activity you are doing under GIFMIS somebody, is watching you and is monitoring that activity. This is a great achievement for us and for all of you and for all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThere is better access to information on finances in this country. Whatever you do, somebody\u2019s watching you and somebody can request and get the information. International rating agencies standards and co have more confidence in Nigeria now because they have access to information and data that they were not able to get before this time.\n\n\u201cAgain, this is a breakdown of some of the benefits of the reforms that we\u2019ve been driving.\u201d\n\nOn deductions blamed on the IPPIS, which has been a source of friction especially between government and universities\u2019 unions, Arabi affirmed that deductions just do not occur on their own except where loans had been obtained.\n\nHis words: \u201cOn deductions and complaints around IPPIS, you know, we have just started from the pilot ministries, six. We went to 10 then because of the push by the international community, especially the development partners, who are really eager to get Nigeria at that level at par with other nations we went through.\n\n\u201cI remember, I\u2019m privileged to be part of the team that started the discussion around IPPIS and were able to get different sectors of the Public Service to come and have meetings and discussions with us to understand their various cadre within the field, their pay structure; their responsibilities and all these have been taken care of.\n\n\u201cAlong the line, there are some new creations and I think there are some omissions, which government is addressing, but I would not take these men complain that their deductions like that, it cannot be arbitrary.\n\n\u201cFor every deduction that is done, there is justification for that. And if there are problems, they are identified and complaints I made, that will be rectified. and quite a number of our colleagues, some may have taken lot of loans that have committed themselves, deductions are being made left, right and center.\n\n\u201cSo, I want to assure you and the person that complained to you, that government is addressing some of these problems.\u201d\n\nThe DG also stated that government is silently implementing aspects of the Oransanye Report on Civil Service Reforms.\n\nHe said government would soon make an announcement on the implementation of the White Paper.\n\n\u201cOn Oronsaye white paper government has been working around that.You are aware that it was implemented in good time. And over the years, there have been changes. More agencies and commissions were created which makes it necessary for government to look back and say okay, between Oronsanye White Paper and today, how many more agencies have been created?\n\n\u201cSo, that was why those committees were created. But beyond that, I want to tell you that some silent aspects of the report are being implemented silently. We\u2019re hoping that very soon we will conclude on that and the major activity will come. So, just wait for the announcement from the secretary to the government of the Federation, who is the chairman of the implementation committee of the white paper,\u201d Arabi further said.\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja",

          "title": "Buhari to Johnson: No 3rd Term for Me, First Person Who Tried It Didn\u2019t End Well",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari, on Thursday, reassured Nigerians and the world that he would not stay in office a day longer than May 29, 2023, when his second and final term as president will end. Buhari spoke in Kigali, Rwanda, during the 26th edition of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM), a biennial gathering of Commonwealth countries hosted by different member countries on a rotating basis.\n\nThe Nigerian president told British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, on the sidelines of the conference, that the first person, who tried to extend his tenure \u2013 an apparent reference to former President Olusegun Obasanjo \u2013 did not end well.\n\nBuhari welcomed the British government\u2019s security assistance to Nigeria, but said a good way to start was for the United Kingdom to first stabilise Libya.\n\nThe fall of the Libyan leader, Muammar Gadaffi, in 2011, after 42 years in power, in an uprising that threw the country into a protracted civil war, has been blamed for the crisis in the Sahel, which has had terrible implications for Nigeria\u2019s security.\n\nBuhari justified the continued detention of the leader of the proscribed Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu. He said Kanu had jumped bail in the past, which made his bail this time difficult.\n\nThe president visited the Kigali Genocide Memorial in Rwanda, toured the permanent exhibitions at the Memorial, and laid a wreath at the mass graves, where more than 250,000 victims of the genocide were buried.\n\nHe made a passionate appeal to Nigerians to be tolerant of one another and embrace peace.\n\nBuhari, who also met with the Jamaican Prime Minister, Andrew Holness, in Kigali, extolled the cordial political and economic relations between Nigeria and Jamaica.\n\nA release by Buhari\u2019s media adviser, Femi Adesina, said at the meeting with Johnson, the Nigerian president reiterated his resolve to respect the maximum term limit in the Nigerian constitution.\n\nJohnson had asked if Buhari would run for office again, perhaps, unfamiliar with the country\u2019s democratic system, but the Nigerian leader immediately retorted, \u201cAnother term for me? No! The first person who tried it didn\u2019t end very well.\u201d\n\nObasanjo had towards the end of his second term in 2007 attempted to seek a third term in office but met stiff resistance at the National Assembly. The federal legislature threw away the clause that sought to give a sitting president the right to seek a third term. But the former president has always denied having anything to do with the idea.\n\nAddressing speculations that Kanu was not being allowed to see his lawyers privately, the president dispelled such insinuations, saying the detained separatist is being given every opportunity under the law \u201cto justify all the uncomplimentary things he had been saying against Nigeria in Britain.\n\n\u201cHe felt very safe in Britain, and said awful things against Nigeria. We eventually got him, when he stepped out of the United Kingdom, and we sent him to court. Let him defend all that he has said there. His lawyers have access to him. Remember he jumped bail before, how are we sure he won\u2019t do it again, if he\u2019s admitted to bail?\u201d\n\nOn the British prime minister\u2019s keenness to help Nigeria in the area of security, Buhari said helping to stabilise Libya would be a pragmatic and strategic first step to the deployment of such assistance.\n\nThe fall of Ghaddafi, with the active involvement of Britain, the United States, and France, unleashed armed groups on countries of the Sahel. \u201cAnd they are causing havoc everywhere, as the only thing they know how to do is to shoot guns,\u201d Buhari told Johnson.\n\nGiving an update on Boko Haram insurgency, Buhari said there was a serious effort to educate the people on the fact that only an unserious person could kill innocent people, \u201cand say Allah Akbar (God is Great).\n\n\u201cGod is justice. You can\u2019t take innocent souls, and ascribe it to God. And the education process is working, the people now understand Boko Haram as anti-God, and not about religion.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Johnson said he was delighted to hear the good news on trade between Britain and Nigeria. He said the UK was further reducing tariffs on some goods going to Nigeria.\n\nThe prime minister described the relationship between Nigeria and the UK as \u201cvery strong attachment,\u201d adding, \u201cI just want to be sure that we are doing enough. It\u2019s a massive partnership for us, and we need to capitalise on it.\u201d\n\nHe offered condolences on some recent attacks in Nigeria, particularly, on churches.\n\nBuhari paid tribute to the memory of the victims of the Rwanda genocide and prayed for healing for the survivors. He told newsmen that the lessons from his visit were the need for Nigerians to continue to be tolerant of one another, and for the country to also preserve its own historical antecedents from the Nigeria Civil War (1967-1970).\n\nAccording to Buhari, \u201cI went through all the experiences from 15 January 1966 to date. I was a governor, minister, and Head of State and went through detention. I returned to partisan politics and will finish my two terms as constitutionally allowed. We fought a 30-month bitter civil war and we killed about a million of each other. Nigeria went through this kind of terrible development process.\u201d\n\nBefore departing the Memorial, Buhari wrote in the visitor\u2019s book, \u201cRemembering the victims of this dark history of the Rwanda Genocide, we pray that humanity will never experience this kind of hatred, wickedness and violence toward others, because of their ethnic background, religion, and beliefs.\n\n\u201cNigeria is strongly committed to the prevention of mass atrocity anywhere in the world and believes that perpetrators of such crimes; and their enablers, anywhere in the world must be held accountable.\u201d\n\nAt his meeting with the Jamaican Prime Minister, Holness, Buhari said, \u201cOur relationship dates back in time, to generations ago. Thank you for strengthening it, particularly, on the economic and political fronts.\u201d\n\nHolness noted that Nigeria had been very supportive of Jamaica, with the two countries having commercial agreements in place.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe maiden flight from Lagos to Jamaica about two years ago was well received. We equally have relationships in the creative industry, sports and finance.\u201d\n\nMaking reference to a recent opinion article written by Buhari, which was published in international newspapers, Holness said he agreed that the Commonwealth could be more than just a club of friends, who have affinity with the United Kingdom, \u201cand become an economic powerhouse. All the elements are there: common language, large market, and many others. It can become a serious economic force.\u201d\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja",
