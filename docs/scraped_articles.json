Few gaps that were identified are being addressed and we expect a balanced and fit-for-purpose system in the following weeks, Salami said.\n\nIn February 2022, a batch of 1,859 teachers and principals from Junior Secondary Schools across Edo state were given a comprehensive 10-day training to prepare them to deliver lessons and manage their schools using the EdoBEST pedagogy.\n\nMost principals and teachers in the schools visited reported that their pupils are learning better while classrooms are being managed better.

We are not increasing our charges,\u201d he noted.",

One of the things that we are doing is to remove the veil and make it open and transparent and have documentation and ensure that we removed the fear of taking away the intellectual property rights of the traditional medicine practitioners,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Director-General of NIPRD, Dr Obi Adigwe, said the health agency has commenced a partnership with the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) in South Africa to grow the traditional medicine industry and ensure medicine security in Africa.\n\nHe said there are plans to facilitate research and development, human capital development and community engagement, all in the context of the Traditional Medicine Value Chain.\n\nThe move is also expected to produce various socio-economic benefits including business and investment opportunities, jobs and income generation opportunities for stakeholders involved in the African Traditional Medicine Pharmaceutical Value Chain, especially traditional health practitioners.\n\nDr. Adigwe insisted that Africans must take responsibility for providing access to safe, affordable life-saving medicines for the people of the region.\n\n\u201cMedicine security that we conceptualised a decade ago was a concept that argued that unless we as Africans begin to determine how our medicines are developed, produced and how our medicines are distributed, we will never be in a position to ensure sustainable access to safe, affordable life-saving medicines to our people.\n\n\u201cEmbedded in the medicine security concept are social-economic indicators that align with local manufacturing and local development of these resources.\n\nDr. Adigwe insisted that \u201cas a people, we must not abdicate the responsibility of providing healthcare for our people to others outside the continent.\n\n\u201cWe must not abdicate the responsibility for developing socio-economic programmes that will ensure that our youth, women have jobs, adequately employed, they no longer seek pastures whether through legal or illegal immigration elsewhere.\n\nThe Deputy Vice-Chancellor, University of Kwazulu Natal, and Head of the College of Humanities, Professor Nhlanhla Mkhize on his part explained that solutions for African healthcare challenges should be based on the commitment of African people to promote, preserve and protect their local knowledge systems.",

His assets and properties, on conviction, are liable to forfeiture as provided under the Cybercrime (Prohibition, prevention, etc) Act, 2015.\n\n\u201cA cursory look at the extradition request and the affidavit evidence in respect of the extradition application shows that the evidence against the applicant is so overwhelming that the court\u2019s discretion should not be exercised in his favour.\u201d\n\nUkeyima added that since extradition cases are purely affidavit evidence cases and may not really require a lengthy time to conclude, the court should refuse Kyari\u2019s application for bail in view of the risk involved.\n\nMeanwhile, Justice Donatus Okorowo of the Federal High Court in Abuja has rescheduled the hearing for June 14 in a suit by a group, the Incorporated Trustees of Northern Peace Foundation (NPF), seeking to stop Kyari\u2019s extradition.\n\nThe group, in the suit, marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/854/2021, argued that extradition of the suspended officer would amount to a violation of his rights.\n\nParties to the case filed on Monday by Kayode Ajulo were absent when it was called.\n\nOkorowo, who had once threatened to strike out the suit for lack of diligent prosecution, adjourned till June 14.",

          "text": "By Gbade Ogunwale, Abuja, Justina Asishana, Minna; Onimisi Alao, Yola; Mike Odiegwu, Port Harcourt; Uja Emmanuel, Makurdi and Aiwerie Okungbowa, Asaba\n\nSouth\u2019s governors join Wike to meet IBB\n\nTambuwal, Bala, Saraki, Hayatu-Deen visit Obaseki, Okowa\n\nAtiku submits forms, get Fintiri\u2019s backing\n\nOrtom pleads with aspirants to consider \u2018bigger picture\u2019\n\nThe battle for the 2023 Presidential ticket of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has split the main opposition platform into three camps.\n\nThe division underscores the protracted disagreement over zoning, ahead of the primary.\n\nIn the first camp are former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, who submitted his presidential nomination form yesterday, and his supporters, including Adamawa State Governor Ahmadu Fintiri and his Edo State counterpart, Godwin Obaseki.\n\nThe second camp comprises aspirants pushing for a consensus presidential candidate.\n\nThe contenders are former Senate President Bukola Saraki, Bauchi State Governor Bala Mohammed and his Sokoto State counterpart, Aminu Tambuwal.\n\nThe third camp is made up of Northerners and Southerners canvassing for power shift and zoning of the ticket to the South.\n\nLed by Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike, the group comprises pro-zoning governors from the South and their Northern allies.\n\nOther members of the third group include Enugu State Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, Abia State Governor Okezie Ikpeazu, Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde, Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom and his predecessor, Senator Gabriel Suswam.\n\nHowever, the camps that other aspirants, including former Senate President Anyim Pius Anyim, Publisher Dele Momodu, and Mazi Sam Ohuabunwa belong to are not known yet.\n\nAkwa Ibom State Governor Udom Emmanuel has been lukewarm, despite collecting presidential nomination form.\n\nWhile the pro-consensus group visited Governors Ifeanyi Okowa (Delta) in Asaba and Obaseki in Benin yesterday to sell the consensus option to him, the pro-zoning camp paid a consultative visit to former military President Ibrahim Babangida and former Head of State Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar at Babangida\u2019s Hilltop Residence, Minna, capital of Niger State.\n\nWike was accompanied to the meeting by Ikpeazu, Ugwuanyi, Makinde and Suswam.\n\nThe group first held a closed-door meeting with Abdulsalami, who followed them to Babangida\u2019s house where the meeting continued for about 20 minutes.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of his colleagues, Ikpeazu said they were in Minna to consult with the two elder statesmen and discuss pressing national issues.\n\n\u201cI have come with my colleagues, the governors of Enugu, Oyo, River and some members of the National Assembly to consult with the former Head of State and President and discuss national issues and the problems affecting our country.\n\n\u201cWe commended him for his support for the unity of this country and the discussions went very well and we will take it from there,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen asked about the response of Babangida to their visit, Ikpeazu said the former military President expressed his preference for the younger generation to take up the baton of leadership and rescue Nigeria.\n\nOn Wike\u2019s presidential ambition, the governor said it would be discussed later.\n\nSaraki, Tambuwal and Mohammed met with Obaseki and Okowa separately in their states.\n\nThe aspirants are exploring the possibility of having one of the 13 aspirants as a consensus candidate for the 2023 presidential ticket.\n\nThe consultation is coming amid agitation by PDP stakeholders in the South to have the ticket conceded to the region.\n\nThe four PDP governors have aligned with the demand of the Southern Governors Forum for power to shift to the South in 2023.\n\nDetails of discussions between the three aspirants and the four governors were not disclosed.\n\nThe team had held a similar meeting with the Taraba State Governor Darius Ishaku in Abuja last week.\n\nObaseki said Nigeria needed a president with the capacity to rebuild and unite the nation.\n\nHe said: \u201cForty years ago, we had a big cake to share, but not today. That cake has disappeared. Whoever aspires to be president of this country must be somebody who Nigerians are ready to give ingredients to start to rebuild a bigger cake for us all.\n\n\u201cFor us in Edo, we are ready for building a bigger, stronger and better Nigeria, as we cannot continue the way we are today. We are concerned that except the PDP comes out and rallies Nigerians around, it will be difficult to pull Nigeria back from the brinks.\n\n\u201cThings are really bad and difficult for our people. We have never had it this bad. We have never had the level of combination of poverty and inflation, as food inflation in Nigeria is pushing millions of people into starvation, coupled with the security challenges.\u201d\n\nYesterday, Atiku submitted his nomination documents at the PDP national secretariat in Abuja.\n\nThe documents were submitted on his behalf by media mogul, Dr. Raymond Dokpesi, who is the chairman of a technical committee in charge of Atiku\u2019s presidential aspiration.\n\nDokpesi, while submitting the documents, declined comments on Atiku\u2019s disposition to zoning.\n\n\u201cBy the special grace of God, when we get to the bridge, we will cross it,\u201d Dokpesi said.\n\nHe dismissed reports of disagreement among PDP stakeholders over zoning.\n\n\u201cI am not aware of any internal problems in the PDP. No crisis whatsoever. PDP is one big family. We shall all be together as brothers and sisters.\n\n\u201cDefinitely, we have nothing against whatever the party will decide, but the zoning will not be against us,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 37-member zoning committee chaired by Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State is slated to hold its third meeting at the PDP national secretariat today.\n\nThe committee, which was given a two-week time frame, is expected to submit its recommendations this week.\n\nFintiri has backed Atiku\u2019s presidential bid.\n\nHe declared his support for Atiku on Sunday on his return to Yola after about three weeks outside Adamawa State.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the Yola International Airport, Fintiri said Atiku was the best option for the ticket.\n\nThe governor said he was confident that Atiku would get it.\n\nHe added that his team has already set machinery in motion to canvas for support across the country and ensure that Atiku gets the PDP ticket.\n\nFintiri said: \u201cPolitics is local. Whether you\u2019re aspiring for the smallest or the highest position, you must have the base, which is home. This we have provided for our leader, the former Vice President, in his aspiration for the presidency of Nigeria for the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cWe have started the scheming, working, and canvassing for support, and very soon, you\u2019ll see him emerging as the flag bearer.\u201d\n\nHe said with Atiku as president, the unity of Nigeria will be assured and insecurity will become a thing of the past.\n\nHe said: \u201cAtiku has the experience and he understands the dynamics of this country and I believe he will be able to close the gap and bring us together as a nation and that will solve part of the security challenges we are facing in this country.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking during the submission of the forms, a former senator representing Kogi West, Dino Melaiye, described Atiku as a man with multiple competencies and a unifier.\n\nMelaiye also said that God had revealed to him that Atiku would be president of Nigeria.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe are here to submit to you the form of a Nigerian with multiple competencies, indoctrinated with the art of civil administration and the rudiments of politics, the only unifier.\n\n\u201cAtiku was the first to pick his form and the first to submit his form.\u201d\n\nOrtom, who is supporting Wike, urged the aspirants to consider the big picture by elevating the collective interest of the party over personal interests.\n\nHe spoke in Makurdi, where he presided over the meeting of the Zoning Committee.\n\nOrtom said if consensus or zoning fails, aspirants will test their popularity at the poll.",

          "text": "Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State was at Agbudu, Udi Local Government Area, on Sunday, to flag off a commercial industrial kitchen project being constructed by an illustrious son of the community, Mr. Emeka Eneh, to provide and supply fresh and healthy local foods to different outlets in the state for average Nigerians at affordable prices.\n\nThe event commenced with a Mass at St. Alfred\u2019s Catholic Church, Agbudu, which was celebrated by Bishop Callistus Onaga of the Catholic Diocese of Enugu, and attended by Gov. Ugwuanyi.\n\nIn his sermon, Bishop Onaga described the business venture, \u201cCome Chop Restaurants\u201d, as \u201cMama-put redefined\u201d and a rare tasty food factory that will empower up to 1000 youths, in its little way of making idle hands busy.\n\nThe bishop thanked Ugwuanyi for his presence at the event, in spite of his busy schedule, to support and encourage the company to grow.\n\nHe added that the governor\u2019s gesture was in keeping with his administration\u2019s commitment to job creation and youth empowerment as well as peace and good governance.\n\nBishop Onaga disclosed that Gov.

          "text": "From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Governors, yesterday, berated the Presidency over its response to the opposition governor\u2019s recent communique on the state of the nation.\n\nThe Forum, in a statement by its Director General, CID Maduabum, described the response of the Presidency through Garba Shehu as infantile.\n\nThe PDP governors noted that their March 23 communique merely stated the facts as it relate to the existential threat confronting the country under the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led administration.\n\n\u201cThe PDP Governors communiqu\u00e9 made a comparative sketch of Nigeria of 2015 under PDP and Nigeria of 2022 under APC. The communiqu\u00e9 reeled out the fact that in almost all sectors, things have gotten worse by over 1000%.\n\n\u201cThis is reflected in prices of basic foodstuffs, unemployment rate, electricity prices, kerosene, diesel, fuel, aviation fuel and air ticket prices which have all gone through the roof. It reeled out figures on poverty, inflation, exchange rate, debt accumulation and corruption.\n\n\u201cIndeed, all aspects of life in Nigeria are being systematically destroyed by the APC administration. Life has become short, brutish and valueless in Buhari\u2019s Nigeria as insecurity ravages the land. But this is not the problem of Garba Shehu, who is enveloped in the Presidential Villa, totally oblivious of the suffering and agony Nigerians are facing.\n\n\u201cThe most disturbing aspect of misrule of the APC as chronicled in the communiqu\u00e9 is the petroleum sector.The stealing of Nigeria\u2019s crude oil and the connivance of NNPC in shortchanging other tiers of government, namely, States and Local Governments is simply mind bogging, if not outright criminal. Nigeria now produces 1.1million barrels of crude oil per day. It has capacity to produce 2.5 million per day. It cannot even meet its OPEC quota of 1.8 million per day. NNPC is a law unto itself.\n\n\u201cNobody can call them to order to desist from the part of lawlessness and unconstitutional acts it has chosen to dwell in. Of course, President Buhari is the Minister of Petroleum Resources. Under his watch, the Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas sector is deteriorating. In an accountable government, he should have resigned his position as Minister of Petroleum, as a result of the cataclysmic failures in the sector.\n\n\u201cIt is even shocking that Garba Shehu admits that funds from NNPC are now directly used to fund social and health programmes, road construction etc, in an unconstitutional overreach. NNPC can spend the Federal Government\u2019s share of the Federation Account as it pleases. It cannot spend money belonging to other tiers of government without their approval. NNPC cheats States and Local Governments. NNPC recklessly squanders money belonging to other tiers of government and has the audacity and impudence to pay Zero amount of money into the Federation Account.\n\n\u201cGarba Shehu conveniently ignored the facts in the PDP Governors Communique that exposed the deduction of N788 billion for NNPC\u2019s own chosen projects without recourse to the Federation Account; the deduction of N8.3 billion monthly for rehabilitation of refineries in Nigeria that do not work; the scandal called petroleum subsidy that gulps trillions of naira yearly without accountability and value for money.",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s Presidential Options: The Die is Cast",
          "text": "\u2022Who amongst these aspirants will be chosen by Nigeria\u2019s changing electorate?\n\nA THISDAY Report\n\nA few weeks from now, two of these men \u2013 one each from the two main political parties \u2013 would emerge presidential candidates of their respective parties and dominate the political space in the countdown to the 2023 presidential run.\n\nCurrently, Nigeria boasts some 18 political parties, out of which less than five are truly active. But the season is here again and it\u2019s expected that a majority, if not all, would start to activate their machines in readiness for the 2023 general election.\n\nWhile many of the parties might field candidates for different elective offices, the possibility that a majority others would either form alliance or endorse the presidential candidates of either of the two major parties \u2013 the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) \u2013 is equally high.\n\nTherefore, about some eight weeks from now, all the serious parties would start to hold their presidential primaries and be ready with their candidates in the countdown to the big event \u2013 the presidential bout \u2013 in February 2023.\n\nAhead of the presidential primaries, however, some presidential hopefuls have started to openly indicate their interests in the nation\u2019s number one job, while a few others, who were deemed to be interested but have yet to say so, have equally hinted at the possibility, one way or the other.\n\nBut, their presidential aspiration aside, the fact of the moment is that the nation is in dire straits and there has never been a more urgent need to rescue Nigeria than it is now. Perhaps, the situation in Nigeria pre-2015 was nothing compared to the current situation, even though it necessitated the \u201cchange mantra\u201d that brought in the incumbent, Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nChallenged on all fronts \u2013 the same grounds the ruling APC travelled to power \u2013 the country has been hopping from increasing insecurity to a tottering economy and burgeoning corruption. Although the work of a president may not be physically demanding as does a bricklayer, it requires a degree of physical fitness and high mental alertness, to be able to address what is currently on the card in Nigeria.\n\nPerhaps, the search for a messiah is back on stream and this time, the same opportunity, which presented itself in 2015, is showing up again except the Nigerian people choose to miss out on it, this time. There is a fierce urgency for a new leadership to steer the country away from the abyss to and redirect the ship of stay in a new direction. It starts with a carefully made presidential choice in 2023. This has become inevitable.\n\nThus, while zoning as a factor cannot be discarded arrogantly under whatever account or pretext, since it has become a critical glue holding the nation\u2019s many tendencies together, the quality of the candidate needed to do the job, has become more compelling if the current search for a president for all Nigerians is altruistic.\n\nAgainst this backdrop are a few of those, who have so far indicated interest in the presidency of Nigeria in 2023 \u2013 some of them are familiar names \u2013 and hopefully, the Nigerian people can find from amongst them, that individual, who understands the issues and knows what the problems are, and has a good and clear idea what solutions fit.\n\nAnyim Pius Anyim (PDP, South East)\n\nA former President of the Senate and erstwhile Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Anyim Pius Anyim, has had those two huge platforms to showcase himself. An indigene of Ebonyi State, Anyim is one presidential hopeful, who has stayed away from scandals and maintained a lowkey profile. Although since leaving public office, he was completely tucked into his private life until activities ushering in 2023 picked up, he has also explained at every given opportunity that he understands Nigeria and can fix the problems.\n\nStrengths: He has experience and probably still keeps some good contacts after leaving office. He is from the South East, a zone that has consistently alleged marginalisation.\n\nWeaknesses: He seems a bit laidback for the task at hand and lacks colour. His acceptability within his South East is also a subject of debate, and that could challenge his national presence.\n\nAminu Tambuwal (PDP, North West)\n\nThe current two-term Governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Tambuwal, was speaker of the House of Representatives from 2011 to 2015. He used his era as speaker to challenge some of the unfavourable policies of the former president Goodluck Jonathan administration, and that made him very popular. Although his governorship has not been anything spectacular, he has continued to leverage more, his days as speaker.\n\nStrengths: Naturally, coming from the core north often confers some advantage, and this is in addition to the fact that he is young and vibrant. He also wields some influence amongst his colleagues, being the chairman of PDP governors\u2019 forum.\n\nWeaknesses: Tambuwal has never been in the cluster of those considered as having the experience and maturity to face the nation\u2019s challenges. Being speaker and governor are not enough, he has yet to acquit himself as a potential presidential material. They are not the same.\n\nAtiku Abubakar (PDP, North East)\n\nA foremost presidential material, former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar, has always been in the forefront of the charge to lead the country. Indeed, in 2015, many held the view that he was the most prepared with clear ideas what he needed to do and where. The Turaki Adamawa is a household name and has all it takes to change the current narrative.\n\nStrengths: He has the experience, capacity and competence to address Nigeria\u2019s problems. He also knows Nigeria well enough and can balance the fault lines without crossing the lines.\n\nWeaknesses: Atiku has always had this never disappearing corruption tag, which mere explanations have refused to clear off. There are also questions about his age and health. Above all, he is categorised as part of the old order that brought Nigeria to its knees.\n\nBala Muhammed (PDP, North East)\n\nGovernor Bala Mohammed is a first term governor and former Minister of the FCT. Although still in office, there\u2019s a general belief he has not used his opportunities to stand out at these other levels. Age is still on his side and he\u2019s promising. A product of some highwire local politics, which witnessed the alignment of the opposition in the state, Mohammed has yet to find his feet well, even as governor.\n\nStrengths: He is from a part of the north, which thinks it has been marginalised enough and therefore, deserves a shot at the presidency. He also has age on his side and from a party, which might throw its presidential ticket open for all.\n\nWeaknesses: He does not command the kind of national presence required of a man aspiring to the highest office in the land. A man still grappling with the needs of small Bauchi, cannot be handed the intimidating challenges of Nigeria. Nigeria at this time cannot try anyone, who might want to learn on the job. Besides, there\u2019s the speculation that he would rather return as governor than gamble with uncertainty.\n\nBukola Saraki (PDP, North Central)\n\nTwo-terms former governor of Kwara State, Dr. Abubakar Bukola Saraki, was President of the Senate between 2015 and 2019, a platform which availed him an opportunity to sell himself. Unlike many before him, Saraki made the office of the senate president very attractive and also drew attention to the fact that there was so much power and influence in being the nation\u2019s number three citizen. His days as senate president also showed him off as a dogged fighter, who despite the various traps set in his way, triumphed, defeating the corruption label that his opponents had tried to hang on his neck.\n\nStrengths: He has shown capacity, competence and has experience also going for him. He clearly understands the issues and at every turn, has always intervened in the Nigerian project, proffering solutions to those knotty national concerns, even as a floor senate member. He connects more with the youth and very much in tune with global trends. His zone, the north central, has been in the trenches for recognition, having been marginalised for many years. They consider now as their time.\n\nWeaknesses: His state of origin, which is now being seen as a form of strength, politically, is the first factor to count against him. Small Kwara in north central has always been hard to place, either as a northern or southern state, realistically. Besides, coming out at a time the clamour for southern presidency is on high note, is a tough call.\n\nBola Tinubu(APC, South West)\n\nA political juggernaut by every definition, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, is by all standards, one of the biggest names in the nation\u2019s political lexicon today. From a relatively unknown Bola in 1999 to becoming the national leader of the ruling APC, today, Tinubu is a force to reckon with. Not only has he built an empire, he has made people and raised soldiers across all ages, walks of life and political leanings. Heavily connected and boasting huge war chest that could unsettle any cause, Tinubu is a political samurai, underestimated only at the peril of his opponents. In addition to commanding experience and competence, Tinubu has an enviable foresight for reading the political barometer, near accurately every season. In South West and beyond, he is an idol to many would-be politicians. He is a kingmaker, who now desires to be king.\n\nStrengths: Highly connected. Has experience and capacity. He seems prepared for what he called his life-long ambition to be president of Nigeria. He has the money required to prosecute his election. He has national presence. Understands some of the issues. Has a fatherly demeanor and the patience for the job. If not stopped by the Villa, he could claim the presidency without a fight.\n\nWeaknesses: Tinubu is largely considered corrupt and it\u2019s almost a consensus. He is one man, who is deemed rich, yet, has no known businesses to his name. Even the businesses marked against his name are easily denied, because they are believed to be held in trust. He is also old, sickly and weak. Age and health have taken their tolls and may be unable to stand the demands of the office. His mental alertness has been called to question many times. Also the Buhari albatross hangs on his neck. He and a clique within the APC brought Buhari. It is now almost like a cardinal sin that he brought Buhari. Can Nigeria afford the Alphabetarisation of Nigeria? He has a 60 million dollars private aircraft with no clear means of income; no factory employing people. Where did the money come? He has not been able to explain to the country he is striving to govern. Explaining his source of wealth becomes a big challenge on his road to becoming President of Africa\u2019s most populous nation.\n\nDavid Umahi(APC, South East)\n\nOutgoing Governor of Ebonyi State, Dave Umahi, is about the only Southeast governor in the APC, who is desirous of succeeding President Buhari. Umahi, whose seat was recently threatened by the judgment of a Federal High Court, which sacked him before it was reversed at the appellate court, is believed to have done relatively well, when compared to some of his colleagues. An engineer by calling, he is one of those, who had openly indicated interest in the job, following after Tinubu.\n\nStrengths: Coming from the South East, the zone has continued to justify why it should be allowed to produce the president in the spirit of equity, fairness and justice. Records have also shown that he is a man of ideas and can champion developments. And, in terms of age, he would pass.\n\nWeaknesses: A recluse by simple definition, Umahi does not really have friends. Apart from compelling meeting of governors, his media exposure says as much. That also presupposes some tribalistic tendencies and definitely not what is needed at a time like this. His contacts are limited and therefore, boasts poor reach.\n\nDele Momodu (PDP, South South)\n\nOne of the most influential celebrity journalists in Nigeria\u2019s modern history, Bashorun Dele Momodu, is having his second outing in the nation\u2019s presidential run. His first outing, which didn\u2019t turn out good, was enough to have discouraged anyone from wanting to serve again, but Momodu\u2019s love for country would not let him look away. Publisher of the prestigious Ovation Magazine, which is sold across the world, has such contacts that only a few politicians can lay claims to. Sound, brilliant, capable and armed with requisite experience, the second coming of this Edo-born journalist and politician, is a welcome development in the scheme of things.\n\nStrengths: Young, experienced, capable and competent, Momodu is a quintessential global citizen, with friends and contacts across the world. His presidency can easily access his contacts in nation\u2019s interest and devote such to development purposes.\n\nWeaknesses: He does not have the kind of money needed to prosecute this kind of election. Politicians, and particularly, owners of Nigeria may not be willing to trust him with power.\n\nUdom Emmanuel (PDP, South South)\n\nThe current and outgoing governor of Akwa Ibom State, Udom Emmanuel, is one of the prides of PDP, given his development initiatives in the state, even though taking off was easy, because of the kind of legacy left behind by his predecessor, and Minister of Niger Delta, Senator Godswill Akpabio, who was famous for uncommon transformation. Udom has spent the last eight years, etching his footprints in the sand of time, a legacy of achievements, which has stoked him into wanting to serve at a higher pedestal.\n\nStrengths: He has shown capacity, experience, and maturity in tending to state matters. His ability to manage his predecessor and former benefactor as a major tendency is a plus that cannot be glossed over. Coming from the south is also an additional strength to his rating as a presidential hopeful.\n\nWeaknesses: Managing a relatively small Akwa Ibom is not a template that is applicable to managing Nigeria, because national politics differs significantly from regional ludo games. Besides, he is in a zone and party, where he can easily be muscled in terms of political advantage by the other big guns. He has to up his game, regardless.\n\nGodwin Emefiele (South South)\n\nAlthough the Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, is from Delta, a South-south state; he is by providence, standing astride in both the South-south and the South East, thus, making his candidacy appealing to two critical zones that feel entitled to the presidency. The nation\u2019s economy has no doubt, been challenged in different ways, a sector in which Emefiele plays a significant role as the CBN governor; that the nation has not been overwhelmed, however, speaks to his efforts at mitigating those challenges. It was not by accident that the nation snapped out of recession twice to the shock of experts. It was also not sheer happenstance that Covid-19 did not shut down the economy. Some people stood in and plugged it. Kudos to the roles played by Emefiele in these and many respects. No doubt, these also accounted for the growing clamour that he should join the race. While he has yet to declare, Emefiele\u2019s supporters are damn certain he is the right man for the job.\n\nStrengths: A technocrat, whose time may have come, leading Nigeria with experience, and with insecurity linked to economy, he is believed to have the understanding of Nigeria\u2019s economy and issues challenging the country to be able to steer the affairs of state if gets the keys to the Villa. Another major factor going for him, is that he is trusted by the northern establishment who see him as someone they can work with.\n\nWeaknesses: First, he has the political class to contend with given his background. Politicians may not be too comfortable with him. He is from a minority South-south, a state controlled by the opposition. Emefiele lacks political base to command strong loyalty. Being a technocrat is also a weakness for him, as he is not seen by politicians as one of them, even if former President Olusegun Obasanjo was able to weather those storm in 1999\n\nIbikunle Amosun (APC, South West)\n\nFormer governor of Ogun State for eight years and senator representing Ogun central for a second term, Ibikunle Amosun, is one of the few contenders, who is very hands-on, firm and assertive. Progressive with development ideas, Amosun changed the face of Ogun in eight years so much that it might take decades to surpass his records. A grassroots politicians with intimidating machine in the politics of his state, his 2019 experience has not displaced him from the current equation in his state as the number one politician. A very good friend of the president, Amosun boasts the kind of contacts that are hard to link to him, except for close allies. He\u2019s got capacity, competence, experience, ideas and very futuristic.\n\nStrengths: His ideas are always taking into account, the foreseeable future. He is quietly friends with both the north and the south. Unknown to many, he is also friends with so many foreign presidents and never will flaunt them. He is very comfortable and has the wherewithal to prosecute his election, particularly, by pulling his friends up onto the field.\n\nWeaknesses: He is seen as very stubborn, although often times on principle. He has the penchant for disregarding processes and protocols if it would stand in the way of an idea he thought was meant to benefit the people. One of his major support pillars is Buhari and if his 2019 experience was to be factored into consideration, he can as well cancel out Buhari from his support base.\n\nKayode Fayemi (APC, South West)\n\nChairman of the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum and Governor of Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, has always distinguished himself in many respects. As a quintessential Omoluabi of the Yoruba extraction, he has used his office to prove that there is nothing esoteric about leadership. And, as a politician, who has learnt from his ugly experience, his politics has also been so elevated that, whoever underrates Fayemi now, might be doing so at very costly expense. Think all the boxes: capacity, competence, experience, networking, international contacts, ideas, development, focus, and blending across generations \u2013 Fayemi ticks them all. What\u2019s more? A ready-made presidential material.\n\nStrengths: He has learnt national politics so well and upgraded his local politics even more. How he has managed the governors from other parties is a case study. He knows the issues and would put them on the global stage almost effortlessly.\n\nWeaknesses: Coming from a rather small Ekiti, the kind of alignment required to build alliances could be frustrated by other states in the zone in an effort to undo him from clinching the ticket. He does not have the war-chest for the project, although could raise it through friends. Also, surviving the few months to the general election after leaving office is a major counter to his aspiration, as some of the things that currently count in his favour could be lost to being out of office.\n\nMohammed Hayatu-Deen(PDP, North East)\n\nA former Managing Director of the now defunct FSB International Bank, Mr. Mohammed Hayatu-Deen, recently joined the presidential race for 2023, after declaring for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). An economist, banker and former Chairman of the Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG), Hayatu-Deen started his career working in principal investments and project finance at the Northern Nigeria Development Corporation, later rechristened New Nigeria Development Corporation (NNDC), which at the time was Nigeria\u2019s largest industrial holding company with investments across a range of industries.He rose from there to the position of Group Chief Executive and was responsible for providing leadership, direction, and oversight to 140 subsidiary and associate companies under the group portfolio. His career therefrom blossomed significantly.\n\nStrengths: With a sound background in economics, coupled with a successful career in the banking sector, his experience would certainly come handy in remedying some of the nation\u2019s current economic challenges. He also boasts some maturity that could help on the job, aside coming from Borno, North East, thus enjoying both party and zone advantage.\n\nWeaknesses: Given an exposure largely rooted in the private sector, it comes with its challenges. Contending with political forces, who see such persons as coming to steal what\u2019s theirs is almost certain. His background has also limited his connection in a sense.\n\nNyesom Wike (PDP, South South)\n\nThe controversial Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, has many limitations, especially with respect to his attitudinal disposition, but certainly not in terms of performance. It is almost a consensus that he has worked hard to take Rivers to a different level in terms of infrastructure development. He also understands politics very well, even though his style is crude. He has equally managed to extend his hold beyond the Rivers hemisphere. It is also not for jokes that many call him Mr. Projects.\n\nStrengths: Being governor of an oil rich Rivers is in itself a lot of advantage. It was a Rivers governor in the person of Rotimi Amaechi, who made Buhari\u2019s presidency possible in 2015. Wike has a lot of money and through his money, he has been able to buy loyalties and friends. This also accounts for why his reach transcends Rivers. He also has signature projects, which means he is not just presumed to be rascally; he is also development-focused.\n\nWeaknesses: Wike, without a doubt, lacks the character befitting of the office of the president. In every of his engagements, he throws decorum to the wind and treats his colleagues as if they are subservient. Unmindful of his integrity (if any), Wike is too reckless about his carriage. While he could actually undo many things, because of his money, he hardly can find the requisite support for his aspiration amongst his peers.\n\nOgbonnaya Onu (APC, South East)\n\nThe Minister of Science and Technology, Ogbonnaya Onu, started his political career with an eye on a senate seat in the old Imo State on the platform of the National Party of Nigeria (NPN). He also contested for the position of Governor of Abia State in 1991, as candidate of the National Republican Convention and won. He was sworn in as the first Executive Governor of the State in January 1992, and was the first chairman, Conference of Nigerian elected Governors. In 1999, he was the presidential standard bearer of the All People\u2019s Party (APP), but relinquished the position to Olu Falae after a merger of his party with the Alliance for Democracy (AD), who lost to Olusegun Obasanjo of the PDP. Ogbonnaya went on to become the National Chairman of the APP in 2010. In 2013, his party successfully merged with the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and some members of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) to form the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nStrengths: He has come a long way with a lot of experience, maturity, and networking. He is also from the South East, a zone that has been marginalised over time in the scheme of things. He a good ambassador of the Igbo.\n\nWeaknesses: Many believe he is not hands-on and his ideas are not in tune with modern day realities. He might be too laidback for the task ahead. His ideas are believed not to be sound.\n\nPeter Obi(PDP, South East)\n\nFormer governor of Anambra State and businessman, Peter Obi, has such ideas about how a state should run and those ideas always resonate with the ordinary people. A vice-presidential candidate of the PDP in the 2019 election, he has moved closer to the presidency than many from the his zone. Although he is wrestling with the zoning ideas like others, he has shown capacity, experience and huge understanding of the issues that are wrong with the nation state.\n\nStrengths: He knows the issues and almost has the solutions off-the-top of his head. He has built friends both in the private and public sectors and is very rich too, even though he embraces a spartan lifestyle.\n\nWeaknesses: With no home-zone support, it\u2019s a tall order to ride roughshod over others to clinch the ticket, much less the presidency. Some of his friends also think he is a pretender and often dismissed him as not bankable.\n\nRotimi Amaechi (APC, South South)\n\nThe Minister of Transport, Rotimi Amaechi, is often described as the \u201cstar boy\u201d of the administration, given the revolution going on in the rail sector of the economy as well as the maritime sector. A former governor of Rivers State, Amaechi has a record of performance and discharging every assignment well. It is no wonder that he is constantly stealing the show in this administration through his development initiatives. Although his efforts are being undermined lately by the activities of terrorists, none of those has stifled him from that which he thought would benefit a majority of the people. Thus, exhibiting capacity, experience and competence, he has held the transport ministry for almost eight years and to the awe of his principal and the people in general. From being speaker for eight years, governor for eight years and now minister for almost eight years, there is no question about his experience in governance and development.\n\nStrengths: He has capacity, competence and the exposure to do the job. He is also very hands-on and very much development-focused. He is a good politician, understands the issues, and can network easily. He has friends across all ages, sectors and affiliations and has money to do the election the same way he did Buhari\u2019s. He is also nice, kind and compassionate. Like Emefiele, his candidacy too stands on both the Southeast and the South-south.\n\nWeaknesses: He is stubborn and can be abrasive sometimes. He takes loyalty seriously and when there\u2019s a tinge of alleged mistrust, he could go off, sometimes without double-checking. There is the home-zone disadvantage too, although he seems to be making up for that with his ministerial posting.\n\nTimipre Sylva (APC, South South)\n\nThe Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, is another South-south presidential hopeful, but from Bayelsa State. A former governor, Sylva has relative executive experience to want to try the presidency of Nigeria. He also has a platform to build a network of friends, locally and internationally, using patronage effectively.\n\nStrengths: He is minister of petroleum and may find it easy to muster the war chest for his campaign. Experience too comes to play for him and capacity is arguable. Also, being from the South is an advantage.\n\nWeaknesses: He is largely drawn away from his colleagues and his network of friends can actually be thrown up for a debate. The petroleum ministry has not been doing well lately and the fact that they are still approbating and reprobating over subsidy removal questions his capacity by extension, even though he is not the principal minister. He too has the home-zone disadvantage.\n\nYahaya Bello(APC, North Central)\n\nThe Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, is another controversial governor, albeit in the ruling party. Almost eight years in office, Bello is grappling with some of the mundane issues of governance. Failing to apply discretion in some of his choices appears to be the hallmark of his leadership. Not many would forget in a hurry how he almost made a mess of the fight against Covid-19, at a time the world came together to battle the scourge. With unpaid salaries and pensions in the region of billions, which have not been given sufficient attention like his ambition, it\u2019s not difficult to ponder a good mental picture of what his presidency might look like.\n\nStrengths: He is young, energetic and has the capacity to throw money around at the expense of real governance issues.\n\nWeaknesses: Coming from the north attracts a resounding no in APC, after Buhari, another northerner\u2019s eight years. He delights to relish in issues that are lacking in substance. Governance has suffered under his watch and his colleagues just let him spawl further in his folly by strategically avoiding him. Save for those interested in his money, mustering a decent crowd for his ambition is almost impossible.\n\nYemi Osinbajo (APC, South West)\n\nHe is the current vice president of the country and a man that a lot of people, would have gladly agreed should step in after Buhari, since he would have worked with him for eight years. Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, has come of age in politics in just eight years. Indeed, he\u2019s practically graduated from the school of strategic politics. He now knows the game as much as its older actors. Barring any last minute changes, he is billed to declare his interest in the presidency any moment from now. One of his foot soldiers, Kayode Ajulo, hinted at this yesterday, when he shared a post, which read: \u201cOn your marks, oh my comrades, what we await and strive for is here. Oh, my comrades, hear the sound; so loud over landscape. Reprieve now appearing; victory is nigh. #PYOIsComing. #FileFunYemi. #RamadanKareem. #PYO23 #ProgressiveLawyers4PYO.\u201d\n\nFrom the many assignments he has been detailed, he has done well. So far, he has conducted himself so well, and even though he has not said a word, he has communicated his intention to run a long time ago. He has confidence, capacity, exposure and competence. Above all, he carries himself so presidentially and with cerebral demeanor, that he unsettles his traducers.\n\nStrengths: He is from the Southwest and as the current vice-president, he has leveraged a very good use of his office to the disadvantage of other aspirants. He has built a network of friends, contacts and connection across the world. He has shown to understand the issues and always propounds the solutions at any given opportunity.\n\nWeaknesses: First, running against Asiwaju is waiting to count majorly against him in the politics of the zone, even though such sentiment belies logic. But the narrative of a betrayal has been established successfully. Two, most of the friends and contacts he has built are \u2018office friends\u2019 and might fizzle out once they perceive that things might not go his way. Osinbajo may have to answer to questions about alleged bigotry as many people have continued to accuse him of giving preference to members of his church, the RCCG, at every turn and populating his office with them. Some politicians accuse him of not being honest and habitually double-faced.\n\nGoodluck Jonathan (PDP, South-South)\n\nDr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan is a former president, who lost his bid for re-election and handed over to the incumbent in 2015. His political career began in 1998, when he was chosen by the late Diepreye Alaimeyeseigha as his running mate. The Alaimeyeseigha/Jonathan ticket won the election and he became the first civilian deputy governor of Bayelsa State on May 29, 1999. In 2005, he was sworn in as governor after his then boss ran into trouble with the law. In 2007, he won the PDP gubernatorial primary in Bayelsa State and was in the midst of his campaign, when he was nominated as vice presidential candidate to the late Umaru Musa Yar\u2019 Adua and as fate would have it, he became president after Yar\u2019Adua\u2019s demise, following prolonged ill-health. In 2011, he was elected president.\n\nGoodluck Jonathan became President on the PDP platform in his first term. The question on the lips of many now is should he decide to run this time, under which platform will he be running? Will it be under the PDP that gave him his first taste of power or will he switch party to the APC as is being speculated? This remains unclear, although he is currently a member of PDP.\n\nStrengths: He is trusted by the present administration, because of the way he handed over power. He is a democrat and adherent of the rule of law. As president, he promoted pro-people policies, especially, programmes such as the Almajiri schools he built in the North. He is also respected among the African leaders, because of efforts he has made to restore peace on the continent since he left office.\n\nWeaknesses: He is perceived to be a weak leader, who was controlled by women, when he was in power, leading to his electoral loss in 2015. However, it is not clear if\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "JNI: Any Govt Incapable of Protecting Citizens Lacks Moral Justification to Be in Power",
          "text": "\u2022Says continuous mayhem, killings, callousness automatically resetting people\u2019s psyche to accept situation as normal\n\nJohn Shiklam\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Nigerians continue to lament the worsening spate of insecurity in the country, Jama\u2019atu Nasir Islam (JNI), the umbrella body for Northern Muslims, has declared that any government that is unable to safeguard the lives and property of its citizens has lost the moral justification to be in power.\n\nIn a statement yesterday in Kaduna, the religious body headed by the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Sa\u2019ad Abubakar III, condemned the persistent attacks and killings by terrorists in the country. It bemoaned the recent attack on an Abuja-Kaduna passenger train in which eight people were confirmed killed while many others were either abducted or injured.\n\nThe statement signed by the Secretary General of JNI, Dr. Khalid Aliyu, declared, \u201cAny government that is incapable of protecting the lives of its citizens has lost the moral justification of being there in the first place; this is enunciated in Section 33(1) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIt stressed regarding to train attack, \u201cThe well-orchestrated incident remains highly condemnable, reprehensible and upsetting to every rational mind.\u201d\n\nJNI stated that the frequent attacks and killings, which occurred almost on a daily basis, were becoming normal occurrences among Nigerians, noting that humanity is gradually being eroded and criminality accepted as the new normal.\n\nThe group said, \u201cIt appears that the continuous callous acts of mayhem, killings and arson happening almost on daily or weekly bases around us; either within communities and/or on the roads we ply, has automatically reset our human psyche that we now have accepted such dastardly acts as part of our lives, to the extent that we no longer feel it.\n\n\u201cThe humanity in us is slowly being eroded thereby making us adapt to the new normal within which we unfortunately found ourselves.\u201d\n\nJNI maintained, \u201cIn Islam and by all global standards, the essence of government and governance is solely to protect the five principal cardinal rights of the human race, the most important of which is LIFE!\u201d\n\nAliyu said JNI had carefully studied and followed the train blast, especially, the attack on another train, reported to have occurred on the Lagos-Kano bound train, near Jaji, Kaduna state, on March 31, which led to the death of the locomotive operator.\n\n\u201cTherefore, this press release is premised on the fact that Nigeria is more or less heading to an unknown destination of multiple cum well-coordinated serial chaos attributable to lack of coordination and synergy from security personnel, if the news making the round is to be believed,\u201d he said.\n\nJNI said in Islam, human life was sacrosanct, \u201cThat is why Allah (SWT) declared in the Glorious Quran that if a single soul is killed without just cause, then it is as if the entire humanity is wiped off the face of the earth.\n\n\u201cWe claim to be people of faith and all these occurrences are allowed without any form of prompt intervention. Why?\n\n\u201cWell, it should be known that an attack on one soul; is an attack on all, and this is how the human race should be preserved and protected, but if allowed to continue we fear the consequence(s) of the innocent souls that were killed, without any fault of theirs.\u201d\n\nThe statement regretted that, \u201cTerrorists are now becoming bolder and more belligerent by the day. They operate in any area of their choice(s) at any time they so wish.\n\n\u201cThey even operate for up to eight hours non-stop (as it was reported to have happened in Niger state last Monday), without any fear of being confronted or apprehended.\u201d\n\nIt lamented that, \u201cMost communities are now under the bandits\u2019 absolute control with taxes being paid to bandits\u2013some parts of Borno, Katsina, Zamfara, Niger, Sokoto states and some others yet to be disclosed to the public.\n\n\u201cIn fact, terrorists do what they wish knowing that there is no gun power or authority that will defy them.\u201d\n\nThe Islamic body wondered why the security situation had continued to deteriorate, despite the allocation of huge resources to the security agencies.\n\nJNI stated, \u201cWith all the reported resources allocated to relevant security agencies; intelligent gathering mechanism, military arsenal and tact, can\u2019t the government provide any convincing justification on why the security situation in the country continue to deteriorate?\n\n\u201cWhy are attacks experienced all over the place and continuing unabated without any deterrence?\n\n\u201cMoreover, why must security budget and expenditure remain so secretive, despite the reported release of funds?\n\n\u201cThe mind boggling train attack of Monday 28th March, 2022, the kidnap and sporadic shootings that ensued thereafter the train en-route Kaduna needs to be seriously investigated and punitive measures taken.\u201d\n\nThe group, however, commended the security personnel who exhibited capacity, resilience, determination and dexterity during rescue operations on the attacked Abuja-Kaduna train.\n\nJNI noted that most Nigerians were of the belief that the government knew the enclaves and hideouts of the criminals, especially considering the fact that only the government had monopoly of legal force, and, by extension, the machinery for intelligence gathering.\n\nThe statement queried, \u201cAgain, why can\u2019t the government proactively take the battle to the criminals\u2019 hideouts and wipe them off?\n\n\u201cWhy should the government wait until people are attacked, lives and properties lost for them to strike and be issuing empty orders and usual condemnation?

          "text": "Emma Okonji\n\n\n\n\n\nThe federal government, yesterday, barred all outgoing calls from every SIM card not linked to the National Identification Number (NIN) of the telecom subscriber.\n\nMinister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ibrahim Pantami, who gave the order, also directed the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) to direct all telecoms operators to begin the deactivation of all unlinked SIM cards with immediate effect, insisting that all telecoms subscribers must comply with the NIN-SIM linkage policy of the federal government.\n\nIn a statement yesterday, jointly signed by Director, Public Affairs, at NCC, Dr. Ikechukwu Adinde, and Head, Corporate Communications, at National Identity Management Commission (NIMC), Mr. Kayode Adegoke, Pantami commended Nigerians and legal residents for their support during the exercise to link their NIN to their SIM cards.\n\nThe recent order to bar all unlinked SIM cards came 16 months after the federal government gave the first order to deactivate all SIM cards not registered and linked to NIN.\n\nPantami had in December 2020 directed the NCC to order telecoms operators to deactivate any SIM card not duly registered and linked to subscribers\u2019 NIN, after the initial December 31, 2020 deadline, given for NIN-SIM linkage.\n\nBased on the inability of subscribers to meet up with the December 31, 2020 deadline, the federal government had to postpone the deadline and had since postponed it 10 times to date.\n\nAt the last postponement, which was on December 31, 2021, Pantami conveyed the approval of the federal government to further extend the deadline for the NIN-SIM data verification and linkage from December 31, 2021 to March 31, 2022.\n\nAlthough NIMC had said NIN registration would continue in all its centres, the federal government, yesterday said it would commence barring of all unlinked SIM cards with immediate effect, and told subscribers yet to register and link their SIM cards to do so before they could make outgoing calls.\n\nThe federal government, however, commended Nigerians for the compliance level in registering and linking the SIMs to NINs, saying 125 million SIMs have been submitted for linkage to NINs.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cAs of date, over 125 million SIMs have had their NINs submitted for immediate linkage, verification and authentication. Similarly, the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) has issued over 78 million unique NINs till date.\n\n\u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari gave the directive for the implementation and commencement of the exercise in December 2020, as part of the administration\u2019s security and social policies. The deadlines for the NIN-SIM linkage has been extended on multiple occasions to allow Nigerians to freely comply with the policy.\n\n\u201cThe federal government also took into consideration the passionate appeals by several bodies- Association of Licensed Telecoms Operators of Nigeria (ALTON), Civil Societies, Professional Bodies and a host of others \u2013 for the extension of the deadlines in the past.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, Mr. President graciously approved the many requests to extend deadlines for the NIN-SIM linkage. At this point however, government has determined that the NIN-SIM Policy implementation can proceed, as machinery has already been put in place to ensure compliance by citizens and legal residents.\n\n\u201cThe implementation impacts on government\u2019s strategic planning, particularly in the areas of security and socio-economic projections.\u201d\n\nThe statement added, \u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari has approved the implementation of the policy with effect from the 4th of April, 2022. Consequently, the federal government has directed all Telcos to strictly enforce the Policy on all SIMs issued (existing and new) in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOutgoing calls will subsequently be barred for telephone lines that have not complied with the NIN-SIM linkage policy from the 4th of April, 2022. Subscribers of such lines are hereby advised to link their SIMs to their NINs before the Telcos can lift the restriction on their lines. Affected individuals are hereby advised to register for their NINs at designated centers and thereafter link the NINs to their SIMs through the channels provided by NIMC and the Telcos, including the NIMC mobile App.\u201d\n\nPantami commended the Executive Vice-Chairman of NCC, Professor Umar Garba Dambatta, Director-General/Chief Executive Officer of NIMC, Aliyu Abubakar Aziz, along with their management and staff, as well as other notable bodies whose efforts had contributed to the monumental success of the exercise.\n\nPantami said enrolment for NIN would be a continuous exercise and that NIN would henceforth be a precondition for service in telcos, banks, Nigerian Immigration Service, and several other government services.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "13 years, $10bn processed. How has Paga evolved over the years?",
          "text": "During a chat at the company\u2019s head office in Yaba, a suburb on Lagos Mainland once touted as Nigeria\u2019s Silicon Valley, CEO Tayo Oviosu recalls the epiphany moment that led to the founding of Paga back in April 2009.\n\nThe Stanford-educated Oviosu had just returned to the country he was born and raised in but left at age 16 and wanted to venture into the world of entrepreneurship.\n\nOpportunities in the private sector at the time were immense. Nigeria\u2019s central bank was pushing for a cashless economy but banks were slow to innovate. After considering several ideas for a couple of months, Oviosu came up with what is now Paga.\n\n\u201cBack then, a lot of transactions in Nigeria were largely cash-dependent which was inefficient for both businesses and individuals,\u201d he said. \u201cPaga was born out of my own frustration with carrying cash around. The idea was simple\u2014there had to be a way to make payments simpler.\u201d\n\nOviosu, aiming to build the \u201cPaypal for Africa\u201d, then teamed up with Jay Alabraba to launch a mobile payments company named Paga, a Spanish word that means \u201cto pay\u201d.\n\nPaga was arguably the first fintech company in Nigeria to popularise mobile money among the unbanked. At the time it was launched, the main players bridging payments with mobile technology in Nigeria were Interswitch, eTranzact, and SystemSpec\u2019s Remita.\n\nThirteen years on, Paga\u2014now a UK-headquartered Group\u2014has amassed more than 19 million unique users through its consumer channel and agent network of over 120,000 agents across Nigeria. Since the company began commercial operations in 2012, it\u2019s processed over $10 billion ( \u20a64 trillion).\n\nIn an interview with TechCabal, Oviosu reflects on Paga\u2019s evolution and growth and talks about product innovation, global expansion, and the next phase for both Paga and the fintech landscape in Africa.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nDigitising consumer payments\n\nOviosu\u2019s goal for Paga was to build a platform that simplified payments, digitised cash transactions, and delivered financial services to the mass market. He started with a team of 8, a figure that\u2019s grown to more than 100.\n\nPaga\u2019s initial set of products was focused on providing more people access to traditional banking services \u2013 especially sending and receiving money \u2013 through mobile phones and physical agents equipped with POS devices. At an agent outlet, customers show up without an account number and for a fee, are able to send and receive money to anyone.\n\nIn December 2019, after the introduction of national identity numbers (NIN) and bank verification numbers (BVN), Paga launched its consumer direct product that allowed users to create mobile accounts and used wallets for transactions through the mobile app and USSD.\n\nAccording to Oviosu, more than 3.7 million wallets have been created on Paga since then while the company plans to roll out physical and virtual cards later this year.\n\nA chart showing growth in Paga\u2019s TPV since its founded.

While it took the company 99 months to get to its first \u20a62 trillion, Oviosu revealed it took 22 months to reach the next \u20a62 trillion.\n\nIn 2021, Paga crossed the \u20a61 trillion mark in annual TPV for the first time\u2014hitting \u20a61.2 trillion\u2014and is on track to reach \u20a62 trillion this year alone, according to the CEO.\n\nAs part of its consumer payments play, Paga in February announced its addition as a payment provider for Twitter Tips, a feature that enables Twitter users to either send or receive by simply linking their preferred third-party payment service providers to their profiles.\n\nBeyond consumer payments, however, Paga is now a fintech behemoth helping merchants digitise payments (under a separate brand called Doroki) and opening up its infrastructure for third-party companies to easily offer financial services.\n\nPaga Group is a teenager today! What started out as a simple idea to make it simple to pay & get paid is now 3 business lines:\n\n\n\n\u2013 Consumer Payments \u2013 @paga\n\n\u2013 Embedded Finance \u2013 Paga PaaS https://t.co/AvGdBzElZ5\n\n\u2013 Seller/Merchant \u2013 @doroki_ng\n\n\n\nThanks to our amazing team \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89 pic.twitter.com/yC5Gv64kGm \u2014 Tayo Oviosu (@oviosu) April 3, 2022\n\nDoroki for merchants\n\nLast year, Paga launched Doroki, a separate unit within the Group that leverages Paga\u2019s payment infrastructure to help SMEs digitise payments.\n\nDoroki allows merchants to accept cards and other forms of digital payments via point-of-sale (POS) terminals and mobile POS handheld devices, making it easy for them to get paid and track inventory while enabling them to provide other value-added financial services to customers.\n\nWhile Covid-19 has increased the use of technology in payments and money transfers in Africa, the purchase and onboarding cost of POS devices is unaffordable for most merchants.\n\nPaga announced last year a partnership with Untapped Global to provide financing that would lower the cost of entry for merchants, with payments recovered from the revenues earned on the devices.\n\nAfter a successful pilot programme, which saw 2,000 businesses provided with financed POS devices, Oviosu revealed that more than 6,000 sellers currently now use Doroki to collect payments in the wake of the commercial launch last November.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to build an ecosystem for the consumer to conveniently make payments and for SMEs to manage their businesses and do payrolls,\u201d Oviosu said.\n\nProduct infrastructure play\n\nFrom merely enabling Nigerians (individuals and businesses) to make and receive payments with ease, the Paga group now offers open-source APIs to companies for building products.\n\nPaga\u2019s platform-as-a-service (PaaS) business started with the acquisition of a remittance license in 2018, after which it allowed companies like Western Union and Wise to terminate remittances to accounts in Nigeria.\n\nIn 2021, Paga opened up its platform to more businesses through Collect APIs, which more than 200 businesses currently use.\n\nPaga\u2019s open wallet is available to any third-party developer. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to compete with you building your wealth management app; we\u2019ll help you,\u201d the CEO said, adding that its recent integration with Flutterwave is built around the same APIs.\n\nThis wknd I experienced the power of Paga's Connect API \u2013 one-click payments \u2013 on @theflutterwave as I paid for my day 2 return covid test \ud83e\udd73\n\n\n\nI had previously linked my Paga acct to Flutterwave so going fwd it's super easy to pay on any website using Flutterwave!@TechProd_Arch pic.twitter.com/6WJkFOvAWa \u2014 Tayo Oviosu (@oviosu) January 24, 2022\n\nIn effect, Paga has extended beyond the payments business to becoming a product infrastructure company, which entails entering into partnerships with tech companies in similar and adjacent sectors.\n\nPaga\u2019s Nigeria approach\n\nPaga\u2019s go-to-market strategy in Nigeria has been a hybrid approach that combines offline and online channels. \u201cA majority of the population may not be tech-savvy and smartphone penetration is still low,\u201d Oviosu said.\n\nStarting out, Paga relied on a retail network of shops and agents that consumers can visit for in-person transactions. \u201cTo scale in Africa, you need a hybrid (digital and physical) approach. If you don\u2019t want or know how to use the technology, you can go to agents and still deal in [physical] cash, but the agent can do the digital.\u201d\n\nOviosu acknowledges that in Nigeria, physical cash is very much still a thing and won\u2019t go away anytime soon. Smartphone penetration has also not improved significantly. Hence, the company \u201cstill needs on ramps & off ramps to cash\u201d.\n\nAlthough the share of Paga\u2019s total transactions being done via agents has declined in recent years.\n\n\u201cThree years ago, agents accounted for about 90% of our transactions. Last year, that figure fell to 60%, an indication that other channels/parts of the business are growing fast.\u201d\n\nA Paga paypoint in Lagos. Image credit: Tayo Oviosu/Twitter.\n\nWhat next for Paga? Expansion\n\n\u201cThe vision is still the same\u2014to solve payments for individuals and businesses,\u201d Oviosu said. \u201cWe\u2019ve always taken an open approach. It\u2019s not a closed circle.\u201d\n\nOn what an \u201copen approach\u201d means, the CEO explained that with Paga, users can link their several bank accounts, debit cards, and mobile money wallets from other providers.\n\nIn addition, anybody\u2014including non-Paga account holders\u2014can pay a Doroki merchant. \u201cYou can walk into a store and pay with your card, scan a QR code, or make payments using USSD from any bank.\u201d\n\nWhile the vision has been steady, the ambition and scope of Paga have grown over time.\n\nAlongside product expansion, Paga has in its sight a global expansion starting with Ethiopia. In January 2020, it acquired Apposit, an Ethiopian software development company that is planned to be its vehicle for entry into East Africa and Latin America. Last month, Paga announced an official launch in the Horn of Africa country.\n\nBecause there are local nuances to be aware of, Paga has a local team of at least 50 in Ethiopia. The payments platform was also built to be multilingual, so switching from one language to another is easy.\n\nAs per funding the expansion plans, Oviosu revealed Paga, which has secured $35 million to date\u2014with the backing of investors such as Jim O\u2019Neill and Tim Draper\u2014is looking to raise additional capital.\n\nTayo Oviosu, Paga co-founder and CEO.\n\nFintech innovation in Africa\n\nOn the next phase of innovation in Africa\u2019s fintech space, Oviosu expects new startups to build more solutions on existing infrastructure provided by older players like Paga, Flutterwave, Paystack, etc. to solve key problems.\n\n\u201cThe first couple of years of Paga was building infrastructure where it didn\u2019t exist. We built a hybrid payment infrastructure for the online and offline customer,\u201d the CEO said.\n\n\u201cNew companies don\u2019t need to repeat that. I expect to see more of them focusing on niche markets that can scale, leveraging existing platforms through open-source APIs.\u201d\n\nAs for Paga, the vision remains the same: getting up to one billion people using its platform to access and use money, according to Oviosu.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Peace Itimi: From Nigeria to the UK in search of peace",
          "text": "Peace Itimi has spent 9 months away from Nigeria but doesn\u2019t miss the country. She misses her cleaner and cook, though, because, in London, she doesn\u2019t have a cleaner and cook. But she at least has peace of mind.\n\nWhen Itimi started working remotely from Nigeria, she promised herself she would stay in Nigeria, until the Lekki toll gate killing\u2014where tens of #EndSARS protesters, who were protesting against police brutality, were killed\u2014scared her out of her wits. \u201cI felt unsafe,\u201d she recalled. It was then she started to reconsider her stance on immigration and realised money won\u2019t shield her from how unsafe Nigeria was increasingly becoming.\n\nA friend gave her the nudge to leave the country, recommending that she go through the Tech Nation Visa\u2014a visa that allows tech talent across the world to live and work in the UK\u2014because, he felt, she was a good fit. In 2021, she started researching the programme, and even though she felt the requirements were scary, she realised that everything she had done up until that point made her a perfect fit.\n\nFinding different loves\n\nItimi grew up in Benin City, Edo state, and studied medical biochemistry at Delta State University. She fell in love with digital marketing while in university. She said university had been one of the most definitive phases of her life because it was where she found God, found herself, and digital marketing.\n\nWhen she became a Google Student Ambassador, she started training other students in digital marketing in school. Fresh from school, she launched a digital marketing agency with a friend in 2016.\n\nShe moved to Lagos in February 2017 to begin her national service year at digital marketing agency, Webcoupers, and that was where she officially launched her career. In 2018, she joined Wild Fusion, another digital marketing agency, where she trained people on digital marketing, branding, Google Ads, and SEO. She, in that same year, also organised training on behalf of Facebook, Orange Academy, and the British Council.\n\nDuring one of her travels for digital marketing training in Accra, she realised that even though she loved travelling, her physical reach was limited. \u201cI can\u2019t train people in Accra except when I travel to Accra. So, I started thinking that a way to break that divide was to start training people online and that means I can reach anybody anywhere, so long as they can find my content.\u201d\n\nSo, Itimi started a YouTube channel in December 2018 where she initially shared marketing tips and random lessons about life, before launching a now-popular segment called Founders Connect, where she has interviewed about 40 African founders, including Odun Eweniyi of Piggyvest, Atsu Davoh of Bitsika, and Ezra Olubi of Paystack.\n\nIn 2019, she entered the Nigerian tech ecosystem after landing a role as the Head of Marketing at fintech company, Korapay, before moving to Venture Capital (VC) firm, Seedstars in 2020.\n\nFirst comes loneliness\n\nIn the first few months after Itimi arrived in the UK last June, she felt lonely. She had never been so far away from home before; the farthest she had travelled had been within the continent, to Cape Verde, in 2019.\n\nEverything was new to her in the UK. For example, the summer was warm yet she still felt cold. She couldn\u2019t see clearly and had migraines when she went outside without sunshades. It also took her a while to adjust to the predominant use of contactless payment in London.\n\nAs an introvert, making friends was initially difficult for her, even though she didn\u2019t face this difficulty back home. In Lagos, she was mildly popular so people started conversations with her at events. Now in the UK, she decided to become more intentional about making friends and connecting with people by starting conversations. When she sees someone on social media she wants to connect with, she reaches out and asks them to have a coffee or jump on an informal call with her. \u201cI am learning that a new environment and country requires an improved me. I have to do extra work,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd what this means for her is that she has to move past her introverted nature and social anxiety because to live the life she wants she must connect with people, build a network, and make impact in this ecosystem.\u201d\n\nIn the months that followed, she made more friends when she joined a cycling community of about 20 other immigrants and her friends for whom she had reviewed the Tech Nation Visa applications joined her in the UK. On top of that, on the back of her YouTube video where she shared her experience with the visa application, at least 20 people have reached out to tell her they had got the visa.\n\nLondon, the good and the bad\n\nShe currently works remotely as Head of Growth for offline fintech app, Stax and admits that her productivity has increased since she moved. \u201cI don\u2019t apologise for bad internet anymore. I don\u2019t have to worry about electricity, either. I can afford to leave my laptop unplugged.\u201d\n\nItimi is excited about the travelling opportunities London presents; she feels more confident applying for visas for different countries now than she ever was in Nigeria. London has the most connected flights anywhere in the world and they are relatively cheaper.\n\n\u201cWhen I travelled to Kenya from London, in February, my flight cost less than a flight from Lagos to Kenya.\u201d\n\nOne thing Itimi likes about London is its diversity\u2014in people, food, and even the hobbies she can choose from. She is also in love with its efficient transport infrastructure: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t exceed the time I estimate to get to my destination.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know this exposure to working infrastructure and this level of diversity is doing something to my mind that I will be grateful for in a couple of years because of how I would have grown as a person.\u201d\n\nShe also loves the feeling of freedom in the city, which allows people to be themselves. \u201cFor instance, I feel like my confidence in the way I dress has increased a lot since I moved to London, compared to when I was in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nBut she doesn\u2019t like the weather. During the winter, she rarely left her house, and when she did, her multiple layers of clothing didn\u2019t stop the cold from getting to her and the wind from threatening to blow her over. She looks forward to the summer, which she prefers.\n\nMaybe higher up on the list of things she doesn\u2019t like are taxes, because there are a lot of them. \u201cI feel like if I thought too much about my taxes I probably would not have moved when I did; I would have waited a bit longer to save more money in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nDigital Nomads is a weekly column on TechCabal where we explore the everyday lives of Africans who leave their home countries to study or work elsewhere, and Africans who leave their conventional jobs for new professions in tech.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there!\n\nInteresting times. They say, \u201cif you want something done right, do it yourself.\u201d This is the closest maxim that describes Tesla CEO and SpaceX founder, Elon Musk\u2019s recent move as he purchased a 9.2% stake in Twitter, making him one of the largest individual shareholders in the company.\n\nThere are speculations about what the end game of this move might be. First, Musk thinks Twitter is not being democratic enough; then, he played with the idea of building a platform to rival the microblogging platform. Do the math.\n\nIt is difficult to ignore the fact that Musk uses Twitter a lot! He can make as many as 30 tweets in a day. And coming from the richest person alive, he\u2019s probably out to own as much stake as he can in Twitter to be able to call the shots about some matters of concern to him. Besides, the \u2018Elon Musk Effect\u2019 has begun to take place as Twitter shares skyrocketed following the news.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile we await the other outcomes, let\u2019s take a look at what I\u2019m discussing today:\n\nJumia X UPS\n\nUSSD vs Bank app\n\nAnother edition of Pitch Friday\n\nUPS partners Jumia\n\nWhile I try not to start another \u201ceCommerce is struggling in Africa\u201d conversation, it\u2019s a good time to mention that global shipping and logistics company, United Parcel Service (UPS) is taking a bet on one of Africa\u2019s most popular online marketplaces, Jumia, through a partnership that will afford the company access to Jumia\u2019s network of distribution on the continent.\n\nThe partnership starts in Nigeria, Morocco, and Kenya with others to follow later. Although the monetary implication is undisclosed, this is more of a bet on an anticipated eCommerce boom in Africa than on Jumia, considering the increasing stats on online shoppers and a promising estimated revenue coming from the industry in coming years.\n\nIt\u2019s a win-win. While UPS will leverage Jumia\u2019s extensive network to expand its coverage across more towns and cities in Africa, this will bring another layer of ease to last-mile delivery and other delivery solutions across Africa for Jumia.\n\nBig picture: For a start, the announcement had Jumia stock up by 23% as of 4 pm (WAT) on Monday, and it even went as high as 29%. Recall this? Despite the complications of running an eCommerce business in Africa, this partnership may be a good move for Jumia to increase user volume and revenue and probably reduce its losses.\n\nWhat\u2019s Stax doing with USSD?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStax team. Source: Supplied\n\nQuick one: How often do you use USSD to perform payment transactions as a smartphone user? My best guess is that you would almost always choose a bank app over USSD. The reason is obviously ease \u2014 getting done with few clicks.\n\nAccording to the Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA), nine in 10 mobile money transactions in sub-Saharan Africa are done through USSD. Understandably so, there are still more Africans using basic/feature phones even though smartphone penetration is speeding up.\n\nHere\u2019s a startup, Stax, that wants to make USSD enticing to smartphone users. And it is doing this with a USSD app that automates transactions and saves you the hassle of remembering codes and putting data in dialogue boxes as fast as possible, so you don\u2019t get an error message.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf doing it better and building on a 24-year technology, you can read the startup\u2019s story here: Stax is levelling the playing field between USSD and bank apps\n\nOn to the next Pitch Friday\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the second Friday of every month, Techpoint Africa hosts early-stage startup founders at Pitch Friday.\n\nCatch up on the previous edition: Nerves and laughter as Techpoint Pitch Friday returns\n\nThere, three selected founders get to pitch their startups or ideas before an audience and get feedback.\n\nIn the past, we\u2019ve hosted founders such as Kelvin Umechukwu, Bumpa CEO and Femi Aiki, Foodlocker CEO.\n\nThis month\u2019s Pitch Friday holds by 5 pm on Friday, March 8, 2022, at 43b Emina Crescent, Opebi, Allen, Ikeja (See directions).

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStax is a startup that takes banking with Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) from the phone dialler to an offline mobile application that gives offline banking a better user experience.\n\nPer Stax\u2019s blog, USSD has been around for 24-years and has mostly been used by telcos to facilitate communication with their customers. For example, telcos have a USSD code that usually starts with * and ends with # to check airtime balance or buy data.\n\nAccording to the Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA), nine in 10 mobile money transactions in sub-Saharan Africa are done through USSD.\n\nInterestingly, the technology is the product of the GSM 02.90 document created by engineers at the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), a body formed by the European Union in 1988 to harmonise and standardise communication technology in Europe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a 2018 Quartz Africa article, the document had a protocol designed to facilitate communication between telcos and their subscribers. However, telcos needed a protocol and initiated machine-to-machine communication where the subscriber\u2019s mobile phone would simply query the network and get a response instantly.\n\nOver the years, USSD has gone from aiding network and subscriber communication to being used for several other applications, including banking. Interestingly, the USSD protocol has not had any major upgrade since its introduction.\n\nHow is Stax using USSD differently?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStax is harmonising USSDs and making them simpler to use. Instead, of dialling *123# and following the instructions to send money or buy airtime, Stax is bringing all the USSD codes under one roof.\n\nIt is doing this with a USSD app that automates transactions and saves you the hassle of remembering codes and putting data in dialogue boxes as fast as possible, so you don\u2019t get an error message.\n\nOn a call with Techpoint Africa, Stax Co-founder and CEO, Ben Lyon, explained that the startup is trying to make USSD better and \u201cfind a way to give smartphone users a way to leverage the best parts of USSD.\u201d\n\nAccording to Lyon, the best part of USSD is that it works offline; its bad part, however, is that it has an awful user experience.\n\nUSSD works with a smartphone or basic feature phone\u2019s dialler. For example, to complete a bank transaction, you dial the bank\u2019s USSD code and follow the instructions in the pop-up\u2019s interactive menus.\n\nThese menus are timed, so inputting data such as an account number or personal identification number (PIN) has to be done swiftly, or you\u2019ll get an error message and start again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere has never been significant innovation around USSD because the Internet took its place in developed nations. A high level of Internet penetration and the rapid development of smartphones and computers made USSD redundant.\n\nInternet penetration in Africa, on the other hand, is slow. In 2000, Internet penetration among adults in the US was 52%, significantly higher than Africa\u2019s 0.5%.\n\nWhile developed countries did not need USSD, it was important to Africa, and it moved from being a way for telcos to communicate with customers to a major tool for financial inclusion.\n\nUsing USSD seamlessly on smartphones\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBen Lyon, Ceo, Stax\n\n\u201cIs there a way we can screenscrape USSD?\u201d That was the question that set the pattern for what Stax is doing today \u2014 navigating USSD menus on behalf of end-users in the background of an Android application.\n\nAccording to Lyon, the startup started out by selling the solution to other developers under the company name Hover, Stax\u2019s parent company. However, the business model did not generate the anticipated revenue, and Stax was created in 2020 as a consumer-facing version of Hover.\n\nLyon described Stax as an online payment super app for Africa that brings together all USSD based services in one place.\n\nHow does Stax work?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStax website\n\nTypically, when USSD is accessed through a phone dialler, you can get a session error if you do not type fast enough. What Stax does is run the USSD in the background and reduce the USSD menus to fewer taps within the app.\n\nThe Stax app works almost like any bank app, but offline. Unlike bank apps, it requires less information which makes setting it up straightforward. It, however, requires permission to manage phone calls and read messages.\n\nThe setup process is completed by selecting your bank(s). Sending money with Stax can be completed in a few taps by selecting the sending and receiving banks and the amount to transfer.\n\nIt becomes evident that the app is running a USSD protocol when it asks which SIM card you\u2019d like to complete the process with. Besides that, the process is just as seamless as using an online bank app.\n\n\u201cI compare USSD to the early Internet,\u201d Lyon said. \u201cIt is like asking people to interact with the web without a browser, going to IP addresses directly instead of websites.\u201d\n\nWith Stax improving the USSD user experience on smartphones, its market is limited to just smartphone users, but according to Lyon, this is still a huge number.\n\nWhile one might assume that smartphone users will typically prefer to perform transactions over the Internet rather than USSD, data by GSMA reveals that although smartphones outnumber feature phones in sub-SaharanSaharan Africa, USSD remains the most popular form of banking.\n\nIn 2019, there were one billion mobile money accounts in sub-Saharan Africa, and over $1.9 billion was processed daily.\n\nHow Stax makes money\n\nFree to use, Stax only takes a USSD telco session charge. It, therefore, becomes difficult to see how the company makes money from its solution.\n\nRevealing Stax\u2019s revenue generation model, Lyon said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to start monetising in Kenya in the next few weeks. We\u2019re going to charge fees and commissions to businesses that sell to our users. So, when you buy airtime in Stax, we\u2019ll get a little commission from the seller.\u201d\n\nExplaining further, he said telcos work with dealers and distributors that buy wholesale airtime rates and sell to the subscribers. Stax\u2019s plan is to partner with these distributors and steer traffic to them while they get a cut.\n\nAlthough Stax has a monetisation plan, its feasibility can only be proven when it starts. The startup recently got a $2.2 million seed funding led by World Within Ventures and Noemis Ventures in March 2022, which Lyon said has been instrumental in growing the business.\n\nStax\u2019s plan goes beyond making existing services available via USSD better; it wants to make crypto services, among others, accessible through USSD.\n\nWill a 24-year-old technology continue to dominate in Africa? Only time will tell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover. Twitter\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHola,\n\nIt\u2019s the start of a new work week, and I\u2019m meant to say something funny or uplifting here, but I have nothing. I\u2019ve got something else, though. Spoiler alert: It\u2019s about Twitter.\n\nSo, you know how you can co-author a post on Instagram with another user, Twitter says it\u2019s testing this feature, but you\u2019ll only be able to invite public accounts who follow you to co-author a tweet, and they\u2019ll have to accept your invitation.\n\nThere\u2019s no \u201cdue date\u201d yet, but like so many other beta features, we may or may not get it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Today\u2019s Digest, we\u2019ll be discussing three very different stories:\n\nFantasy football in Africa\n\nMTN\u2019s contribution to Nigeria\u2019s tax revenue, and\n\nWhat the Web3 is\n\nBetting on fantasy football in Africa\n\nAt the beginning of every football season, every person I know interested in the English Premier League \u2014 the biggest football league in the world (argue with your keypads) \u2014 starts talking about which players they\u2019re buying and what fantasy league they are joining.\n\nEven though I\u2019ve been a football fan for the last 13 years, I\u2019ve never understood the craze behind fantasy football. So imagine my surprise when I heard African football fantasy startup, Eksab had raised $3million in funding on Monday, March 28, 2022.\n\nWhat\u2019s fantasy football, though? So, think of this as your average football league, complete with players, coaches, and everything that makes up the entire production, but this time, you\u2019re the coach, and you choose your players yourself. Each match week, you get points based on how your players perform. At the end of the season, the person with the highest points gets a prize.\n\nIt\u2019s a big deal in places like Europe and Asia, not so much in Africa. On the African continent, betting companies rule the roost, and you\u2019d often find football fans \u2014 this tag is arguable, in my opinion \u2014 placing bets on how teams play.\n\nBut what does a fantasy football startup raising money mean for the \u201cecosystem\u201d? How would this play out considering the dominance of betting companies in Africa? Chimgozirim and Bolu made some interesting findings, which they shared here: Fantasy sports in Africa: Can $3m funding make it popular?\n\nMTN\u2019s lion share taxes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s go down a different path: On Saturday, April 2, 2022, news of telecom company, MTN\u2019s 13.5% contribution to Nigeria\u2019s tax revenue hit the papers \u2014 or in most cases, screens.\n\nAccording to MTN, it paid \u20a6757 billion in taxes to all Nigerian government agencies in 2021 and \u20a6618.7 billion to the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS). The company was also named the most tax-compliant company in Nigeria. An interesting u-turn from 2018 when the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, accused MTN of owing $2billion in taxes. This was eventually resolved.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContributing 13.5% of the total taxes paid to the FIRS in a tax year is no mean feat and got our spidey senses tingling. So, Emmanuel and I decided to do a little calculation.\n\nThe FIRS says it collected \u20a66.4 trillion in taxes in 2021. After our calculations, it amounts to approximately 10%, instead of 13.5%; still not a bad number if you ask me. Interestingly, according to Premium Times, the tax collecting body refused to comment on the actual percentage.\n\nApart from this, however, is one crucial fact: MTN contributes double-digit percentages to Nigeria\u2019s tax revenue. The implications of this are myriad. For one, this basically seals the telecoms giant\u2019s status in Nigeria. It could also mean that MTN leaving the country might have some interesting consequences.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to unpack here, and it should make for an interesting read.\n\nMaking sense of the Web3 buzz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve probably heard or seen the words \u2014 or abbreviations \u2014 Web3, NFTs, LFG, WAGMI and wondered what the evangelists were on about.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the \u201csimplest\u201d, Web3. It is said to be the next version of the Internet, which will focus on decentralisation and user ownership. So, unlike the current dispensation \u2014 Web2 \u2014 where many platforms are owned and regulated by one central entity, individuals in Web3 have more say in how their data or actions are controlled.\n\nTake Twitter, for example. Instead of having rules and regulations being set by the microblogging site, users can put possible policies to a vote and decide how they want to be regulated, kind of like democracy, but not.\n\nIn the last few months, Bolu has covered quite a bit on the space and, in a natural progression of events, hosted a Techpoint Twitter Spaces on Friday, April 1, 2022. We spoke to Chika Uwazie, Founder of Afropolitan; Erikan Obotetukudo, Founder of Audacity; and Clement Ugbo, Founder of Crevatal, to make sense of the Web3 buzz.\n\nHave a listen or if you want a read, you can check out this explainer: Web3: The Internet evolution to come in 2022 and beyond.\n\nTechpoint stories for you\n\nWhat I\u2019m listening to/reading\n\nSpent the weekend in the company of The Black Power Mixtape. Also sneaked in Omolade\u2019s self-titled EP (for Nigerian residents, you may know her as Airtel\u2019s 444 advert crooner). And went back to an all time favourite: Lorde\u2019s Pure Heroine.\n\nIn this long, but insightful piece by Adam Thierer for Discourse, he discusses how we can get the future we were promised.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nStakeholders in the Niger Delta Region in Nigeria have expressed optimism that with continuous engagement with critical government agencies the region will be able to overcome the inherent challenges that have deviled the area and the country at large in the past due to corruption.\n\nIt is no more a secret that one of the issues that is on the front burner at every discourse when the dwindling fortune of Nigeria, especially the oil rich region is being articulated is corruption amongst the government agencies and politicians in the corridor of power.\n\nAt the center of this colossal waste of the nation\u2019s wealth is the Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC, and the six oil producing states of Edo, Abia, Delta, Imo, Rivers and Ondo state and the National Assembly where the elected members take care of their own interest more than their constituents\n\nTo address reforms and issues of transparency and accountability in NDDC and the oil producing states as well as promote and engage in anti-corruption policy reforms the Africa Network for Environment Justice, ANEEJ held the Enhancing Anti-corruption and social inclusive reform initiatives in Nigeria project inception meeting at Abuja recently with stakeholders in attendance\n\nIn the words of the facilitator, Rev David Ugolor, Executive Director of ANEEJ, this important project seeks to promote and engage in anti-corruption policy reforms at both the national and sub-national levels as well as designed to enhance local civil society organizations ability to be positive and responsible change agents in Nigeria\n\nHe said, \u201cEnhancing Anti-Corruption and Social inclusive Reforms initiatives in Nigeria is designed following the anchor cluster model adopted by Palladium to promote and engage in anti-corruption policy reforms. ANEEJ is the anchor for the Anti-Corruption cluster under the SCALE project working with eight cluster organizations across six states and Abuja.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Palladium has adopted the cluster approach to identify possible areas of networking, advocacy, lobbying, civic engagement and policy dialogue and we are building that collective action that will put pressure on those institutions that need reforms and at the same time when those institutions are established, there is need for implementation and for implementation to happen there is the need for some level of public awareness.\n\n\u201cThese are some of the approaches we are going to be adopting and where the reforms is working we would like to scale it up by using the passivity impact and bringing the result to bear in our advocacy work,\u201d he added\n\nOn the issue of lack of accountability and transparency, he noted that it has been governance challenge, stressing, \u201cit is not just in the PADECS, oil and Gas commission alone because there have been reports and assessments that have shown that 13 percent oil money going to all the oil producing states are not properly managed well because of lack of transparency and accountability.\n\n\u201cThere are research that have now demonstrated that when there is absence of transparency the tendency is to have accountability impaired. Our message through this project is that we want to work with government agencies to see how the oil and gas commission established to manage this 13 percent are properly run and then they are able to achieve their goal so that people\u2019s livelihood will improve and there will be transparency and accountability in programmes they carry out.\n\n\u201cWhen that is done, there will obviously be developments happening in the region and this conflict and crises we are seeing engulfing the entire region will reduce dramatically,\u201d Rev. Ugolor added.\n\nHe further disclosed that ANEEJ has the history of working in the region in the past 20 years, and has developed governance index which is systemizing where there are possible improvement and opportunity to engage in those selected states which are just pilot states and when it is successful it would be scaled to the entire region and eventually impact across the country.\n\nWhile expressing profound gratitude to USAID through Palladium for providing ANEEJ cluster the grant to undertake this very important project as a very critical time of the nation\u2019s democratic match, Rev Ugolor added that \u201cOur cluster will also advocate for the mainstreaming of anti- corruption issues into the country\u2019s upcoming 2023 general elections discourse.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, the inception meeting provided the platform for the stakeholders who lauded the initiative of ANEEJ the opportunity to buy in to the project because of its timeliness to curb the huge deficit being experienced in the region which has translated to infrastructural decay and wanton profligacy by some Nigerians who fed fat at the expense of the tax payers.\n\nIn the past, ANEEJ was known for coming from the confrontational background, throwing stones. The Civil Society Organizations and Nigerians are quite aware of some of the actions taken, such as demanding the sack of Alison Madueke as the Minister for Petroleum, and other battles against corruption\n\nBut a time came, according to the Deputy Director of ANEEJ, Leo Atakpu that they now have to adopt what works in other climes apart from the stone throwing approach even though it is also helpful. They had to use a method which will deliver a better result and they arrived at the conclusion that collaborating with other stakeholders using global initiatives together, like the open government partnership that bring all stakeholders together on the table to procreate policies and drive the implementation with them has been found to be very useful in delivering results.\n\nAn Assistant Director of Community and Rural Development in the NDDC, Mrs. Ebi Ake who was delighted to be invited for the meeting said the commission is predisposed to the agenda of the meeting and more inclined to the social inclusiveness that will bring about the much needed reforms in the region.\n\nWhile pouring encomiums on ANEEJ, the NDDC Assistant Director noted that the commission will be ready to continue the engagement because of its commitment to whatever will bring succor to the region\n\nShe was explicit in her choice of words, when she said that with such engagement a lot would be achieved at the National Assembly where critical decisions concerning the region are being taken by the representatives of the people.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate what ANEEJ is doing, we are here because we want to further the engagement in whatever that will bring succor to the region and create a sense of responsibility amongst institutions and partnering with persons that have good intentions for Niger Delta region.\n\n\u201cWe know what we have been going through as a region, because of the way things are, we are looking at and ensuring that the NDDC constitutional review, the act that set it up need to be looked at again and see how we can meet up with international best practices in service delivery. Having to associate with ANEEJ we know that we would be able to achieve that at the National Assembly,\u201d she enthused.\n\nIn the same vein, a key stakeholder in the NDDC and a Civil Society Organization activist, Patterson Ogon who expressed optimism that the result of the project will be positive, advised that all hands must be on deck to improve the lives of the people in the region.\n\n\u201cWe commend ANEEJ for what they are doing and we want more stakeholders and development partners to key in to what ANEEJ is doing because it is a collective enterprise. We are certain it is going to be positive at the end of the day to translate to a better livelihood for the people.\n\nAlso, a representative of the chairman of Delta State Oil and Gas Producing Areas Communities, DESOGPADEC, Mr. Bayo Iyalaju commended ANEEJ for such a platform to discuss about corruption and he assured that the commission will be ready to Partner on this project to deal with corruption.\n\nOn behalf of the cluster members, Mrs. Onose Matha appreciated ANEEJ for working with the cluster organizations on the anti-corruption project noting that they are very anxious to see what is in the package for them in the next two years that the project will last.\n\nThe representative of Mr. Sulayman Dawodu, Executive Secretary of Criminal Justice Monitoring Committee, Joshua Dada disclosed that they have a good working relationship with ANEEJ Executive Director, Rev David Ugolor, adding that they are looking forward to working at the legislative reform of the project.\n\n\u201cWe supervise criminal justice in Nigeria with particular interest in anti-corruption that has been the path we have thread with ANEEJ\n\nThe interactive session was in-depth as Civil Society Organizations represented made indelible inputs during the meeting. For instance, Comrade Taiwo from Publish what you pay, observed that the theory of change presented by Deputy Director of ANEEJ, Leo Atakpu captured the inclusiveness of the project and Ismail Opeyemi from 24 Century advised on the intentional involvement of youths who are critical stakeholders.\n\nIn the words of Anne Bisi Ojugo, representing Joint Association of persons with Disability, JONAPWD, the persons with disability have never had it so good because they are always been carried along by ANEEJ.\n\n\u201cWe thank ANEEJ for including the people with disability in this project, we have never had it so good. A forum like this to build the capacity of people with disability is commendable,\u201d she noted.\n\nThe project has developed six indicators that will assist ANEEJ measure results achieved and this will be centered on three objective of the project, which are capacity building, advocacy engagement and public awareness activities.\n\nAccording to Sandra Eguagie, the second indicator to be measured in this project is the total number of anti-corruption commitment and oil commission mandate and policy documents reviewed. There will be a number of researches that will be done in line with the commitment of the OGP and the London anti- corruption commitment and other policy that will be used to review the PADECS.\n\n\u201cWe want to know the number of commitments that will be secured through the review of this Project and We are going to be measuring it by the time we are doing our presentation. Secondly, We are not only going to be looking at the number of documents reviewed, we are going to be looking at the number of laws that will be passed because we have some pending bills before the National Assembly,\u201d she added.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "title": "Saving public tertiary education in Nigeria",
          "text": "For several years now, the public tertiary education space in Nigeria has been afflicted by a rash of industrial actions arising from the displeasure of academics and other stakeholders in the system over the inability of government to honour collective bargaining agreements and give a jolt of life to the sector.\n\nThe latest experience of this disruption in the academic calendar of public tertiary institutions began in February when the Academic Staff Union of Nigerian Universities, ASUU resumed its warning strike action that it had earlier suspended.\n\nPut I perspective, the latest action by ASUU has been seen in most quarters as one that was seriously avoidable given that the academics and the government had reached a compromise of sorts after the last bout of strike which had resulted in an agreement that many hoped would have been the beginning of a conclusive resolution of the recurring disputes. What was then needed was to implement the outcome of that compromise which the academics now insist has not been done. And for the better part of seven weeks, the institutions have in the immediate, remained cold rooms for study purposes.\n\nBeyond the immediate, the net outcome of this rash of strike actions then has been the stultification of academic activities and massive frustration for students and parents.\n\nBeyond these also are the collateral damages that have come into the mix. They include the challenge of securing enduring quality for the system in a world where tertiary education is evidently a universal engagement where global best practices are the norm. There is also the issue of the continuing migration of many students who ordinarily should be receiving their tertiary education in-country but who have been forced by factors, including the instability in the educational calendar, to seek admission and study opportunities outside the country.\n\nThere is also the sheer range of economic losses that the country suffers on account of the large numbers of Nigerians that are forced to go abroad to study. As CBN records would readily confirm, this is a major source of pressure on the nations foreign exchange position as the volume of dollars being sought by the Nigerians studying abroad continues to soar.\n\nEven more worrisome is the fact that government tends to be lackadaisical, unconcerned and indifferent about taking prompt and serious action to address the entire situation. When the strike first broke in the current dispensation, the attitude of government officials was to feign ignorance of the action. When they finally stepped in to presumably address it, the focus has been on trying to intellectually shoot down the positions being canvassed by the striking lecturers as if this is a lecture room debate. There is no sense of urgency; no show of empathy, compassion and consideration for hurting students, distraught parents and a continually hemorrhaging nation.\n\nIn the past there have been several suggestions, including one that public office holders be forced to compulsorily educate their children and wards within the countrys public tertiary educational system. While this has been shot down at the National Assembly the fact remains that there is still a large dose of indifference of public sector personnel to the plight of Nigerians who work in and are supposed to derive benefits from the system.\n\nOn their part, lecturers and students have been criticised for not being realistic in their opposition to raising fees in the system as a way of increasing funding. But even this point is neither here nor there as specific proposals and cushioning effects in this regard first have to be put on the table by those promoting them. For example, rather than simply ask students and their parents to just go and find any fees that are presumably denominated as market-efficient rates, can proper steps be taken to ensure that even as those adjustments are being proposed, there are also corollary proposals to address the question of a revamped Students Loans Board that would undertake to ensure that those who bring evidence of an inability to pay the revamped fees get to secure low interest loans to fund their studies.\n\nThis newspaper reminds government that it is its responsibility to get the system to work and therefore calls for everything to be done within the next two weeks towards ensuring that the schools are opened once again for full and uninterrupted studies.",

          "title": "Tension mounts over Lekki Tollgate reopening",
          "text": "By ADEBAYO OBAJEMU\n\nIf not properly handled the proposed reopening of Lekki Toll gate may prove a sticky one for the administration of Babajide Sanwoolu of Lagos State.\n\nLast Friday, Abiodun Alabi, commissioner of police in the state warned citizens planning to converge at the Toll gate to protest to shelve the idea, saying much as they have rights to protest, the state Police Command will not take kindly to attempts to infringe on the rights of others in the name of protest.\n\nThis subtle sabre rattling on the part of the police command in the state comes amidst meetings with stakeholders by the Lagos officials, where majority of speakers voiced their opposition to reopening, even as the representatives of Lagos State pleaded for understanding. The spectre of trouble hovers, and crisis looms over the polar views held on the matter by the government and the people.\n\nBackground\n\nIn 2020, as #Endsaars protests which started as ripples of discontent against police brutality \u2013 especially its special branch responsible for robbery \u2013 raged across the country, rapping the knuckles of Nigeria\u2019s state actors lost sleep and became jittery. Then, wave after wave of soft pressure on the protesters, which included the deployment of street urchins to scuttle the protests failed to make their mark, before force was deployed.\n\nOn the night of October 20, 2020, while young Nigerian protesters sat at the Lekki Toll Gate, wrapped in the national flag and singing the national anthem, a hail of bullets cut loose from guns procured with their taxes, felling about 11 of them in the process while leaving others with horrific injuries. About a year later,\n\nresponsibility for the bloodbath, which effectively ended the protest was placed at the doorstep of the Nigerian police and the Nigerian army.\n\nIn scorching findings penned by the Justice Doris Okuwobi-led judicial panel of inquiry set up by the Lagos State Government to investigate the disturbances, the killings were poignantly described as a massacre. But that was not before the Lekki Concession Company, operators of the Lekki Toll Gate, where the killings happened, was indicted.\n\nThe panel was unequivocal and unsparing in its findings that the company lent a leprous hand to those who carried out the massacre.\n\nRecently, the Lagos State Commissioner for Information, Gbenga Omotoso, announced plans by the Lagos State Government to open the Lekki Toll Gate closed for over 18 months since the massacre. Pegging the planned opening for April 1, 2022, Omotoso said operators of the facility had huge debts to pay.\n\nOmotoso puts the debts at N11.6 billion to local lenders and about $31.1 million to foreign lenders. He also announced that about 500 workers with families to feed had been affected by the closure. But Omotoso said nothing about the blood debts owed by the Lekki Concession Company for its complicity in the killing of October 20, 2020. This, Omotoso, conveniently glossed over.\n\n\u201cFor money, reopening Lekki Toll gate without the state paying adequate compensations to victims and publicly apologizing is not the path to go\u201d, said Professor Adeagbo Moritiwon, a political scientist.\n\nHe told this newspaper that reopening \u201cought to be the last on the menu.\n\n\u201cThe first is to come clean by accepting responsibility for what happened, and paying adequate compensation, then the state can call a meeting of stakeholders to negotiate and haggle on how to reopen.\u201d\n\nBen Adamson, a lawyer told Business Hallmark that \u201cI think this administration should have shown more sensitivity and compassion, placing profits above every other thing is not the best. We are talking about the feeling of Nigerians, their psyche was assaulted at the same Lekki, and we are yet to resolve this, only for the government to be talking of reopening the toll gate.\u201d\n\nIn the past one week, the Lagos State Government has been intensifying its plea to the people of the state, especially residents of Lekki and Ikoyi, to show understanding ahead of the proposed reopening of the Lekki-Ikoyi Link Bridge toll plaza by the Lekki Concession Company Limited.\n\nAccording to a statement on Wednesday, the Lagos State Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr Gbenga Omotoso; Commissioner for Transportation, Dr Frederick Oladehinde and Commissioner for Home Affairs, Anofiu Elegushi, disclosed this during a stakeholders meeting held in Lagos.\n\nOmotoso and his counterparts assured the residents that the government will look into all the requests and recommendations made by the stakeholders which included the President of Lekki Estates Residents and Stakeholders Association, Olorogun James Emadoye; human rights activists, the media and several other residents of Lekki and respond appropriately.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are here to seek your understanding as a government about the matter at hand. We are also citizens of Nigeria. We are all Lagosians. I have listened to all of you talking about our rights, privileges and how government should be responsible for everything. I also feel that as citizens, we should have some responsibilities.\n\n\u201cLagos is a city of about 25 million people and out of the 25 million people there are about six million taxpayers and among six million taxpayers, only 4.2 million are active taxpayers.\n\n\u201cSo, let us reflect on all these things. I know how people feel and I understand what has been said but I believe that the matter at hand is about seeking your understanding. It is a matter of showing some compassion for people who have one thing or another to do with this company.\u201d\n\nOladehinde explained the decision of the government to re-open the toll plaza was not to punish people but to create an enabling environment for more jobs through private sector participation.\n\n\u201cWhat Lagos State is trying to do is to create an enabling environment to create more jobs and when you create more jobs. We should not be shortsighted. The only way to create jobs is to create an environment where we can attract the private sector to build more infrastructure in the state. Let us look at the issue from the view that we are trying to resuscitate the economy of Lagos State,\u201d he said.\n\nElegushi, said the purpose of the stakeholders meeting was to engage key stakeholders on the matter of reopening the toll plaza and appealed for cooperation from the people to work together with the government.\n\nThe Managing Director of LCC, Mr Yomi Omomuwasan, on his own hinted on the necessity for the resumption of operations so as not to continue to default on its payment of local and international loans as well as to cater for the welfare of its workers.\n\nLCC has also introduced new technology and innovations to make movement at the toll plaza seamless and faster for commuters.\n\nMeanwhile, Nigerians of all hue had asked the Lagos State government to halt the April 1 planned reopening of tolling of the Lekki-Ikoyi Link Bridge by the Lekki Concession Company Limited, LCC. This comes as appeal from Lagos State government calling for understanding on the side of the people mounts.\n\nHowever, the residents said they want the reopening halted based on the harsh economic situation in the country. They said the tolling would aggravate their hardship. Some Nigerians also took to social media to demand justice for people killed and injured at Lekki Toll Gate during the #EndSars protest.",

          "text": "National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) has commissioned North-Central Skill Acquisition Centre (SAED) and the garment, bakery and water factories located in Keffi, Nasarawa State to boost Internally Generated Revenue (IGR).\n\nThe factory is equipped with over 100 industrial sewing machines and other machines needed for the production of high-quality kit items to be supplied for use by corps members, while the water factory has three water packaging lines for the production of sachet water as well as pet and dispenser bottle water.\n\nSpeaking at the commissioning of the factories in Keffi yesterday, the Nasarawa State governor, Abdullahi Sule thanked the director general of the NYSC for redefining and reinvigorating the scheme as a whole, while stressing the need not only to acquire a degree but to acquire a skill.\n\nThe governor said, \u201cYou have done wonderfully well. I have attended several of your events, one of which was the opportunity to visit the NYSC museum that you have established and without mincing words, just like the Emir of Lafia has mentioned it doesn\u2019t matter how many years NYSC continues to remain.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cYou came in and redefined NYSC. You set up a museum, set up acquisition centers all across the country and today, you have been able to actually have NYSC now generating revenue and returning the revenue to the federal government for the first time in the history of NYSC, so you have indeed redefined this.\n\n\u201cAt one of the events that I attended, the initiator of the NYSC as a whole, Gen Yakubu Gowon, had to thank you sincerely for bringing back the life of his vision.\n\n\u201cI want to assure you that by the grace of God, we will not only patronize the products you are having here, we will find ways to work together as a team because this is coming right on time.\u201d\n\nNYSC director-general, Major General Shuaibu lbrahim said the inauguration of the new factories has shown the commitment of the scheme in expanding its revenue generation platforms.\n\n\u201cThey will also serve as additional training avenues for Corps members enrolling for relevant vocational skills under the SAED programme. This complex is also unique in the sense that it has the highest number of NYSC factories located in the same place,\u201d he noted\n\nHe said the scheme is also in talks with the Nasarawa State University on a proposed partnership whereby the Entrepreneurship Unit of the institution will use the facility to impart entrepreneurial skills on both the Corps members and interested youths of Keffi community.\n\nThe director general added, \u201cI am also pleased to inform this gathering that our sustained focus on revamping the NYSC Ventures is bearing impressive results as over one billion Naira generated through these sources was paid into the Federal Government coffers from the year 2020 to 2021.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time the NYSC is remitting revenue to the federal government, an achievement that has earned us commendations from the higher authorities, including the National Assembly.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the former governor of the state, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, thanked the DG for making sure this impact has been properly captured.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe emphasised the need to train youths to be self-sufficient, saying that the government alone cannot give jobs to everyone.\n\nThe Emir of Lafia, Sidi Bage Muhammad said the DG has set a pace that any one coming after him will have to work very well.\n\nThe event was attended by former Chiefs of Army Staff: Lieutenant General AB Danbazau (rtd) and Lieutenant General TY Buratai (rtd), among other dignitaries.",

The need for a new Nigeria which only New Nigeria People\u2019s Party will provide cannot be overemphasised.\n\n\u201cNigerians need a compassionate government with milk of human kindness and ready to deliver dividends of democracy to assuage the sufferings of the people in accordance with Section 14(2)b of the Constitution 1999, as amended which states that security and welfare of the people shall be the primary purpose of government. It is unfortunate that this basic constitutional requirement of government at all levels has remained a mirage as fellow compatriots are being killed daily as if there is no government in place.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cNNPP shares the grief of those who lost their loved ones in the dastardly train attack, the recent gruesome killings of innocent citizens in Benue, Plateau, Kaduna, Niger etc, and pray to God Almighty to console them, heal the wounded and safe return of those missing to reunite with their families,\u201d it said.\n\nThe party said it is time to take governance seriously, arrest the perpetrators of these heinous crimes against the fatherland and their sponsors to face the full weight of the law. It noted that Nigeria cannot be the great arsenal of democracy in Africa when its leaders are still groping in the dark confused on the way forward.\n\nIt said the 2023 general election provides yet another opportunity to elect credible, reliable, compassionate and progressive leaders which only the NNPP can produce to restore the nation\u2019s greatness, prosperity and dignity.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe party urged eligible Nigerians to register and obtain their voter cards, and ensure they vote out all those that have brought the nation to this sorry state and their stooges to pave way for a new Nigeria.",

          "text": "New Nigeria People\u2019s Party (NNPP) has condemned the spate of insecurity in the country and urged the federal government to arrest the situation immediately as no part of the country is safe.\n\nThe party in a statement by the national publicity secretary Ambassador Agbo Major said, \u201cToday, Nigerians live in fear of terrorists, insurgents, bandits, kidnappers, militants, armed robbers and ritualists.\u201d It said no means of transportation is safe anymore including land, railway, air and sea, adding that the country has not had it so bad since Independence in 1960.\n\n\u201cIt is a sad commentary on our emerging democracy. The need for a new Nigeria which only New Nigeria People\u2019s Party will provide cannot be overemphasised.\n\n\u201cNigerians need a compassionate government with milk of human kindness and ready to deliver dividends of democracy to assuage the sufferings of the people in accordance with Section 14(2)b of the Constitution 1999, as amended which states that security and welfare of the people shall be the primary purpose of government. It is unfortunate that this basic constitutional requirement of government at all levels has remained a mirage as fellow compatriots are being killed daily as if there is no government in place.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cNNPP shares the grief of those who lost their loved ones in the dastardly train attack, the recent gruesome killings of innocent citizens in Benue, Plateau, Kaduna, Niger etc, and pray to God Almighty to console them, heal the wounded and safe return of those missing to reunite with their families,\u201d it said.\n\nThe party said it is time to take governance seriously, arrest the perpetrators of these heinous crimes against the fatherland and their sponsors to face the full weight of the law. It noted that Nigeria cannot be the great arsenal of democracy in Africa when its leaders are still groping in the dark confused on the way forward.\n\nIt said the 2023 general election provides yet another opportunity to elect credible, reliable, compassionate and progressive leaders which only the NNPP can produce to restore the nation\u2019s greatness, prosperity and dignity.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe party urged eligible Nigerians to register and obtain their voter cards, and ensure they vote out all those that have brought the nation to this sorry state and their stooges to pave way for a new Nigeria.",

The plan is that once it comes to the South even the southeast governors will support the southsouth aspirant to emerge.\n\nAs we speak the entire 37man team has come under intense pressure to zone.\n\nI still submit that zoning at this late hour will breed rancour, division, resentment and bitterness. The appropriate thing to do if we actually want to achieve fairness, equity as well as merit and competence, is to choose a CONSENSUS CANDIDATE FROM THE SOUTH-EAST.\n\nTherefore let us choose National Consensus over Zoning.\n\nA lot of PDP members erroneously believe that whoever is our presidential candidate will easily win the election. Let the PDP not position itself to snatch loss over victory in the 2023 elections.\n\nI speak because I love my party and have paid monumental sacrifices for my immeasurable loyalty.

          "title": "Train attack: The humanity in us slowly being eroded \u2013 JNI \u2013 Blueprint Newspapers Limited",
          "text": "Jama\u2019atu Nasril Islam (JNI) \u2013 the apex Muslim organisation in Nigeria \u2013 has said the rising security challenges in the guise of killing, maiming and kidnapping are indications that \u201cthe humanity in us is slowly being eroded.\u201d\n\nThe group, led by Sultan of Sokoto Sa\u2019ad Abubakar III, also noted that any government that cannot protect the lives and properties of the people lacked the justification of remaining in office.\n\nIt also expressed worry that the tragic train attack may have indicated the nation was heading towards an unknown destination of chaos.\n\nJNI Secretary-General Dr. Khalid Abubakar Aliyu made the group\u2019s position known Monday in a statement issued to journalists in Kaduna.\n\nTitled \u2018Passengers\u2019 bound train attack along Abuja-Kaduna rail track\u2019, the statement said: \u201cTo say the least Jama\u2019atu Nasril Islam (JNI) is agonised and short of words to express her-self over the gory incident of the infamous train attack which happened on Monday, 28th March, 2022. The well-orchestrated incident remains highly condemnable, reprehensible and upsetting to every rational mind.\n\n\u201cIt appears that the continuous callous acts of mayhem, killings and arson happening almost on daily or weekly bases around us; either within communities and/or on the roads we ply, has automatically reset our human psyche that we now have accepted such dastardly acts as part of our lives, to the extent that we no longer feel it. The humanity in us is slowly being eroded thereby making us adapt to the new normal within which we, unfortunately, found ourselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt should be noted that in Islam and by all global standards, the essence of Government and Governance is solely to protect the five principal cardinal rights of the human race, the most important of which is LIFE! Any government that is incapable of protecting the lives of its citizens has lost the moral justification of being there in the first place; this is enunciated in section 33(1) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe have however carefully studied and followed-up the unfortunate train blast especially that another train attack was reported to have occurred on the Lagos-Kano bound train, near Jaji, Kaduna state, on Thursday, 31st March, 2022, which inevitably led to the death of the locomotive operator. Therefore, this press release is premised on the fact that Nigeria is more or less heading to an unknown destination of multiple cum well-coordinated serial chaos attributable to lack of coordination and synergy from security personnel, if the news making the round is to be believed.\u201d\n\n\u201cNevertheless, history is replete of several astonishing and bravery art of governance exhibited overtime by leaders. For instance, during the time of Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him), he battled and expelled Banu Qaynuqa from the city Madinah, because a woman was molested in the market by one of them and the community-supported his actions. The Prophet (SAW) did not waste time but promptly attacked Banu Qaynuqa and expelled them. This served as deterrence to others with evil intentions.\n\n\u201cIn the Nigeria of today, how many wives are raped daily in the presence of their husbands, mothers in the presence of their sons? How many daughters are raped in the presence of their fathers and sisters in the presence of their brothers? This happens a lot. and it is well known. What action did the authorities take in averting and/or to remedying such absurd and ungodly happenstance? Why must the country be brought to kneel?\n\n\u201cHuman life is held sacrosanct in Islam that is why Allah (SWT) declared in the Glorious Quran that if a single soul is killed without just cause, then it is as if the entire humanity is wiped off the face of the earth. We claim to be people of faith and all these occurrences are allowed without any form of prompt intervention. Why? Well, it should be known that an attack on one soul; is an attack on all, and this is how the human race should be preserved and protected, but if allowed to continue we fear the consequence(s) of the innocent souls that were killed, without any fault of theirs.\n\n\u201cTerrorists are now becoming bolder and more belligerent by the day. They operate in any area of their choice(s) at any time they so wish. They even operate for up to 8 hours non-stop (as it was reported to have happened in Niger state last Monday), without any fear of being confronted or apprehended. Most communities are now under the bandits\u2019 absolute control with taxes being paid to bandits\u2013some parts of Borno, Katsina, Zamfara, Niger, Sokoto states and some others yet to be disclosed to the public. In fact, terrorists do what they wish knowing that there is no gun power or authority that will defy them,\u201d the statement further added.\n\nHe said: \u201cWith all the reported resources allocated to relevant security agencies; intelligent gathering mechanism, military arsenal and tact, can\u2019t the Government provide any convincing justification on why the security situation in the country continue to deteriorate? Why are attacks experienced all over the place and continuing unabated without any deterrence? Moreover, why must security budget and expenditure remain so secretive, despite the reported release of fund? The mind boggling train attack of Monday, 28th March, 2022, the kidnap and sporadic shootings that ensued thereafter the train en-route Kaduna needs to be seriously investigated and punitive measures taken. Although, without doubt, the security men have exhibited capacity, resilience, determination and dexterity during the rescue operation of the same ill-fated train attack.\n\n\u201cIt is also the firm belief of most Nigerians that the Government is expected to know the enclaves and hideouts of these criminals, particularly that only Government has absolute control and use of force, and by extension it also has machineries to generate genuine information. Again, why can\u2019t the Government proactively take the battle to the criminals\u2019 hideouts and wipe them off? Why should the Government wait until people are attacked, lives and properties lost for them to strike and be issuing empty orders and usual condemnation? The whys are endless?\u201d\n\nThe JNI scribe said it\u2019s high time the security outfits were directed \u201cto ransack the enclaves of all criminal elements and deal with them decisively. Informants should not be spared, as they are more dangerous than the killers. They should be made to face the right punishment befitting their crime. The intelligence community should beef-up their efforts in trying to dig to the root of this phenomena.\n\n\u201cIt is also worth noting, that in recent time, scholars of social behavior have discovered that most acts of terrorism and banditry are carried out under the influence of hard drugs. As part of effort to tackle insecurity in Nigeria, the war on drug should be placed on the front burner as it is the elixir that spurs criminals to action. Suppliers, vendors and traffickers of hard drug and intoxicants must be dealt with decisively. The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) and other security agencies should as a matter of national security note and penetrate into villages, higher institution campuses, motor parks and recreational or viewing centres, because they are now dwellings where hard drugs/substances are being peddled brazenly.\n\n\u201cLikewise, parents, religious and community leaders have a role to play in the fight against illicit drugs/substance pervading most households within our neighbourhoods. This should be considered a fight for all and not only for the Government.\u201d\n\nThis is not conventional war \u2013 Lai\n\nIn a related development, Minister of Information and Culture Alhaji Lai Mohammed, told former President Olusegun Obasanjo that the nation\u2019s security agencies were battling unconventional warfare.\n\nMohammed, who spoke on a TVC programme, \u201cThis Morning,\u201d said contrary to Obasanjo\u2019s position, the Muhammadu Buhari administration was not overwhelmed by the nation\u2019s security challenge.\n\nObasanjo, had , while reacting to Kaduna train attack, said: \u201cI believe that all right-thinking Nigerians must know that we have a situation that has overwhelmed the present administration, but we should not allow that situation to overwhelm Nigeria.\u201d\n\nCountering the former president\u2019s position however, the minister said the military and other security personnel were doing their best and had recorded successes in their fight against terrorism.\n\n\u201cWe must give kudos to our military; you know that we are not fighting a conventional war but terrorism, hence the need for everyone to support the security agencies so as to win over the menace.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government has also given the military the enabling environment to continue in the fight against terrorism and banditry,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nMohammed also said: \u201cThe Federal Government is working toward ensuring that such incident does not reoccur.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that the government wants to do is to fast-track the installation of a surveillance and monitoring system, not just on the Abuja-Kaduna rail track.\n\n\u201cBut also on the Lagos-Ibadan and Warri-Itakpe rail tracks to ensure that at any given time we will be able to monitor from the control room.\u201d\n\nGunmi on suspended cleric\n\nMeanwhile, controversial Islamic scholar, Sheikh Ahmad Abubakar Gumi, has backed the suspension of the Chief Imam of Apo Legislative Quarters Mosque, Abuja, Shiekh Nuru Khalid, over an \u2018inciting sermon.\u2019\n\nIn the sermon last Friday, Khalid lashed at the Buhari-led government over the recent train attack in Kaduna and related killings by bandits in the Northern Nigeria and across the country.\n\nCommenting on the cleric\u2019s suspension, however, thinks otherwise as he has condemned the sermon, saying it was riddled with \u201csentiments overriding intellect.\u201d\n\nIn a chat with journalists on Monday in Kaduna, Gumi said what Imam Khalid did was worse than \u201cthe few kidnappings\u201d being perpetrated by bandits.\n\nGunmi, an ex-military officer said: \u201cIt\u2019s a case of sentiments overriding intellect. Calling masses not to vote out incompetent government by massive voting is worse than the few kidnappings and a misplaced judgement.\u201d\n\n",

          "text": "The race to the Presidential Villa in 2023 is getting more intense in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as the party\u2019s 37-man zoning committee meets to take a decisive position.\n\nThe committee is expected to recommend to the party whether zoning would help its return to power at the centre in 2023 or not, and which part of the country picks the presidential ticket.\n\nThe committee was inaugurated on the 24th of March, 2022 with Benue state Governor Samuel Ortom, and Minority Leader of the House of Representatives Hon Ndudi Elumelu as chairman and deputy chairman respectively, while Emmanuel Ekpe was named as secretary.\n\nBlueprint gathered that the first meeting, held few days ago after their inauguration and the other one held on the 29th of March, 2022, ended inconclusively.\n\nIn a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Nathaniel Ikyur on 29th March, 2022, the governor said: \u201cThe meeting is yet to be concluded. We have adjourned till Tuesday next week at the same time, same venue. And until we conclude the proceedings, there is not much to say. So far, all the members are quite understanding. There wasn\u2019t any form of tension.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s dicey \u2013 Source\n\nAlso, a reliable source who is from North-central told Blueprint that almost all members of the committee came to the meetings with a position and argument for the ticket to be zoned to their geo-political zone.\n\nThe source, a high ranking member of the party and also a member of the committee who did not want his name in print said, \u201cthe zoning committee has met twice since inauguration. The next meeting which will be the 3rd meeting will take place on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe previous meetings ended inconclusively as members of the committee were advancing arguments to favour their zone. So, it becomes difficult to agree on a zoning arrangement.\u201d\n\nAsked about the possible way the zoning would go, he said: \u201dIt is difficult to say, the committee has not concluded and no one can say it will go south or north. But, from the number of those who have bought forms and from our last meetings it will be difficult for this committee to zone it to either south or north.\n\n\u201cThe aim of the party is to win 2023 general elections, if we zone it now that many people have bought forms it may cause crisis within the party. From our previous meeting and from what the majority of the members have said, the 2023 Presidential ticket may be thrown open.\u201d\n\nThe report and recommendation of this committee would determine the fate of former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, Rivers state Governor Nyesom Wike, former Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Anyim Pius Anyim, and former Anambra state Governor Peter Obi, at the PDP presidential primary slated for May 28 and 29.\n\nOthers who have obtained the PDP presidential nomination form include, Sokoto state Governor Aminu Tambuwal, Bauchi state Governor Bala Mohammed; Akwa Ibom state Governor Udom Emmanuel; former Senate President Abubakar Bukola Saraki; Oliver Diana Teriela, Nwachukwu Anakwenze, Ovation Publisher, Dele Mohammed, Sam Ohuabunwa and Mohammed Hayatu-Deen.\n\nThe two-week deadline given the committee to submit its report elapses Thursday, 10th April, 2022.\n\nDokpesi hopeful on Atiku\n\nIn a related development, the chairman, Technical Committee, Atiku Presidential Project, High Chief Raymond Dokpesi, has expressed confidence that the PDP zoning would not affect the former VP.\n\nDokpesi stated this, Monday, shortly after submitting the expression of interest and nomination forms on behalf of Atiku.\n\nReacting to questions on whether the zoning would affect the plans of Atiku to vie for the PDP Presidential ticket, the media mogul said: \u201cDefinitely, we have nothing against whatever the party will decide, but the zoning will not be against us.\n\n\u201cI am not aware of any internal problems in the PDP; no crisis whatsoever. PDP is one big family and we shall all be together as brothers and sisters. The forms have been fully signed and in complete order.\u201d\n\n",

It\u2019s now a question of whether they can get over the line.\n\nSouthgate will hope that Manchester United defender Harry Maguire can recapture his best form ahead of the tournament, while there will inevitably again be much scrutiny on Harry Kane, who will likely have the chance to become his country\u2019s leading all-time goalscorer.\n\nCurrent FIFA world ranking: No. 5 (March 2022)\n\nNo. 5 (March 2022) Regional ranking: 3rd (UEFA)\n\n3rd (UEFA) World Cup titles: 1\n\n1 World Cup appearances (last): 15 (Russia 2018)\n\n15 (Russia 2018) How qualified: UEFA Group I winners 8W-0L-2D\n\nUEFA Group I winners 8W-0L-2D Overall record (all competitions & friendlies): 2022: 2W-0L-0D (Goals: 5 scored / 1 conceded) 2021: 15W-0L-4D (Goals: 52 scored / 5 conceded)\n\nCoach: Gareth Southgate (England) since September, 2016\n\nGareth Southgate (England) since September, 2016 Star players: Harry Kane (Tottenham / England), Declan Rice (West Ham / England), Raheem Sterling (Manchester City / England)\n\nUSA\n\nThe U.S. will be joining the party at World Cup 2022, barely making it through the group on goal difference over Costa Rica. This will be the 11th time that the U.S. men\u2019s national team (USMNT) have featured on the global stage, with the best result coming via a semifinal run at the inaugural tournament in 1930.\n\nWithout question, Gregg Berhalter\u2019s side has enough young talent to have a chance at getting out of the group, and should excite supporters on the way, as they plot a potential deep World Cup run.\n\nChelsea\u2019s Christian Pulisic will be expected to play the main role, while Gio Reyna will provide a creative spark between the midfield and attack. The U.S. will be a real threat going forward for teams to worry about, given their 21 goals scored in qualification.\n\nCurrent FIFA world ranking: No. 15 (March 2022)\n\nNo. 15 (March 2022) Regional ranking: 2nd (CONCACAF)\n\n2nd (CONCACAF) World Cup titles: \u2014\n\n\u2014 World Cup appearances : 10 (Brazil 2014)\n\n10 (Brazil 2014) How qualified: (CONCACAF qualifying third place: 7W-3L-4D)\n\n(CONCACAF qualifying third place: 7W-3L-4D) Overall record (all competitions & friendlies): 2022: 3W-2L-1D (Goals: 9 scored / 5 conceded) 2021: 17W-2L-3D (Goals: 45 scored / 12 conceded)\n\nCoach: Gregg Berhalter (USA) since December, 2018\n\nGregg Berhalter (USA) since December, 2018 Star players: Christian Pulisic (Chelsea / England), Gio Reyna (Borussia Dortmund / Germany), Weston McKennie (Juventus / Italy)\n\nIran\n\nIran will appear at a third straight World Cup finals later this year, with the No.1 ranked national team in the AFC region capable of making a mark at the tournament.\n\nDragan Skocic\u2019s side qualified for the 2022 showpiece in emphatic style, winning eight, drawing one and losing one of the last qualification round fixtures. That was enough for Iran to finish top of their group, as they edged out South Korea, who also qualified as runners-up.\n\nPorto forward Mehdi Taremi, Feyenoord creator Alireza Jahanbakhsh and Bayer Leverkusen threat Sardar Azmoun make Iran a strong attacking unit, with Skocic\u2019s team netting 15 times in 10 final-round qualifying matches, having already scored 10 times in a single match against Cambodia in an earlier phase.\n\nCurrent FIFA world ranking: No. 21 (March 2022)\n\nNo. 21 (March 2022) Regional ranking: 1st (AFC)\n\n1st (AFC) World Cup titles: \u2014\n\n\u2014 World Cup appearances (last): 6 (Russia 2018)\n\n6 (Russia 2018) How qualified: AFC Third Round Group A winners: 8W-L1-D1\n\nAFC Third Round Group A winners: 8W-L1-D1 Overall record (all competitions & friendlies): 2022: 3W-1L-0D (Goals: 4 scored / 2 conceded) 2021: 10W-0L-1D (Goals: 31 scored / 3 conceded)\n\nCoach: Dragan Skocic (Croatia) since February, 2020\n\nDragan Skocic (Croatia) since February, 2020 Star players: Sardar Azmoun (Bayer Leverkusen / Germany), Alireza Jahanbakhsh (Feyenoord / Netherlands), Mehdi Taremi (Porto / Portugal)\n\nWales / Scotland / Ukraine\n\nEvents away from the pitch mean that the outcome of who will qualify for the 2022 World Cup out of Wales, Scotland and Ukraine is yet to be determined. Wales are due to face the winners of Scotland vs. Ukraine in the last UEFA playoff final, however, the tie between Scotland and Ukraine has been indefinitely postponed due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. It has not yet been confirmed when that fixture will be settled.\n\nWales will look to qualify for a first World Cup finals since 1958, when they reached the quarterfinals of the competition. Being a relatively small nation, they have punched well above their weight in recent years, even managing to get to the semifinals of Euro 2016 before losing to eventual champions Portugal.

Currently on an eight-match unbeaten run, the Tartan Army will believe that they can negotiate tough ties against Ukraine and then Wales to book their ticket to Qatar.

          "text": "The flow of \u201cbloody money\u201d to Russia must stop, Kyiv\u2019s mayor said on Tuesday as the West prepared new sanctions on Moscow after dead civilians were found lining the streets of a Ukrainian town seized from Russian invaders.\n\nSince Russian forces withdrew from northern Ukraine, turning their assault on the south and east, grim images from the town of Bucha near Kyiv, including a mass grave and bound bodies of people shot at close range, have prompted international outrage.\n\nRussia denies targeting civilians and said the deaths had been staged by the West to discredit it.\n\nSanctions already imposed have isolated Russia\u2019s economy but its gas is still flowing to Europe and a number of international companies continue to do business there, leading Ukraine to say more is needed to starve Moscow\u2019s war effort.\n\n\u201cEvery euro, every cent that you receive from Russia or that you send to Russia has blood, it is bloody money and the blood of this money is Ukrainian blood, the blood of Ukrainian people,\u201d Mayor of Kyiv Vitali Klitschko, dressed in military clothes, told a mayors\u2019 conference in Geneva via video link.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Tuesday that while what happened in Bucha was unforgivable, Ukraine had no choice but to negotiate with Russia to end the war, now in its sixth week.\n\n\u201cAll of us, including myself, will perceive even the possibility of negotiations as a challenge,\u201d Zelenskiy said in an interview broadcast on national television. He said it was not clear whether he and Russian President Vladimir Putin would speak directly.\n\nRussian news agency Interfax cited a deputy Russian foreign minister as saying talks, which last convened on Friday, were continuing via video link. There was no update from the Ukrainian side.\n\nZelenskiy said earlier that at least 300 civilians had been killed in Bucha and that many more dead were likely to be found in other areas. He said he would address the United Nations Security Council later in the day as he builds support for an investigation into the killings.\n\nSATELLITE IMAGES\n\nRussia denied that its forces had carried out any atrocities and said it would present \u201cempirical evidence\u201d to the U.N. Security Council meeting proving its forces were not involved.\n\nBut satellite images of Bucha taken weeks ago showed bodies of civilians on a street, a private U.S. company said, undercutting Russian claims that the scene was staged.\n\nMaxar Technologies provided nine images taken of Bucha on March 18, 19 and 31 to Reuters. At least four of the images appear to show bodies on Yablonska Street in the town, which was occupied by Russian forces until about March 30. read more\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden called for a war crimes trial against Putin and Washington will ask the U.N. General Assembly to suspend Russia from the Human Rights Council. read more\n\nAt the weekend, Reuters reporters in Bucha saw several bodies apparently shot at close range, along with makeshift burials and a mass grave, but could not independently verify the number of dead or who was responsible.\n\nUkraine\u2019s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said he spoke with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres about Bucha and stressed that \u201cUkraine will use all available UN mechanisms to collect evidence and hold Russian war criminals to account.\u201d read more\n\nKuleba spoke to his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on Monday, with Beijing again calling for talks to end the conflict. read more\n\n\u2018FEEL THE CONSEQUENCES\u2019\n\nRussia launched what it calls a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d in Ukraine on Feb. 24, saying it aimed to demilitarize and \u201cdenazify\u201d its neighbour.

He is wanted on charges of genocide and war crimes, which he denies the charges.

          "text": "Shell Nigeria, Chevron and the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited are hindering full operation of the Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) project by not allowing third parties transit gas through their pipelines, Nigeria\u2019s federal government alleged on Monday.\n\nThe government therefore appealed to the partners to allow the transportation of third-party gas through its joint pipelines to increase gas supply to the NLNG and boost the supply of the product to Europe.\n\n\u201cFollowing the refusal of the joint partners Shell, Chevron, NNPC and others, to allow third parties to transport gas through their pipelines to the NLNG Trains, the company has been unable to operate at full capacity, thus causing its inability to meet both domestic and international gas obligations,\u201d the federal government lamented.\n\nA statement by Senior Adviser, Media and Communications to the Minister of State, Petroleum, Mr Horatius Egua, noted that the NLNG is at present only able to produce at about 70 per cent installed capacity.\n\nThe Minister , Chief Timipre Sylva, during an audience with the new Italian Ambassador to Nigeria Mr. Sefano De Leo, in Abuja, said that if the NLNG partners relax their rules and allow third party supply gas to the company, it will be able to provide gas to help ease the European Union\u2019s energy crisis.\n\n\u201cThe issue we have with the existing NLNG Trains is that of insufficient gas supply. The partners are running out of gas and they are refusing third party to supply gas to the Trains.\n\n\u201cThe partners are insisting that they can only allow third party supply gas to the plant only if they agree to supply at subsidised rates. These people of course want to make money and they cannot supply at subsidised rates and that\u2019s why the NLNG Trains cannot produce at fully capacity.\n\n\u201cThe partners can afford to supply at subsidised rates because they are partners in the NLNG project not the third parties. This is a very critical issue I want to discus with the respective partners to see how we can resolve this problem so that we can increase the production capacity of the NLNG,\u201d Sylva said.\n\nThe minister who stressed the long-standing relations between Nigeria and Italy also sought the cooperation of the Italian government in providing support for night helicopter rescue operations in the country, adding that at the moment helicopters cannot fly in the night in Nigeria, thus foreclosing any rescue operations at night.\n\nSylva added: \u201cFor us, this is a very important matter. We want to develop a 24-hour economy. We want a situation where helicopters can fly 24 hours in Nigeria\u201d.\n\nIn his response, De Leo stressed the importance of Nigeria in Africa and noted that as the continent\u2019s most populous country, it would be difficult for anyone to ignore the country both at the political and economic front.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, the EU wants to diversify its energy sources, especially gas and Nigeria is very strategic to us. We have been long-standing friends and partners and one of the most important one for that matter.\n\n\u201cSo, we need to continue to dialogue on how things can be done properly. In Africa, no country is more strategic than Nigeria because of its population, economy and political position. So we are happy to work with you,\u201d the Ambassador noted.\n\nEurope has recently begun to pile pressure in Nigeria to ramp of gas supply to the continent following the Russia-Ukraine war. The Vladimir Putin-led country supplies between 30 to 40 per cent of gas to Europe.",
