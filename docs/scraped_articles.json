          "text": "THE Sarkin Fulani of Igangan, Alhaji Salihu AbdulKadir, who was recently banished from the community by a Yoruba activist, Sunday Adeyemo, aka Sunday Igboho, has for the umpteenth time denied any involvement in the crisis rocking Igangan community in the Ibarapa North Local government of Oyo State.\n\nAbdulKadir told newsmen in Ilorin, Kwara State on Thursday that neither he nor his family was involved in the killings of innocent souls in Igangan since the crisis started.\n\nHe also denied that one of his children was killed during last Saturday\u2019s killing in Igangan.\n\nThe Sarkin Fulani who alleged that members of Odua Peoples Congress killed eight Fulani men in Igangan and Elekokan, near Igangan during the week, called on both the state and the federal governments to probe the crisis in the area with a view to bringing the perpetrators to book.\n\nAlleging that the utterances of Oyo State Governor\u2019s Special Adviser on Security, Fatai Owoseni, were tantamount to encouraging Sunday Igboho and the likes to foment trouble in the area, AbdulKadir, however, commended Governor Seyi Makinde for his mature reaction to the issue of the latest attacks in Igangan where scores of people were killed.\n\nAbdulKadir denied claims that one of his children was killed during the recent crisis in the town.\n\nHe said, \u201cI want to tell the whole world that my family and I were not involved in Igangan crisis. Since the crisis began about four months ago, we have relocated from Igangan.

          "text": ".\n\nBy Ebunoluwa Sessou\n\nFor teenagers to be fully responsible in the society, the right foundation, guidance, right environment to grow, proper communications, right mentorship, family values and dialogue have been identified as important ingredients for all stakeholders in the family circle to employ as training tools.\n\nSpeaking during the just- concluded Crush it, a programme organised for teenagers by Movere Foundation, the convener, Joyce Ugbosu, disclosed that the foundation which was birthed in 2017 was aimed at building capacity, training teenagers to give guidance, right counsel on career, how to live their lives and do away with distraction.\n\nAccording to her, teen age is full of distraction and there are little or no role models that teenagers can emulate and that is why we brought this programme.\n\n\u201cTeenagers tend to take decision without being guided and that is why Crush it was birthed to allow teenagers knows those things to do to Crush it in life and break records. They can be the first to become achievers of great things in life,\u201d she maintained.\n\nOn the impact of the event, she said: \u201cLots of teenagers have denounced cultism, some school dropouts have gone back to school. Some of them have been skillfully empowered and have become employers of labour.\n\n\u201cWe cannot leave the training of children in the hands of school owners. It is a partnership thing. All stakeholders must come together to train the children. There are lots of security challenges in the country and this is caused by bad leadership.\n\n\u201cWe do not have role models for our children to emulate. There is a problem of leadership and for us to have leaders who are genuinely concerned about the citizens; we have to take the bull by the horn.\n\n\u201cI urge them to do the needful so that the lives of our teenagers could be secured and guaranteed.\n\n\u201cWe are partnering with other organisations in different countries. In Nigeria, we have reached Sokoto, Zamfara, Delta among others,\u201d she added.\n\nA Teen\u2019s Coach, Chinemenma Umeseaka, an On-Air Personality who is also Special Adviser to Abia State Governor on Teens Matters highlighted some of the challenges most teenagers encounter which include lack of foundation, proper communication, family values, and bad environment, among others.\n\nAccording to her: \u201cSome of the children are trained by parents or guardians who do not have proper foundation.\n\n\u201cSecondly, teenagers do not have the right environment to grow. There is need to hold activities that would help them grow positively. Most teenagers grow in an environment that is not adding value to them. When a child does not have proper role model to look up to, the end result will be devastating.\n\n\u201cParents should step up; they can start from the moment they realise that something is wrong and needs to be corrected.\n\n\u201cThere is need to dialogue with our teenagers and engage them on our family values.\n\n\u201cCyber space is creating contents that are not helping us. Most of our teenagers are misguided by television celebrities. Nobody is monitoring them to understand right from wrong,\u201d she lamented.",

          "text": ".\n\nBy Cynthia Alo\n\nNigeria\u2019s indigenous ride-hailing platform, Univasa Nigeria has launched a new feature to ease off remittances delay to driver-partners.\n\nThe feature allows driver-partners to withdraw their commissions instantly on card-based trips at their convenience.\n\nVanguard gathered that Univasa was the first platform to enable in-app internet-enabled voice calls that helps drivers and riders spend less on airtime calls.\n\nThe company also noted that the Instant withdrawal feature is the first of its kind in the Nigerian ride-hailing sector where drivers usually have to wait till a particular day in the week to cash out or withdraw their card-based trip commissions.\n\nAccording to the company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Ben Adeniyi, \u201cWe decided to implement this feature after so many driver-partners complained of the delay in accessing much-needed cash, the weekly remittance process is a major pain point for ride-hailing driver-partners especially when they have a lot of card-based trips in the week, this means they don\u2019t readily have access to cash needed for both car and personal maintenance, some of them informed us that they take loans ahead of their payout days and this affects their profit-making or even business growth.\n\n\u201cSo, we decided to solve this one issue and I can assure you that our driver-partners are so happy about it. We already give them 90 percent of the ride charges but this anytime withdrawal really tops it for them and we are happy that they are happy because our driver-partners are our priority.\n\n\u201cThis development is in line with our mandate to provide the best possible service to driver-partners. We also provide a welfare package that gives drivers the opportunity to own their lands, buy gadgets and pay in installments. We also provide insurance to drivers and security tools like tracking devices.\u201d\n\nUnivasa launched in the later part of 2020 in Lagos with a partnership with the popular Lagos yellow cabs with a campaign called \u201cBaba dey online\u201d and has since expanded operations to Ibadan, Port Harcourt, Benin City, Akure and Ilorin; Kwara state. The platform also confirmed that they will be extending operations to at least 5 more cities in Nigeria before the year runs out. The Univasa User and Provider apps are available for download on Google Playstore and the Apple AppStore.",

          "text": ".\n\n\u2026Says stop injustices, Biafra agitations will end immediately\n\nBy Chinonso Alozie, Owerri\n\nThe Association of South East Town Unions ,ASETU, on Thursday, said that it would invite the International communities on the statement President Muhammadu Buhari, made about the Igbos in the Southeast region of the country, while on Arise TV, exclusive interview.\n\nThe ASETU, Chairman, Emeka Diwe, stated this to newsmen in Owerri, in his reaction to Buhari\u2019s outing on Arise TV.\n\nDiwe\u2019s grouse was that for Buhari to mention that Igbos properties were scattered all over the country, could mean to them, as a genocidal plot.\n\nHe however, called on President Buhari to stop marginalization against Igbo and that the agitations for Biafra republic will end the next day.\n\nASETU argued that, \u201cBy reminding Ndigbo of our assets that are scattered across the country, President Buhari has only succeeded at giving a tacit support to the rest of Nigeria to be hostile to the Igbo and our interests wherever they are found. This is unfortunate. The fact that Ndigbo live freely everywhere in Nigeria and develop everywhere they find themselves should have made Buhari to know that Ndigbo are better Nigerians and they are the adhesive that holds the country together, and they have contributed to national unity and progress in concrete terms more than any other ethnic nationality in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe threats which we are now getting from President Buhari suggest that there is a plot to commit another genocide against our people. We demand that President Buhari should immediately withdraw those threats against Ndigbo, tender apologies to our people and put off every plan for their execution.\n\n\u201cWe hereby invite the International Criminal Court, the United Nations, the United States of America, the European Union, the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to intervene in the Nigerian situation and save the innocent, poor, marginalized and defenceless Igbo people from the looming genocide against us,\u201d Diwe said.\n\nThe group continued on what have been fueling agitations for Biafra saying: \u201cIt is an aberration that in the past six years no South Easterner has been appointed into the headship of any security establishment in the country. Why would President Buhari talk of our people growing through the ranks when he does not respect the ranks? How many Igbo military officers were seniors to the current Chief of Army Staff? Why were they not selected? Instead, some of them are reportedly about to be laid off. How many Igbo police officers were seniors to the current Inspector General of Police? Why were they all bypassed? The type of injustices our people suffer in Nigeria cannot be found in any modern nation.\n\n\u201cThe country would go to borrow money abroad, and Igboland would not be captured in the projects on which the loan would be expended. Yet, the oil and gas through which the country hopes to repay the loan are mostly found in our land. Which other zone in the country has five states? Only South East! The noise you hear about the construction of second Niger Bridge now suggests that they really don\u2019t see it as a national project.\n\n\u201cRather as a favour being done to Ndigbo. How many rail lines are currently being done in Igboland? We have a Government that is instead constructing railways through the Sahara to other countries. Of what economic significant are they to the country! So, those who are perpetuating this unfair system against our people are the sponsors of secession.\u201d\n\nIt was their view that, \u201cWe have severally posited that if the injustices against Ndigbo in Nigeria are erased today, the agitations will end the next day. The ferment of Biafra that you see today is therefore the symptom of a disease afflicted on Ndigbo by this Government and the previous ones.\n\n\u201cOn a daily basis, Fulani herdsmen kill our people. They rape our women. They sack our communities. They destroy our farmlands and destroy our crops. Our livelihoods are now sorely imperiled by the activities of the herdsmen.\u201d",

In 2019, another five (5) fire officers were sponsored for a national fire conference in Ilorin, Kwara State.\n\n\u201cHe (Ugwuanyi) is the leading Governor in Nigeria to have installed fire extinguishers of various types and sizes in over 24 major markets in his state and other fire prone locations.\n\n\u201cHis Excellency broke records again in the history of Enugu State Fire Service, as he provided Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for the safety of all firefighters in the state\u201d.\n\nIn his speech, the Rector of IMT, Enugu, Prof. Austin Nweze explained that the training was part of the initiatives of the school management aimed at supporting the state government\u2019s concerted efforts at tackling fire outbreaks for safety of lives and property of residents of the state.\n\nFire razes shops, properties worth millions at Katsina Central Market\n\nProf. Nweze applauded Gov.

I am sure you will understand what they mean. Again the youths made the same statement. So, that IPOB is just like a dot in a cycle, if they must secede, you must have access to where you are. And the way they are spread all over the country, having businesses, having property, I think that IPOB doesn\u2019t know what they are talking about.\n\n\u201cIn any case, we said we will talk to them in the language they will understand. We will organise the police and the army to pursue them, that\u2019s what we can do and we will do it.\u201d",

It is unfortunate that Kyari and co are killing cults members and forcing them to answer ESN and unknown gunmen. We are calling on human rights organisations across the globe and other relevant stakeholders in the world to take record of what Nigeria army and police are doing in so many peaceful communities in Imo State. We therefore, warn perpetrators of these evil agenda to retrace their steps immediately or brace up for stiff resistance,\u201d he said.\n\nThe IPOB spokesperson queried why youths in the North were not treated same way even after being identified as bandits.\n\n\u201cThe intention of the masterminds of this crime against humanity is to weaken the South East and pave the way for its long-planned invasion by jihadists. But they will not succeed. We promise them hell for this cowardly act of victimising innocent Igbo youths for the activities of unknown gunmen.\n\n\u201cHow many times have youths in Zamfara, Katsina or Kaduna been arrested and killed for the activities of bandits?

With the challenges we face in Nigeria today, I see an opportunity for us not to break up or break down but to break open; open up to ourselves in truth so that we may appreciate each other, understand each other, honour each other and live together in peace and prosperity.\u201d\n\nHe assured Nigerians that with the concerted efforts being put in place by the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration to secure the lives and property of Nigerians and stabilise the economy, the nation will continue to get better.\n\nAregbesola said: \u201cThere will surely be light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d even as he wishes all Nigerians a happy Democracy Day celebration.\n\nThe June 12, which was the day Chief Moshood Abiola won the 1993 presidential election, which was subsequently annulled by the military government of Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, was declared a public holiday by the administration of President Buhari after it was only celebrated by states in South-west since 1999 on return to present civilian rule.\n\nThis year\u2019s celebration falls on a Saturday, making the federal government to declare Monday, June 14 a public holiday.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

I spoke to one French man and I had to tell him this. He spoke nonsense and I told him look, in 1885, you sat down and drew lines (boundaries). I said I have first cousins in Niger. There are Kanuris, there are Hausas, there are Fulanis in Niger Republic just as there are Yorubas in Benin.

          "text": "On Tuesday, Nigeria\u2019s Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami, defied the Nigerian government\u2019s Twitter ban.\n\nThe government had last Friday banned Twitter after the App deleted a controversial comment made by President Muhammadu Buhari, in which he made reference to the Nigerian Civil War, which many Nigerians described as distasteful.\n\nAbubakar Malami\n\nAmidst the public outcry and criticism that followed the government\u2019s decision, Malami on Saturday directed the Director of Public Prosecutions in his office to begin the process of prosecuting violators of the government suspension order.\n\nHowever in a post on his verified Facebook page on Tuesday, the Attorney General posted a screenshot from the Twitter app showing his account has been deleted.\n\n\u201cMy Twitter account deactivated,\u201d he wrote.\n\nSaharaReporters further gathered that the Minister downloaded Virtual Private Network in order to visit Twitter to deactivate it.\n\nA critical look at the photo by just clicking on it showed that indeed Malami had accessed his Twitter account with the aid of a VPN. See Also Politics REVEALED: How Malami Downloaded VPN, Logged Into Twitter To Deactivate Account\n\nThis is however not the first time the Minister would be disregarding laws made by the Buhari-led government despite being the Chief Law Officer of the country.\n\nHe has also been constantly accused of using his influence in the government to promote impunity and human rights violation.\n\nIn July 2020, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) protocols and guidelines were flouted during the wedding Fatiha of Malami\u2019s son, Abdulaziz, to Khadija Danbatta as guests were seen in a video dancing and communicating close to one another without wearing face masks.\n\nThe Minister was also seen in the video spraying wads of cash at the event, against the rule of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), which forbids anyone from abusing the naira by spraying and stepping on them in public.

Like a relay race, successive PDP administrations furthered infrastructural development only for him to run the opposite direction when the baton was passed to him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is important to state that only the on-going refurbishing of Akwanga-Maiduguri road that President Buhari can lay claim to as the singular and only project in which he has demonstrated capacity.\u201d",

          "text": "The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) says it is wrong for President Muhammadu Buhari to \u201cclaim\u201d projects started by previous administrations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBuhari highlighted some of his administration\u2019s projects in an interview with Arise TV, which was broadcast on Thursday.\n\nHowever, Kola Ologbondiyan, the party\u2019s spokesman, in a statement, said Buhari claimed projects which date back to the administrations of Olusegun Obasanjo and Goodluck Jonathan \u2014 both former presidents were elected on the PDP platform.\n\nHe added that contrary to Nigerians\u2019 expectations, the president was evasive in his responses to some questions on the country\u2019s challenges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOur party is dismayed that while millions of Nigerians eagerly expected President Buhari to use the interview to address salient issues confronting our nation, Mr. President bungled the opportunity by being evasive and dodgy while attempting to lay claims to projects done by PDP administrations,\u201d the statement reads.\n\n\u201cInstead of addressing issues and providing direction for our nation, President Buhari exposed his cluelessness, paucity of ideas for development, while making very provocative comments that could embolden terrorists as well as serve as recipe for further division and violence in the country.\n\n\u201cOn infrastructure, it is ludicrous to us in the PDP that Mr. President can disingenuously seek to subtract the deliverables achieved by past PDP administration from his so-called achievement on infrastructure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe PDP places it on record and we know that Nigerians are also aware that President Olusegun Obasanjo, who was elected on the platform of the PDP, introduced a 25 years national development plan upon assumption of office in 1999.\n\n\u201cThis included the massive construction and expansion of road network, power plants, railways projects, inland and coastal waterways, airports, housing, agricultural and health projects as well as establishment of new universities and other legacy projects in various parts of our country.\n\n\u201cWe want to inform President Buhari, since he is not always aware, that successive governments elected on the platform of the PDP built on these development plans leading to the expansion of major trunk roads across our country, railways and other legacy projects which, probably, his handlers are making him to believe are his.\n\n\u201cIt is on record that President Goodluck Jonathan also took on a massive expansion of our international and domestic airports across the country, built and commissioned railway stations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is instructive to state that where projects were yet to be completed, it is only a natural occurrence for any Nigerian elected as President to proceed, in the national interest, to complete such projects.\n\n\u201cThe PDP therefore considers it tacky for Mr. President to seek to claim any credit for projects he never conceptualised, commenced or built to near completion, just because he found himself in office at the point of completion.\n\n\u201cShould Mr. President be reminded that even the expansion of the Presidential Villa including the Banquet Hall, which his party, the All Progressives Congress (APC) uses today as its National Secretariat was conceptualised and built by the PDP government, though leaders of the APC stood stoutly against the project while it was on-going?\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari also needs to accept the bitter fact that the current drawback in infrastructural development in our country started with his administration. Like a relay race, successive PDP administrations furthered infrastructural development only for him to run the opposite direction when the baton was passed to him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is important to state that only the on-going refurbishing of Akwanga-Maiduguri road that President Buhari can lay claim to as the singular and only project in which he has demonstrated capacity.\u201d",

Should he be impervious to hope, optimism and positivity or should he be amenable to fairness, truth and sanguinity \u2013 even if the facts are not in harmony with his public posture? It is customary here once you are branded a \u2018\u2019critic\u2019\u2019 of the government you are expected to only breathe fire like a dragon \u2013 \u2018\u2019see no good, speak no good; \u2013 just attack and attack\u2019\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is the fallout out of militarised socialisation \u2013 a hangover of military-era opposition. During Nigeria\u2019s military rule, scorched-earth activism/criticism was the definitive approach to the government and rightly so. Down with the Kaiser! If you betray any emotion for the Kaiser, then you are a traitor who must be hanged \u2018\u2019comrade-style\u2019\u2019.\n\nI used to be that guerrilla critic; always hungry for an attack. And truly so, there were always reasons \u2013 good reasons. But I realised that if you prime yourself for complaints and fault-finding, you will always have reasons. You only see what you want to see. This does not vitiate the very important task of holding the government to account. No!\n\nInsecurity remains a detraction to the achievements of the Buhari administration. While most of us agree that the performance of the government on security has not been impressive, very few may want to acknowledge the fact that President Buhari has made appreciable gains on infrastructure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Buhari administration has done well on infrastructure. It is a leap from where we used to be. We can agree that security remains a challenge but still acknowledge the good outcomes when we see them. At a time Nigeria was fortuned by favourable crude oil prices \u2013 in the past administration \u2013 funds for infrastructure were either diverted or frittered away. Contracts were awarded as a meal for political cronies. I am aware that the contract for a famous road in Abuja was awarded without a design \u2013 but funds were paid to the contractor who happens to be a cousin of the former president. That road was abandoned afterwards.\n\nLet me get down to brass tacks. On rail, the 157km Lagos-Ibadan standard-gauge rail was inaugurated today. The benefits of this infrastructure are immense. The project is a relief for those who ply the tortuous Lagos-Ibadan road. The 327km Itakpe-Warri standard-gauge rail was completed and inaugurated 33 years after construction began. Abuja light rail was completed in 2018. Financing negotiations for Ibadan-Kano standard-gauge rail project are also in progress.\n\nSome road projects have been completed and more are in progress. Also, more than N360 billion worth of Sukuk Bonds was raised in 2017 for many crucial road projects across all the six geopolitical zones. New terminals for international airports in Lagos, Abuja, Kano and Port Harcourt were completed. The construction of new runways for Abuja and Enugu international airports was also completed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet it appears insecurity is eclipsing the achievements of the Buhari administration in this area. The basic responsibility of any government is to protect lives and property. We can only ride on the train and use the roads if we are alive. In fact, road trips have become an attempt at self-murder. The roads are gravely unsafe. Security comes first in the hierarchy of needs. It is the nucleus.\n\nThe Buhari administration must do well to address insecurity \u2013 for its own reckoning. Any achievement it records in other sectors will be obviated and dampened by daily episodes of killings and kidnappings.\n\nThe administration will be cheered and applauded by more Nigerians for its achievements when it saves Nigeria from the grim reaper rampaging everywhere in the country.\n\nBy Fredrick \u2018Mr OneNigeria\u2019 Nwabufo\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwitter @FredrickNwabufo",

          "title": "#TwitterBanNigeria: Is it even legal?",
          "text": "The short answer is no. The long answer...\n\nOn Friday the 4th of June, Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed, announced that the country\u2019s federal government would be suspending Twitter\u2019s operations within Nigeria. This came after Twitter deleted a tweet by the country\u2019s president where he threatened \u201ccivil war\u201d type violence on citizens of the country.\n\nFollowing this announcement, in the early hours of Saturday, June 5, Nigerian Twitter users found that they could only access the site with the use of a VPN (Virtual Private Network) which allows people to access blocked websites by masking their actual locations.\n\nThe loss of access formally took place after the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) issued a directive to all telcos and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) instructing them to restrict their users\u2019 access to the social media platform.\n\nWhile there are ongoing debates around how the ban affects Nigeria\u2019s digital economy and what it means for freedom of speech in the country, one issue that hasn\u2019t been addressed is the legality of this action by the executive arm of the Nigerian government.\n\nIn a democracy, various arms of government exist to work together and keep each other in check.\n\nWhile one arm makes laws, another enforces; but it is unusual for one arm to enforce a law that the other did not make. This is the situation in Nigeria today as the directive barring the use of Twitter is not currently backed by any law passed by the country\u2019s legislature.\n\nIn response to the Twitter ban, Malechi Okafor, a lawyer and managing partner at M & O Legal Services said, \u201cIt is unprecedented because we never thought we would get to a point where a democratically elected leader would try to take away the voice of the people.\u201d\n\nWhile he is currently a democratic leader, President Buhari, a retired army general and former military head of state, is not a stranger to muzzling the media as his regime in the 1980s was one wrought with media clampdowns.\n\nIn what seems like an encore performance, President Buhari\u2019s 1984 media clampdowns have taken a new form as the Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, issued a directive on the 5th of June that citizens found still using Twitter were to be prosecuted.\n\nWith this we suddenly have two things to be addressed: was blocking Twitter legal and should people be prosecuted for carrying on tweeting with their VPNs.\n\nThe Almighty NCC\n\nIn my discussion with Imade Iyamu, a corporate lawyer at Banwo and Ighodalo, she shed some light on what actual powers the Nigerian Communications Commission has when it comes to telcos and ISPS.\n\n\u201cJust like the CBN has a lot of power over banks, the NCC has the power to issue directives,\u201d she said.\n\nBut the fact that a directive is issued does not make it entirely legal. This is why the courts exist, to allow citizens or concerned entities to challenge directives or actions performed by the government or its parastatals.\n\nSo to reverse the decision, we must head to the courts then?\n\nWell, not exactly. In Nigeria, the courts have been inactive for weeks as the court workers, under the umbrella of the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN), have been on strike for weeks now. It has however been reported on Wednesday that the strikes have been suspended and the courts will reopen on Monday the 14th of June.\n\nJUSUN has very clear demands. In 2020, President Buhari signed an executive order mandating that state governors adhere to a provision in the country\u2019s 1999 constitution that gives the judiciary financial autonomy and access to a federal fund. The governors have ignored this.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly has a budget that they manage. The judiciary should have one as well to pay themselves and handle their affairs \u2013 to be truly independent,\u201d Okafor tells me during our talk.\n\nA truly independent judiciary would be the recourse of the people at this time but that is not something that is currently available.\n\nWithout the courts, the directive by the NCC stands unchallenged and while this is in itself a problem, the bigger problem lies in the directive issued by the country\u2019s attorney general and minister of justice.\n\nThen there\u2019s Malami\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t declare that people should be prosecuted without a written law,\u201d this sentiment expressed by Iyamu during our call is one I have heard from several lawyers both offline and on Twitter.\n\nThe directive issued by the attorney general is unlawful. That much is clear.\n\nOne of the tenets of a democratic society like ours is the idea that laws are deliberated on and passed by a body of elected officials \u2013 the legislature. These laws can then be enforced by the executive branch and interpreted by the judiciary. The attorney general falls into the class of the former but in this regard, he has no law to enforce. Just one he has made himself.\n\nTwo days ago, the country\u2019s house of representatives invited the Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed, to ask questions regarding the Twitter ban.\n\nThere has been no official statement from the legislature regarding Malami\u2019s declaration that the use of Twitter will be met with prosecution. While VPNs provide momentary succour from the irrational directive of the NCC, Malami\u2019s push for prosecution might be harmful to citizens who continue to use Twitter as is protected by their right to free speech.\n\nSo, is the current Twitter ban with the threat of prosecution illegal? You bet it is. But until the courts open on Monday and the people get a chance to exercise their rights, I guess we\u2019ll have to wait.",

          "text": "Kenya, this week, became the first and only African market where Bolt has introduced electric bikes, tuk tuks (tricycles) and scooters on its platform. This comes as the on-demand transport company looks to tackle the twin challenge of fuel price fluctuations and environmental pollution in the East African country.\n\nBolt\u2019s addition of electric vehicles to its fleet is in line with an expansion plan for greener transport options in Kenya, particularly in its delivery unit, with the ultimate goal of reducing the company\u2019s environmental footprints.\n\nA study by the Union of Concerned Scientists finds that ride-hailing companies are responsible for nearly 70% more carbon pollution than the modes of transport they displace, like mass transit, biking, and walking. To address this, they have been called on to reduce emissions with more concerted efforts such as electrifying their fleet of vehicles.\n\n\u201cThis is a great step towards realising environmentally conscious ways for people to move around in the city, reduce our ecological footprint, decrease air pollution and increase access to clean transportation modes,\u201d Regional Director for Bolt Africa, Hillary Miller-Wise, said at the launch.\n\nFor now, the electric bicycles and tuk tuks will be used by Bolt Food couriers only. The food delivery business launched in Nairobi three months ago amid a resurgence in global coronavirus infections, with Bolt looking to tap into the boom in demand for contact-less services recorded since the Covid-19 pandemic began. It offers users access to a diverse list of restaurants and menus in the capital city.\n\n\u201cWe will be making deliveries using the newly launched tuk tuks and bicycles within Nairobi as we expand into other towns across the country. Our customers will now have more Eco-friendly and sustainable options to choose from,\u201d Bolt Food Country Manager, Edgar Kipngetich Kitur, said.\n\nThe fleet of electric scooters and e-motorbikes essentially helps Bolt fulfill the demand for light, smarter and greener modes of transport that are also less expensive to maintain. It is perhaps the cost factor that was the biggest consideration that propelled the company to introduce the new vehicles.\n\nAccording to Bolt, electric vehicles will also help evade challenges associated with a fuel price crisis that has greatly affected its drivers and couriers. Last month, the ride-hailing company raised fare prices across all cities in Kenya due to the increased cost of fuel in the country.\n\n\u201cWe trust that this is a stride forward to mitigate the impacts of constant fluctuating fuel costs and will stabilise the growth and sustainability of driver earnings and cost of doing business,\u201d Hillary added.\n\nWhile the vehicles will initially be used by Bolt Food couriers, the company plans to include them in the passenger business as well. Bolt will also expand its green transport options in other African markets where it has a presence, it said, without specifying which will come next. On the continent, Bolt Food is only available in Kenya, South Africa, and Ghana.",

          "title": "How seamless customer onboarding is transforming fintech growth",
          "text": "According to McKinsey, Nigeria is now home to over 200 fintech standalone companies. And thanks to increasing smartphone penetration, many of these services use apps. Many of these apps have extensive marketing spending to drive user growth. In recent times, Abeg app and Patricia were announced as sponsors of Big Brother Nigeria.\n\nYet, beyond marketing spend, there\u2019s another simple way that fintech startups are ensuring that people want to use their products, and it is through onboarding. Onboarding is the process of introducing a new user to your app or product.\n\nOnboarding is essential for several reasons; it can lead to customer drop-offs if the process is difficult or complicated, or it can be such a delight that customers end up telling others about your app.\n\nOn Friday, May 21, VerifyMe Nigeria and TechCabal held the \u201cDigital Identity Matters\u201d event to talk about the importance of onboarding and the nuances that surround it. The event had Babs Ogundeyi, the CEO of Kuda Bank, Dayo Ademola, the Managing director of Branch Nigeria, and Esigie Aguele, the co-founder and CEO.\n\nOne of the critical things in onboarding a customer is the Know Your Customer (KYC) requirement.\n\nWhat does the onboarding process look like at Kuda bank?\n\nAccording to Babs Ogundeyi, Kuda has different levels of onboarding because not everyone in Nigeria has the same type of identification, and some people do not have any identification at all. In June 2020, the Director-General of the NIMC, Aliyu Aziz, said only 38% of Nigerians have any form of identification.\n\n\u201cThe way we think about it is that we need to do enough to capture everybody and to give everybody a chance to be onboarded. So we have three tiers of customers, which is in line with the Central Bank guidelines for Microfinance banks.\u201d\n\nFor Kuda, the minimum requirement for KYC is that the bank needs to know what you look like, so while it asks users to take a selfie as part of its onboarding, it uses technology to be sure that the person taking that selfie is the owner of the account.\n\nIt also relies on Bank Verification Number (BVN) to compare the pictures of account holders with what is in the system. These levels of verification are important to prevent forgeries, fraud and attempt to circumvent processes.\n\nIn a nutshell, the more documents you have to corroborate, the better your onboarding process. It also helps to think of them as a never-ending process because bad actors never stop trying and fintech startups need to stay ahead of them.\n\nWhat would make the lives of customers easier?\n\nWhile BVN has been a gamechanger for verifying customer details, there\u2019s still some work to be done. According to Dayo Ademola, one important part of onboarding should be verifying the address of customers.\n\n\u201cTypically, you would ask for a utility bill but at the highest level of KYC, someone has to physically verify the address of the customer. What we are trying to do is, if we say that we are a bank in your pocket, then we have to find workarounds to make this happen.\u201d\n\nOne workaround is comparing the address on a customer\u2019s BVN with the address they have listed with a commercial bank. This is because commercial banks often physically verify the addresses of their customers.\n\nIt already sounds cumbersome in an industry where customers are asking for speed. \u201cBeing able to onboard pretty quickly is important; how quickly can customers download your app, verify their information and become an actual user instead of gaps where the app needs to verify.\n\n\u201cThe top thing that new users are really looking for is speed. Another pattern we see is that customers start to drop off when you start asking for a lot of information, you see a lot of drop-offs.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlso, if you ask costumes to wait 24-48 hours before you verify them, that poses a problem.\u201d\n\nIn the end, bank customers will still face lengthy wait times while a bank is running verifications checks in the background. Nigeria still functions as a low-trust environment; and despite accelerated changes to our financial ecosystem, banks and their customers agree that the KYC process is crucial to prevent fraud and cybercriminal activities.\n\nFind the full video of this conversation on YouTube.

          "text": "The latest smartphone in the product line of the Note series, the Infinix Note 10, is a device that was built to \u2018Meet Beauty with Strength\u2019. The elements of the new Note 10 are Speed, Beauty, Power, and Strength. The beautiful screen, the bodywork, and the overall design of the device, plus the strength of its processor all come together to provide an extraordinary experience for users. Infinix has gone a step further to bring upgraded and improved features to the new Note 10, while still maintaining affordable pricing for consumers.\n\nThe Infinix Note 10 Pro won the IF design award 2021 for its iconic design and flattering colour variants. The brilliant bodywork was followed with this remark by IF World design Guide, \u201cThis generation has a single appearance but two different battery cover designs. One is full of symmetrical design aesthetics \u2013 \u201cpolygonal vertical grating\u201d \u2013 while the other has more mysterious shimmering patterns and texture.\u201d\n\nAccording to Unbox Therapy, \u201c\u2026 if entertainment is one of your priorities and you need a budget smartphone the Infinix Note 10 Pro looks like it\u2019s up to the task. The Infinix Note 10 Pro will certainly satisfy with its whopper of a 6.95inch IPS display. It is definitely one for those who want their smartphone to be as big as humanly possible.\u201d And the Tech Chap, a UK top tech YouTuber, further confirmed the screen size by saying, \u201cI really love just how big the screen is. We\u2019ve got nice thin bezels around the edges; we\u2019ve got the hole punch selfie at the top. As I said, 6.95 inches \u2013 if you are watching movies or playing games, this is going to give you a really immersive experience.\u201d\n\nAnother UK tech reviewer, Tech Spurt said, \u201cThe batteries are integrated with ultra power saving mode so you can get an extra 58 hours of call time even when the battery is at 5% capacity\u201d. Another tech reviewer, the Tech Chap also said, \u201cWe do also have that fast 33W charger, which actually charges up 50 minutes faster than the previous generation of this phone \u2013 a nice upgrade there.\u201d\n\nIn the words of a British tech reviewer, SuperSarf, \u201cA 90hz refresh rate at this price, that\u2019s just insane. It\u2019s going to make everything very smooth. You will be very surprised to learn that this will be retailing for $259. I think you will be pretty impressed with what this offers for that price.\u201d Just in case you were wondering if the Note 10 is a good buy for your money, there you have it from the tech gurus themselves. So, if you had doubts about what the Note 10 had to offer, be rest assured you\u2019re in good hands.\n\nConfirming every feature that the device is claimed to have, media houses have described the Note 10 smartphone as a value-for-money device that offers high-end features such as impressive entertainment experiences, long-lasting battery, and high-performance processing power.\n\n\u201cTheir 6.95\u201d displays (FHD+, 1080\u00d72460) should make any visual application extremely agreeable to use. The panels are based on IPS LCD technology, which typically does quite well in color gamut and maximum brightness (480 NITs).\u201d \u2013 Hubert Nguyen, Ubergizmo\n\n\u201cWith the new 33W X-Charge a 0-100% charge takes 50 minutes less than it did on the previous Note model. A quick 5-minute top-up is enough for 2 hours of gaming.\u201d \u2013 Peter Bonov, GSMArena\n\nMeanwhile, the Note 10 online launch was brimming with thrill and excitement around the main features of the Note 10 \u2013 speed, beauty, power, strength \u2013 as the functionalities of the new smartphone were tested live.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "In May 2021, CribMD, a Nigerian healthtech startup, closed a $2.6 million seed round led by US-based venture capital firm, Sputnik ATX.\n\nFounded by Dr Oksana Malysheva \u2014 a physicist with stints at McKinsey and Motorola \u2014 and Joe Merrill \u2014 a former US diplomat to Nigeria, South Korea, and Bosnia \u2014 Sputnik ATX runs an accelerator programme where founders receive $100,000, with the potential for more in follow-on funding.\n\nSince its inception, the firm has invested in over 30 startups across various industries.\n\nTechpoint Africa spoke to Joe Merrill, a partner at the firm, and he gave some insights into how they invest in startups.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFun fact: Sputnik is a Russian word meaning partner. It is also the name of the first artificial satellite launched into space.\n\nTell us how Sputnik ATX came about\n\nMy business partner, Oksana Malysheva, and I founded ATX in 2017 after we had managed a fund together.\n\nWe were looking for ways to improve our returns and be more impactful. In our research, we discovered a massive gap with early-stage financing that would give entrepreneurs the tools needed to grow their businesses and then follow-on funding to scale and grow quickly.\n\nWe founded Sputnik ATX so that we could do that. We joke that we teach nerds how to sell, so if they have a minimum viable product (MVP) and a customer and are looking to try and figure out how to grow their startup, we teach them how to grow and build a big company.\n\nWhat does VC investment mean to Sputnik ATX?\n\nDr. Oksana Malysheva, Managing Partner, Sputnik ATX\n\nWe are early-stage investors, and to us, VC investment is the ability to help very brilliant, gritty, hardworking, humble people get access to capital at an early stage to accelerate their company\u2019s growth.\n\nWe also help them by giving them business skills, particularly in sales and marketing, so that they can refine their product and grow their business in a sustainable way that would help them to produce an amazing company.\n\nEvery VC has an eye or eyes in specific markets. Tell us what market(s) Sputnik ATX is interested in and why?\n\nWe\u2019re not necessarily interested in specific markets but in people who have a big impact. So, for example, we talk about this thing called consumer surplus \u2014 an economic term that refers to the difference between what you\u2019re willing to pay for something and what you pay for it.\n\nAnd when we see people who are generating lots of consumer surplus, it means they\u2019re generating lots of value in the market. And we want to help them to do just that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe name Sputnik comes from the first thing mankind launched into space \u2014 the Sputnik 1 satellite \u2014 and like Sputnik, we\u2019re looking for people who are doing big things.\n\nDoes that mean you invest more in founders than in startups?\n\nIt has to be both. There\u2019s this statement about whether you invest in the jockey or the horse, and we think that you invest in both because good jockeys and good horses work together.\n\nWe think that the best ideas are where you have a fantastic person with incredible technology that the world desperately needs.\n\nBy Sputnik ATX\u2019s standards, what shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nJoe Merrill, Partner, Sputnik ATX\n\nI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a wrong answer to that question. If you\u2019re a startup founder, you should be asking yourself if what you\u2019re doing is making the world a better place, and if it\u2019s making the world a better place, then the question is how much better.\n\nSome startups that make the world a better place may not generate many financial returns, and that\u2019s okay. There\u2019s nothing bad about that.\n\nBut as venture investors, we have a responsibility to get a return for our investors. So while those are worthy businesses, the economics don\u2019t work for venture capital.\n\nWe have to invest in companies that are making an impact where additional money and resources can go a long way in building the business and generating a return for the investors, the founders, and ultimately something really great for the customers using the service or product.\n\nWhat is your average ticket size?\n\nWe start small by giving them a $100,000 cheque, and we have an option to increase that to $500,000, but we would continue to invest in companies as they grow. We have invested millions in some of the companies in our portfolio.\n\nWe\u2019re just getting started. Right now, we\u2019re raising a $100 million follow-on fund, and we have raised over half of the money. We plan to continue to write cheques worth $5 million to $10 million for companies as they continue to grow.\n\nIs there any other African startup in your portfolio other than CribMD?\n\nCribMD is probably the second. The first was Vybe Software, and even though Vybe was based in the United States, like CribMD, most of their customers were in Africa. Vybe has an app called Leia that enables people to launch a website.\n\nIt is free, but for 99 cents a month, you can upgrade and get a much nicer package. It uses artificial intelligence to build completely unique, beautiful websites for anyone.\n\nThat company did really well in Nigeria. Lots of merchants were able to create little marketplaces where they could advertise their businesses online.\n\nHow does Sputnik ATX deal with bad investments?\n\nI hate saying bad investments because bad is kind of like this judgement where something is morally repugnant, and that\u2019s not the case. What happens is someone starts a company, and the company is generating insufficient financial returns to justify the investments, but that doesn\u2019t make them bad.\n\nIt just means that it didn\u2019t work out, and there are a couple of choices. Sometimes those companies can continue to operate because they\u2019re profitable; they\u2019re not just going to get very big.\n\nHowever, if they\u2019re losing money, and if they continue to lose money, you usually sit down with the founders, and you decide if it\u2019s a good time to shut the company down. If there\u2019s some value in the asset that another company would find valuable, you sell the asset to other companies because while you may not be able to do a lot with it, someone else might.\n\nI\u2019ll be frank, it\u2019s okay if a startup doesn\u2019t work; we expect that to happen. It\u2019s how you do it that matters. If you realise your company is not viable, you shut it down in an orderly way. What you do says a lot about the quality and the integrity of the founder.\n\nWhen founders shut things down properly, we love to invest in them because they acted with integrity.\n\nWhat industries are of most interest to Sputnik ATX?\n\nWe invest in anything that is not evil. We have a strict policy of not investing in evil. We have everything, including a company that makes nutritious doughnuts.\n\nEverybody likes doughnuts, but they\u2019re not good for your health. This was a bunch of American football players with such strict diets who worked tirelessly to figure out how to make nutritious yet delicious doughnuts.\n\nWe also have a company producing an engine that will replace the one in cars, and it\u2019s beautiful. This thing would single-handedly stop greenhouse gas emission, and Shell just announced that they are investing in that company.\n\nIt works, and in 20 years, we could all be using this product. So when we see companies with amazing technologies like these, we want to invest in them.\n\nWhat opportunities have Sputnik ATX regrettably passed on, and why?\n\nMy biggest regret is a company called FloatMe. It\u2019s in San Antonio, and we almost accepted them. We limit the number of companies that we can accept to between five and seven for each group. They were the company that just missed the cut.\n\nWe liked the founders, and we should have done it. The company has been very successful. I still love the founders. They\u2019re incredible, and I think the world of the company.\n\nIt\u2019s such an incredible service. It puts a little money into people\u2019s accounts when they are about to overdraft them. I wish we had invested, but it turns out they didn\u2019t need our money, and they\u2019ve done very well.\n\nThat\u2019s okay. I\u2019m just happy to see smart people do awesome things that help other people even if we don\u2019t get to invest.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nThey can go to sputnikatx.com. They can also find me on Twitter @Austin_VC. I get and accept DMs from people.\n\nMy business partner is @Oksana_ATX. You can read all about her on our website. I also have a blog where I write about business, economics, and startups because I\u2019m an economist and an entrepreneur.\n\nI talk about Nigeria ever so often on my blog. I love Nigeria.",

Terms and conditions apply.\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nPossible Twitter negotiations with the Nigerian government\n\nAndroid 12 beta 2 launch and Apple iOS 15\u2019s features\n\nTwitter reaches out to the Nigerian government for negotiations\n\nNigeria\u2019s online space has been abuzz since the government announced the suspension of microblogging and social media platform, Twitter on Friday, June 4, 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, according to Channels Television, Minister for Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, says Twitter has reached out to the government to negotiate. He made the statement on Wednesday, June 9, 2021, while addressing the State House correspondents after the Federal Executive Council meeting.\n\nThe Minister added that the suspension has been effective, saying Twitter has made significant losses since the ban.\n\nNothing from Twitter: However, the social media platform has kept mum about negotiating with the Nigerian government.\n\nBut the company, via its Public Policy account on June 5, 2021, said that the platform would \u201cwork to restore access for all those in Nigeria who rely on Twitter to communicate and connect with the world.\u201d\n\nAsk Malami? When Mohammed was questioned about the section of the law that prosecutes Nigerians who continue to use Twitter, he referred journalists to the country\u2019s Attorney General, Abubakar Malami\u2019s comment.\n\nTwitter should pay tax too: The Minister discussed the Federal Government\u2019s move to ensure social media and over-the-top (OTT) platforms \u2014 WhatsApp, Facebook, Netflix, et al. \u2014 are registered in the country and pay tax for the billions they earn.\n\n\u201cQuiz 1: How many topics did we discuss in the first edition? Mention two.\u201d\n\nOn a non-Twitter related note, Apple has announced the new features coming to its new iOS 15.\n\nThe announcement was made during Apple\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). The event, dedicated to software, is held annually to showcase new features coming to operating systems across Apple\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nThis year\u2019s edition kicked off Monday, June 7, and will end Friday, June 11, 2021.\n\nFaceTime, a feature known to be exclusive to iOS devices, will now work outside the ecosystem; it will include options to share screens like video conferencing platform, Zoom. The new operating system will continue Apple\u2019s App Tracking Transparency feature that started with the previous upgrade.\n\nAnother interesting feature coming to the new iOS is Live Text. The iPhone camera will now be able to recognise text within an image. So, texts \u2014 phone numbers, words, symbols \u2014 in an image can be copied and saved.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this before: While this feature is new to iOS, it bears a close resemblance to Google Lens on Android devices, which can translate and save text from an image using the camera. However, whatever upgrades Apple has introduced to this feature will be ascertained when the operating system launches officially.\n\nThere\u2019s more on Apple\u2019s WWDC here.\n\n\u201cQuiz 2: If you noticed, Emmanuel and Oluwanifemi did something different with previous Thursday editions. What was the first topic in this trend?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of Android, Google has released the second beta version of its latest operating system, Android 12. Launched Wednesday, June 9, 2021, the second version will come with more of the features promised at the Google I/O event in May.\n\nPer TechCrunch, Google will bring more beta testers on board with the Android 12 beta 2 release. They will be testing out features like the new privacy dashboard, Quick Setting toggle, and Internet Panels that make switching between Internet providers easy.\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading\n\nHow to install the developer beta of iOS 15. Read.\n\nWhat Should You Send a VC Before Your Meeting? Read.\n\nHave a beautiful day.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s President Muhammadu Buhari says his administration would be decisive in dealing with terrorist hoodlums causing unrest in the country, in an interview on Thursday with Arise TV, his first since he was re-elected in 2019.\n\nPresident Buhari spoke on a wide range of issues bordering on infrastructural development, appointments, insecurity, farmers/herders clashes, etc.\n\nHere are five takeaways from the interview\n\nInsecurity\n\nThe President said his administration had decided to tackle the worsening security situation in Nigeria headlong, adding that after changing the head of security agencies he had given them a directive, especially to the police, to be ruthless with anyone or group causing unrest in any part of the country.\n\nThe President said the security situation, especially in the North, had become a serious concern as the people of the region were suffering a lot of casualties, stressing that though there had been significant progress in the Zamfara State, where foreigners carrying out illegal mining activities had been expelled.\n\nHe dismissed the secessionist agitations of Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and other groups, saying that security forces had been instructed to use force against them.\n\nBuilding infrastructure to Niger Republic\n\nPresident Buhari justified the continued building of roads, railways and other infrastructure projects to connect the country to Niger Republic, noting that Niger Republic and other neighbouring countries were crucial to the country\u2019s fight against terrorism and insurgency.\n\nThe President said there was the need for an access road between Nigeria and Niger, especially now that country had discovered crude oil, stressing that the move had also become necessary so that the country could serve as a transit route for the products rather than Niger using other neighbouring countries\u2019 routes.\n\nBan on open grazing/efforts to end farmers/herders clashes\n\nAccording to the President, record shows that Nigeria had grazing routes for herders in the First Republic, which were equipped with infrastructure, while herders with animals that grazed on people\u2019s farms were fined or their animals confiscated.\n\nHe said the solution to the constant farmers and herders clashes in the country was the resuscitating of the cattle grazing routes across Nigeria, which would further make herders better managed, accountable and taxable.\n\nHe lamented that the country had been invaded by foreign herdsmen from the West African region, adding that his administration was on top of the situation.\n\nOn complaints of lopsided appointments\n\nThe President defended his appointments, saying that all the appointments he made were strictly based on merit and not based on ethnic or regional balance.\n\nHe cited the case of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NPPC), noting that most top position holders rose through the ranks, had put in years of service to earn their positions.\n\nHe said there were several Igbos in Nigeria\u2019s civil service, adding that the Igbos must compete with qualified Nigerians from other regions for positions, as it was impossible to bypass qualified individuals to favour them.\n\nOn Nigeria losing foreign investments\n\nBuhari said the spate of insecurity had adversely affected the flow of foreign direct investments to Nigeria in recent time, saying it had become increasingly difficult to attract investors to Nigeria with the spate of insecurity plaguing the country.\n\nThe President advised the youths to shun violence and maintain peace, stressing that the recent EndSARS protests across the country had further complicated the security situation and affected investors\u2019 confidence in Nigeria.",

          "text": "Against early forecasts that COVID-19 infection and mortality rates in Africa might spell mind-boggling catastrophe, the pandemic on the continent remains a puzzle that Africa Centre for Disease Control (ACDC) has not yet found answers.\n\nDespite over 4.8 million infections, largely believed to be an underestimation of the scale of exposure to the virus, the mortality rate still does not represent a picture of the predicted devastation for the continent, John Nkengasong, director, ACDC, said speaking at the 2021 Mo Ibrahim Forum.\n\nSerologic surveys conducted in some African countries such as Nigeria for instance show that at least 20 percent of the population in Lagos has been exposed, yet deaths barely over 2,000 country-wide and 130,000 in Africa.\n\nThis is unlike India where the virus surprised the country and the devastation has been very visible. So, there is a paradox or puzzle between the last number of people that are potentially infected and the relatively low rate of mortality.\n\nHowever, the director fears that the pandemic will begin to normalise deaths as more comparisons are made with the rest of the world.\n\nRead Also: FG okays N895.5bn supplementary budget for military, COVID-19\n\n\u201cHere I am referring to 130,000 people as if they were 130 people. No. When Ebola hit West Africa and within two years, about 12,000 people died, we said never again. And here we are four or five years later with a raging pandemic that has claimed so much more in Africa,\u201d he said, raising fresh concerns over vaccine shortage on the continent.\n\nThe persisting shortage of vaccines in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa at a time when hospitals in some Western countries are being relieved of COVID-19 cases took the centre stage as African leaders deliberated on health systems strengthening at the forum.\n\nThe conference, which saw a review of governments\u2019 responses to the pandemic, gave a renewed push to tackling the challenge of health inequalities amplified by vaccine shortage.\n\nNkengasong again urged countries with surplus doses to offer them for redistribution at speed and scale, saying \u201cAfrica will definitely move towards the endemicity of this virus on the continent, and that does not bode well for our collective global health security.\u201d\n\nOver the last week, the continent has seen an average increase of 14 percent in case, according to Africa CDC. Some countries are tilting slowly towards the third wave and others are battling to level the second wave.\n\nIt is also likely that in the next coming months, some countries that have gone through the third wave will begin to edge towards the third wave, the director said, noting that the public health measures in place had helped and avoided the devastation earlier predicted.\n\nMaking the case for vaccine equity, Tedros Ghebreyesus, director-general, World Health Organisation, said although Africa had not yet seen the same scale of devastation from the COVID-19 pandemic as some parts of the world.\n\nSo far, Africa has administered just over 31 million COVID-19 vaccines doses or 2 percent of the global total, he stated, noting that the final solution will be to build health capacities, not only for COVID-19 vaccines but for other vaccines.\n\n\u201cAfrica has not escaped COVID-19 and we cannot let down our guard. What has happened in many other parts of the world can also happen in Africa.\n\n\u201cWHO is working to bring immediate solutions for equitable vaccine distribution. But it is clear that Africa cannot rely solely on imported vaccines from the rest of the world,\u201d Ghebreyesus said.",

          "title": "Scrapping of NYSC: Scapegoating Only Aggravates Our Woes \u2013 Nigerian Observer",
          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nIt\u2019s longer news that the corporate existence of Nigeria is threatened by the unabating attacks of insurrectionists, bandits, terrorists and the aberration of unknown gunmen. Due to the helplessness of the government to curb this ugly and incessant attacks on the precious lives and property of the citizens, Nigerians are taking recourse to their primordial ethnic cocoons which decimates the Nigerian state to the threshold of near collapse.\n\nThe security conundrum has put everyone in danger. The activities of these anti-state actors have imperiled farmers, traders, students, political leaders, travelers and ofcourse corps members who are entrusted with the patriotic mandate of rendering selfless service to the motherland.\n\nConcerned Nigerians are asking what the way out of the quagmire could be. It is this existential question that has birthed a precipitous bill seeking to scrap National Youth Service Corps (NYSC). Sponsored by Awayi Abiante from Rivers State, the bill has now reached the second reading at the Green Chamber. This bill has brought NYSC to the stead to be a whipping boy for our insecurity as lawmakers debate it relevance to the nation after 48 years of existence.\n\nHon. Awaji-Inombek Abiante in the explanatory memorandum of the proposal, listed various reasons why the NYSC should be scrapped.One of the reasons, according to Abiante, is due to incessant killing of innocent corps members in some parts of the country due to banditry, religious extremism and ethnic violence.\n\nHon Abiante also gave economic exploitation of Corpers by private agencies as another reason for his bill seeking the discontinuation of the scheme as they \u201care no longer recruiting able and qualified Nigerian youths, thus relying heavily on the availability of corps members who have not been well remunerated and get relieved with impunity at the end of their service year without any hope of being gainfully employed.\u201d\n\nApart from serving in their various places of primary assignment, corps members are often deployed for key assignments such as working as ad hoc electoral staff during elections which he also explains endangers the safety of corps members since elections in Nigeria are most times volatile.\n\nIt is worthy to note that since the inception of nysc itself in 1973 the program has been trailed by waves of protest . Just so you know that the scheme has always been a bone of contention right from the day it\u2019s decree was promulgated in 1973. In the words of the scheme\u2019s founder, Gen. Yakubu Gowon \u201cthe establishment of the scheme was followed by a protest throughout the length and breadth of the country\u201d\n\nThe administration of Gen. Gowon established the NYSC with the promulgation of Decree No 24 of May 22, 1973, the objective was to ensure that Nigeria remained an indivisible entity that would be focused on sustainable development and four decades later the scheme can do better but it\u2019s relevance to the socio economic fabrics of Nigeria can be attested to by well meaning and patriotic citizens of Nigeria though not devoid of challenges.\n\nIt was the same General Yakubu Gowon who launched the famous 3Rs which are reconstruction, rehabilitation, reconciliation in order to galvanize the wartorned Nigeria after the devastating civil war the giant of Africa was plunged into between 1967 to 1970 and he found young graduates as one of the veritable tools of nation building. Reconstruction, rehabilitation and reconciliation should be seen as an ongoing efforts of nation building just as government is a continuous process.\n\nThe NYSC posts Corps members to cities or villages and states far from home and states of origin, where they are expected to mix with people of other tribes, social and family backgrounds where they could learn the culture of the indigenes in the place they are posted. This of course fosters mutual understanding of the country\u2019s diverse cultures and national cohesion. What if there was no NYSC?\n\nNYSC should be seen as a work in progress. The government should strengthen the scheme to ensure it meets the current socio-economic reality of our country but scrapping it because of insecurity is like a farmer throwing away his hoe because he\u2019s unable to use it. The problem is not the hoe but the farmer\u2019s inability to use it.\n\nNigeria is one of the most terrorized countries in the world and no society can thrive in an atmosphere of severe insecurity like the one in Nigeria. Government must live up to it\u2019s primary responsibility of providing security of lives and property to citizens. This is the least citizens can ever ask of any government.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSinafi Omanga is a serving corps member with the Nigerian Observer.\n\nEmail: benomanga01@gmail.com\n\n...",

          "text": "ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Nigerian government is counting on Standard Chartered Plc for funding as it moves on with the ambition to develop two key rail lines in the country\u2019s south, a departure from its original resolve to source the loan from a syndicate of lenders based in China.\n\nIt is now in the midst of negotiation with the British multinational bank, which focuses on providing financing to African, Asian and Middle East markets, with a view to funding an upgrade of a narrow-gauge track in the South-East and the building of a standard-gauge on the coast, both projects estimated at $14.4 billion, Minister of Transportation Rotimi Amaechi told Bloomberg in an interview.\n\nThe railway infrastructure will be constructed by China Civil Engineering Construction Corp (CCECC), which has entered pact with the government.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve moved away from China in some of our projects,\u201d the minister said on Saturday in Abuja, and added during his discussion with Bloomberg that Zainab Ahmed, his counterpart in the finance ministry, would lead Nigeria\u2019s talks with Standard Chartered.\n\nChoosing not to borrow from China could be a ploy by the government to cut Nigeria\u2019s exposure to the country, which stood at $3.4 billion as of the end of March, going by the figures issued by the debt office on Wednesday.\n\nNigeria spent about 12.6 per cent or $195.5 million of the entire money it used to service its external debt last year to pay part of its debt to China.\n\nMr Amaechi\u2019s spokesperson did not respond to phone calls by PREMIUM TIMES, requesting comment.\n\nStandard Chartered commenced operation in Nigeria 22 years ago, and midwifed the inflow of investments in the sum of $2.5 billion into Africa\u2019s largest economy in 2020 alone of the total $9.7 billion, the biggest by any bank, Bloomberg said Thursday, citing data from the statistics office.\n\nMr Amaechi had in March said at the groundbreaking of the CCECC\u2019s revamp of the Eastern Line connecting Port Harcourt to Maiduguri that a consortium of Chinese financiers would support the project.\n\nState-owned CCECC inked a deal valued at $11.2 billion with Nigeria in 2014 for the building of the Coastal Line that would link Lagos with Calabar in the South-South.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari disclosed in 2017 China\u2019s Export-Import Bank would soon endorse a $3.5 billion facility to help tee off the development of the standard-gauge line, spanning 1,400 kilometres, planned to be constructed in segments.",

          "text": "Apex Yoruba sociopolitical group, Afenifere, has berated President Muhammadu Buhari over the comments he made during his interview with Arise TV, noting that the president only takes delight in ridiculing Igbo people, and is un-presidential in his utterances.\n\nAfenifere in a statement by its Secretary General, Chief Sola Ebiseni, pointed out that Buhari now regards every Igbo person as IPOB, which according to it, is very unbecoming of a president.\n\n\u201dThe President takes delight in ridiculing the Ndigbo which he used IPOB to represent,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cThus, to him, the Igbo and their territory is just a dot in a circle of the map of Nigeria, which even if the secede could exit to nowhere since the elders and youths of the South-South had assured him of not being part of the secessionist agenda.\n\n\u201cHe couldn\u2019t have been reacting to the IPOB but the Igbo who he said had businesses everywhere.\n\n\u201cHis utterances were very unpresidential and in the mode of common expressions with some unidentifiable northern organisations.\n\nAfenifere described the president as a tribalist who holds the rest of Nigeria in contempt, noting that his interview is full of of lies and inconsistencies.\n\n\u201cFirst, his arranged interview on Arise Television is not a substitute for the clamour of Nigerians that the President, as the father of the Federation, should speak to Nigerians in this critical times.\n\n\u201cSecondly, his engagement was full of lies, inconsistencies, contradictions and utter disrespect for the ethnic nationalities including their elected governors.\n\n\u201cHe is pathetically unschooled in the constitution which he often claims to guide him in spite of its manifest flaws.\n\nOn the lopsided appointment in the Armed forces, the group said \u201dthe President\u2019s claim that his appointment in the armed forces is based on merit and seniority and not to satisfy geopolitical zones, is a violation of the letters and intendment of the provisions of sections 217-220 dealing with the Armed Forces of the federation and appointments thereto.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, Section 217 (3) provides that the composition of the officer corps and other ranks of the armed forces of the federation shall reflect the Federal character of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn Section 219, all the powers given the President including the appointment of Service Chiefs, is subject to the Act of the National Assembly ensuring the reflection of the Federal character.\n\n\u201dEven his latest appointment of the Chief of Army Staff, is flawed particularly on seniority. The constitution never contemplates nor approve of the situation under Buhari where 90% of the commanding heights of the armed forces and security architecture will be from only northern Nigeria and only the two zones of North East and North West.\n\n\u201dIn any case, anyone familiar with the history of Buhari leadership will appreciate that he is the only Nigerian leader, even among military Heads of state, whose government government, himself, second in command as Chief of staff Supreme headquarters (Idiagbon) and top echelon were all northerners. It was after his death that many Nigerians knew Idiagbon was Fulani of Ilorin.\n\nOn the governors, the group said that \u201dthe President owned up to the statements of Garba Shehu, his most uninformed spokesman, that the ban on open grazing by the Governors was illegal and he could not make a new statement that would contradict him.\n\n\u201cHe is delighted that Governors are Chief Security Officers without any security powers, yet he asked two of the South West Governors to exercise a non-existent powers to deal with terrorists herdsmen who he acknowledged bear arms, even as foreigners , against Nigerian citizens.\n\n\u201cIt is pitiful that our President has no solution rather than the braggadocio of re-opening grazing routes in states by repossessing such lands for his beloved herdsmen.\n\n\u201dLet the President be told that the Yoruba people are solidly behind our Governors that not an inch of land in our territory will be carved out for any grazing reserves or cattle Colony.\u201d",

          "title": "Why we are honouring Daily Times icons \u2013 Fidelis Anosike",
          "text": "Dr. Fidelis Anosike, Chief Executive Officer of Folio Holdings, publishers of the Daily Times Newspaper, has lined up activities to honour heroes of the newspaper, as part of activities designed to mark its 100-year anniversary.\n\nIn this interview, Anosike, an astute media entrepreneur who founded Folio Communications at 24, the company that went on to acquire Daily Times in 2004, explores his journey into the media industry, as well as speaks about the activities he is lining up to honour former MDs and editors of Nigeria\u2019s oldest surviving newspaper.\n\nExcerpts:\n\nYou have come a long way. You set up Folio Communications at 24. How did it all start?\n\nI will say that I started life rather early. I got into the university drawing portraits, so I am a graphic and creative artist. I graduated from the University of Benin. I still tell people that the creative industry is not just my passion, it is my job. I also did loads of self-development. I got enrolled at Harvard Business School Owner President Management course (OPM 39). So, to that extent I am a Harvard alumnus, and being at Harvard made me understand how to businesses properly.\n\nYes, at 24, I established Folio Communications, which went on to acquire Daily Times of Nigeria, the oldest surviving newspaper and noteworthy media organization in Nigeria. Since then, I have been trying to see the much I can do with the resources available to me, both access to capital and knowledge, to expand the frontiers. Besides the media, I also have investments in other areas such as water resources and renewable energy, and I am also financing some global companies on major research on mobility and renewable energy space.\n\nOn how I was able to set up a company at 24, I think it\u2019s important for us as human beings to pray for God to give us consciousness. You can get consciousness at 10, you can get consciousness at 30, you can get consciousness at 70. If you pray for the grace of God, you can get consciousness early. I think I was lucky to get consciousness early and importantly, an opportunity. So, how did I set up Folio? There is an uncle of mine who worked with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). He introduced me to the Head of Communication at the bank, a certain Mr. Bolarinwa of blessed memory, and one Mr. Amobi. They allowed me to enter for CBN creative jobs. At that time, if they want to make a Christmas or Eid cards, or something like that, they would make the bid open and whoever wins; that is if, they pick your design, you will be commissioned to do the work. I won on three occasions, and the price for each was N14,500. With that, I was able to get my office, and went on to create an ecosystem of my friends that studied graphics with me. Whenever a company needed design services, we all made design submissions and as fate often had it, one of us always won. Together we won on many occasions and got contracts from institutions like First Bank, NNPC and CBN.\n\nThat was how I was able to build up capital to go into the communication business. I created a standard for myself and my friends and became a relationship manager for them because they were all on paid jobs. Whoever made a design that was successful shared the proceeds with others. It was a case of all for one and one for all. We designed, restructured and produced all the diaries of NNPC for two years running through open and competitive bid process. We introduced Nigerian idioms into those diaries rather than white labeled ones from FT and so on, which gave it local content. This is because we felt that we should promote our own country. I am full Nigerian. I am proud of my ethnicity as an Igbo man, but this is Nigeria, our country. None of us chose to be here, but we are here all the same, and we must make our country work.\n\nWhen exactly was Folio Communications established?\n\nThat was in 1991. In 2004, Daily Times was put up for sale. Before then, they had tried to sell the shares through public offer via the stock exchange. But it failed, so BPE resorted to Core Investor Sale which refers to a situation where whoever buys it, takes full management control. Folio Communications was already a thriving communication company, and so felt that we needed a media voice and had to create a media company. Long before then, I was already involved in some creative work for ThisDay, and that was how I met Chief Dele Momodu. I had a lot of background knowledge. I reasoned that if I had to make my dream known, I needed a media voice. Therefore, I entered the bid as the singular company involved, others were consultants and consortiums. We were pre-qualified, and made a deposit of $10,000 and put in our technical bid. We were number one. We actually scored 81 per cent. The terrain was known to me. I learnt under Dele Momodu and Nduka Obaigbena; these are men who are far ahead of their time.\n\nI\u2019m sure that until Dele celebrated his 60th birthday, people may have thought he was 90, same as Nduka. They are my pillars, including Okagbue Aduba. About how I was able to understand Nigeria and how it works, I connected with their energy which was infectious. At that point I already had $1 million for the bid bond. This is a security for your integrity, and so no bank will lend you money for a bid bond. You can only finance it with equity. It is money you lose if at the end of the day, you did not pay the bid price. Daily Times Bid Bond then was N100 million. Like I said, they had tried selling it via shares, hoping that people will buy and someone will acquire the majority share, but nobody came in. This was because the media industry in Nigeria is not bankable; it has not been restructured so it doesn\u2019t have capital flowing into it. We bid and attracted N1.25 billion into the media industry as far back as 2004. Our first bid was, I think N327 million. Our competitor, bid N800million in their first bid. That was N500 million above us. But we knew the bid was in two rounds. Our second-round bid was N1.25 billion, while our competitor\u2019s second round bid was N1.05 billion, so we won.\n\nWhen we bought and took over Daily Times, its liability was N1.9 billion. The assets were N2.3 billion. The enterprise value was N700 million or slightly above that. We bought Daily Times at almost twice the price the government was hoping to get. It is on record, and I was about 35 years old then. Nobody would have given an \u2018Igbo boy\u2019 a chance to buy Daily Times. I am a testimony that things can work in Nigeria if you believe. I had no godfather, only by faith and audacity of hope.\n\nThe Folio Media Group (FMG) has come a long way. Today, it has access to the technology space and we are also doing consolidated media offering to clients. the Folio Investment and Trading Company (FITC) is an investment company focused on media, creative and cultural industry investment and innovation. We also have as part of the group, Folio Media and Creative Academy (FMCA), which is working in tandem with relevant authorities to train journalists and creative industry practitioners. The aim is to train 50,000 in those key fields in five years.\n\nDoes the Creative African eXchange perform the same function?\n\nNo, that is Folio Media and creative Academy. The Creative African eXchange (CAX.caxafrica.com) is part of the Folio Media Group. It is part of the initiative we are trying to use to consolidate the continental space of the creative and cultural industry.\n\nCan you shed more light on 1st October and Miss Nigeria as offshoots of Folio Media Group?\n\n1st October Limited is a publishing company that we set up in 2007 to publish the birth of Nigeria. It has evolved overtime because we have done over 10 different publications on Nigeria and state governments. It also went ahead, in 2014, to give birth to a global public perception movement for Nigeria called \u2018Nigeria, Our Heritage.\u2019 This was launched at the Kennedy Centre, and it was the first ever African event at the Kennedy Centre, Washington DC on the sideline of Obama African heads of Government meeting. What we are trying to do with 1st October and Nigeria, Our Heritage, is to see how we can transition the love of Nigerians to love of Nigeria. We saw a gap there in terms of country branding. We want to create a platform that will enable us to use Nigerians, specially those in the Diaspora, to drive the love for country. This is important because at the end of the day, other countries spend millions of dollars in country branding. Even the United States spends up to $240 million annually to brand their country. You see, once you are in Europe as a Nigerian, you take a 30 per cent cut. If Aliko Dangote walks into an office in New York, and says he is a Nigerian, he takes a 30 per cent minus. That is huge! That\u2019s one of the reasons our national development is stunted; because our brand, the brand Nigeria, has so much deteriorated. There are many reasons: political instability, military government of thirty plus years, advanced fee fraud, imperialistic gang up and many more. So you can see the reason it has happened over the years.\n\nSo we as Nigerians, we doing what we can to change this for the future because people only do business with those they can trust. Without that trust, we cannot have foreign direct investment coming to Nigeria. You can have $10 billion like in Lagos State, and you are happy, but you could have $100 billion. You can begin to see how that affects national security, the issue of banditry and so on. The problem is image. Nobody wants to do business with anybody that is dirty. If you wear dirty clothes, you become non attractive. There are options; people can sit down in New York and put their money in Scottish windows or savings accounts and make returns. But if you want people to come from China or America, you must present yourself in a way that will make them to fly in first before realising that there are challenges. Of course, there are challenges everywhere. Afghanistan is probably receiving more investment than Nigeria even as they are beset by terrorism. So it is a matter of how you package yourself as a country. Nigerians must help to improve the whole because when the whole collapses, the part, which may be fantastic, will automatically collapse. That is what 1st October is doing. It is a big project. We just recently partnered with the Nigeria Diaspora Commission, and in October, we will start an immersion programme, which is going to bring 100 young Nigerians from all the Ivy League schools in the Diaspora to Nigeria. We will train them on issues of national development and deploy them to about 100 companies, and expose them to what Nigerians are doing right. We know that a lot of things are going wrong, but let\u2019s amplify the right ones and let\u2019s also inculcate this into the young people. So, it is going to be a deliberate effort to raise 1000 people young people that can become advocates for the country. This is what 1st October is all about. This is a positive national development platform.\n\nWe have also remodeled Miss Nigeria to become more than just beauty pageant. It\u2019s more of female empowerment platform. It was founded in 1957. It gave life to all other pageants in Nigeria. Our very first Miss Nigeria is still alive at 86, Chief Mrs Grace Oyelude. We shall also institute a commemorative lecture in her honour as a DTN icon. Every Miss Nigeria is an ambassador of the Green Girl Company, with projects like Green Dignity Kit (GDK) and Green Girl Academy, among others. Nigeria is our country, nobody chose it; it chose us and we have to make it work. We must not use all the energy we have to think of how to break the country. What is happening today is a consequence of long-time inaction; of doing the wrong things, and not having ideas for doing the right thing. Most of the governors were busy building airports they don\u2019t need, but neglected the primary schools that are supposed to train people that would shape the future. They neglected education, and dwelt on less important things. So when you lose empathy, you start approaching things from the middle. That explains why conspiracy theory comes in.\n\nWhat attracted you to the Daily Times and what has been your experience running the company?\n\nDaily Times has huge pedigree. The company was created by Adeyemo Alakija and the London Mirror Group. It went on to have Dr. Ernest Ikoli, Alhaji Babatunde Jose, Amb. Dele Cole, Aremu Segun Osoba, Chief Tunji Oseni, Prince Tony Momoh, Dr. Yemi Ogunbiyi, Chief Innocent Oparadike, Dr. Onyema Ugochukwu, Chief Sam Amuka Pemu among others. The Daily Times was the biggest mouthpiece in the country. At one time, Alhaji Jose was asked if he would run for president, and he said he was already chairman of Daily Times. That was how big the Daily Times was. It was indeed the fourth estate of the realm. Because I did appreciate the enormity of what I took upon my shoulder when I took it over, the commercial problems arising from property didn\u2019t weigh me down. I am not a property person, the only personal property I own in Abuja was bought with my money. No government or minister can claim to have given me any land.\n\nWhen we took over Daily Times, there were about 400 staff in the company. Money from the government was not coming anymore, so we had to restructure. We had to downsize, and fought with the union for two years. During the fight, the business was closed down. Then Hallmark Bank, which loaned us the money, took over the company. We didn\u2019t recover the company through legal means until September 2007. So, I acquired the company in 2004, it was hijacked by Hallmark Bank. Everyone was interested in the assets, but no one was thinking about the liabilities. We had to go to court. There was this man, Mr Adrian Wood, one time CEO at MTN who joined us at Folio Communications. His mandate was to revive Daily Times, and put it on the same pedestal as the New York Times. He employed people from all walks of life; both Nigerians and other Africans to make it a model. We knew that without a dominant and strong media organization in Nigeria, the issues of national development will fail. That is why in America, they have Fox, CNN, etc., based on their ideological beliefs, and tied to politics.\n\nWithout a strong media, there will be fragmentation, and that explains why the masses don\u2019t have a voice. We wanted to make Daily Times what it used to be. Thereafter, all sorts of people started taking us to court. All these people came from third parties because Folio acquired Daily Times alone. In the typical Nigerian context, everything is contentious, not to talk of when you acquire a national asset. We adapted to many things in the course of all these.\n\nWe have continued to push. The first Times Heroes Awards [email protected] in 2017 was massively supported. We interacted with many governors in the process. See what Nyesom Wike of Rivers State is doing today. We are proud of him. We saw the character the man brought with him to the office from day one, and gave him an award. We gave award to people like Yahaya Bello of Kogi State. You know, sometimes you have to encourage people with potential or you lose them.\n\nWhy did you retain the name Daily Times after acquiring it? Is it because of its influence?\n\nNo, it is not because of the influence. Daily Times owns the largest archives. It is 95 years now, and will be 100 years in five years. How many media companies in Nigeria are 100 years old? Daily Times is beyond a newspaper company. It was here before Nigeria. It created the Nigeria Stock Exchange. It has produced two or three state governors. It is a national development company.\n\nDaily Times will mark 100 years in five years. You have lined up events to mark the anniversary. Can you tell us about that?\n\nYes, in the run up to our 100 anniversary, we have created an event to celebrate icons of Daily Times \u2013 our heroes; Times Heroes. The first one that we have designed is for Ambassador Dele Cole. We are hoping to do these in their states of origin. Ambassador Cole\u2019s event will be held in Port Harcourt. It will be a two-day event. On day one, we are going to train about 500 journalists in the area. On day two, there will be a proper Lecture where the likes of Dr. Mrs Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Dr Adewunmi Adeshina and other distinguished scholars and technocrats of Nigerian origin will be invited as Keynote Speakers. There is nothing like making impact in your home state. We have lined up about 15 of our former heroes. The first one will be in Rivers State because that is where Amb. Cole comes from. We don\u2019t want to keep celebrating people when they are dead; we want to celebrate them while they are alive, and learn something from them. We will talk about national development and the role the media play.\n\nIn Nigeria, we let out heroes die without transferring knowledge. We need to have teach History in Nigeria because if you don\u2019t know where you are coming from, you won\u2019t know where you are going. We must return history to our schools. And that is what we are doing at Folio Communications. It is important therefore, that we get this first one right.\n\nSecondly, we are developing a book, which Dr. Onyema Ugochukwu will co edit with Chief Tunji Okegbola, DTN Librarian of over 40 years, to be launched at our 100-year celebration. Amb. Dele Cole proved himself to be an epitome of politics without bitterness, media game changer and diplomat per excellence. He created the legacy of The Guardian and revived the legacy of Daily Times, and when the government was becoming overbearing, he created a new legacy at The Guardian.\n\nWe are also planning for the First Onyema Ugochukwu\u2019s lecture, which will hold on 9th November, 2021. We will celebrate Ernest Ikoli, the first ever indigenous and founding editor of the Daily Times. We are also looking at celebrating Allahaji Babatunde Jose, Aremu Segun Osoba, Dr Yemi Ogunbiyi, Chief Sam Amuka-Pemu, Mrs Grace Oyelude \u2013 first miss Nigeria, Prince Tony Momoh, among others. Our goal between now and the next five years, is to institute a minimum of 10 lectures. Each of them will be in respective home state of the icon, most of them and their governors have accepted. Indeed, they are all excited about it. We will send a letter to Governor Wike believing he will be gracious enough to accept and host the 1st Amb Patrick Dele Cole lecture.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s president, Muhammadu Buhari, has said that the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), has businesses everywhere, adding that his government had mobilised and would continue to mobilise the military and the police to go after them.\n\nBuhari who spoke in in a pre-recorded interview on Arise News Television, categorized all Igbo People as IPOB members, noting that despite having businesses everywhere, nobody is disturbing the group.\n\nHe said some leaders of the South South, had approached him to say they have no business with IPOB, which according to him, means that they will be encircled.\n\n\u201cIPOB is just like a dot in a circle and they have nowhere to turn to. They are spread everywhere and they have investments and properties everywhere and in other areas,\u201d Buhari said.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t know what they are doing. How we will handle them is to mobilise the police and the military to go after them. I\u2019m happy that some South-South leaders came to me and said they have nothing to do with IPOB, so they will be encircled\u201d\n\nBuhari also contradicted himself while trying to defend his administration\u2019s nepotism and lopsided appointments.\n\nSpeaking on the general perception that his administration had concentrated appointments in the North than Southern Nigeria, the president said \u201cYou better get the list of our civil servants if you think there are no people from the South East. There are people from the South East, but they know they have to go through the mill.\u201d\n\nOn the failure of his administration to adequately include people from the South East and the entire southern region in his government, especially into security services and Ministries Departments and Agencies (MDAs), he said: \u201cPeople who have been there for 18 years\u2026they trained in Zaria or in Abeokuta, they climbed through the ranks and because they found [themselves] under all the circumstances, the crisis and everything, and they gradually rise to that status and you think [I will] just pick somebody just to balance up? These positions have to be earned. There are people who have been there for 10-15 years.\u201d\n\nHe added that geographical balance should not be the basis for appointing security chiefs.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t join, you\u2019re not forced to join, but when you join, you go through the rigmarole\u2026and you learn by the system,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the massive retirement of major generals from the army over their subordinate as Chief of Army Staff, he said: \u201cDo you know where he (Major General Farouk Yahaya) was serving before he became the Chief of Army Staff? You can\u2019t just pick somebody because he is wearing seniority (sic). You will put somebody who has suffered with the soldiers, they know him, he fought with them and so on. I tell you the truth, on individual basis, I have forgotten some of these chaps, I don\u2019t know them.\u201d\n\nAsked if years of operational experience did not matter in appointing the service chiefs, Buhari said \u201cIt is, [but] for the soldiers to be effectively led, it must be somebody they know\u2026\u201d\n\nThe president also defended his government\u2019s decision to spend $1.9 billion on a rail project to the Niger Republic, saying he has family members there.\n\nAccording to him, his government\u2019s decision to build rail lines from Kano to the country was to allow his Nigerien relatives easily have access to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI have cousins, family members, etc., in Niger Republic. I shouldn\u2019t just cut them off,\u201d Mr Buhari said.\n\nHe also cited transportation of oil from the neighbouring country to Nigeria and job creation as other reasons for constructing the rail line.",
          "summary": "Nigeria\u2019s president, Muhammadu Buhari, has said that the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), has businesses everywhere, adding that his government had mobilised and would continue to mobilise the military and the police to go after them.\nBuhari who spoke in in a pre-recorded interview on Arise News Television, categorized all Igbo People as IPOB members, noting that despite having businesses everywhere, nobody is disturbing the group.\nHe said some leaders of the South South, had approached him to say they have no business with IPOB, which according to him, means that they will be encircled.\n\u201cIPOB is just like a dot in a circle and they have nowhere to turn to.\nThey are spread everywhere and they have investments and properties everywhere and in other areas,\u201d Buhari said.",

(SFH), a Chinese-Italian joint venture based in Chongqing, which mainly produces diesel engines and exports its products to Europe via China-Europe freight trains, saw the best business performance since it was founded in 2007, according to Federico Gaiazzi, general manager of the company, who added that the result was unexpected given that trade was seriously plagued by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nChina-Europe freight trains can help SFH save more than ten days of transport time compared with sea transportation, and have brought more profits to the company, said Gaiazzi.\n\nAs COVID-19 lock-downs have sharpened \u201cforeign appetite\u201d for China\u2019s manufactured goods from electronics to home appliances, and a wave of demand in Europe stoked a sharp rise in transcontinental rail freight, many Chinese manufacturers have shifted from sea transport to safe, stable, and smooth China-Europe freight trains due to shipping delays and skyrocketing shipping prices, according to an article publish on the website of the Financial Times.\n\nSince the outbreak of the COVID-19, the role of China-Europe freight trains in promoting mutual benefits and win-win cooperation has been further demonstrated to the world.

          "title": "NUJ Condemns Attack On Journalists By DSS, Police In Abuja",
          "text": "The Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Abuja Council, on Thursday condemned the attack on a chief correspondent with the PUNCH Newspapers, Friday Olokor by a combined team of security operatives from the Department of State Services and Police, describing it as reprehensible.\n\nThe security officials also harassed a reporter from the LEADERSHIP Media Group, Patience Ivie-Ihejirika.\n\nThe chairman, FCT council of the NUJ, Emmanuel Ogbeche, in a statement, frowned at \u201cthe low-life conduct of the officers and personnel in question.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cThe NUJ FCT finds it reprehensible and frowns at the low-life conduct of the officers and personnel in question.\n\n\u201cThe idea that any policeman and SSS operative will lay their hands on any journalist as is the unfortunate case of Friday Olokor speaks to why Nigeria ranks poorly in the Freedom Index.\n\n\u201cThe NUJ will pursue this matter and hopes that those found wanting in this despicable act are brought to book.\n\n\u201cIt seems there is now a state policy targeting the media and journalists in this country. There is the urgency for all well-meaning Nigerians to not only condemn this travesty, but an assault on the right to freedom of expression and of the media.\u201d\n\nThe DSS operatives had seized Mrs Ivie-Ihejirika\u2019s telephone and deleted some vital videos to be sure that she did not record the scene of the assault on Olokor.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA police officer at the scene had threatened to beat her up if she did not surrender her phone for checks.\n\nAlso Olokor was on Thursday beaten and handcuffed by a combined team of officials of the DSS and Police at the popular M & M Events Centre, beside NICON Luxury Hotel where he went to attend the coverage of the ongoing African Women Conference organised by the dRPC under the Ford Foundation.\n\nOlokor said he ran into trouble when he introduced himself as a journalist.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe were invited to cover a panel of discussion at the ongoing African Council of Women Conference with the theme: \u201cFactors and Driver of Gender-Based Violence in Nigeria\u201d,\n\norganised by the dRPC, under the Ford Foundation.\n\n\u201cI drove to the venue, M & M Events Centre, Abuja, close to NICON Luxury in Central Business District. After introducing myself, the MOPOL stopped me at the gate and said I should get entrance tag. I told him I can only get the tag from the people who invited me and can\u2019t get it unless I drove in. Still, he refused. I had to call Patience Ihejirika of LEADERSHIP Newspapers who came, gave me my tag.\n\n\u201cYet, the police officer was complaining that we journalists are the problem of Nigeria. I turned and asked him why do security agencies hate journalists. He started abusing me and said if not he was on uniform, he would have taught me a big lesson. He said, \u2018Look, I don\u2019t fear journalists.\u2019 Seeing him, you can tell he\u2019s frustrated. He said I wasn\u2019t going to enter. I told him tomknow that since I\u2019ve been cleared, I have to go in because the event has started. He stopped me from entering while I insisted on going inside.\n\n\u201cIt was at that time that the DSS operatives pounced on me, tore my shirts. One of them tried severally to clear me from the ground but I kept jumping like a smart monkey.\n\n\u201cThe DSS operatives were joined by the police officers and they were all armed.

          "text": "An anti-violence Non-Governmental Organization, Coalition for Peaceful Co-Existence (CPC-E), has appealed to the National Security Adviser (NSA), Major-General Babagana Monguno (Rtd), to revisit the disbandment order placed on the National Taskforce on the Prohibition of Illegal Importation/Smuggling of Arms, Ammunition, Light Weapons, Chemical Weapons and Pipeline Vandalism (NATFORCE).\n\nThe appeal, according to the leader of the Coalition, Rev. Josiah Haroun, to revisit the matter is with a view to reversing the clampdown order placed on the security organisation to give room for proper steps that would be democratic and in conformity with the law of the land.\n\nThe Coalition, in a signed statement said, the outrage occasioned by the NSA\u2019s order was borne out of the peoples observations that, \u201cthe order contravene some rules of law and democratic ethos,\u201d admonishing that, \u201cin a civilised clime like ours, things are expected to be done in line with democratic norms and democratic principles.\u201d\n\nThe NGO was reacting to the declaration that the NATFORCE is an illegal security outfit by the National Security Adviser (NSA), Major-General Monguno (Rtd), an action the coalition view as \u201chasty, pre-emptive and undemocratic.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Oduduwa Republic: Agitators To Protest June 12 \u2014 Daily Times Nigeria\n\nThe statement reads further: \u201cit appears undemocratic and hasty because it is in the public domain that the National Assembly, the two legislative houses of the land are already in possession of a Bill on the matter for deliberation. The deliberation has reached the second reading stage. One expects that the office of the NSA should exercise patience till the end of the legislative efforts before striking. The action, against this background, to us, is pre-emptive, hasty and undemocratic.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, the action, which came after a court of competent jurisdiction has given the outfit a clean slate of health by declaring it legal, appears against the rule of law. It is expected that, the action should not have come before the vacation of the court verdict said to have been given since 2013.\n\n\u201cWe should quickly add at this juncture that, the Coalition has no vested interest in the NATFORCE floated by Dr. Baba Mohammed beside the general national interest on how the country would be secure, our concern is the setback the clamp down on it could cause for the fight against insecurity in the land.\n\n\u201cIn addition, the almost 300, 000 youth it would clear off the streets and the labour market through employment is of great satisfaction to us. And the retention of that population on the streets and in the labour market when the outfit is banned from operation is also, equally of great concern to us.\u201d\n\nIn conclusion, the Coalition suggested that, such an outfit and others like it should be supported and assisted to contribute their quotas to augment the efforts of the authorities in the fight against all forms of security challenges in the country, asserting that, doing so with patriotic zeal would be of great relief to all and sundry.",

Mfa Mdooyonga Solomon of the St Augustine Parish, Makurdi in Benue State has gifted an old woman a house in return for her past widow\u2019s mite generosity.\n\nSolomon was attacked by bandits on 5 October 2020 in his parish with his house stripped of all valuables.\n\nHis phones, laptop, ATM cards, clothes, shoes, an undisclosed amount of money all were taken away.\n\nThe old woman heard his travail and decided to offer some succour, in the best way she could afford.\n\nShe went to the parish and gave Solomon six eggs, in sympathy.\n\nDays after, the Rev. Fr. decided to return the visit of his \u2018benefactor\u2019.\n\nHe found the woman living in a shack and was possibly shocked that she could have such a heart of gold despite her condition.\n\nHe decided to repay the woman in her own coin. He launched a crowdfunding for her and used the proceeds to build a bungalow for the woman.\n\nThe incredible story, which has gone viral on Twitter was related on Twitter Thursday by Duke of Benue @Collins Uma\n\n\u201cRobbers attacked Rev Fr Solomon Mfa (St Augustine Parish, Makurdi). This old lady brought him 6 eggs to sympathise with him. He went to visit her and saw where she was living. Then he crowd-funded and built her this house. She moved in 2 days ago.\n\nThis is Love\u201d, The Duke of Benue tweeted.\n\nBy 10p.m.the story had drawn over 2,500 retweets and over 7000 likes, just eight hours after it was posted.\n\nHere are some comments by Nigerians:\n\nApril @Candybliss 95:\n\nShe gave out of nothing.\n\nMoral of the story:\n\n1. No one is too poor to give.\n\n2. God Loves a cheerful giver. He sees the heart and will always reward\u2026\n\n3. There\u2019s no sowing without reaping.

          "title": "Insecurity: Nigeria faces looming food crisis \u2013 El-Rufai",
          "text": "Governor Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna state has urged security agencies to engage in interagency synergy and collaboration to address the spate of insecurity in Nigeria, if the country is to avoid a looming food crisis.\n\nSpeaking while declaring open the 2021 quarterly meeting of the Directors of the State Commands of the Directorate of State Security (DSS) in the Northwest on Thursday in Kaduna, el-Rufai said, if Nigeria was to avoid food crisis, finding immediate and enduring solution to the spate of kidnapping, banditry, killings, herders-farmers clashes is key, to enable farmers return to their farms in the advent of the rains.\n\nAccording to the governor, there is immense security challenges across the Northwest states, which have led to devastation of rural economy, displacement of farmers from their communities, loss of lives and properties and travel challenge.\n\n\u201cAddressing this grave problem and restoring order require that security managers and intelligence agencies constantly share information and experiences. These criminals operate across state lines. Therefore, tackling them requires cooperation and collaboration by the various states. Any plan that seeks to address the problem only in one state will at best yield a temporary respite as the criminals retreat to safe havens.\n\n\u201cThis is an urgent priority, in the face of the looming food crisis that we face if our farmers do not go to the farms. The rains are here, but farmers in various communities are unable to go to their farms, that is when they are lucky not to have fled their remote villages under pressure and attacks from the criminals. This cannot be allowed to continue.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe security agencies need to strengthen intelligence gathering, to establish not just the identities, plans and locations of these criminals, but to actively disrupt their capacity to organise and mount attacks on our citizens. It is also very important to ensure that prompt and coordinated action becomes the default response of the Armed Forces and the Police to the profusion of actionable intelligence that is already available from the DSS,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking on how the criminals gained this much ground, el-Rufai said, \u201cthe governors of the Northwest states and Niger state as far back as 2015 came together to fund simultaneous operations by the federal military and security agencies across the largely ungoverned Kamuku-Kuyambana forest swathes that straddle about seven of our states up to Dajin Rugu in Katsina state.\n\n\u201cThese operations disrupted the cattle rustling gangs but were unfortunately not sustained as a continuous exercise to dominate these spaces and assert within them the authority of the Nigerian state. That the criminal gangs have become more daring and dangerous since recovering from their near defeat in 2015 is obvious across the country.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs the lead agency for domestic intelligence and counterintelligence, the Department of State Services has a vital role to play in providing the reliable information needed by the Police and Armed Forces and other security agencies for the total defeat of these dangerous insurgents,\u201d el-Rufai said.\n\nThe Kaduna state Director of State Service, Alhaji Idris Koya said the quarterly \u201cmeeting was originated by the Director General, State Service, Alhaji Yusuf Magaji Bichi to enable the State Directors regularly come together and brainstorm on the changing spate of insecurity bedeviling the Northwest, exchange ideas and proffer possible solutions that would aid in containing contemporary threats, effectively efficiently and with minimum cost.\n\n\u201cThe region is currently confronted by security threats of kidnapping, armed banditry, insurgency, Farmers/herders conflicts, arms trafficking and several other contemporary security issues that require concerted effort to address, including the pivotal input of the respective state governments.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe current efforts by the state government to establish a drone centre for intelligence gathering and support of other security operations is highly commendable and it is our hope that it will come into service soon as it will be a game changer in tackling security challenges not only in Kaduna state but the Northwest and even Northcentral zones.\u201d\n\nThe Kaduna state Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Mr Samuel Aruwan, said criminals, bandits and terrorists are collaborating to a devastating effect on the people of the state, noting that if there had been more robust collaboration among the security agencies, several serious attacks would have been prevented.",

At about 2:30 p.m. the rain and wind became heavier just as the IGP was being introduced.\n\nAs soon as the National Anthem was over the rain increased in intensity while the raging wind pulled down canopies covering both journalists and senior police officers.\n\nBoth the police and journalists scampered for safety.\n\nAt that point the IGP and AIG Zone Two Lagos, Johnson Kokumor, as well as AIG Force CID Galandi, CP Odumosu, and other senior officers rushed out \u2013 and then the canopy collapsed.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria, NAN, reports that the IGP arrived at the Command at about 1:40 p.m. and was only able to take the National Anthem before the downpour started.\n\nThe wind blew up all the canopies erected. This development forced the IGP and other senior officers to run to the conference room while others and journalists sought safety in available.\n\nThe IGP on arrival in Lagos at 10:00 a.m., had visited Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu at the Lagos House, Marina, and the Oba of Lagos before coming to the command headquarters at about 1.40 p.m.\n\nOn arrival at the command, he met briefly with some senior officers at the conference room before coming to address other senior officers, including Area commanders, DPOs, squadron commanders before the rain started.\n\nIGP Baba later briefed the press, where he pointed out the areas that needed to be improved on by his men.\n\nHe listed them to include: crowd control, which he said should be done by policemen according to the norms of discharging their responsibilities.\n\n\u201cThere is the need to also control the use of arms. Officers should lecture their men that once they are assigned rifles, there is a time and reason for their use. You need to guard them and use them responsibly.\n\n\u201cWe must also be civil in discharging our responsibilities. Never should we allow our stations to be overrun to the extent that we will not be able to handle situations because of cowardice or lack of professionalism,\u201d he said.\n\nThe police chief added that his mission in Lagos was to familiarise himself with and address officers of the Command on how the Nigeria Police will be administered under his leadership.\n\nBaba said that there was also the need to talk to police officers that they had a duty to perform which should be done while some things were taken cognisance of.\n\n\u201cIt is good to remind ourselves of the enormous task of policing in a democratic system.\n\n\u201cWe have not got all we need to discharge our duties in terms of welfare, logistics, and equipment. But with the available limited resources, we will do our jobs with more dedication and professionalism.\n\n\u201cI want to congratulate us that the government and the people are taking cognisance of our duty.\n\n\u201cWe have the support of every Nigerian like never before and it has become obvious that we are neccessary in maintaining equilibrium,\u201d he said.\n\nThe IGP also urged senior Police officers to motivate their men through rewards and sanctions.\n\nAccording to him, rewards will motivate the men while sanctions will serve as deterrent to others.\n\nThe police boss said the Police was beginning to witness increase in its personnel, improvement in logistics and welfare and that recruitment was ongoing.\n\nHe added that the police was also taking delivery of some tools from the Police Trust Fund and that the request of the Lagos Commissioner of Police, CP Hakeem Odumosu, for equipment was noted.\n\nBaba added that the police authorities would focus on training and retraining of policemen so that they would be able to discharge their duties with professionalism.\n\n\u201cWe need to restore our professional calling by way of discharging our responsibilities through technology based practices and go by the enabling laws,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the police was also working toward the rehabilitation and the reconstruction of barracks and effective housing scheme project which would serve as retirement homes for officers after service.\n\nHakeem Odumosu, the commissioner of Police in Lagos, CP said that Lagos State had been calm and relatively peaceful as crimes and criminality had been suppressed.\n\nHe stressed that the command was able to arrest 2,228 suspects connected with offences ranging from armed robbery, cultism, murder, hooliganism, and defilement/rape in the state.\n\nHe said, \u201c87 arms and 129 ammunition of various calibres were recovered. In addition, 36 stolen vehicles were recovered by the command within the period under review.\u201d\n\nOdumosu solicited the assistance of the IGP in the rehabilitation of Police facilities that were burnt during the #EndSARS protests.\n\nHe stressed that the damaged facilities had affected the operations of the Command in tackling crime.\n\n\u201cWe lost six personnel. 16 Police stations and 13 Police posts were set ablase then.

          "text": "*As Senate donates truckload of items worth N10m\n\nSenate President, Dr. Ahmad Lawan has appealed to Nigerians in leadership positions to always show empathy to the Internally Displaced Persons, IDPs in the country by ensuring that their lives and dignity are protected.\n\nLawan, who spoke yesterday when he led a delegation of senators to the Wasa IDP camp in southern Abuja to commemorate the 2nd year anniversary of the Ninth Assembly, said the planned visit was a conscious and collective decision of the upper legislative chamber.\n\nThe Senate delegation during the visit donated food items and other materials worth N10 million to the IDPs.\n\nLawan said: \u201cThis is an Internally Displaced Persons Camp. None of our sisters and brothers in this camp wanted to be here or wish to be here.\n\n\u201cAll of them are forced to be in an IDP camp, and those of use especially in leadership positions are supposed to show empathy and commitment in ensuring that while there our compatriots are in this camp and, indeed, any other camp, their life and dignity is protected.\n\n\u201c(And) of course, I\u2019d like to mention here that we must ensure that these Nigerians who are in this camp and other refugee camps, who are vulnerable in so many ways, receive what is due to them from the government.\n\n\u201cThat is to say, there must be sufficient security presence here and, indeed, across the country to protect them.\n\n\u201c(But) they also need the government to do what is right. We are supposed to as a government provide some livelihood here. We must be able to give them something to eat, and we should do so responsibly.\n\n\u201cWhen I use the word responsibly, I mean not to throw away a few things and leave them to eke a living, because it is going to be impossible for these people here to eke any meaningful living on their own.\n\n\u201cThis is a price we have to pay because of the security situation we have found ourselves in. Food alone is not enough.\n\n\u201cSo, we will take particular interest in the health facilities available to this camp and, indeed, others.\n\n\u201cWe would like to know the details of how and when they fall sick from a major sickness that would go beyond the capacity of primary health care \u2013 that requires a secondary health care intervention.\n\n\u201cWe have a national policy on refugees and people in camps like these, how are we up-to-date with the implementation of the provisions of that national policy? It may sound too hard, but they are necessary questions and we owe these people.\u201d\n\nThe Senate President added that the amendment to the Electoral Act by the National Assembly seeks to provide an electoral climate that would enable Nigerians to elect their leaders and representatives.\n\nHe explained further that the review of the Constitution by the Ninth Assembly is aimed at ensuring that governance is improved in the country.\n\nAccording to him, this can be realized through the provision of a legal framework that would provide for good governance at all levels of government.\n\nLawan disclosed that the National Assembly has been working closely with the executive arm of government to provide more resources to the armed forces and security agencies in the fight against insecurity.\n\nHe gave the assurances of the National Assembly to expedite action on the request when received, so as to ensure the return of internally displaced persons to their respective communities across the country.",

          "text": "Onicha Ugbo indigene, Eze Asia has disowned a purported voice conversation with Azuka Jebose on Idumuje Ugboko crisis.\n\nSpeaking from Turkey where he resides, Asia dismissed the voice notes in circulation by Azuka as fake and labeled him serial blackmailer\n\nBelow is a recorded voice message along with transcript of Asia\u2018s rejoinder disclaiming any audio chat with Azuka.\n\n\u201cThe recorded voice sent to social media and everywhere, I was not the one who recorded it. Azuka Jebose did it, because the first time I traveled down here (Turkey) was after three days he called me on phone.\n\n\u201cHe was asking me some certain things \u2013 how they went to Ugboko; how they killed somebody from Kogi or something like that; asking me how somebody died in swimming pool; asking how they killed Onicha Ugbo people and I was there. I replied him. I said Azuka, you are a very useless man. How do you think they will kill an Onicha Ugbo man when I am working with Hon. Prince Ned Nwoko and I will keep quite?\n\n\u201cBut he said that they said Ned always sends us. I said you said they said, is he a military man? And that if people are telling you things concerning Ned and you are writing it and you did not verify, you are wasting your time; that everybody is aware; that you are asking me that during the time of Ugboko crisis we mobilised our men to go there and destroy. I said Azuka, bros, it\u2019s like you want enough insult\u2026you are a useless man. During the time of the crisis at Ugboko, I was in the hospital, lying down in the hospital.\n\n\u201cThis young man you are asking me that we should blackmail and let\u2019s plan together and write against him, that if not for this man I would have been a dead man by now. If Ned did not spend money on me during the time I was lying down at the hospital, he spent nothing less than N5million\u2026concerning my leg issue.\n\n\u201cYou are asking me now to give you information. Somebody in the hospital, can I fly in the hospital to come tell you what happened in Ugboko; am I (a) witch? If something happened in Ugboko, I was not aware. The way they told you was the way I heard it. Before you write against somebody you have to verify well. Like the way you are Azuka Jebose, somebody will come and meet me because I am from Onitcha Ugbo, because I know you, I should come and tell them bad things about you; what will I tell them?\n\n\u201cOkay you want me to start telling you things about Ned, like what you said that you want to nail Ned. You want to destroy his political career; that you want to do many things. Has Ned ever one day called me to go and kill somebody? Ned cannot send me to go and kill somebody\u2026 I am not a thug and he is not using me as a thug.\n\n\u201cThis young man you are accusing, if not because of Ned I wouldn\u2019t have been here (Turkey) today. He was the one who assisted me with money to leave the country. So what do you want me to tell you about him? You were asking me that somebody died in the swimming pool and how can I be from Onicha Ugbo and such thing happened.\n\n\u201cI said thank God you said I am from Onicha Ugbo and you now feel that I am from Onicha Ugbo and they will kill my own brother in my presence and I will keep quiet; that you are a stupid man. You were asking me about Prince Nonso. I told him, stop putting mouth in things that do not concern you. Nonso and Ned are brothers. The day two of them will settle none of you will be there. Steer clear of a matter you don\u2019t know. I have no business in Ugboko because I am not from Ugboko.\n\n\u201cYou were asking me how did they kill somebody; I was not aware because I was at the hospital. Those people telling you what to write still go and meet them to tell you what to write. By the way, how did you get my number? You were telling me to forget about that one that we should work.\n\n\u201cWhat work?. Working together to blackmail my boss, a man who saved my life; a man who has spent a lot of money on me? That if not for the man Ned Nwoko I would have been a dead man by now. If not for Ned I would not have travelled out. How many youths from Onitcha Ugbo did you help? You said you are a big man, how does it affect me?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know you to start with. I only hear about your name. I don\u2019t know you and I don\u2019t want to know you. So stop telling me that I should come and write against my boss. Because I did not accept what you told me, the next thing, you moved to go and manipulate my name to write against me with my voice. But anything you are doing, God is watching you. God will bear witness\n\n\u201cI will be the last person in this life, this world, that will fight against Ned. Ned has never one day treated me bad. If not for the young man I wouldn\u2019t have been alive today. So you want to spoil my name. You want to destroy my life; you are destroying your life, not me.\n\n\u201cThe voice note you sent to people, I have received it. Thank you very much. But you will also remember that everybody has evidence. Everything you said about Ned was recorded. I reserved my comment for now, till then. May God keep us alive; but anybody planning evil for my life or against my family, evil will go back to that person. I never one day planned evil against anybody. If I have offended someone I will be the one to meet the person and say I am sorry. I work on my own; I don\u2019t look for trouble.\n\n\u201cTelling me I should come and write against my Oga, what am I going to tell you. Has he sent me one day to go and destroy? Has he told me to go and do something stupid? What am I going to tell you? A good man, a man of all people. Somebody who is trying to help the community. You are not from there. You are destroying their own community. Go back to your own town. That was what I told you.\n\nYou were asking me about Prince Nonso. Does he know me? The prince knows it was police who arrested him. You were asking me how did we carry prince. Who is the prince? Have I ever one day called Ugboko youths to come out? Have they ever seen me fighting in Ugboko? What am I going to write; something I know or something I don\u2019t know? I will never wish Ned Nwoko evil because he always wished me good luck.\u201d",

Freedom of expression and access to information both online and offline are foundational to prosperous and secure democratic societies,\u201d read a statement posted on the Department of State\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cWe support Nigeria as it works towards unity, peace, and prosperity.

You must be a corporate entity before you can do business in Nigeria,\u201d the minister said after the weekly cabinet meeting in Abuja.\n\n\u201cWhether it is Netflix, Iroko, or Facebook\u2026they are all doing business in Nigeria, making money and they are not paying taxes.

Despite the many challenges we are facing, I want Nigerians to rest assured that we will secure this country.\n\n\u2018\u2018We will secure our infrastructure, our highways, our communities, and our forests, and we will secure the lives of our people,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nREAD ALSO: Maritime Crimes: Buhari Inaugurates New Security Assets To Combat Piracy\n\nThe President told members of the Nigeria Police that as the government strives to improve their welfare and capacity, the citizens equally had expectations from them.\n\n\u2018\u2018First, let me commend the Inspector-General of Police and the entire Force for the recent efforts to restore peace to troubled parts of the country.\n\n\u2018\u2018I have charged the Inspector-General to leave no stone unturned in rebuilding the morale of his officers and men, especially in the aftermath of the mindless violence associated with the EndSARS protests, as well as the recent spate of attacks on Police Stations in some parts of the country,\u201d he said.\n\nCommending the Lagos Governor on the newly acquired security equipment and assets, the President noted that it would go a long way in boosting the morale of the Police, and further enhance their capacity to fight crime and combat criminality.\n\n\u2018\u2018This is even more touching in the light of the unwarranted violence that ensued in the wake of the ENDSARS protests last October, which saw the security architecture in Lagos State being severely damaged,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President added that it was commendable that Lagos State, the Centre of Excellence, has shown a truly resilient spirit, in the face of the massive destruction it suffered last October.\n\n\u2018\u2018You did not allow yourselves to be deterred by the severe setback; instead you have bounced back and are now boldly rebuilding the confidence of residents and investors in the State.\n\n\u2018\u2018I acknowledge the initiative taken to kick-start the rebuilding process, through the establishment of the Lagos State Rebuild Trust Fund, and through this very laudable effort by the Lagos State Security Trust Fund. I enjoin other State Governments to emulate your bold, proactive and resourceful initiative,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President also used the occasion to reiterate that the \u2018\u2018Federal Government takes very seriously our constitutional oath to secure the lives and properties of the Nigerian people, adding that his administration was conscious of the fact that lasting security is a necessary foundation for business, investment, and true prosperity.\n\nPresident Buhari declared that no Federal government since 1999 has been as committed as his administration in reforming and repositioning the Nigeria Police Force and national policing architecture.\n\n\u2018\u2018In 2019, I signed into law the Act establishing the Nigeria Police Trust Fund, the first in the history of the Force, to provide guaranteed funding to support Police welfare, logistics, and equipment.\n\n\u2018\u2018In September 2020, I assented to the Bill amending the Nigeria Police Act, which was originally enacted in 1943.\n\n\u2018\u2018This new Act, a vast improvement over the old one, among other things spells out the modalities for the implementation of a National Community Policing Scheme in Nigeria.\n\n\u2018\u2018This new scheme will build confidence within our local communities and make them active stakeholders in the safety and security of their environs.\n\n\u2018\u2018We are currently recruiting 10,000 new Police officers to reinforce our personnel capacity across the country. In addition to this, I have directed the National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission to carry out an upward review of Police salaries and benefits,\u2019\u2019 he said.",
