He was very skilful and technically gifted.\n\n\u201cFor his clubs, Ndoro Island FC and Asabatex FC, he played as attacking midfielder and often switched to central striking role with the same game. I don\u2019t have the exact stats but l believe that in about 23 or 24 outings for the Green Eagles he must have scored about 18 goals.\n\n\u201cA member of the Dire Dawa Eagles at the Ethiopia\u201976 Nations Cup, Thompson distinguished himself alongside other greats like Baba Otu Mohammed, Kunle Awesu, Emetiole Kelechi, Christian Chukwu, Joseph Effiong Eric(aka Erico), Muda Lawal, Sunny Oyarekhua and co. His absence from the Green Eagles v Tunisia in the second leg of the World Cup Qualification Game in Lagos was probably the one big reason Nigeria didn\u2019t make the World Cup in 1978.\n\nRead Also\n\n\u201cHis temperament and discipline were something young footballers could learn from. Great player, great guy. May the Lord grant him eternal rest.\u201d\n\nAccording to information gathered, Usiyan died, aged 65, at his Lamset Redonda beach home in California, United States.\n\nIn his brief spell he had with the national team, he played 24 times he averaged a goal per game.\n\nUsiyan came into national limelight the moment he came in as a dying minute substitute for the then Mid Western State intermediate team that beat Western State in Lagos in 1973.",

Similarly, Low-Density Plastic, LDP will be used for recyclable purposes. LDP such as pure water leather, shopping bags and water bottles etc.\n\n\u201cFor bio-degradable waste, we have two uses. One is the biggest that we are investing a lot of money on. We burn those materials to produce gas, gas helps us to turn to create steel, steel turns turbines while turbines provide electricity.\n\n\u201cOur hope is that by the end of next year, we will generate 10MegaWatts of electricity from the waste in Kano. And every year after that, depending on how the typology of waste changes, we should be able to generate 30 Megawatts and so we are hoping to generate 150MegaWatts in Kano in 5 years and more than what Kano requires. We are also considering generating 2 megawatts of solar to power street lights of Kano,\u201d he said.\n\nYakasai boasted that with the coming of the company within the last three months it succeeded in mitigating the state from perennial flooding and keeping the state clean.\n\n\u201cIt is a Public-Private Partnership, PPP. The partnership is for 20 years. We inherited the defunct Refuse Management and Sanitation Management Board, REMASAB.\n\n\u201cIt is a known fact that Kano is the dirtiest in the country but within a short period of time, Kano is wearing a new look.\n\n\u201cWe spent about eight weeks dredging all flashpoints of flooding in the state. With the intervention, no major case of flooding is recorded.\n\n\u201cWe inherited all staffs of the defunct REMASAB and double their salaries including the casual staffs. We have over 2,000 workforces. We have recruited 200 fresh graduates. We are targeting to employ over 5,000,\u201d Yakasai however stated.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Parroting the line of Nnamdi Kanu and IPOB, a proscribed terror organisation, they work to legitimise its cause to Western audiences.\n\n\u201cThis puts them in bad company. Controversial American lobbyists are paid hundreds of thousands of dollars annually to do the same, laundering IPOB\u2019s reputation in Washington DC.\n\n\u201cIPOB murders Nigerian citizens. They kill police officers and military personnel and set government property on fire. Now, they have amassed a substantial stockpile of weapons and bombs across the country.\n\n\u201cWere this group in a western country, you would not expect to hear Amnesty\u2019s full-throated defence of their actions. Instead, there would be silence or mealy-mouthed justification of western governments\u2019 action to check the spread of \u201cterrorism.\u201d\n\n\u201cDespite Amnesty\u2019s self-proclaimed mandate to impartially transcend borders, unfortunately in Nigeria, they play only domestic politics. The international NGO is being used as cover for the organisation\u2019s local leaders to pursue their self-interests. Regrettably, this is not uncommon in Africa.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing wrong with an activist stance; there are claims of neutrality, when all facts point to the opposite.\n\n\u201cAmnesty International has no legal right to exist in Nigeria. It must open a formal investigation into the personnel that occupy their Nigerian offices. They should reject the outrageously tendentious misinformation they receive and bring some semblance of due diligence to the sources they base their claims on. Currently, we see none.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian government will fight terrorism with all the means at its disposal. We will ignore Amnesty\u2019s rantings. Especially when it comes from an organisation that does not hold itself to the same standards it demands of others.\u201d\n\nAttempts to get the IPOB Spokesman, Emma Powerful and other officers to react proved abortive.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "After a mid-term performance review, President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday dismissed two ministers.\n\nOut are Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Sabo Nanono and Minister of Power Saleh Mamman.\n\nThe President redeployed Minister of Environment Muhammed Mahmood Abubakar, who replaces Nanono in Agriculture Ministry and Minister of State (Works and Housing) Abubakar Aliyu to take over from Mamman in the Power Ministry.\n\nMinisters were shocked when the announcement was made at the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting.\n\nSources told The Nation that the ministers were fired for poor performance and unfavourable security report on their activities.\n\nThe erstwhile Power minister missed the power generation target.\n\nHe failed to take it beyond where it was when he took over,\u201d a source explained.\n\nNanono, the former Agriculture Minister, was found to have reversed the gains made by the ministry between 2015 and 2019.\n\nUnknown to other ministers, President had informed the ministers of their impending exit from the cabinet before yesterday\u2019s FEC meeting and had wished them well in their future endavours.\n\nThe President also put other ministers on their toes by saying that \u201cthe few cabinet changes mark the beginning of a continuous process.\u201d\n\n\n\nSpeaking further on the changes, Spokesman Femi Adesina quoted the President as saying: \u201cOn Wednesday 21st August, 2019 the Federal Executive Council was sworn-in after a rigorous retreat to bring returning and new members up to speed on the accomplishments, challenges and lessons drawn from my first term in Office and to emphasise the nine priority areas of government for the second term.\n\n\u201cTwo years and some months into the second term, the tradition of subjecting our projects and programmes implementation to independent and critical self-review has taken firm roots through sector Reporting during Cabinet meetings and at Retreats.\n\n\u201cThese significant review steps have helped to identify and strengthen weak areas, close gaps, build cohesion and synergy in governance, manage the economy and improve the delivery of public good to Nigerians.\n\n\u201cI must commend this cabinet for demonstrating unparalleled resilience that helped the government to navigate the disruption to global systems and governance occasioned by the emergence of COVID-19 shortly after inauguration. The weekly Federal Executive Council meetings was not spared because the traditional mode was altered.\n\nRead Also: What you probably didn\u2019t know about two Ministers sacked by Buhari\n\n\u201cAs we are all aware, change is the only factor that is constant in every human endeavour and as this administration approaches its critical phase in the second term, I have found it essential to reinvigorate this cabinet in a manner that will deepen its capacity to consolidate legacy achievements.\n\n\u201cIn due course, substantive nominations will be made to fill the consequential vacancies in accordance with the requirements of the constitution.\n\n\u201cI have personally met with the departing members to thank them for their contributions to discussions in cabinet and the invaluable services rendered to the nation. Today, effectively marks their last participation in the Federal Executive Council deliberations and I wish them the best in all future endeavours.\n\n\u201cI wish to reiterate once more, that this process shall be continuous\u201d.\n\nIt was learnt that the President\u2019s decision was as a result of a comprehensive review of the performance of his ministers after two years.\n\nA top source, who spoke in confidence, said there was a reversal of gains made in the agriculture sector between 2015 and 2019.\n\nThe source said: \u201cOrdinarily, one of the closest political strategists to the President is Nanono, who was part of the defunct Congress for Progressives Change (CPC) merger talks with the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) and other parties that led to the emergence of the All Progressives Congress (APC). He is an insider in government.\n\n\u201cWith Nanono\u2019s sack, the President has demonstrated that there is no sacred cow in his cabinet. It was a removal which shocked cabinet members.\n\n\u201cBut the President looked at results in office than personal or political relationship, Reports available to the President indicated a reversal of some gains made between 2015 and 2019.\n\n\u201cMonday, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed confirmed that \u2018growth in Q2 2021 would have been much stronger had it not been for Agriculture recording slower growth at 1.30% due to several bottlenecks currently negatively affecting the sector.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe rising food prices nationwide, most especially in the North, was a setback for the administration which the President was not happy about. At a stage, the food price crisis was becoming unbearable for the poor in the North and the backlash on Buhari administration has caused discomfort for the President.\n\nThe former Minister initiated many programmes but which ended up on his table rather than in actual action. He came up with some of these ideas: mechanization hubs in 650 local governments to support the farming communities; the approval of a loan facility of $1.2 billion by the Federal Executive Council (FEC) to finance the mechanisation of agriculture in the country and the introduction of subsidy for farm inputs.\n\n\n\n\u201cFrom security reports on Nanono, age was a factor in slowing him down to do his job. And there was no synergy between him and his team. He was also alleged to be sliding towards politics more than his assignment.\u201d\n\nAlso, findings indicated that President Buhari was unhappy that the nation\u2019s power generation outlook was still between 4,000MW and 5,801.6MW contrary to the performance expectations from Sale.\n\nA source said: \u201cThe sacked Minister of Power had assured the nation of 11,000MW by 2022 before moving up to 25,000MW. In spite of the fact that he said the power generation targets will be in phases, there was nothing to show that the nation will attain its goal.\n\n\u201cMamman became a minister based on a strong recommendation that he could turn around the power sector. But the President reviewed his performance bond and discovered it was low.\n\n\u201cHe was not even catching up with the July 2019 agreement between the Federal Government and Siemens for the implementation of a roadmap to resolve the challenges in the power sector and possible expansion. So, in line with the last lap goals of the President, he had to leave the cabinet.\n\nAlso, security reports on Mamman\u2019s alleged \u201coverbearing control\u201d over agencies under his ministry accounted for his removal.\n\nIt was also alleged that his knowledge of the sector was poor such that he could not address some issues on Mambilla Hydroelectric Power Project.\n\nA top source added: \u201cThere was a case of interference by the former Minister in the internal affairs of the Rural Electrification Agency(REA) which led to the deployment of some directors, especially the then Director of Procurement, Bulus Maiyaki from the agency.\n\n\u201cAlthough REA is under the supervision of the Minister of State for Power, Goddy Jeddy Agba, he allegedly sidelined the junior minister to make the deployment.",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja. From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, sacked ministers of Agriculture, Mohammed Sabo Nanono and his power counterpart, Saleh Mamman, in a move aimed at weeding out weak link in the chain of development.\n\nSpecial Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, announced this, yesterday, to State House Correspondents, after the Federal Executive Council (FEC) presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nHe said Minister of Environment, Mohammed Abubakar, has been redeployed to the Ministry of Agriculture while Minister of State for Works, Abubakar Aliyu, takes over in the power ministry.\n\nHe said the exercise would continue to fill vacancies as prescribed in the constitution.\n\nThe presidential spokesman quoted Buhari as saying the changes were sequel to the \u201ctradition of subjecting our projects and programmes implementation to independent and critical self-review\u201d through sector reporting during Cabinet meetings and at retreats.\n\nHe added that \u201cthese significant review steps have helped to identify and strengthen weak areas, close gaps, build cohesion and synergy in governance, manage the economy and improve the delivery of public good to Nigerians.\u201d\n\nThe statement read in part: \u201cOn Wednesday 21st August, 2019 the current Federal Executive Council was sworn-in after a rigorous retreat to bring returning and new members up to speed on the accomplishments, challenges and lessons drawn from my first term in office and to emphasise the priority areas of government for the second term.\n\n\u201cTwo years and some months into the second term, the tradition of subjecting our projects and programmes implementation to independent and critical self-review has taken firm roots through sector reporting during cabinet meetings and at Retreats.\n\n\u201cThese significant review steps have helped to identify and strengthen weak areas, close gaps, build cohesion and synergy in governance, manage the economy and improve the delivery of public good to Nigerians.\n\n\u201cI must commend this cabinet for demonstrating unparalleled resilience that helped the government to navigate the disruption to global systems and governance occasioned by the emergence of COVID-19 shortly after inauguration. The weekly Federal Executive Council meetings was not spared because the traditional mode was altered.\n\n\u201cAs we are all aware, change is the only factor that is constant in every human endeavour and as this administration approaches its critical phase in the second term, I have found it essential to reinvigorate this cabinet in a manner that will deepen its capacity to consolidate legacy achievements.\u201d\n\nOn Monday the All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN) had faulted the sacked Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development for neglecting key stakeholders at the just-concluded Feed Nigeria Summit (FNS) in Abuja.\n\nAssistant Publicity Secretary of AFAN, Salisu Mukhtar, in a statement had also criticised the ministry for organising such an important event in the height of a rainy season without a National Agricultural Policy to replace the defunct Agricultural Promotion Policy (APP) launched in 2015.\n\nAccording to him, the Ministry excluded many key stakeholders in the food system value chains such as AFAN, National Agricultural Seeds Council (NASC), National Agency for Food, Drug, Administration and Control (NAFDAC) and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for its good work in the agriculture space at the event.\n\nNanono had come under criticism when a leaked memo dated December 10, 2020, with Ref. No. FMA/PROC/AHS/SIP/2020/7742/1, signed by Musa Musa, deputy director of procurement in ministry on behalf of the minister, approved N30 million for the construction of a mosque awarded to El-Shukhur Multi-Buz Nig. Ltd.\n\nThe mosque, he said, was for livestock farmers displaced by Boko Haram insurgents in Borno State.\n\nMeanwhile, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has said the sack cannot cover failures of the administration.\n\nThe opposition party, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said the president and the All Progressives Congress (APC) should know that Nigerians were not swayed by the sack of the two ministers.\n\nIt noted that Nigerians \u201care eagerly awaiting the exit of the Buhari Presidency and the APC come May 29, 2023, as there is no hope in sight under their purview.\u201d\n\nBesides, the PDP added that it \u201cis also investigating the real reason behind their sack given Mr. President\u2019s public approach to fighting corruption by \u2018easing out\u2019 the culprits.\n\n\u201cThe party however asserts that the manifest inefficiency of the Buhari administration is a product of President Buhari\u2019s myopic and divisive approach to governance as well as the impunity and corruption deeply embedded in his administration and party, the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\n\u201cThe PDP posits that even if the best hands are recruited, they will be contaminated by incompetence, impunity, disregard to rules, divisiveness and corruption that have become the hallmark of the APC and its administration.\u201d\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "\u2022Redeploys two others\n\n\u2022Abubakar replaces Nanono, Aliyu replaces Mamman\n\n\u2022Says changes part of his government\u2019s \u2018tradition of subjecting projects and programmes implementation to independent, critical self-review\u2019\n\n\u2022Don\u2019t use sacked ministers as cover up for your failure, PDP tells president\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha in Abuja and Peter Uzoho in Lagos\n\nFor the first time in the over six years old administration of President Muhammadu Buhari, a minor cabinet reshuffle was effected yesterday, with two ministers losing their jobs and two others redeployed.\n\nThose sacked were Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Mohammed Sabo Nanono, and Minister of Power, Saleh Mamman.\n\nMinister of Environment, Mohammed Abubakar, was redeployed to Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, while Minister of State for Works and Housing, Abubakar Aliyu, was elevated to Minister of Power.\n\nIt was the first midstream cabinet reorganisation by Buhari since the inception of his government in 2015.\n\nThe president said the changes were part of his administration\u2019s strategy of independent self-review.\n\nBut the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) described the president\u2019s sack of the two ministers as an attempt to mask his failure in office.\n\nBuhari broke the news of the cabinet reshuffle at the weekly virtual Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting at the State House, Abuja. He hinted that more ministers would be shown the way out in an urgent need to reinvigorate his cabinet.\n\nSpecial Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, who read the president\u2019s statement to newsmen after the FEC meeting, quoted Buhari as saying that the cabinet rearrangement was part of measures to identify and strengthen weak areas, close gaps, build cohesion and synergy in governance, manage the economy, and improve the delivery of public good to Nigerians\n\nAdesina also revealed that the president would fill the two vacant ministerial positions soon after confirmation of substantive nominees to be sent to the Senate in line with the provisions of the 1999 Constitution, as amended.\n\nThe president\u2019s statement read, \u201cOn Wednesday 21 August 2019 the current FEC was sworn-in after a rigorous retreat to bring returning and new members up to speed on the accomplishments, challenges and lessons drawn from my first term in office and to emphasise the nine priority areas of government for the second term.\n\n\u201cTwo years and some months into the second term, the tradition of subjecting our projects and programmes implementation to independent and critical self-review has taken firm roots through sector reporting during cabinet meetings and at retreats.\n\n\u201cThese significant review steps have helped to identify and strengthen weak areas, close gaps, build cohesion and synergy in governance, manage the economy and improve the delivery of public good to Nigerians.\u201d\n\nIt added, \u201cI must commend this cabinet for demonstrating unparalleled resilience that helped the government to navigate the disruption to global systems and governance occasioned by the emergence of COVID-19 shortly after inauguration. The weekly FEC meetings were not spared because the traditional mode was altered.\n\n\u201cAs we are all aware, change is the only factor that is constant in every human endeavour and as this administration approaches its critical phase in the second term, I have found it essential to reinvigorate this cabinet in a manner that will deepen its capacity to consolidate legacy achievements.\u201d\n\nThe president pointed out that he had personally met with the sacked ministers to thank them for their contributions to discussions in cabinet as well as the invaluable services they rendered to the nation.\n\nHe stated, \u201cToday, effectively marks their last participation in the FEC deliberations and I wish them the best in all future endeavours.\n\n\u201cFinally, I wish to reiterate once more, that this process shall be continuous.\u201d\n\nHowever, reacting to the president\u2019s decision to sack the two ministers, some operators in the power and agriculture sectors said both men added no value to the respective sectors they were overseeing.\n\nNational Coordinator, All Nigerian Electricity Consumers Protection Forum, Mr. Adeola Samuel-Ilori, told THISDAY, with regard to Mamman\u2019s sack, that consumers were indifferent to his discharge because they never felt his impact throughout his time in the saddle.\n\nSamuel-Ilori said there was hardly anything that portrayed him as being in-charge of the power ministry. He alleged that Mamman was merely interested in protecting some interests in the sector.\n\nSamuel-Ilori alleged, \u201cThe consumers\u2019 feeling cannot be different, we are indifferent, and you know why, while the man held sway, there was no feeling of his presence in that office. There was nothing he did that showed that he was in charge of the ministry or that he was overseeing either TCN or NERC and every other person. So, I don\u2019t see any reason why the consumers should feel anything about his absence.\n\n\u201cIf you go back to how the man emerged, it would tell you that the man came for a purpose and I\u2019m sure that the purpose must have been fulfilled.\u201d\n\nAn operator, who pleaded to remain anonymous, also alleged that the sacked power minister never added value to the sector.\n\nThe operator said about Mamman, \u201cHe was just a stumbling block in the system. The president told him to set up a board for the Transmission Commission of Nigeria, but he was just foot-dragging. Also he wasn\u2019t willing to support Siemens and he kept foot-dragging as well.\n\n\u201cWe hold regular meetings with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) on the power sector, where we always have top officials of the central bank, but he hardly attended.\n\n\u201cWe also met with the Minister of Finance and officials of the Debt Management Office, but he was hardly in attendance. All our challenges, he is not the one resolving them, it is either the CBN Governor or Minister of Finance.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, commenting on the sack of Nanono, an operator in the agriculture sector said he was never fit for the role. The source also preferred to remain anonymous.\n\nThe source also noted the recent stockpiling of some agricultural produce by the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development under Nanono, which contributed to inflationary pressure in the country.\n\nNanono had awarded contracts to some organisations to mop up some commodities, including maize, sorghum and rice and the move led to increase in the price of maize and rice. The arrangement, which was termed, \u201cEmergency Procurement\u201d, had contradicted efforts by policymakers in the country to tame inflation.\n\nPDP Tackles Buhari on Ministers\u2019 Sack\n\nMeanwhile, PDP described the sack of ministers as an attempt to cover the president\u2019s failure in office.\n\nIn a statement by the PDP national publicity secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, the party said it was investigating the real reason behind the ministers\u2019 sack given the president\u2019s public approach to fighting corruption by \u201ceasing out\u201d the culprits.\n\nPDP asserted that the inefficiency of the Buhari administration was a product of his myopic and divisive approach to governance as well as the impunity and corruption deeply embedded in his government and party, the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nPDP said even if the best hands were recruited, they would be contaminated by \u201cincompetence, impunity, disregard for rules, divisiveness and corruption that have become the hallmark of the APC and its administration.\u201d\n\nThe party called on Buhari and APC to note that Nigerians were not swayed by the sack of the ministers but \u201care eagerly awaiting the exit of the Buhari presidency and the APC come May 29, 2023, as there is no hope in sight under their purview.\u201d\n\nOn its part, a civil rights advocacy group, the Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA) urged Buhari to sack the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami; Minister of Defence, Major General Bashir Magashi (rtd); as well as the National Secretary Adviser, Major General Babagana Monguno (rtd.).\n\nAccording to the group, the three ministers have failed in terms of containing the security challenges plaguing the nation.\n\nNational Coordinator of HURIWA, Emmanuel Onwubiko, disclosed this in a statement made available to newsmen in Abuja\n\nAccording to the HURIWA coordinator, \u201cThe Minister of Defence and the NSA to the President should be sacked. There is no doubt that students are constantly kidnapped and the security situation in Nigeria has become like a war situation and deteriorated almost to a point that the president is openly accused of undermining national security.\n\n\u201cThe NSA should have been sacked about two years ago\u2026\n\n\u201cThe country has never had it so bad in terms of security threats. Borno, Katsina, Zamfara, Kaduna are all under the control of terrorists and even Nigerian Defence Academy was not spared of the disgraceful attacks by terrorists.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the justice minister justified the illegal rendition and abduction by government of the leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, (Nnamdi Kanu), from Nairobi, Kenya, means that the justice minister is grossly incompetent and unfit for that high office.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022As world health body launches disease intelligence preparedness initiative\n\n\u2022 Governor Uzodinma, Moghalu hail appointment\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\n\nDirector General of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, has been appointed Assistant Director-General of the World Health Organisation (WHO) in charge of Health Emergency Intelligence. The appointment takes effect from November 1, 2021.\n\nA statement by WHO Director General, Dr. Tedros Ghebreyesus, yesterday, explained that Ihekweazu would lead the work on strengthening pandemic and epidemic intelligence globally, including heading the WHO Hub for Pandemic and Epidemic Intelligence in Berlin, which was launched yesterday.\n\nGovernor Hope Uzodimma of Imo State and a former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Professor Kingsley Moghalu, lauded the appointment, calling it well-deserved.\n\nThe WHO Hub for Pandemic and Epidemic Intelligence is a global platform for creating shared and networked access to vital multi-sectoral data, driving innovations in data analytics, and building the communities of practice needed to predict, prevent, detect, prepare for, and respond to worldwide health threats.\n\nIn addition, the WHO Hub is a new global collaboration of countries and partners dedicated to driving innovations to increase availability and linkage of diverse data; developing tools and predictive models for risk analysis; and monitoring disease control measures and infodemics.\n\nThe WHO Hub would enable partners from around the world to collaborate and co-create the tools and data access that all countries need to prepare, detect and respond to pandemic and epidemic risks.\n\nThe statement by the WHO director-general said, \u201cI am pleased to welcome Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu as an Assistant Director-General for Health Emergency Intelligence from November 1, 2021. He will lead the work on strengthening pandemic and epidemic intelligence globally, including heading the WHO Hub for Pandemic and Epidemic Intelligence in Berlin.\n\n\u201cI am confident that Dr. Ihekweazu\u2019s appointment will help further accelerate WHO\u2019s work in health emergencies.\n\n\u201cPlease, join me in welcoming him to WHO.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the need for the new global initiative, German Chancellor, Dr. Angela Merkel, was quoted as saying, \u201cThe current COVID-19 pandemic has taught us that we can only fight pandemics and epidemics together. The new WHO Hub will be a global platform for pandemic prevention, bringing together various governmental, academic and private sector institutions.\n\n\u201cI am delighted that WHO chose Berlin as its location and invite partners from all around the world to contribute to the WHO hub.\u201d\n\nThe German Minister of Health, Jens Spahn, said there was need to identify pandemic and epidemic risks as quickly as possible.\n\nSpahn stated, \u201cFor that aim, we need to strengthen the global early warning surveillance system with improved collection of health-related data and inter-disciplinary risk analysis.\n\n\u201cGermany has consistently been committed to support WHO\u2019s work in preparing for and responding to health emergencies, and the WHO Hub is a concrete initiative that will make the world safer.\u201d\n\nThe minister assured that the WHO Hub would work with partners globally to achieve a scale-up in innovation for existing forecasting and early warning capacities in WHO and member states.\n\nHe also said the WHO Hub would accelerate global collaborations across public and private sector organisations, academia, and international partner networks.\n\nAccording to Spahn the pandemic intelligence hub would help countries to collaborate and co-create the necessary tools for managing and analysing data for early warning surveillance.\n\nIhekweazu, while speaking in an exclusive interview with THISDAY, said the decision to appoint him to lead the global initiative was a recognition of the work the NCDC under his leadership.\n\nIhekweazu said, \u201cIt is in recognition of what we have done in Nigeria with the NCDC, the Federal Ministry of Health, and the Presidential Steering Committee in responding to this pandemic in Nigeria; in responding to many other infectious disease threats that have happened over the last few years \u2013 monkey pox, Lassa fever and the rest of them.\n\n\u201cAlso, it is in recognising that in order to have a global initiative to respond, there is need to have deep knowledge about how local systems work. So, I think it is a recognition that the work that we have done over the past five years to develop this system will have a big contribution in the global context.\u201d\n\nThe NCDC boss was trained as an infectious disease epidemiologist, and he has over 20 years experience working in senior public health and leadership positions in several National Public Health Institutes, including the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD); the United Kingdom\u2019s Health Protection Agency; and Germany\u2019s Robert Koch Institute (RKI).\n\nHe has led several short-term engagements for WHO, mainly in response to major infectious disease outbreaks around the world.\n\nIhekweazu, a Nigerian, was born in Germany. He is a graduate of the College of Medicine, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, and holds a Master in Public Health (MPH) degree from the Heinrich-Heine University, Dusseldorf, Germany.\n\nIn 2003, he was awarded a Fellowship for the European Programme for Intervention Epidemiology Training (EPIET) and, subsequently, completed his Public Health specialisation in the United Kingdom. He is widely published in medical peer-review journals.\n\nMeanwhile, Uzodimma lauded the appointment of Ihekweazu as WHO Assistant Director-General.\n\nThe governor said in a statement by his Special Adviser (SA) Media/Chief Press Secretary, Oguwike Nwachuku, he wasn\u2019t surprised over the appointment because Ihekweazu demonstrated capacity and exhibited professional competence as DG of NCDC.\n\n\u201cIhekweazu is one of Imo State\u2019s best and brightest and that the state is proud to be part of the human capital contributing towards the wellbeing of the global family,\u201d the governor stated.\n\nUzodimma reiterated that Ihekweazu\u2019s pick was fundamental because, \u201cit will help to further bring Imo State into global focus, particularly Amaigbo in Nwangele Local Government Area of the state where the NCDC DG hails from.\u201d\n\nThe governor urged Ihekweazu to continue to do the state proud, and assured him of the support of the government and good people of Imo State to ensure that his outing at the WHO is exemplary.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

They kill police officers and military personnel and set government property on fire. Now, they have amassed a substantial stockpile of weapons and bombs across the country.\n\n\u201cWere this group in a western country, you would not expect to hear Amnesty\u2019s full-throated defence of their actions.

The international NGO is being used as cover for the organisation\u2019s local leaders to pursue their self-interests. Regrettably, this is not uncommon in Africa\u201d.\n\nThe Presidency\u2019s statement read:\n\n\u201cAgain, they have decided to side with terrorists, before the liberty of those they injure, displace and murder.\n\n\u201cSpeaking the language of universal human rights, Amnesty International deploys it only in defence \u2013 even outright promotion \u2013 of those that violently oppose the Federal Government of Nigeria. Parroting the line of Nnamdi Kanu and IPOB, a proscribed terror organisation, they work to legitimise its cause to Western audiences.\n\n\u201cThis puts them in bad company. Controversial American lobbyists are paid hundreds of thousands of dollars annually to do the same, laundering IPOB\u2019s reputation in Washington DC.\n\n\u201cIPOB murder Nigerian citizens.

It must open a formal investigation into the personnel that occupy their Nigerian offices. They should reject the outrageously tendentious misinformation they receive and bring some semblance of due diligence to the sources they base their claims on. Currently, we see none.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian government will fight terrorism with all the means at its disposal. We will ignore Amnesty\u2019s rantings.

          "text": "An ex-soldier, Amoo Bukola, recently released with others from the Maximum Security Prisons, Kirikiri in Lagos has narrated how he and others were tortured, jailed and sentenced to death by the army authorities for demanding better weapons to fight Boko Haram terrorists.\n\nBukola disclosed this in a recent interview with PM News, expressing hope that he will be reinstated in the army.\n\nHe gave details of how he joined the Nigerian Army and what led to his imprisonment alongside 53 others.\n\nBukola narrated how he began his military career, saying, \"I joined the Nigerian Army fully on the 6th of August 2012 after completing six months' training and eventually passing out of the training on the 21st of December 2012.\n\n\"After passing out from the Depot, I was posted to NATRAC Kotangora in Niger State for training as a (member of the) Counter-Terrorist Special Force and Quick Response Group (QRG).\n\n\"There I was trained for four months, commencing from the 3rd January through to 19th April 2013.\n\n\"Thereafter, I was then posted to 101 Special Force battalion at Kainji, Niger State. After the posting, I was then nominated to go for training in Pakistan, there, I was trained for two months between 13th July and 13th of September 2013. See Also Boko Haram 54 Nigerian Soldiers Jailed For Demanding Better Arms, Regain Freedom After Seven Years\n\n\"I also had the Anti-Terrorist Training (ATT) commando course 43. Two days after my arrival from Pakistan, I was appointed to go for Operation Zama Lafiya in Maiduguri, Borno State.\n\n\"We took off from 101 battalion special force camp to Abuja on the 15th of September 2013, for operation. We were about one hundred and eighteen soldiers (118) that went for the operation and we went at a company level named 'Army Headquarters Special Force Company.'\n\n\"We finally left Abuja on the 18th of September, 2013. We transited at Damaturu where we slept in Yobe State till the following morning. We then moved to Maiduguri. We arrived at 7 division Garrison in Maiduguri, Borno State.\n\n\"We were deployed to several places like Bulaburi Damboa, Bulaburi garna, Mafindi, Balle, Chinese, Ngwoshe, Gwosa, Cashew Plantation at the back of How\u2019s barracks, Asigashia Cameroon, and Mulai primary school along Damboa Road, adjacent AIT, Maiduguri, Borno State.\n\n\"On the 9th of July, 2014 our mission on this day was to go and recapture Damboa from the terrorists. On our way to the point, along the road the terrorists had laid ambush unknown to us. At that point, we lost nine men and twenty-three (soldiers) were seriously injured.\n\n\"To further commence the journey, we requested sufficient weapons from our commander so as to be able to fight more sufficiently with the terrorists but our request was refused by the commander.\n\n\"On the 4th of August 2014, we were asked to return to Damboa. At this point again we were ambushed, yet again we requested weapons from our commander and he still refused.\n\n\"All of a sudden on the same day, the GOC of 7 division in Maiduguri, Borno State, Major General M.Y Ibrahim ordered that we should be brought to him for an address.\n\n\"His plan then was to hand us over to the military police guardroom. Two weeks later we were moved to the airport, flown to Abuja, and driven to Abacha barracks in Abuja.\n\n\"At the barracks, we were divided into different groups and taken to different guardrooms at different barracks, some Mambila barracks, Lungi barracks, Mogadishu barracks, and Keffi barracks, Nasarawa State.\n\n\"We were in the guardroom for four months after which we were sent to the general court-martial.\n\n\"The court-martial process started on the 2nd of October 2014. A case was established against us in the court and adjourned several times before we were finally sentenced.\n\n\"But one of us did not face the trials for health reasons, five were discharged and acquitted while 54 of us were sentenced to death by firing squad on the following charges: mutiny and criminal conspiracy to commit mutiny against 7 division Maiduguri.\n\n\"The presiding chief justice who sentenced us is Brigadier General M.S. Yusuf, while the advocate judge was Lieutenant Col Ukpe Ukpe, the prosecutor Captain J. A. Nwosu, our defence counsel was led by Mr. Femi Falana (SAN), Major Femi Oyebanji (Rtd), Barr. Samuel, Barr. Eze, and Barr. Olakitan.\n\n\"After the sentence was announced on the 17th December 2014, we were taken to the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja and flown to Lagos on 21st December 2014 with handcuffs and leg chains.\n\n\"On arrival in Lagos, we were shared into different guardrooms e.g. CIC intelligence underground guardroom and SIB military detention, all these with handcuffs and leg chains for a whole month all together in detention we spent 1 year, 2 days, 7 hours and 40 minutes and 29 seconds in Lagos State.\n\n\"Thereafter, on the 18th of December 2015, our sentence was reverted to 10 years imprisonment and after some days we were moved to the maximum security prisons, Kirikiri, Apapa, Lagos State.\u201d\n\nBukola also revealed that the incident affected his marriage, saying his wife abandoned him after he was sentenced to death.\n\nBukola said: \u201cThis life is full of ups and downs. I never imagined that my wife, mother of my only child (Adam) would abandon me just after I was sentenced to death by firing squad to marry another man. Anyway, life continues.

          "text": "An ex-soldier, Amoo Bukola, recently released with others from the Maximum Security Prisons, Kirikiri in Lagos has narrated how he and others were tortured, jailed and sentenced to death by the army authorities for demanding better weapons to fight Boko Haram terrorists.\n\nBukola disclosed this in a recent interview with PM News, expressing hope that he will be reinstated in the army.\n\nHe gave details of how he joined the Nigerian Army and what led to his imprisonment alongside 53 others.\n\nBukola narrated how he began his military career, saying, \"I joined the Nigerian Army fully on the 6th of August 2012 after completing six months' training and eventually passing out of the training on the 21st of December 2012.\n\n\"After passing out from the Depot, I was posted to NATRAC Kotangora in Niger State for training as a (member of the) Counter-Terrorist Special Force and Quick Response Group (QRG).\n\n\"There I was trained for four months, commencing from the 3rd January through to 19th April 2013.\n\n\"Thereafter, I was then posted to 101 Special Force battalion at Kainji, Niger State. After the posting, I was then nominated to go for training in Pakistan, there, I was trained for two months between 13th July and 13th of September 2013. See Also Boko Haram 54 Nigerian Soldiers Jailed For Demanding Better Arms, Regain Freedom After Seven Years\n\n\"I also had the Anti-Terrorist Training (ATT) commando course 43. Two days after my arrival from Pakistan, I was appointed to go for Operation Zama Lafiya in Maiduguri, Borno State.\n\n\"We took off from 101 battalion special force camp to Abuja on the 15th of September 2013, for operation. We were about one hundred and eighteen soldiers (118) that went for the operation and we went at a company level named 'Army Headquarters Special Force Company.'\n\n\"We finally left Abuja on the 18th of September, 2013. We transited at Damaturu where we slept in Yobe State till the following morning. We then moved to Maiduguri. We arrived at 7 division Garrison in Maiduguri, Borno State.\n\n\"We were deployed to several places like Bulaburi Damboa, Bulaburi garna, Mafindi, Balle, Chinese, Ngwoshe, Gwosa, Cashew Plantation at the back of How\u2019s barracks, Asigashia Cameroon, and Mulai primary school along Damboa Road, adjacent AIT, Maiduguri, Borno State.\n\n\"On the 9th of July, 2014 our mission on this day was to go and recapture Damboa from the terrorists. On our way to the point, along the road the terrorists had laid ambush unknown to us. At that point, we lost nine men and twenty-three (soldiers) were seriously injured.\n\n\"To further commence the journey, we requested sufficient weapons from our commander so as to be able to fight more sufficiently with the terrorists but our request was refused by the commander.\n\n\"On the 4th of August 2014, we were asked to return to Damboa. At this point again we were ambushed, yet again we requested weapons from our commander and he still refused.\n\n\"All of a sudden on the same day, the GOC of 7 division in Maiduguri, Borno State, Major General M.Y Ibrahim ordered that we should be brought to him for an address.\n\n\"His plan then was to hand us over to the military police guardroom. Two weeks later we were moved to the airport, flown to Abuja, and driven to Abacha barracks in Abuja.\n\n\"At the barracks, we were divided into different groups and taken to different guardrooms at different barracks, some Mambila barracks, Lungi barracks, Mogadishu barracks, and Keffi barracks, Nasarawa State.\n\n\"We were in the guardroom for four months after which we were sent to the general court-martial.\n\n\"The court-martial process started on the 2nd of October 2014. A case was established against us in the court and adjourned several times before we were finally sentenced.\n\n\"But one of us did not face the trials for health reasons, five were discharged and acquitted while 54 of us were sentenced to death by firing squad on the following charges: mutiny and criminal conspiracy to commit mutiny against 7 division Maiduguri.\n\n\"The presiding chief justice who sentenced us is Brigadier General M.S. Yusuf, while the advocate judge was Lieutenant Col Ukpe Ukpe, the prosecutor Captain J. A. Nwosu, our defence counsel was led by Mr. Femi Falana (SAN), Major Femi Oyebanji (Rtd), Barr. Samuel, Barr. Eze, and Barr. Olakitan.\n\n\"After the sentence was announced on the 17th December 2014, we were taken to the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja and flown to Lagos on 21st December 2014 with handcuffs and leg chains.\n\n\"On arrival in Lagos, we were shared into different guardrooms e.g. CIC intelligence underground guardroom and SIB military detention, all these with handcuffs and leg chains for a whole month all together in detention we spent 1 year, 2 days, 7 hours and 40 minutes and 29 seconds in Lagos State.\n\n\"Thereafter, on the 18th of December 2015, our sentence was reverted to 10 years imprisonment and after some days we were moved to the maximum security prisons, Kirikiri, Apapa, Lagos State.\u201d\n\nBukola also revealed that the incident affected his marriage, saying his wife abandoned him after he was sentenced to death.\n\nBukola said: \u201cThis life is full of ups and downs. I never imagined that my wife, mother of my only child (Adam) would abandon me just after I was sentenced to death by firing squad to marry another man. Anyway, life continues. It sounded incredulous when our death sentence was reverted to 10 years.\n\n\"So many things happened when I was in prison, my elder brother a constable in the Nigeria Police Force attached to Kwara State Police command misfired on January 20, 2016, and was sentenced to death.\n\n\"The sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment last year. My aged parents \u2013Mrs. Rainot Amoo, 65 and Pa Abdul Salam Amoo, 70 \u2013are in the village Gorioluode in the Moro Local Government Area of Kwara State.\n\n\"Now that we have been released, we beg President Mohammadu Buhari, Vice President (Prof.) Yemi Osinbajo, the Chief of Army Staff to reinstate us in the army so that we can fight the terrorists.\u201d",

          "text": "A man, Ezedinachi Oguibe has been detained since August 27 by operatives of the Abia State Police Command, Zone 9 Umuahia after his cousin's wife accused him of causing her husband's death.\n\nIn a statement by Okechukwu Nwanguma, the Executive Director of Rule of Law Accountability Advocacy Center (RULAAC), the complainant had informed the police that Oguibe killed her husband so he could claim the deceased's life insurance.\n\nFile photo used to illustrate story.\n\nHowever, it stated that the family confirmed that the deceased died as a result of gangrene from diabetic complications.\n\nRULAAC said it had tabled the matter before the Assistant Inspector General of Police, Zone 9, Umuahia, who invited the parties and after the interview, directed that Oguibe be released.\n\nHowever, to date, Oguibe has not been released despite the orders of the AIG.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cMr Ezedinachi Oguibe a native of Akpodim in Ezinihitte Mbaise LGA Imo State was arrested on Friday, August 27, 2021, by police officers who waylaid him and took him to Zone 9 Umuahia where he has been detained since then.\n\n\u201cPrior to his arrest, Mr. Oguibe was approached earlier in the week by someone posing as a prospective client. He performs gospel songs at weddings and burials, etc. He and the 'client' decided the fee, and he was told to meet this person in Chokoneze - a neighbouring community, and collect a down payment.\n\n\u201cHowever, while on his way to the meeting, he was waylaid by what turned out to be police, placed under arrest, and driven all the way to Umuahia where he has remained in detention.\n\n\u201cHe was accused by his cousin's wife of murdering his cousin who died over a year ago of gangrene resulting from diabetes. His late cousin's wife claimed that he killed her husband so he could claim his life insurance.\n\n\u201cMr Ezedinachi is the head of the Oguibe family and family members have confirmed to the police that their late relative died of diabetes and was not murdered.\n\n\u201dThe police have also not uncovered any evidence that the man was murdered. After efforts to get the IPO simply known as Ismaila to grant the man bail since there was no evidence to establish the allegation of murder, we brought the matter to the attention of the AIG Zone 9, Umuahia who invited the parties and after the interview, directed that Mr Ezedinachi Oguibe should be released.\n\n\u201cHowever, the relatives who were at the station reported back that the IPO demanded the sum of two hundred and fifty thousand naira (N250,000) before he would release him. When RULAAC confronted the IPO with this information, he denied demanding money and said his team leader asked that they produce the original death certificate and doctor's report.\n\n\u201cThe AIG ordered the release of the man and the investigation team is placing their own conditions. We request the AIG to kindly call the investigating team to order.\u201d",

          "text": "School abductions have worsened. From a fleeting criminal fad they have become a modus operandi for bandits looking to nick millions of naira from parents. What was once believed to be a one-off show of cruelty in Chibok eight years ago is now a recurring loop that barely moves Nigerians again. Dapchi happened and shook the nation. Kankara and Jangebe came in late 2020 with the chilling realisation of the perilous times Nigeria was crouching into.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, nothing could have foretold how rife, and sometimes numbing these school adoptions would become in 2021.\n\nAt least 821 students have been abducted within the first eight months of the year already. That figure is more than two-thirds of the 1191 students kidnapped in Nigeria in the previous seven years combined.\n\nHere is a rundown of the abductions:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwenty-seven pupils kidnapped in Kagara\n\nJust as the dusk began to lift over the sky of Kagara in the early hours of February 17, another kind of darkness descended on the town. A marauding gang of bandits invaded Government Science College in the community, overpowered the security guards, killed one student and snared an initially unknown number of children and staff members away.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was not until noon on that unfortunate day that Bello Abdullahi, governor of Niger state, officially put the number of abducted students at 27 alongside 15 staff members.\n\nThe victims were not released until after 10 days in the kidnappers\u2019 dens \u2014 with those who are wards of military personnel specifically targeted for excessive maltreatment.\n\nOver 270 abducted in Jangebe\n\nWhile the country was still frantic from the fresh abduction of Kagara students, another pincer landed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn February 26, in Jangebe town of Talata-Mafara LGA, Zamfara state, residents were jerked awake from sleep by sporadic shooting. The rat-tat of the guns escalated into the hair-raising boom of doors getting kicked down as a set of bandits raided some houses in the community, and the residents could only watch as the brazen gunmen proceeded to their next target. The assailants headed for the Government Girls Secondary School located in the area and left with 279 students.\n\nThe girls were freed on March 2, after a \u201dpeace reconciliation\u201d with the bandits and the state government.\n\nLeading the federal government\u2019s delegation to the state after the girls\u2019 release, Hadi Sirika, minister of aviation, said the president promised the incident will be the last school adoption the nation would ever witness under his administration. But the president\u2019s vow failed to materialise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwenty-nine kidnapped in Afaka\n\nLess than two weeks after the federal government pledged Jangebe abduction will be the last, bandits struck again.\n\nOn March 12, gunmen attacked the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation, Afaka, Igabi LGA of Kaduna state, and abducted 29 students.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe following day, the abductors released videos in which the students were seen sitting on the floor in an unknown location, guarded by armed men whose identities were concealed.\n\nIn the videos, the victims appealed to the government to pay the ransom demanded by the bandits so that they would be freed.\n\nThrough it all, the Kaduna state government remained adamant on its earlier resolve that struck out negotiating with bandits as an option.\n\nOn the evening of May 5, news filtered through that the kidnappers have agreed to release the students \u2014 after seven weeks of abduction. It was reported that the students were ransomed by a pool of contributions from the victims\u2019 parents.\n\nTwo primary school pupils \u2018went missing\u2019 in Rama\n\nOn March 15, another gang of suspected bandits invaded UBE primary school in Rama, Birnin-Gwari LGA of the state.\n\nAccording to Samuel Aruwan, Kaduna commissioner for internal security and home affairs, two pupils who were initially missing were later found. He then added that three teachers \u2014 Rabiu Salisu, Umar Hassan, and Bala Adamu \u2014 were abducted.\n\nTwenty Greenfield University students kidnapped\n\nWhen, on April 18, another group of bandits abducted 20 students from Greenfield University, Kaduna, and the criminal trend assumed a more bloody dimension.\n\nThe assailants wanted N800 million as ransom, and when the demands were not met to early enough, they killed five of the students, further threatening to kill more.\n\nOn May 29, the remaining students were released from captivity by their abductors. A parent of one of the abductees claimed the bandits were paid N180 million before they were released.\n\nA student kidnapped in Plateau.\n\nOn April 29, gunmen abducted a student of the Calvary Ministries, a mission agency popularly known as CAPRO, in Barkin Ladi LGA of Plateau state.\n\nThe gunmen reportedly attacked the school in the night, and after a fierce gun battle with security operatives, they went away with one of the students.\n\nA student abducted in Abeokuta\n\nOn May 23, Olayinka Tokunbo, a Federal University of Agriculture student, Abeokuta, was abducted from a farm near the institution. He was kidnapped alongside another man and one lady.\n\nHe was, however, set free three days later with details of his release withheld by the authorities.\n\nAnother 156 children abducted in Niger\n\nOn May 30, bandits on 70 motorcycles and attacked 17 communities across three LGAs of Niger state. The gunmen then proceeded to Salihu Tanko Islamic School, Tegina, and abducted 156 schoolchildren.\n\nThe bandits then released 11 of the children \u201cwho were too small and couldn\u2019t walk,\u201d demanding N110 million as ransom.\n\nAbubakar Alhassan, the school\u2019s headmaster, said one of the parents of the abducted children died few days after the incident from shock.\n\nThe pupils spent more than 16 weeks in captivity for 90 of them were released on August 27 after a few of them had died.\n\nEight students kidnapped from Nuhu Bamalli Polytechnic, Kaduna\n\nOn June 11, the Kaduna state government confirmed that eight students and two lecturers were kidnapped during a bandit raid of Nuhu Bamalli Polytechnic.\n\nTheCable had reported how gunmen invaded the school on Thursday night, shooting sporadically upon entering the premises.\n\nThe abductees remained in captivity for 28 days until their release on July 19.\n\n\u2018Eighty\u2019 students kidnapped in Kebbi\n\nOn June 17, many students were reportedly abducted by bandits who attacked the Federal Government College, Birnin-Yauri in Kebbi state.\n\nThe gunmen went away with several students \u2014 estimated to be 80 \u2014 after a gun battle that overpowered the police officers on the ground. One of the officers was killed, and five teachers were kidnapped alongside the students.\n\nOne of the students that escaped the attack claimed that the assailants are not Nigerians.\n\nSubsequently, five students and two teachers were rescued, while one was killed during a rescue mission by security operatives.\n\nAbout 121 students of Bethel Baptist High School abducted in Kaduna\n\nIn the early hours of July 5, bandits invaded Bethel Baptist High School in Damishi, Chikun LGA of Kaduna state, and snared 121 students away despite police officers rescuing 28 others.\n\nIt was not until 20 days after that the belligerents began releasing the students in batches and 90 of them have been released with the remaining 31 still in captivity.\n\nAnother 15 students kidnapped from College of Agriculture, Zamfara\n\nOn August 16, Bandits took away 15 students, a teacher, his wife, and two children at the College of Agriculture and Animal Health in Bakura, Zamfara state.\n\nThe victims were not freed until 11 days later with the details of their release still sketchy.\n\nNine students kidnapped in Kastina\n\nOn August 18, nine students were kidnapped in Sakkai, Faskari LGA of Katsina state, following an attack on the community.\n\nIsah Gambo, police spokesperson in Katsina, confirmed the incident to TheCable that the students were said to be returning from the Islamiyya school in the area when they ran into the gunmen who were attacking the residents of the area.\n\nThe nine students, all boys, were said to have been taken away by the gunmen, who drove away on motorcycles.\n\nSeventy-three students abducted in Zamfara\n\nOn September 1, gunmen descended on Government Day Secondary School in Kaya, Maradun LGA of Zamfara state, and abducted 73 students.\n\nThe assailants invaded the school around 11 am and took the students to an unknown location.\n\nThe incident forced Bello Matawalle, governor of Zamfara, to order the closure of all schools in the state.\n\nAccording to a statement on Wednesday by Mohammed Shehu, the Zamfara police spokesman, a search-and-rescue team has been deployed to find the students.\n\nThe students are still in captivity as of the time of filing this report.",

          "title": "Fintech Focus: The link between Open Banking and financial inclusion",
          "text": "Nigerian banks sit on an inventory of consumer data that fintech startups in the country can only dream of.\n\nWith more than 70 million active bank customers in Nigeria, banks possess valuable big data, consisting of demographic, personal, and professional information of clients as well as transaction history, consumption patterns, and movements.\n\nThere\u2019s so much that can be done with this data. For instance, lenders can segment their client base to offer personalised savings or loan offers. The data can also be deployed in targeting Nigeria\u2019s huge unbanked population with customised services, based on similar profiles to existing clients.\n\nBut very few, if any, legacy banks in Nigeria actually go out of their traditional ways to innovate using the rich data reserves. However, banks can share the data with third parties that have better capabilities to use them, and that\u2019s the premise of Open Banking.\n\nWhat is Open Banking?\n\nOpen Banking is an emerging global practice of data sharing between banks and other stakeholders in the ecosystem; including third-party financial services providers (TPPs), fintechs, and other institutions.\n\nBy sharing one another\u2019s datasets, the companies can better understand their target markets, acquire more customers, and build out new customer-centric products and services or improve on existing ones.\n\nIfeoluwa Orioke, the Chief Commercial Officer at Flutterwave, explains to TechCabal that one of the ways customers can benefit from open banking is by accessing loans tailored to their needs.\n\n\u201cA lender can understand your credit score from your transaction history and tailor specific credit facilities to you. Or for instance, interest repayments for a farmer whose income is in seasons, and not months, can be structured around the harvest season.\u201d\n\nWhile these are viable use cases, Open Banking is more effective for driving financial inclusion in Nigeria. As of the end of 2020, over 36% of the adult Nigerian population (or 38 million adults) were unbanked.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBanks don\u2019t have incentives to target rural areas, where most of the unbanked population resides. In their place, fintech firms are extending access to financial services in these areas through agent networks and mobile money wallets.\n\nHowever, fintechs need to integrate data with banks before they launch agent locations. A common standard for both parties to share information is needed to help speed up integration.\n\nOpen Banking introduces this common standard, via uniform Application Programme Interface (API), which banks and fintechs all have access to. It aids the latter\u2019s efforts to reach the financially excluded or underserved.\n\n\u201cOpen Banking is a major step forward in solving restricted access to financial services in Nigeria,\u201d said Orioke. \u201cThose who do not have bank accounts can participate in the financial ecosystem via Fintechs. Fintechs can provide improved solutions and personalised services to these people by processing data from banks.\u201d\n\nOpen Banking Nigeria, a private initiative building a common standard for Open Banking APIs in Nigeria, has, to an impressive extent, helped standardise API access, thereby easing the process of integration between fintechs and banks.\n\nNigeria\u2019s central bank also recently launched draft regulations for Open Banking, which establishes principles for data sharing across the banking and payments ecosystem.\n\nWin-win for all\n\nAccording to Orioke, the Open Banking idea is a win-win for all parties involved in the ecosystem; banks, fintechs, TPPs, the banked, and the unbanked populations.\n\nWith vast and detailed consumer data gathered over the years, Open Banking provides value creation opportunities for innovation-friendly banks.\n\nFintech companies, with access to bank data, could better serve existing customers and even acquire new users in the process.\n\n\u201cOpen Banking equally creates more options for existing customers and could bring in more people into the banking system, simply by tailoring solutions to their needs,\u201d notes Orioke. \u201cWith more customer personalisation comes improved trust in the financial services industry.\n\nOutside financial services, Open Banking has the potential to impact all aspects of the customer\u2019s life, seeing as every activity is connected to finance; whether hospitality, healthcare, or insurance.\n\n\u201cIt can also increase the profitability of all participating parties (including the banks), reduce cost and improve customer experience. Open Banking could be the ultimate solution to all current difficulties with access to financial services in Nigeria,\u201d Orioke said.\n\nConsidering its numerous benefits and rapid adoption, Open Banking could potentially revolutionise the financial services ecosystem in Nigeria and go down as one of the most important innovations in the financial inclusion drive.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "How customer loyalty is helping Nigerian fintech apps through regulatory crackdown",
          "text": "On August 17, a court in Abuja granted an order to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to freeze bank accounts belonging to four startups, which allow Nigerians to invest in foreign securities, for 180 days.\n\nThe crackdown by the apex bank could result in severe unintended casualties for the companies; but above all, it puts at risk what is arguably their most valuable asset \u2014 customers\u2019 trust.\n\nThe global finance industry is built on the foundation of trust. And in Nigeria, where more than 80 million citizens live below the poverty line, trust is even more paramount. Most Nigerians are likely to be skeptical about storing their hard-earned Naira with a digital-only company for extended periods.\n\nAnd the fintech platforms affected by CBN\u2019s move \u2014 Trove, Risevest, Bamboo, and Chaka \u2014 know this.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBeyond offering financial products with attractive investment returns, the startups have invested in building a customer trust and loyalty bank. This has mostly been through providing consistent financial literacy and transparent communication over the years, primarily via emails and Telegram channels.\n\nEach of the fintech firms has thousands of members in its respective Telegram community \u2014 Risevest (+12,000), Chaka (+5,000), and Trove (+3,000) \u2014 where inquiries and queries are responded to in real-time with opportunities to further educate their users.\n\nNews of the embargo on their bank accounts would ordinarily have sparked a frenzy among customers and it did for a moment. Some users took to social media to express their shock and others made moves to withdraw their funds, exhibiting a natural human instinct to fight or take flight when faced with a crisis or an unexpected situation.\n\nBut the majority of users have held on, helped by their trust in the companies, which quickly communicated the suspension to customers while assuring them their funds were safe.\n\n\u201cI got an email from Risevest before I even read in the news that their accounts were barred. So I was already calm knowing that my money was safe,\u201d Motunrayo Koyejo, a software engineer and Rise Vest user, told TechCabal. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would have this much confidence if I didn\u2019t get that email.\u201d\n\nRise Vest\u2019s email to users after the suspension.\n\nWhile the suspension affected four retail trading apps, there is a tendency that such clampdown can result in contagion; a situation where a crisis affecting some companies spreads to other players in the industry.\n\nStephanie Osaji, who uses Cowrywise for savings said after seeing news of the court order, she was \u201cscared, thought about my funds and was wondering what would happen to my money\u201d if the platform suddenly shut down.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I considered withdrawing my money. I remember logging into the app and checking when my next due date for withdrawal was,\u201d Osaji said. \u201cBut then I just told myself that they would figure it out. I mean Nigerian startups almost always have a way of figuring things out.\u201d\n\nAnother Cowrywise user, Mosopefoluwa Okeowo, told TechCabal she thinks fintech startups will always find a solution. \u201cI honestly believe in them totally.\u201d\n\nThis sort of consumer confidence is one that takes years to build. Communicating with customers and stakeholders at the very early stages of a mishap is crucial to reassuring their confidence.\n\nSe the money I have in risevest yh, even if it will go like that we go die there. Thats how much I believe in Eke \u2014 Sani Yusuf (@saniyusuf) August 17, 2021\n\nSem. Sem. Started investing with Eke so long ago. Before he even started coming this way and we had never met until years later.\n\n\n\nRise will survive. https://t.co/a42wEDeVAW \u2014 Gossy (@gossyomega) August 23, 2021\n\nNigerians embracing investment-tech amid economic uncertainty\n\nAfrica\u2019s bustling fintech ecosystem has been increasingly defined by payments specialists and digital banks.\n\nBut a crop of wealth management startups has emerged in recent years, the majority helping Nigerians invest in foreign stocks and assets easier than ever before.\n\nInvesting in reliable financial assets appeals to many millennials in the country who are keen on hedging their future wealth against the unstable Naira, amid broader economic uncertainty.\n\nWith \u20a61,000 (around $2), anyone with a smartphone and internet can register on Chaka and browse through over 11,000 shares publicly listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) and stock exchanges in the U.S.\n\nSavings and investment apps also boast superior returns on deposits. Compared to less than 5% interest rates on fixed deposits offered by Nigerian banks, Rise Vest offers a guaranteed 10% annual return on its fixed-income offering.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s safer to save money with banks but one gets little or nothing in return,\u201d Koyejo said. \u201cThat\u2019s not an option in this economy. I\u2019d rather keep my money and invest with Rise Vest. I don\u2019t plan to use the money I have invested soon anyway.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

At the event, I learnt practical strategies on how to navigate through Nigeria\u2019s unique market. With the grant my business won, I was able to get a refrigerator for my business, which was a pressing need at the time.

          "title": "I want more women to become angel investors \u2014 Yemi Keri on angel investing and building Rising Tide",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in the workplace, and this also plays out in the venture capital space. According to Crunchbase, global VC funding to female founders dropped in 2020. Their figures show that 800 female-founded startups received $4.9bn from investors \u2014 a 27% decrease from the same period in 2019.\n\nOne reason for this is low representation in VC firms. Axios reports that 12.4% of decision-makers in US venture capital firms are women. And only 10% of West African startups that cumulatively raised $1m between 2010 and 2020 had at least one female co-founder.\n\nThis is a problem Yemi Keri, one of a handful of women investing in African startups, is passionate about solving. After getting a taste of angel investing with the Lagos Angel Network and seeing how hard it was for women to get funded, she co-founded Rising Tide Africa to get more women involved in angel investing.\n\nTechpoint Africa caught up with her for a chat, and she held nothing back as she shared her experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nI got into angel investing by referral with the Lagos Angel Network. Now I\u2019m on the board, but I got started there. I think this was 2014/2015, and Tomi Davies had started off Lagos Angel Network and wanted a group of us to come in and understand what it was all about. If I recall correctly, he brought about 50 of us together, and every so often, we would meet and listen to pitches.\n\nI used to watch and listen to the kind of questions that were asked. My background is in information technology, so this was new to me at the time. I made two investments \u2014 in Cafe Neo and Big Cabal \u2014 with Lagos Angel Network, and that\u2019s how I came into angel investment.\n\nWhat was the attraction to these companies?\n\nFor Cafe Neo, it was the revenue and expansion model and the target audience (youthful demography). In the case of Big Cabal, the passionate team, the possibility of catering for multiple audiences, and the various products that were in the pipeline when we invested won me over.\n\nWhat influenced the founding of Rising Tide?\n\nAround 2016, I began to toy with the idea of having a female-focused angel network because many of the people who came to pitch were men who got more attention and interest than the few women who showed up. And this made me wonder. It wasn\u2019t by design, but I began to notice that, first of all, the questions they asked women were kind of different.\n\nSecondly, the women were not communicating effectively to the investor team, and the kinds of businesses they pitched were slightly different. Women often do their businesses with a sense of passion. As we approached 2017, a lady came to pitch one of the best products in the healthcare sector \u2014 it still is today \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t convey it very well.\n\nI think it was her first few months of fundraising, so Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien and I took her aside and began to mentor her. We took her to pitches; we would put a group of women together and tell her to pitch. We would then question her thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nAfter a while, we brought her back to the team, and everybody was impressed and wanted to invest. They got to the point of negotiations, and the rest is history. Though we did not invest then, she\u2019s doing well. I knew that there was a gap and that we had hit on something we could develop.\n\nSo Ndidi and I got together and started Rising Tide Africa, which has been my major focus. We founded Rising Tide to increase women\u2019s participation in angel investing so that they can see it as an asset class; the end goal is to invest in more female founders. We believe that with more female angel investors, we can reduce the gender funding gap for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the genesis of Rising Tide, and it is a vehicle in which we are now investing. Lagos Angel Network has metamorphosed into a network of networks. Now we have different networks within Lagos Angel Network.\n\nHow many startups has Rising Tide invested in?\n\nBy 2019, we had done six. By the end of 2020, we had 15 investments. In 2021 we have made six investments. That would mean 21 investments in all, and we have completed the due diligence for two others, for which we are about to call for funds.\n\nHow many investments have you made?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m on my 19th investment.\n\nWhat is Rising Tide\u2019s average ticket size?\n\nWe initially said we would start with $25,000, but so far, our largest ticket size is $289,000. We intend to do between $50,000 and $200,000.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to increase female participation in both startups and angel investing. What else drives your investment mission?\n\nRising Tide is set up on four major pillars, one of which is investments.\n\nThe other thing that we do is education. We now have about 64 members at Rising Tide, and some of them are new to angel investing, so we have to do a lot of educating.\n\nWe try to teach them about things going on in the ecosystem so they can be better investors. We also educate the entrepreneurs. Over the years, we\u2019ve organised training and masterclasses for our founders and others in the ecosystem. We are now developing Entrepreneurship 101, which contains several courses to help entrepreneurs become investment-ready. We plan to develop other curricula that will be required for the ecosystem.\n\nThe other arm is networking. Just like what you\u2019re doing, having us talk about investments and enabling entrepreneurs to have access to investors, we also do our bit in terms of networking. We attend events where we meet many entrepreneurs.\n\nWe organise events where entrepreneurs can meet many investors not only within Rising Tide but also outside. We do a lot of coaching and panel roles for other networks or groups of networks. So we try to develop not only Rising Tide but also the ecosystem.\n\nThe fourth arm is mentoring, which is very crucial. We act as individual mentors for our portfolio. We don\u2019t believe that investments alone are what we need to provide for our businesses. We believe in growing with them and holding their hands.\n\nYou get a pool of people who can mentor you for a period. So we have one-offs like that. We also have mentoring sessions where we spend three to six months mentoring a business. Our goal is to mentor them until they are investment-ready, either for Rising Tide or any other network willing to invest in them.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is giving back to the ecosystem and ensuring that it develops so that our businesses do not die within the first three years. Those are the four pillars that Rising Tide operates by.\n\nAre there specific markets or industries that you focus on?\n\nWe are sector-agnostic; however, we try to invest in certain sectors. We look at sectors that have volume and the most impact on our economy \u2014 like education, for instance. Apart from education, we\u2019re looking at something related to healthcare. So education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, essential goods, and services are our areas of interest.\n\nHow do you determine what startups to invest in?\n\nWe have an investment process that guides us. First of all, tech and tech-enabled startups get our attention. We prioritise female-owned, female-led, and gender diverse companies. We look at their business model critically. We look at the market. Of course, we look at their financials and their corporate documents.\n\nSo we filter based on our investment philosophy. After we do that, if they qualify, we look at factors like their team. We look at their qualification and prior experience, their commitment to the business itself; we don\u2019t want people doing part-time coming to us for investment.\n\nWe look at diversity. We go as far as looking at who sits on your board of directors and talking to some of your references. We also look at your business model. Don\u2019t forget that these are early-stage startups, and there\u2019s only so far we can go in terms of due diligence, but we look at these basic things.\n\nWhat are their revenue sources? Who are their potential customers and suppliers? What kind of pipeline do they have? What\u2019s their value proposition? We look at the size of the market and the key drivers within that landscape. These are external things that we look at in terms of whether there\u2019s a unique selling point, the barriers to entry, and the competitive landscape.\n\nSome don\u2019t have historical financials, but we look at how objective their revenue projections are? What will their gross margins be? Their burn rate of cash \u2014 how long our investment can carry them. Also, because we are angel investors, we want to exit between a three to five year holding period, so we look at the exit potential.\n\nThis is how we filter and look at the kind of businesses that we invest in. If we are not investing in Nigeria, we would require a local investment network in that country to co-invest with us because those are the people who understand the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI will talk about the team first. If a founder says, \u201cI am still keeping my day job until we get funding,\u201d that\u2019s a red flag because it means that the founder is not confident about their business. You will quickly lose the interest of an investor. So, when you are pitching, make sure you are fully committed to your startup.\n\nThe other thing is that while you are putting your team together, try and understand the kind of skill sets that you require based on what you are doing and ensure that you have those requisite skills. Ensure that you are not relying on one person to the point that if your technology person or CTO leaves, your startup shuts down.\n\nSome founders tend to make the CTO a co-founder, but you have to be sure about the interest of your CTO. Even though you make them your co-founder, that might not be enough to hold them down.\n\nDon\u2019t rely solely on raising capital from investors, solely being the keyword. Fundraising is a different ball game in itself, and sometimes, it makes you shift focus from your business. A founder needs to determine how much they need over a fixed period so that they\u2019re not continuously raising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re raising funds, remember that an investor does not want to fund your overhead. Do not raise $100,000 and then use it to rent a place or pay salaries. That is not what we\u2019re interested in investing in.\n\nEven if you use some of it for your overheads, let most of it be for improving or scaling your product or whatever it is that will make the business grow. We also advise founders not to give out majority equity of their business. As angel investors, we also say, \u201ctry not to take more than 15% of the business, so you do not kill it.\u201d\n\nThey will always need to have that kind of authority because if other investors are coming in down the line and you have given away 30% already without even getting to Series A, then it starts to become a major challenge.\n\nAnother issue that investors are beginning to see is the level of valuation. It\u2019s incredible how a company that started business 5 or 12 months ago and is still in product development is valuing itself at $1 million. That is ticking off a lot of investors. Be realistic in your valuation.\n\nWe are not in the mature European and American markets, so stop equating your business to startups in those regions; it is bad for the ecosystem. You have to be able to justify your valuation to angel investors. If we see that something is overvalued, we walk away.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nAmayi Foods and Migo in terms of expansion into other environments. Amayi is on Amazon Prime and sells globally, and Migo \u2014 formally Mine.io \u2014 has expanded its services to Brazil.\n\nHave you had bad investments, and how did you deal with them?\n\nIn your portfolio as an investor, you should be ready to lose some funds. Before we onboard our investors, we always tell them only to invest what will not affect their lifestyles because statistically, only one or two of your investments will become a unicorn. However, they will make up for your other investments.\n\nWe started off investing really critically in 2019. We have two that are not looking promising so far. As for the others, it\u2019s still too early for us to say they have failed. What we do when we are investing is to position the team lead of that investment as a board observer or a board member in that startup, so they act as a liaison between Rising Tide and the startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried everything from mentoring to handholding to board observing, and we\u2019ve made recommendations, but we\u2019re still watching. It\u2019s still early to say that they are really bad. We hope that the recommendations we\u2019ve made can take them out of the hole that they\u2019re in.\n\nWhat startups are in your portfolio?\n\nSo we have Migo, Amayi foods, Big Cabal, Cafe Neo, Aruwa Capital, OZ\u00c9, Kwik, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Eden, Blackbet \u2014 which we co-invested in with Lagos Angel Network.\n\nInkblot is an interesting one because we decided to try entertainment. We have Seso Global, Emergency Response Africa \u2014 very early stage but gaining a lot of traction. We have Bankly, Chekkit, and Gradely.\n\nAre there any deals that you passed on that you regret?\n\n(Laughs) There will always be deals that you pass on. I think in the early stages of Lagos Angel Network, we let Flutterwave go. We also let Paystack go. That\u2019s for Lagos Angel Network. Now, I don\u2019t know if any we let go has done well, but you will always have those companies.\n\nThere\u2019s a company called Termii. We didn\u2019t want to pass up on them, but before we could conclude, they had gotten other investors. At that time, our investment process took so long because we were at the teething stages ourselves. This was 2018/2019. As an investor, you win some and lose some.\n\nHow do you deal with the fear of missing out as an angel investor?\n\nThere will always be deals. If you miss one bus, there will always be others. If you miss out in the early stages, you might get another opportunity later. There will always be a chance for you to get on board, and if there is none, it wasn\u2019t yours.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nFor Rising Tide Africa, you can send an email to info@risingtideafrica.com. You can also visit the website at www.risingtideafrica.com if you want to join us as an angel investor. Finally, you can send your pitches to pitches@risingtideafrica.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

We believe government\u2019s overriding concern is the safety and health of its citizens.\n\n\u201cWe are currently confronted with a situation wherein the Case Positivity Rate (CPR) for COVID-19 hovers between 15 and 25 percent as deaths are consistently being recorded daily from COVID-19, with unvaccinated persons accounting for 100 percent of deaths in the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the state.\n\n\u201cGovernment, therefore, finds it strange that some persons in purported pursuit of their fundamental human rights would embark on litigation tourism outside of our state, seek to become a source of public health danger and put at risk the safety and health of the larger population.\u201d\n\nReassuring the government\u2019s commitment to the protection of the lives and livelihoods of Edo people, the governor further stated: \u201cGovernment owes a sacred duty to the populace to take all actions necessary to protect the health of the majority of the citizens and in this connection, an even greater quantity of vaccines is being secured for the use of the people of Edo State.\n\n\u201cThe Edo State Government has, therefore, instructed its Lawyers to vigorously pursue and challenge all such orders in the courts from where they emanate and if necessary, at the appellate level, while affirming its position as a law-abiding government.\u201d\n\nObaseki also commended residents for complementing the government\u2019s efforts at containing the pandemic.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe want to appreciate all leaders in various spheres within the state for their support so far for the vaccination exercise which has resulted in unprecedented uptake of the vaccines by Edo people.\n\n\u201cWe thank the churches, mosques, hotels, banks, event centres, restaurants and bars, among others, that have volunteered their premises for use as vaccination posts.\u201d\n\nReinstating the government\u2019s stance on proof of vaccination to access large gatherings from the second week of September 2021, Obaseki added that \u201cWe want to reiterate that our directives on vaccination stands and so people who are planning social, religious, political or business events after the second week of September should ensure that both themselves and their guests are not only vaccinated but possess vaccination cards as proof of vaccination, as anyone without this proof, will not be granted access to crowded facilities.\u201d\n\nThe governor also directed intensive enforcement of use of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) to curb the current spike in COVID-19 infections and deaths.\n\nHe said: \u201cThese measures include compulsory wearing of facemasks, regular washing of hands under running water and/or use of hand sanitisers, and maintenance of recommended social and physical distancing in public places, among others.\n\n\u201cConsequent on the rapid rise in infections and death from COVID-19, government may be forced to implement a lockdown if there is a failure to follow the directives for vaccination and compliance with the Non-Pharmaceutical Intervention (NPIs) in order to halt the spread of the Delta variant of COVID-19 which is currently raging within the state.\u201d\n\n...",

          "title": "Families are central to search for Africa\u2019s disappeared",
          "text": "The number of people missing across Africa appears to be rising. By the end of June, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) had recorded more than 48,000 missing across the continent \u2013 an increase of 4,000 since June 2020.\n\nThese figures account for just a small fraction of the total. Beyond those documented by the ICRC and the International Organization for Migration (IOM), no reliable information exists on how many are missing and for how long.\n\nMost registered disappearances are connected to armed conflict, situations of violence, natural disasters and migration. Armed conflict in seven African countries accounts for 39,360 (82 per cent) of missing people recorded by the ICRC.\n\nIn recent years, governments and humanitarian organisations have intensified efforts to track and identify missing people, prevent disappearances and restore family links. However, the problem seems to be worsening. Greater awareness, more coordinated action and information exchange may help fix it.\n\nLimiting the numbers who go missing is vital. For the ICRC\u2019s Regional Director for Africa, Patrick Youssef, this means better collaboration between national authorities, non-governmental organisations, communities and humanitarian actors. He says although initiatives exist in most African countries, they aren\u2019t always consistent.\n\nThe African Commission on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights (ACHPR) recent resolution on missing migrants and refugees and the impact on their families could help. Maya Sahli-Fadel, ACHPR\u2019s Special Rapporteur on Refugees, Asylum Seekers, Migrants and Internally Displaced Persons, told ISS Today that it was important for the commission to take leadership on this issue.\n\nShe said the main step was for more African countries to ratify the 2006 International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. She lamented the slow pace of ratification or accession \u2013 it took almost four years to get the required 20 ratifications for the convention to enter into force. Of the 98 countries that have signed, only 64 have ratified (18 are from Africa).\n\nArmed conflict and violence are the main reason why people go missing. However, migration is increasingly a cause \u2013 and a major concern, says Ms Sahli-Fadel. More and more migrants travel along perilous routes as options for legal migration in and out of Africa diminish. And for various reasons, they lose touch with their families and loved ones.\n\nSome who are smuggled or trafficked across borders are arrested and detained without access to the outside world. Others might not want to contact their families until their situation improves or their immigration status is legalised. Not wanting to expose relatives to investigations or difficulties with authorities and criminal networks is a way to protect loved ones.\n\nWithout any information though, families continue to search. Many fear their relatives are dead, and the risks are indeed high. Almost 1 300 migrants died trying to cross the Mediterranean from Africa to Europe between 1 January and 31 August this year. On other African migration routes, by 31 August the IOM had recorded 513 deaths in 2021.\n\nMame Bara Ndoye, Secretary-General of Senegal\u2019s Association of Families of Missing Migrants, says that knowing the fate of missing relatives was critical for many people. He was speaking at a joint ICRC\u2013Institute for Security Studies (ISS) seminar to mark the International Day of the Disappeared on 30 August.\n\nAnd since most of the missing are men, he said many families left behind were headed by women. In deeply patriarchal societies this brings its own challenges in relation to remarriage, divorce and custody of children, sources have told the ICRC.\n\nThese difficulties are also evident in Cameroon, South Sudan and Niger. Maman Aminou A Koundy, an adviser to the Appeal Court of Niamey in Niger, said the role of security services and the judiciary was critical. He emphasised the need for governments to efficiently issue identity and travel documents, document migration and trace missing persons.\n\nSenior officials at the ICRC\u2013ISS seminar shared this view. Zimbabwe Police\u2019s Assistant Commissioner Crispen Lifa called for coordination among police at the regional level and through Interpol in the search for missing people. Beyond the state, he said, community workers should be trained on the importance of information sharing to help locate missing people.\n\nWhile contexts differ, the same five ingredients are needed for responses to succeed, according to a new ISS-ICRC report on Africa\u2019s disappeared. First, families have a central role to play. Authorities should support them and provide individual assessments and responses. To do this, governments must acknowledge the tragedy of missing people and deal with the multifaceted needs of their families.\n\nSecond, prevention and early action are needed to solve pending cases. Third, strong laws and effective protocols are essential, which means missing people and their families must be recognised under national law. Depending on the circumstances, death certificates or certificates of absence must be issued efficiently, along with services from a well-trained and resourced medico-legal system.\n\nFourth, authorities should consider establishing national and regional missing persons mechanisms and databases to clarify the fate and whereabouts of the disappeared. Finally, for those missing in the context of migration, committed inter-government efforts from countries along migration routes are vital. Procedures to search for and identify missing migrants are needed, along with information exchange and coordination protocols.\n\nUnderpinning all five of these action steps is the understanding that Africa must tackle the plight of missing people and their families, and that states must lead.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOttilia Anna Maunganidze, Head of Special Projects, ISS Pretoria\n\nThis article is funded by HSF.

In addition to the Federal Capital Territory and 7 states \u2013 Kaduna, Kano, Kwara, Imo, Cross River, Ogun and Oyo \u2013 participating in Phase 1, several other states have indicated interest in the SAPZ programme. These include Bauchi, Lagos, Niger, Jigawa, Ekiti, Lagos, Taraba, Benue, Sokoto, Ondo, Nasarawa, Gombe and Kogi.\n\nOyebanji Oyeleran-Oyeyinka, Senior Adviser on Industrialisation to the President of the African Development Bank, said \u201cthe zone model is an explicit industrialization strategy to transform poor rural spaces into zones of prosperity, stem rural-urban migration, end human insecurity induced by herder-farmers clashes, and provide employment to Nigerian youth.\u201d\n\nMinister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Richard Adebayo, commended the strategic initiative of the African Development Bank and its partners, and added \u201cstrong private sector participation will ensure that the project aligns with the Federal Government\u2019s industrialization agenda.\u201d\n\nAlso present at the meeting, African Development Bank Group\u2019s Vice President for Agriculture, Human and Social Development, Beth Dunford, said, \u201cIn the same manner that SAPZs have worked in other countries, it will create jobs, develop skills, and facilitate agricultural value chains development in Nigeria. Private sector investment is critical to the success of the SAPZs, as well as having the right policies in place. Action is needed now. The African Development Bank is ready to accelerate this action.\u201d\n\nIFAD\u2019s Associate Vice President for Programme Management, Donald Brown, said, \u201cthis flagship project will enable us to take our relationship with the African Development Bank to another level. Our relationship started 43 years ago, and since then we have worked together on 52 projects. But I think the Special Agro-industrial Processing Zones are the biggest and most high-profile project that IFAD and the Bank will work on together.\u201d\n\nSolomon Quaynor, African Development Bank\u2019s Vice President for Private Sector, Infrastructure and Industrialization, noted that \u201cthe quality of industrial policies and design will influence the quality of private sector operators that can be attracted into the Special Agro-industrial Processing Zones.\u201d\n\nOugfaly Badji, IsDB\u2019s Senior Agricultural Economist said the zones would enable producers, processors, and the entire agricultural value chain in Nigeria, to become more functional and profitable.\n\nSpecial Agro-industrial Processing are a flagship initiative of the Bank\u2019s \u2018Feed Africa\u2019 strategic priority. They aim to provide end-to-end solutions and services that de-risk production, processing, and marketing operations of private sector actors as they boost manufacturing and transformation capacity in production areas. The end result is improved livelihoods for millions in the rural areas as well as a reduction in poverty.\n\nDistributed by APO Group on behalf of African Development Bank Group (AfDB)",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government has announced plans to commence auctioning of its Bitumen block in the third quarter of 2021.\n\nMinister of Mines and Steel Development, Olamilekan Adegbite who disclosed this in a statement on Wednesday, said the ministry is working towards auctioning its bitumen block in the third quarter of the year.\n\nResponding to the enquiry of the Australian High Commissioner, John Donnelly, who visited the ministry on Tuesday, Adegbite revealed that the ministry was still gathering data on some of the bitumen field and was edging close to completion.\n\nHe noted that there were ample opportunities for investors in the local development of the bitumen sector.\n\n\u201cA lot of people are interested in bitumen which is coming from both local and foreign investors. However, we are still acquiring data in some of the fields and once the data is in we will go for auctioning in the third quarter,\u201d he said, adding that PWC, was advising the ministry on its bitumen development road map.\n\nAdegbite also disclosed that the ministry was working on raising the quality of barite produced in the country to internationally acceptable standard which is known as American Petroleum Institute, API, standard.\n\nThe minister revealed that the ministry had contracted a consultant to help raise the standard in the local production of barite to ensure that the oil industry players begin to use barite produced in Nigeria as against importing from other countries.\n\nHe noted that there was ample opportunity for investors in the barite segment of the sector.\n\n\u201cWe are also working on the local production of barite. Barite is a critical weighting material in Drilling fluids used in oil industry. We have a lot of barite but the issue is that it is not produced to API standards. However, we are putting a system in place which would be ready to launch in about July. We have got the millers who can produce barite to API standard. Hence we will be able to compete with foreign once and it would save Nigeria a lot of foreign exchange in import substitution,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAjaokuta steel plant was meant to be a game changer for the country when fully functional, revealing that about 13 other minerals were required in the production of steel. Ajaoukta steel would have brought development to the 13 other minerals which would have presented opportunities for investors to develop and would have created thousands of jobs for Nigerians.\n\n\u201cOne of the mandate that the president gave me was to use the sector to diversify the economy and create employment. And Ajaokuta is one place that would readily employ like 10,000 Nigerians if it is working fully. About 14 minerals are going into the production of steel through the blast furnace. We have got all these minerals in Nigeria. Production of these other minerals which we need to produce steel will also create jobs.\u201d\n\nThe minister expressed regret that the pandemic had slowed down the plan to resuscitate the Ajaokuta Steel plant. He revealed that the travel restrictions and cumbersome protocols had prevented the 60-man technical audit team from Russia from coming to Nigeria to perform a comprehensive technical audit of the plant.\n\n\u201cWe turned to the Russians the original builder to come and resuscitate the plant. The first step towards the resuscitation was to have a technical audit. We were expecting a 60-man team from Russia which are to be joined by a 100-man team from Nigeria. The resuscitation of Ajaokuta was such a loft goal and was in full speed. But then the pandemic struck.\n\n\u201cThis has prevented the Russians who are supposed to conduct the technical audit from coming to Nigeria. I hope very soon that they can come and that we kick start the plan to resuscitate the plant again. It will help our industrialisation because production of liquid steel will take us to the next level in industrialisation as we will be able to do produce parts for vehicles, engine blocks and so,\u201d he added.\n\nAdegbite also disclosed that the ministry had been working with artisanal and small scale miners, creating an enabling environment for them to operate in the formal sector. He added that the ministry had provided many incentives for them to be in the formal sector such as training and easy access to funds.\n\n\u201cWe are bringing artisanal miners together and make them to come into a formal arrangement. We have a department in the ministry dedicated to artisanal miners that provides various incentives so that they could join the formal sector,\u201d he said",

          "text": "A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, APC, and Director-General of Progressive Governors Forum, PGF, Dr. Salihu Moh. Lukman has challenged Benue State governor, Samuel Ortom, to provide evidence of his claim that there is a sinister plot by the government of President Muhammadu Buhari to turn Nigeria into a Fulani and Islamic caliphate.\n\nIn a statement titled, \u201cNarrow Politics and Questions of Democratic Development\u201d, issued Wednesday, the party chieftain also carpeted former Deputy governor of Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, Dr. Obadiah Mailafia and a retired military officer, Commodore Kunle Olawunmi for going on air on national television to allege that people in government, including a serving Governor are the sponsors of insurgency and banditry in the country.\n\nLukman stressed that such weighty allegations which is capable of creating ethnic hatreds and religious disharmony should rather be matters of judicial investigation and once proved, all identified culprits should be made to face the full wrath of the law, and not reduced to media debates, which rather highlights how low we have descended as a nation.\n\nRecall that in August 2021, there were reports of incidences of killings in Plateau State, bandit attacks on Nigeria Defence Academy (NDA), continued activities of bandits in Zamfara, Katsina, Kaduna and Niger States, Boko Haram \u2013 ISWAP clashes and many other criminal activities across the country which dominated national discourses.\n\nThese led to a revelation made by Commodore (Rtd) Kunle Olawunmi while granting an interview on Channels television where he alleged that government, including the presidency are the sponsors of Boko Haram and bandits.\n\nAlso in September 2020, Dr. Obadiah Mailafia similarly alleged on a live radio show that a serving Northern Governor is the sponsor of Boko Haram.\n\nLukman, who described these allegations as \u201cunsubstantiated and meaningless wild goose campaign\u201d which lack any specific proposal on how to resolve Nigeria\u2019s challenges, maintained that the claimants should have supported their claims with evidence and not just making baseless claims that are capable of setting the nation on fire.\n\nHe said, \u201cAlthough while making the allegations, he also claimed to have proof, after interrogation by the security, Dr. Mailafia was reported to backtracked, saying that he \u2018did not really mean to say that the government was part and parcel of the killings.\u2019 Since Commodore Olawumni has already began meeting with the security, hopefully the details of his evidence will come out.\n\n\u201cOn the part of Governor Ortom, he claimed that he has forwarded his evidence to President Buhari and security agencies in the country. But since he feels so strong as to go public with his allegation without waiting for both President Buhari and security agencies to handle the matter, he can as well make the evidence public since he has lost confidence on established processes of managing matters of national security.\u201d\n\nThe party chieftain debunked the allegations saying the only reason why such a campaign is attractive today is because President Buhari who is a Fulani man is in power.\n\n\u201cIf a primary school pupil talks like the way all the diehard opposition campaigners in the country campaigning against so-called \u2018fulanisation\u2019 and \u2018islamisation\u2019 agenda, one can excuse it because at that level of innocence, everything could appear possible. But for a public servant as highly placed as that of a Governor, retire public servant, retire security personnel, etc. it portends a big danger, which if overlooked can produce a cult mentality in the country with all the ethnic and religious hatred associated with it.\n\n\u201cBeing Governor, retired public servants, retired military personnel, with all the knowledge and experiences they have but decided to adopt the imaginary notion that a country as diverse as Nigeria can be taken over by any ethnic or religious group, is the highest manifestation of morbid symptom of attempt to block any possibility that a new society can be born out of the dying culture of corruption, greed and lawlessness, which was the hallmark of PDP\u2019s sixteen year tenure,\u201d he said.\n\nThe PGF DG warned against conduct and utterances of political leaders in the country who are bent on setting the nation on fire for political gains.\n\nLukman noted that if Nigerian democracy is to develop and become the facilitator for national unity and political development in the country, there is urgent need for political parties in Nigeria to take steps to discourage ethnic and religious campaign of hatred by regulating the conduct of political leaders and elected representatives.\n\nHe added that to be able to discourage ethnic and religious campaign of hatred in the country, it would require that parties put in place internal code of conducts \u2013 byelaws, beyond what is provided in their constitution as parties, as they are today, are weak in regulating the conducts of political leaders and elected representatives.",

Whenever the national teams are playing, there is no disparity or ethnicity among us for that moment. I am not saying everything is okay in Nigeria, but whatever challenges we have can be resolved.

          "text": "Organised labour, under the aegis of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), has warned that it would embark on an industrial action if the speculation about an increase in electricity tariff becomes a reality.\n\nNLC stated this in a letter titled, \u201cNotice on Speculations on increase in Electricity Tariff,\u201d signed by its president, Ayuba Wabba.\n\nThe current electricity tariff charged for residential areas in both Abuja and Lagos ranges from N36 to N47.09 per kilowatt.\n\nThe federal government approved the last increase in electricity tariff in January 2021 following complaints by the operators of the distribution companies that low tariff was adversely affecting their business.\n\nHowever, there have been speculations that the Nigeria Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) was planning to grant fresh approvals for an increase in tariff by commencing the processes for the Minor Review of the Multi-Year Tariff Order (MYTO-2020).\n\nAccording to reports, NERC is considering the inflationary pressure, foreign exchange, gas prices and available generation capacity as part of the reasons for the proposal tariff hike.\n\nHowever, there have been negotiations between the federal government and organised labour on modalities to use in arriving at a tariff mechanism acceptable to both parties.\n\nIn the letter, NLC dismissed reports of an on-going plan to increase electricity tariff as mere speculation.\n\nThe letter read, \u201cWe wish to draw your attention to the wave of speculation, especially as widely reported in the media, that there are fresh plans to grant approval to Electricity Distribution Companies to hike electricity tariff.\n\n\u201cWe write to remind the minister that organised labour on September 28, 2020 through the federal government-organised labour committee on Electricity Tariff agreed to freeze further increases in electricity tariff until the committee concludes its work and its report adopted by all the principals in the committee.\n\n\u201cIt is in light of this that we dismiss the on-going speculation on increase in electricity tariff as mere speculations. We, however, find it prudent to put you on notice that should government make true the swirling speculation by approving an increase in electricity tariff, oganised labour would be left with no option than to deploy the industrial mechanisms granted in our laws for the defense of workers\u2019 rights.\u201d\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo",

The United States has a recommended ratio of 1:5 and Japan has 1:7 while South Korea has none.\n\nThe union had argued its workers are often working double or triple shifts and need better pay and working hours.\n\nThe government and the union have previously met for talks 12 times since May, including a 14-hour marathon session on Monday, but had not been able to find common ground.\n\nSouth Korea has fully inoculated 31.7% of its 52 million people, and 57.4% with at least one dose.
