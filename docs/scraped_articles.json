          "text": "A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party, Olanrewaju Jim-Kamal, has assured residents that if elected the next governor of Lagos State, he will provide free and compulsory education and health care for all.\n\nJim-Kamal, according to a statement on Wednesday, said this while he formally disclosed his interest to contest the state governorship election on the platform of the PDP in 2023.\n\nThe governorship hopeful noted that it would take both infrastructural and human capital development to curb most of the social ills in society.\n\nHe said, \u201cOnce elected we will ensure the provision of automated free and compulsory e- education at all levels, automated free e-healthcare facilities, social security, mechanised food production, sports development, modern transportation system and restructuring. We are out to tell Lagos residents in particular and Nigerians in general the truth and nothing but the truth and then to discuss issues, debate issues and deliver issues through dividends of democracy that have eluded Lagos for sometimes now.\n\n\u201cInfrastructure without giving these teaming youth free and compulsory education, free health, mass employment for youth, women emancipation, availability of subsidised food to our market women, modern day security network that is devoid of force and mass killing of innocent people will only compromise our security networks.\u201d\n\nJim-Kamal also explained that the Lagos PDP now has a brighter chance to win through elective primaries.\n\n\u201cWe have not been winning because Lagos PDP has always promoted imposition but our last elective state congress has brought in the light that we can get it right now. The best way to address all these problems is for the party to go for elective primaries in Lagos like we did in the congress.\n\n\u201cI opted out in 2015 when I discovered somebody was to be imposed on us. Now that the PDP has come to stay and the chances are brighter, we should not spoil it; our primaries should be one man one vote and it should be a free and fair direct primaries,\u201d he added.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": ".\n\n\u2026Operators Describe Gesture as Unprecedented\n\n\u2026As Governor Inuwa Rides Keke-NAPEP To Venue Of Event\n\nGombe State Governor, Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya has flagged off the distribution of 1,000 tricycles as part of his administration\u2019s sustainable economic plan to empower the teeming unemployed youths in the state.\n\nHe described this as historic as it once again demonstrated his government\u2019s commitment to improving living conditions and providing opportunities, especially for the teeming youths.\n\nGovernor Inuwa said it was evident that his administration was steadily reducing the state\u2019s dependence on federal allocations through the institutionalization of a framework that guaranteed a geometric surge in internal revenue more than ever before in the 25 years of the existence of the state.\n\nHe said as part of his administration\u2019s continued quest to improve the socio-economic life of the ordinary people, it had extended the welfare and economic support programme to an important economic group, the Keke NAPEP riders.\n\n\u201cLike other support and economic empowerment programmes of our administration, this intervention is aimed at promoting the socio-economic advancement and self-reliance of the common man and increasing the availability of easy-to-use means of transportation for our people,\u201d the governor said.\n\nHe said 1,000 tricycles were provided for 1,000 individuals through his administration\u2019s Human Capital Development Initiative.\n\nHe said this was, among other interventions, in addition to the training of 1,000 youths that had been engaged through the At-Risk Children Programme (ARC-P) and GOSTEC.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, you may also recall that we recently engaged more than 3,000 persons across all the 114 wards as development facilitators working for the progress of our communities. Our goal is to support and empower not less than 10,000 youths before the end of this year,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe said beneficiaries of the empowerment programme were nominated from the 11 local government areas of the state through their umbrella association, Keke Riders Association of Nigeria (Gombe State Chapter) regardless of their political affiliation, religion or tribe.\n\n\u201cThis further affirms our determination to support every citizen of the state without bias. By this discounted revolving rider-owner arrangement, it is envisaged that these beneficiaries will earn a living for themselves and their families through this partnership and subsequently give a window for another batch of beneficiaries to be selected in due course,\u201d he added.\n\nGovernor Inuwa urged the beneficiaries to take advantage of the opportunity to pursue a decent livelihood devoid of any wrongdoing, recklessness or violation of the law.\n\nHe expressed the hope that the distribution of 1,000 tricycles would ease transportation challenges and help reduce accidents and security threats associated with motorcycles popularly known as \u201cachaba\u201d, especially within the Gombe metropolis.\n\n\u201cYou may recall that since assuming office in May 2019, I emphasised the importance of eschewing short-term expediency and gains, and instead committed to implementing long-term solutions to deeply complex developmental problems. I firmly believe that by introducing better ways of doing things in government, we will not only address difficult developmental challenges but also establish a solid foundation for long-lasting prosperity, peace and progress in our dear state,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the Governor, economic development and progress do not just happen without realistic visions, careful choices as well as resolute commitment of leaders and followers to doing the right thing.\n\n\u201cFor this reason, our first two years in office were marked primarily by unprecedented efforts to institutionalize accountability in government, minimise wastages of scarce resources and revenue leakages, develop the capabilities of our institutions, pursue bold civil service reforms and provide necessary critical infrastructure that will enable Gombe to become an industrial hub in the North East subregion,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said his administration had created a conducive environment for private businesses to thrive, noting that this had led to the state\u2019s rating as the number one in the ease of doing business in the country.\n\nThe Governor said in order to accelerate the progress in human capital development, his administration established a database for unemployed graduates that had so far captured over 27,000 applicants.\n\nHe said the strategy was designed to link the youths with appropriate jobs for their skills in both the private and public sectors.\n\nGovernor Yahaya said Gombe State had always been recognised as the most peaceful, secure and socially cohesive state in the country.\n\nHe said his administration was working hard to create an environment where all citizens and residents could pursue their livelihoods and realise their God-given potential without fear of harassment, discrimination or violence.\n\n\u201cWe are aware, like any other democratic government, that our administration is being constantly scrutinized by the people \u2013 the media, members of the opposition and even by ourselves. As we approach another election season, questions are being asked continuously regarding the extent to which we have fulfilled the promises we made to the people.\n\n\u201cWhat gladdens my heart and of course, every well-meaning citizen of the state is the consensus reached by the people, regardless of political affiliation, that we have delivered on the vast majority of the promises we made in 2019 and have done a lot more!! The evidence is clear for anyone to see\u201d, he said.\n\nThe governor used the opportunity to thank the entire people of the state for their individual and collective support, assuring that his administration would continue to work harder in order to provide good governance and bring economic prosperity to the citizenry.\n\nEarlier in his welcome address, the Secretary to the State Government, Professor Ibrahim Abubakar Njodi, had noted that the empowerment programme forms part of Governor Inuwa\u2019s administration\u2019s sustainable economic agenda for the citizens of the state.\n\nAlso speaking, the Special Adviser to the Governor on Human Capital Development, Barrister Sani Ahmed Haruna, said the series of empowerment programmes of the present administration were broad-based, multi-disciplinary and just a tip of the iceberg.\n\nThe Managing Director of Simba-TVS group of companies, represented by the Head of Business Development, Mr Mahendra Pratap expressed delight in being part of the success story of the Gombe empowerment scheme, disclosing that his company is poised to take advantage of the enabling business environment, especially the Industrial park to set up an assembling plant in the state.\n\nChairman, Gombe State\u2019s branch of the Tricycles Riders Association of Nigeria, Mohammed Abdullahi Sarki, said the distribution of 1,000 tricycles marked a turning point in the history of the association.\n\nHe expressed gratitude to Governor Yahaya for considering the association in the state government\u2019s sustainable economic plan.\n\n\u201cThis is the mother of all empowerment programmes since the state was created some 25 years ago. As a matter of fact, this will go a long way in the annal of history and we, as an association, shall continue to cherish this gesture for a long time to come,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe Governor had earlier arrived at the venue riding a tricycle in the company of the SSG to the admiration of the crowd.",

          "text": ".\n\n\u2026 As countries obtain \u2018Global Benchmarking Too\u2019\n\nBy Chioma Obinna\n\nThe World Health Organisation, WHO, yesterday upgraded the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control, NAFDAC, and Egypt\u2019s medical products regulatory agency to high maturity level 3.\n\nAccording to WHO, with the latest development, these national bodies have been found to function well and they could be eligible for inclusion into the transitional WHO Listed Authorities, a list that will comprise the world\u2019s regulators of reference \u2013 that is, regulatory authorities that should be globally recognised as meeting WHO and other international standards.\n\nIn a press statement on Wednesday, WHO said Egypt has reached maturity level 3 for vaccines regulation (locally produced and imported) and Nigeria for medicines and imported vaccines.\n\nThe two countries join Ghana and Tanzania as effective regulatory systems on the African continent. Several other African regulators are currently under assessment.\n\nThe statement states that the assessment of regulatory authorities was based on the \u2018Global Benchmarking Tool\u2019 \u2013 an evaluation tool that checks regulatory functions against a set of more than 260 indicators covering core regulatory functions such as product authorisation, testing of products, market surveillance and the ability to detect adverse events \u2013 to establish their level of maturity and functionality.\n\n\u201cRegulatory authorities that reach maturity levels 3 and 4 will be eligible for inclusion among WHO-listed authorities, after additional evaluation of their performance.\n\n\u201cThe benchmarking of Egypt and Nigeria\u2019s regulators was carried out by a WHO-led team of international experts. In February and March 2022, WHO conducted a formal evaluation of the authorities and found them to perform well against most of the indicators in the Global Benchmarking Tool,\u201d the statement noted.\n\nOn the importance of regulatory oversight for local manufacturing, it noted that Egypt and Nigeria were also chosen in February 2022 as recipients of mRNA technology from the WHO mRNA Technology Transfer Hub.\n\n\u201c Effective and efficient regulatory oversight is critical to efforts to boost manufacturing capacity as they ensure that medical products entering the market are safe, effective and produced according to international quality standards.\n\nSpeaking, WHO\u2019s Assistant Director-General for Access to Health Products, Mariangela Simao said: \u201cEgypt and Nigeria have come a long way to improve their regulatory work and performance. Given that medical products regulatory oversight and manufacturing must work in tandem, this is very good news for access to quality health products on the African continent.\u201d\n\nRegulation of medical products is extremely important for all health systems and for access to quality vaccines, medicines and other health products.\n\nApart from ensuring the quality, safety and efficacy of medical products, regulatory authorities that function well also perform critical functions such as faster authorization of products and safety monitoring after authorisation.\n\nFewer than 30 per cent of the world\u2019s regulatory authorities are considered fully functioning and operational. For that reason, WHO has intensified efforts to bolster the capacity to regulate medical products in all regions.\n\nIn a related development, WHO also announced a transitional WHO-Listed Authorities (WLAs) list. The introduction of a framework for designating and publicly listing a regulatory authority as a WLA aims to provide a transparent and evidence-based pathway for regulatory authorities to be globally recognised as meeting and applying WHO and other internationally recognised standards and guidelines, as well as good regulatory practices.\n\nThe designation of a regulatory authority as a WLA is intended to promote access and the supply of safe, effective and quality medical products.\n\nIt also encourages the optimal use of limited resources by facilitating reliance on the work and decisions of mature and advanced agencies in the decision-making of other regulatory authorities, the WHO Prequalification Programme, and procurement bodies.\n\nThe transitional WLA combines pre-existing lists of Stringent Regulatory Authorities for medicines, highly performing regulatory authorities for vaccines, Regional Reference Authorities for medicines and vaccines in the Americas (AMRO/PAHO), national regulatory authorities operating at maturity levels 3 and 4, and vaccine producing countries with functional regulatory authorities. The WHO Listed Authorities framework will come into full effect pending successful pilots later this year.",

          "text": ".\n\nBy Olayinka Ajayi\n\nTHE Asiwaju Bola Tinubu Movement, ABAT, has charged residents of Kosofe Local Council and Lagosians to back the presidential aspiration of former Lagos State Governor, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu.\n\nThe group spoke, on Wednesday, during the launch of its Kosofe chapter.\n\nAt the colourful event, the Coordinator of the movement, Mr Ketiku Gbemisola said: \u201cThe initiative was a show of our love and loyalty to our benefactor, someone who has sacrificed so many things for the development of other people. This is the time for payback for us by galvanising support, and mobilising towards the presidential ambition of Asiwaju.\u201d\n\nAsked why the group went ahead to launch the Kosofe chapter a day after Tinubu cancelled his 13th Colloquium in honour of victims of the Kaduna \u2013 Abuja train attack, he said: \u201cIt is an unfortunate attack and our leader is shocked by it. But our gathering was not a funfair. Up till 1 am, we were considering if the programme would hold or not. The main reason for the gathering is just to pass a message to our people. Our mission is just to bring the ABAT movement in Kosofe together. You can see people that came in honour of Tinubu without inducement.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to mobilise people and emphasize that Asiwaju is the best man to manage Nigeria. Nobody can question his competence, his capability and his reach out. Tinubu is not a man of the South-West alone, he is a man of the whole federation. In Kosofe, our aim is to be in oneness. I can assure you that what we did here would lead to Tinubu emerging as president in 2023.\u201d\n\nAlso, a member of the Lagos State House of Assembly representing Kosofe 1, Babatunde Okanlawon said Tinubu during the National Democratic Coalition, NADECO, days laboured for democracy to be enthroned in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAsiwaju has proven himself in so many ways. He is one of the forerunners of modern-day Lagos. He was in the trench during the NADECO, days, and he laboured excruciatingly to ensure we enthrone democracy, rule of law and true federalism in Nigeria. He is a tested democrat and a destiny helper. My being in the House of Assembly today is due to the benevolence of Asiwaju. Everybody should just rally around him and give him full support to ensure that he becomes Nigeria\u2019s president in 2023.\u201d",

It was an unintended action as violence is never in my character.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency, Sir, I hold your person, your ideals, the records of your great accomplishments in public service in Nigeria and beyond, as well as their concomitant collosal impacts in public policies in highest esteem.\n\n\u201cWithout any equivocation, your achievements as a towering intellectual of national and international repute are enduring legacies and pride for the State and Ndigbo in general.\n\n\u201cI will therefore never deliberately engage in any activity or action to disrespect you and your Government.\n\n\u201cAll those who know me can testify that before and throughout my eight years as the First Lady of State, I pursued peace, promoted philanthropic gestures which empowered many of our less privileged people. No excuse can therefore be tenable as justification for such public embarrassment, no matter the height of provocation.\n\n\u201cEqually, I wish to extend the same apology to all the important dignitaries, the people of Anambra State, as well as the entire Ndigbo for that unintended embarrassment at the occasion.\n\n\u201cI want to use this opportunity to pledge that I will wholeheartedly support and pray for the Government of His Excellency, Governor Charles Chukwuma Soludo, to excell exceedingly better than the immediate past government, even as he builds on the legacy of his predecessor, my husband, His Excellency, Chief Willie Obiano, and take our dear State to a higher level.\n\n\u201cI consciously chose this medium to express my apology, goodwill, supports and prayers publicly to His Excellency, Governor Charles Chukwuma Soludo, as a token of my full respect for him, his family and the entire Ndigbo\u201d, she stated.",

Saheed Popoola, a member of the state House of Assembly from Ojomu/Balogun constituent in Offa Local Government Area of the state as false and totally out of line.\n\nDAILY POST reports that Saeed Popoola, recently dumped the All Progressives Congress, APC, for the Social Democratic Party, SDP, and formally notified the legislative arm.\n\nIn a statement by the Honourable Commissioner for Communications, Bode Towoju, the government said the interest of the people is paramount to Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq.\n\nHe urged the people of the state to beware of rumour mongers who have started springing up poorly-calculated mischief in a bid to mislead the populace for selfish political gains.\n\nReacting to a claim by Hon. Popoola on a radio programme in which the lawmaker mischievously alleged that the administration has taken a total of N93bn loan since coming on board in 2019, Towoju said the claim is outright falsehood.\n\n\u201cThe N93 billion loan claim is spurious. How can you come up with such preposterous propaganda when the facts of what the administration received are in the public domain?\n\n\u201cThe government has spoken extensively on the bond it took as well as the budget support/loan refinancing facility,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cThere is a debt stock of N93 billion naira. For the sake of emphasis, as against the unfounded claims, the totality of this loan was not accrued over the last three years under the leadership of the Executive Governor of Kwara State, Mallam AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq.\n\n\u201cThe past administrations left a foreign loan of 43 million dollars. This is apart from the domestic debt of over 63 billion naira that this administration met on the ground.\n\n\u201cThis administration, for the three years it has spent, has only taken a bond of 27 billion naira, out of which only N12billion has been drawn so far. The effect of what the administration has accessed can be seen in the numerous projects that are ongoing across the state.\n\n\u201cSome N18.6 billion refinancing facility has also been given to all the states, including Kwara State, by the Federal government to cushion the effects of the repayment of loans taken by past administrations and as a form of budget support.\u201d\n\nTowoju, said the loan secured by the present administration was for projects like the ongoing Gen. Tunde Idiagbon flyover at Tanke area in Ilorin, the two campuses of the Kwara State University in Osi and Ilesha Baruba that were abandoned by the past administration and other monumental projects, including Osi-Obbo road, Ilesha Gwanara Road, as well as many other roads, and other giant projects that are ongoing.\n\nThe Commissioner advised Hon. Saheed Popoola to focus on the legislative business for which the people of Ojomu-Balogun constituency elected him, rather than chasing shadow on radio.\n\nThe Commissioner called on Kwarans to get their Permanent Voters Cards(PVC\u2019s) and focus on the numerous achievements of the governor, without paving ways for \u201crumour mongers\u201d and \u201cfake news carriers\u201d even as the 2023 elections draw near.",

He was on duty as Doping officer. He collapsed suddenly and died. Cause of death not confirmed yet. His family, the Zambia FA and the government of Zambia have been duly informed.\u201cIf the death of #Zambian doctor Dr Joseph Kabungo at the #Abuja stadium was caused by being attacked by the #Nigerian fans who invaded the pitch, after the @NGSuperEagles lost the@FIFAWorldCup ticket to @GhanaBlackstars, @thenff would be in terrible trouble with @FIFAcom.\u201dNeither officials of the Nigeria Football Federation nor CAF have confirmed the doctor\u2019s death.It was learnt that Kabungo\u2019s family, the Zambia FA and the Government of Zambia had been informed.A Ghanaian sports journalist, Collins Atta Poku, who was also at the venue of the match, alleged that the doctor was beaten to death.In his reply to Osasu\u2019s tweet, Poku posted:\u201cThey beat him, he fell and they throded on him. He lost consciousness was rushed to an ambulance closer to the Ghana dressing for CPR. The entire Ghanaian contingent watched on as resuscitation attempts were made with oxygen mask. He was taken to hospital later and now this. Sad.\u201dThe deceased was a former Mufulira Wanderers goalkeeper. He also once served as Chongwe and Siavonga District Chief Health Medical Officer.At UNZA his mates fondly called him, \u201cWalter Zenga\u201d after the Italian great goalie.The Super Eagles failed to qualify for the 2022 FIFA World Cup finals billed for Qatar after they could only draw 1-1 with the Black Stars of Ghana .The draw in the reverse home leg of the qualifying competition\u2019s playoff round came four days after both sides had drawn goalless in the opening leg at the Baba Yara Stadium in Kumasi.The Super Eagles required an outright win at home to book their seventh World Cup appearance.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

I prayed and prayed and prayed,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cI went to a workshop in Abuja in the morning and I was on may back to Kaduna that same day after the workshop. I was shot on the thigh. But the bullet did not touch my bone. The bullet penetrated out of my thigh.\n\n\u201cHonestly, we suffered seriously, but thank God soldiers came and they really helped us\u201d, she said, adding that, she was unable to walk after she was shot and soldiers had to carry her out of the train to a vehicle by the expressway.\n\n\u201cI was unable to walk, it was the soldiers, who carried me on the back to a the vehicle that brought us to the hospital. They were able to pass over the cliff, carrying us on their backs. Seriously, they tried, because it was not easy climbing the cliff,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cThe terrorists were moving about in the train, but they did not come to where I was seated. I was hit by the bullet through the window. They entered SP17. As they were shooting, the police security on the train asked us to lie down on the floor of the train so that the bullet will not get at us.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately before I could lie down, the bullet hit me. I saw the terrorists from the window. They were many, they were small boys of between the ages of 18 and 20. They appeared like Fulani. They wore turbans. They don\u2019t look like Nigerians. They were shouting Allahakubar.\n\n\u201cThey abducted some people. I saw them forcing people out of the train. They were beating them as they were taking them out of the train.\n\nThey were shouting Allahuhakubar, Allahuhakubar as the shot sporadically,\u201d she said.\n\nSpeaking too from her hospital bed, another survivor, Fatima Shuaibu, a student of College of Education, Gidan Waya, Kaduna State, said her sister was killed in the attack. She was being treated for dislocation on her right leg.\n\n\u201cMy sister, Zainab Awal, was shot on the stomach and she died,\u201d she said amid tears.\n\nShuaibu said she was seated by the window when she started noticing flashes of touch lights.\n\nInitially, she thought it was the villagers around the area, but when she suddenly heard a loud explosion and the train went off track, she knew there was trouble as her heart started palpitating.\n\nShe said, \u201cI was seated by the window in the train. Suddenly, I started seeing flashes of touch light, this was around 8pm. Then, there was a loud bang as if something exploded. Then the train went off track as if was falling down. We started shouting and praying.\n\n\u201cAs soon as the train stopped, we started hearing gunshots. The security personnel on the train announced that everybody should lie down on the floor of the train. They attacked the VIP couch, they abducted some people and took them to the bush, they shot other people. They operated for about two hours or so before soldiers and Airforce arrived and they exchanged gunshots.\n\n\u201cThe terrorists came with five Sharon buses and motorcycles. Those who were abducted were taken away in the Sharon buses. The terrorists were small boys of between 18 to 20 years. I saw them, they don\u2019t look like Nigerians. The soldiers rescued us in the train. Those of us who were injured were evacuated from the train. They climbed the cliff with us and took us to the expressway, where vehicles were brought to carry people.\n\nOn his part, also from his hospital bed at St. Gerald, Mohammed Isa, who was shot on his right arm, said the whole episode was like a dream.\n\n\u201cI was seated by the window and they shot me on the right arm. There was an explosion and the train lost control and went off track. All of a sudden, they started shooting at the train from afar, then, they started coming closer. When they got to the train, they attempted to force the door open, but they couldn\u2019t. So they shot at the door and it opened.\n\n\u201cThey were speaking Hausa. It took quite some time before soldiers came and they exchanged fire with them,\u201d he said, corroborating the accounts of others.\n\nYusuf Idris, ex- spokesman to Zamfara State\u2019s former deputy governor, said Alhaji Ibrahim Wakkala was shot in the leg and was currently receiving treatment in a medical facility in Kaduna.\n\n\u201cHe is responding to treatment very well. He is answering phone calls in his bed. I spoke to him and several other people spoke to him also. There is no cause for alarm,\u201d Yusuf said.\n\nAt the Army, hospital, journalists were prevented from seeing the victims.\n\nMeanwhile, the Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai, has visited victims of the attacks in the hospitals.\n\nIn a statement issued after visiting the 44 Nigerian Army Referral Hospital and St. Gerald Catholic Hospital on Tuesday, the state government condemned the terrorist attack on the Kaduna-Abuja train.\n\nThe statement expressed sympathy and solidarity with all the passengers, and extended its condolence to the families of the those that died in the attack.\n\nThe statement signed by Muyiwa Adekeye, spokesman to El-Rufai, stated that, the governor and his deputy Dr. Hadiza Balarabe, had visited the injured in hospitals.\n\n\u201cThe governor prays for the peaceful repose of the souls of the deceased persons and wishes the injured persons speedy recovery,\u201d the statement stated, stressing that, \u201cwhile the evacuation of passengers from the scene of the attack has been completed, efforts are still being made to account for all the passengers, crew and security officers that were on the train.\u201d\n\nBuhari: No One Will Hold Us to Ransom, Orders Military to Be Ruthless, Directs Integrated Security Surveillance\n\nMeanwhile, President Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, in his first reaction to Monday\u2019s terrorists\u2019 attack on an Abuja-Kaduna train, which killed many people and left several hospitalised, said his government would not let anyone hold Nigeria to ransom.\n\nThe president, who reiterated his call on the military to be ruthless with terrorists and other criminal elements, however, directed the security agencies to arrest the perpetrators of the attack and also ensure, without further delay, the release of all the kidnapped passengers on the ill-fated train.\n\nIn addition, the president has further ordered the immediate implementation of integrated security surveillance for the Abuja-Kaduna and Lagos-Ibadan rail lines.\n\nOn his part, the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, who visited the scene of the attack, yesterday, confirmed the death of eight passengers, and 41 others said to be receiving treatment at the hospital, while putting the total number of the passengers on board the train at 398.\n\nHowever, new information emerging from the attack, has shown that the Secretary-General of the Trade Union Congress (TUC), Barrister Musa Lawal Ozigi, and a lady medical doctor with the St. Gerald\u2019s Hospital, Chinelo Megafu, were among those killed by the terrorists.\n\nA former deputy governor of Zamfara State, Malam Ibrahim Wakkala, who was also on the train, reportedly sustained a gunshot wound on the leg, and among those currently receiving treatment at the hospital.\n\nAt the same time, the Managing Director of the Bank of the Agriculture (BoA), Alwan Ali Hassan, and his niece, were reported to be part of the missing passengers on the train.\n\nBuhari gave the directive at the State House, Abuja, after being briefed by the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), General Lucky Irabor and service chiefs as well as the Inspector General of Police, among other top military officers, about the attack by terrorists on the Kaduna bound passenger train.\n\nHe charged the security chiefs to bring back all passengers kidnapped and ensure that each of the terrorists were hunted down and made to face justice for their heinous acts as no one or group should be allowed to make the country prostrate.\n\nPresident Buhari, who reiterated his earlier directive that the military should deal ruthlessly with terrorists, asked them to be more decisive and not spare anyone unlawfully wielding the AK 47 weapon.\n\n\u201cNo one should be allowed to hold the country to ransom,\u201d the President said as he strongly condemned the bombing of the passenger train, which he described as a \u201cmatter of grave concern.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cLike most Nigerians, I am deeply pained by this occurrence, the second of its type, which has resulted in the death of a yet to be determined number of passengers and others, who suffered injuries.\n\n\u201cThe attack on the train, a safe means of transport to many, is callous; and our thoughts are with the families of the deceased and prayers for the injured,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President commended the Law Enforcement agencies for their prompt response and emergency personnel, who were responsible for the evacuation and treatment of the injured persons.\n\nHe also directed the immediate conclusion of all the processes for the implementation of the integrated security surveillance and monitoring solution for the Abuja to Kaduna railway line, adding that this be extended to cover the Lagos-Ibadan railway line.\n\nHe further directed the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) management to speedily repair the damaged lines and resume normal service without delay.\n\nBriefing newsmen after the closed door meeting with the president, the Chief of Defence Staff, General Irabor said, \u201cWe have come to brief the President regarding the unfortunate incident of yesterday, where some criminals, bandits had gone to lay improvised explosive devices on the rail tracks and a passenger train was demobilised and seven Nigerians were killed, 29 others wounded and some were kidnapped and we are yet to establish the exact number.\n\n\u201cSo, we went to the scene this morning, inspected the entire area and gave out instructions on what is to be done and we have come to brief the president on this development.\u201d\n\nThe CDS said security agencies would build on the lessons they have learnt from the latest incident, while assuring Nigerians that the military and other security agencies would not rest on their oars until everywhere was secured.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe challenge of insecurity is a constant one and so the defence and security agencies need to be on their toes 24/7. This is unfortunate and we believe that the lessons out of this are what we need to build upon going forward.\n\n\u201cI can, perhaps, use this opportunity to reassure the nation that based on the President\u2019s directive, we will take every necessary action, not just to apprehend those behind this dastardly act, but for them to also face justice. Going forward, certainly there will be greater security for the nation and I will like to urge everybody to go about their normal duties.\u201d\n\nApart from the CDS, others who took turns to brief the president were the Chief of Army Staff, Lt-General Faruk Yahaya; Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Isiaka Amao; Inspector General of Police, Usman Baba, as well as the Chief of Defence Intelligence, Major General Samuel Adebayo and the Director General of the Department of State Services (DSS),Yusuf Magaji Bichi.\n\nAmaechi Confirms Death of 8 Passengers, 41 Hospitalised\n\nMinister of Transportation, Mr. Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi, yesterday, confirmed the death of eight passengers, and hinted that 41 persons were currently receiving treatment at a undisclosed hospital following Monday\u2019s terrorists attack on an Abuja-Kaduna train.\n\nAmaechi, speaking to the press after inspecting the scene of the bomb blast at Rijana, along the Abuja-Kaduna rail corridor, put the total number of passengers at 398.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have all the figures of missing persons, kidnapped and those injured at the moment. The numbers we have is that there are eight death and 41 passengers at the hospital.\n\n\u201cSo, we have to wait on the security and the Kaduna State government and the Nigerian Railway Corporation are all trying to make contact with those on the manifest,\u201d he said.\n\nAmaechi added that there were a few persons, who were not on the manifest like the staff of the NRC, staff of the cleaning contractor, were not on the manifest and might not be able to completely account for them, noting that for those on the manifest, calls were being made to reach them.\n\n\u201cWe have not being able to install the security sensors, because the procurement process is a bit difficult. It is typical of Nigerians. To shorten the process and save lives like this but because the process is tedious, the approval is also tedious, we have not been able to get that approval that will lead to purchase those items.\n\n\u201cIf those items were here, drones alone will tell you that there are people around the rail tracks, because there are drones, there are equipment that pick sensors if you touch the track but unfortunately the process has not been able to get us that approval for us to import those items. So, for me, I am devastated and I honestly don\u2019t know what to tell Nigerians anymore,\u201d he said.\n\nHe explained that the cameras in the train could not pick what was happening outside, stating, \u201cWhat you need is a camera that shows 100 metres away from the train, there are unknown things carrying gun. Then, we can take precaution but we have done all we need to do in the ministry of transport and we have forward to them for approval but we have not gotten approval.\n\n\u201cThe patrol vehicles are available but they cannot reach everywhere. For the areas the patrol can patrol, it will forestall. We are thinking about the possibility of employing natives until we get those equipment. We also need helicopters, beyond the drones, we need helicopters.\u201d\n\nOn the suspension of the train service, Amaechi said, \u201cThe Kaduna state government has advised that we stop it but on whether there is a need, there is a need, because there are those who work in Abuja and go back home in Kaduna. So, we have to provide those service but if it\u2019s going to make us lose lives, we may have to stop it but I don\u2019t think that is the solution.\n\n\u201cThe solution is not in running away from the militants or the bandits; the solution is providing the technology that lets you know that they are around. If it lets you know that you are around, there are two actions to take \u2013 either for the security men to go after them or you don\u2019t ply within that period but the agencies that need to give us approval have to give us the approval, because we need to purchase those items.\n\n\u201cNo matter the cost, you cannot equate it with the eight lives that were lost. The equipment were just N3 billion and we are about to place order for the one in Lagos but we need to know what is happening on the track, it is everywhere in the world. The ministry of transport has finished everything, the other agencies are not under me.\u201d\n\nOn perimetre fencing, Amaechi said: \u201cThe man was doing it but he was not paid and even for areas that have the fencing, they are being demolished and it is high enough to protect one from criminals; it is just for cows.\n\n\u201cWhat we need is technology that lets you know that there are human activities or foreign activities on the track, that way, you can secure the locomotive and secure lives and I had warned earlier that it is important they get us this approval, because human lives would be involved. Since that warning till today, we have had two incident.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of due process is that? When I say due process, it does not necessarily mean BPP but whatever agency it is, they need to get us approval so that we can get out of cabinet. Even if they get us approval, it will take some months to acquire them from overseas to install them.\n\n\u201cWe need to do that to enable us see from Kaduna-Abuja, Itakpe-Warri and from Lagos-Ibadan what is going on so that we don\u2019t continue to lose lives, because lives are important. If we don\u2019t do that, more persons will die. The cost was about N3 billion and the damage here is more than N3 billion. So, if we had gotten the approval, we would have saved the N3 billion and saved lives.\u201d\n\nTUC, NMA, NBA, NBTE Suffer Casualties\n\nAs Nigerians and the world continue to mourn with families of those who lost people in the Monday train attack in Kaduna, information trickling in has indicated that the Trade Union Congress of Nigeria (TUC), the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA), the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), and the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE), also suffered casualties of various categories.\n\nWhile some of the associations were still in search of their members, presumed to have been kidnapped by the terrorists, others have identified their members as among those who suffered injuries and were being treated, while some had announced outright, the passing of their members.\n\nThe TUC, an official statement stated, lost its Secretary General, Comrade Musa-Lawal Ozigi, and the Kwara State Chairman, Comrade Akin Akinsola to the train attack, whilst on their way to Kaduna for an official assignment slated for yesterday.\n\nThe NMA too has expressed sadness over the death of one of its members, Dr Chinelo Megafu Nwando, in the terror attack.\n\nPresident of the association, Prof. Innocent Ujah, said in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Dr Aniekeme Uwah, that the body was deeply saddened by the tragic, horrific and preventable death of Nigerians during the incident.\n\nNwando was reported to have lost her life from injuries sustained from gun shots, when the train she travelled in from Abuja to Kaduna was attacked by suspected bandits.\n\nThe NBA, on its part, lost Tibilere Mosugu and Farida Sulaiman, to the cold hands of death. The death of Tibilere Mosugu was confirmed by the NBA Kaduna Branch in an obituary announcement signed by Oguguo C.

A source told a national daily that Hassan\u2019s line had since been switched off from the time of the attack.\n\nThe source added that Hassan boarded the evening train going to Kaduna with one of his nieces.\n\n\u201cWe cannot tell if he has been kidnapped or not but we are worried, because we have been unable to reach him since yesterday. His phone lines have been switched off and no one has contacted the bank or any of his family members,\u201d the source close to his family stated.\n\nSenate Tells Military to Bombard Terrorists\u2019 Enclaves\n\nThe Senate, yesterday, called on the Army and Airforce to, as a matter of urgency, bombard terrorist enclaves with a view to restoring peace and stability in the country.\n\nThe call was made amid resolutions reached, following a point of order raised on \u201cthe continuing attacks on communities and public facilities in Kaduna State.\u201d\n\nThe point of order was raised by Senator Uba Sani (Kaduna Central).\n\nThe lawmaker, noted that terrorists had in recent times stepped up attacks on some communities and public facilities in Kaduna State.\n\n\u201cThe latest attacks by these murderous elements took place in some communities in Giwa Local Government, namely Angwan Sarki Yahya, Tashar Shari, Bare-Bari, Tsaunin Natal, Dillalai, Durumi and Jatin Kanwa, all on Yakawada Ward.\n\n\u201cOther places affected include Kaya community, Mai kyauro and Fatika. They killed 50 persons and kidnapped o 100 people. They also made strategic roads in Giwa Local Government no go areas. Not done with their devilish acts, they made an attempt to penetrate the Kaduna International Airport.\n\n\u201cAlthough the attack was foiled by vigilant security operatives, one person lost his life. When people were trying to come to grips with a week-long wanton destruction of lives and property, the terrorists struck again.\u201d\n\nHe, therefore, bemoaned the attacks by bandits on a Kaduna bound train carrying over 970 passengers around Kateri-Rijana axis in Kaduna, just a few kilometers to the Rigasa Train Station in Igabi Local Government Area of the State.\n\nSani observed that the forests where the terrorists held sway were not impregnable, adding that, \u201ca comprehensive operational plan, executed with high sense of professionalism and responsibility, total commitment on the part of our security forces and the support and cooperation of the local communities will rid Kaduna State forests of these murderous elements.\u201d\n\nContributing, Senator Gabriel Suswam lamented that Kaduna had become the new theatre of insecurity and said the lingering activities of terrorists in the state made it imperative for the appropriate authorities to take decisive action.\n\nSenator Danjuma La\u2019ah, said if the security situation in the country was not nipped in the bud, political leaders would become the main targets of terrorists.\n\nThe Senate, accordingly, in its resolutions, urged President Buhari, to declare full scale war against terrorists, so as to fully secure all our national territory from them in whatever guise.\n\nAttack is Horrifying, Barbaric, Say Northern Governors\n\nThe Northern Governors Forum, has expressed shock and fury over the attack on a train along Kaduna-Abuja route by terrorists, saying the attack was horrifying, barbaric, and totally reprehensible.\n\nChairman of the Forum and Governor of Plateau State, Simon Lalong, while responding to the development in a statement signed by his director of press, Simon Macham, said, \u201cThe entire governors and people of the region as well as other Nigerians are distressed over the unfortunate attack on innocent commuters by terrorists, who have demonstrated total disregard for human lives and compassion.\u201d\n\nEncouraging security forces to intensify their search and rescue efforts in ensuring that those kidnapped were released without further delay and the fleeing terrorists were arrested and brought to justice, the governors sympathised with the families of those killed as well as those kidnapped or injured.\n\nThe forum also commended the armed forces for their quick intervention, which prevented further escalation of the incident.\n\nLalong said the Forum was working with the federal government and Governor Nasir Elrufai of Kaduna State to ensure that the incident and other recent terrorist attacks on communities in Kaduna were dealt with decisively.\n\nHe called for the support and collaboration of citizens by volunteering relevant information about criminal elements throughout the region and the country, as well as supporting the armed forces to carry out their mandate of security of lives and properties effectively.\n\nThe governors said more investments were being made into the security sector by state governments within the region as part of the collaboration with the federal government to boost the capacity of the security forces to be on top of the situation.\n\nHouse Summons Monguno, Amaechi, Sirika, Baba, Others\n\nThe House of Representatives has invited some of the key security chiefs in the country, including supervisory ministers for a meeting over the recent attack on an Abuja-Kaduna train.\n\nThose invited included the National Security Adviser (NSA), Major General Babagana Monguno (rtd); Minister of Defence, Bashir Magashi; Minister of Transport, Rotimi Amaechi; Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika; Chief of Air Staff Air Marshal, Isiaka Amao;and Inspector General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba.\n\nOther heads of agencies expected at the meeting starting today include, Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA), Department of Security Services (DSS), Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), Managing Railway Corporation and Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN).\n\nThe House urged the federal government through the NSA, Chief of Defense Staff, the Inspector General of Police and heads of other security agencies, to holistically intervene by setting up a Special Security task Force on Airports across the country.\n\nIt urged the Federal Ministry of Aviation, FAAN and other security agencies to put a more proactive measure in securing airports, including a modern security surveillance equipment on the perimeter.\n\nThe resolutions of the lawmakers were sequel to the adoption of a motion of urgent national importance sponsored by Chairman Committee on Aviation, Hon. Nnolim Nnaji at plenary, yesterday\n\nMoving the motion, Nnaji recalled that about a year ago, armed bandits attacked the staff quarters the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN), at the Kaduna International Airport and abducted about 12 persons.\n\nHe noted that on Friday, 25th day of March, 2022, there was a horrific armed banditry attack at the Kaduna International Airport, culminating in the death of a security guard of the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency.\n\nHe expressed concerns that the armed banditry attacks at Kaduna International Airport might escalate to other airports across the country, if not checkmated.\n\nHe also worried that no one was safe to travel by air if positive steps were not taken urgently to safeguard airports from banditry attacks, considering the international standards on airport security management as outlined by International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO).\n\nContributing, the Deputy Minority Leader, Hon. Toby Okechukwu, lamented that terrorists were now essential threats to the country and Nigeria was hemorrhaging.\n\nHon. Onofiok Luke urged the executive, legislature, federal, state and local governments, to come together and proffer solutions and provide security for Nigerians, which was the primary objective of government.\n\nObi: Worsening Insecurity Depressing, Disheartening\n\nA former governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi, has described as shocking, the recent terror attacks on Kaduna Airport and on Abuja-Kaduna bound train, saying the worsening level of insecurity across the country was depressing and disheartening.\n\nObi, a presidential aspirant for the 2023 elections, in a statement from his Media Office, said the terror attacks in Kaduna and different parts of the country, had become very worrisome and should serve as a wake up call for the government to beef up the country\u2019s security architecture and be more proactive in handling security issues.\n\nHe lamented that the challenges of insecurity would be too much of a burden on Nigerians already battling with hardship and poverty.\n\nThe former Anambra governor explained that the worsening level of insecurity further aggravated the negative performance of Nigeria\u2019s economy.\n\nWhile condoling with the families of the bereaved and sympathising with the traumatised passengers, Obi urged the different security agencies in the country to remain resolute in the fight against terrorism in the country.\n\nUp Your Game, Northern Senators Charge Security Agencies\n\nSenators from the North under the auspice of the Northern Senators Forum (NSF), yesterday, expressed shock and outrage over the Monday night attack on Kaduna-bound train, and asked the military to re-strategise in handling the security situation in the North West.\n\nThe forum\u2019s chairman and former governor of Sokoto State, Senator Aliyu Magatakarda Wamakko, said the attack was a direct dare at the Nigerian state and its security forces.\n\nWamakko, who is also chairman of the Senate Committee on Defence, said the loss of lives of innocent and defenceless Nigerians must be halted immediately.\n\nThe senators described the attack as \u201cheinous and unforgivable\u201d and charged the security agencies to come together and pursue the criminals.\n\n\u201cIt is devastating hearing about the outrageous attack, which was brought to the fore, yet again, the nature of the problem we are dealing with.\n\n\u201cIt is sad that the precious lives of defenceless citizens get perished in the hands of callous and merciless terrorists,\u201d Wamakko said in the statement released in Abuja yesterday, adding that, \u201cThis is yet another wake-up call not only for our security forces, but indeed all Nigerians \u2013 to wake up and be more decisive in ending this menace.\n\n\u201cWe condole with His Excellency President Muhammadu Buhari, the Kaduna State Government as well as families and associates of those who lost their lives in the attack. But as a tribute to those lost in the attack we must ensure that their lives do not go in vain by bringing the perpetrators to book.\u201d\n\nPANDEF: Attack Is a National Embarrassment\n\nThe Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF), has described Monday\u2019s bombing of an Abuja- Kaduna train by terrorists as a national embarrassment and monumental indictment of the nation\u2019s security agencies.\n\nReacting to the ugly incident in an interview with THISDAY yesterday, PANDEF\u2019s National Publicity Secretary, Hon Ken Robinson, was of the view that the nation\u2019s security architecture has collapsed as the terrorists were clearly sending a message to government that they were in control and could attack anywhere, anytime as they wanted.\n\nThe group bemoaned the silence of the federal government on the incident, particularly, the silence of the Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed, whom it described as someone quick to accuse people of trying to destabilise Nigeria.\n\nWhile sympathizing with families of the those, who lost their lives in the horrific incident, the Forum called on President Buhari to do the needful by discarding his nepotic disposition and act as the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe Abuja Attack is a National embarrassment and a monumental indictment of the nation\u2019s security agencies. These terrorists are clearly sending a message to Nigerian government that they are in control and can attack anywhere, anytime as they want. It shows that the nation\u2019s security architecture has collapsed completely and overwhelmed by this monstrous bandits and terrorists that have made life unbearable for Nigerians.\u201d\n\nGbajabiamila Commiserates with Grieving Families, Says House to Investigate Attack\n\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, has commiserated with families, who lost their loved ones in the Monday attack by terrorists on an Abuja-Kaduna bound train, saying his spirit was wounded by the tragic attack.\n\nGbajabiamila, in a condolence message, said the losses to insecurity in the last two decades were needless and must end.\n\nThe speaker said the lawmakers had resolved to investigate the circumstances of the tragic attack and the security response, to understand why these security breaches continued to occur despite ongoing investments.\n\nHe challenged security agencies to redouble their efforts in finding urgent solutions to the repeated killings.\n\n\u201cMy heart goes out to the families, who are now living through an experience that no one should ever endure. The dead, wounded and missing are our brothers and sisters going about their lives. They had families and friends waiting for them to come home last night. Some of them will never go home again.\n\n\u201cOthers will live the rest of their lives with the memory and injury of this tragic encounter. I commiserate with the families of the dead and pray for a quick recovery for the injured. I strongly urge the national security agencies to find and account for all the passengers, who boarded that train and whose whereabouts remain unknown to their families and loved ones.\u201d\n\nAbdulRazaq Mourns Death of TUC Chair, Others\n\nKwara State Governor, Alhaji AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, yesterday, commiserated with the labour unions and the family of the state council of the Trade Union Congress (TUC) chairman, Comrade Akinsola Akinwunmi, who died in the Kaduna train attack.\n\nIn a statement by the governor\u2019s Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Rafiu Ajakaye, the governor said, \u201cI send our heartfelt condolences to the family of the trade union leader as well as the labour communities in the state.\n\n\u201cIt is my prayer to God to console all that mourn this fine gentleman at this very sad moment. I also condole with the families of all the other victims of the dastardly attack\u201d.\n\nNSIA Gives Police Patrol Vehicles to Boost Highway Security\n\nThe Managing Director/Chief Executive, Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA), Mr. Uche Orji, yesterday, formally handed-over 16 patrol vehicles to the Inspector-General of Police, IGP Usman Alkali Baba, to improve the security of the Abuja-Kaduna-Kano road.\n\nHe said the gesture was extremely important for the NSIA and for the Nigerian people in view of the current security challenges on the highways.\n\nThis came as the police IG said seven people lost their lives while 29 persons sustained injuries in Monday\u2019s train attack along the Abuja- Kaduna route.\n\nOrji paid his respect and condolences to the victims of the train attack, adding that the development was a constant reminder of the challenges Nigerians face with security, which the police were at the forefront to fight.\n\nHe said the donation which was directed by President Muhammadu Buhari was to \u201censure that the work continues to get done and while it\u2019s not sufficient in any way, we hope it will help\u201d.\n\nResponding, the IGP said the donation came at a time Nigerians were mourning the dastardly acts of the \u201cfew ones in our society or community that will not want to leave us in peace.\n\n\u201cWe have briefed Mr. President of our findings and we will be able to emphatically say that during our tour, we were able to establish that seven Nigerians lost their lives and 29 had injuries.\n\n\u201cThis event came at a time we had respite for sometime on the Abuja-Kaduna road, because of the commitment of the security forces to secure the road.\u201d\n\nLife is Near Worthless Under APC, Buhari, Says PDP\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has condemned in the strongest terms, the continuing insecurity and near worthlessness of the lives of Nigerians under the administration of the All Progressives Congress (APC), following terrorist attack on a Kaduna State-bound train on Monday, March 28, 2022.\n\nThe party, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, said the ambush of the train by terrorists, who killed many Nigerians, abducted scores of others in an operation that lasted over an hour, confirmed PDP\u2019s stand that the security command and control coordination structure under President Buhari has collapsed.\n\nPDP said More alarming was the fact this particular attack took place within two days of another on the Kaduna International Airport on Saturday, March 26, 2022, a state controlled by an APC government.\n\nThe PDP insisted that the complicity of silence by the Buhari administration on the Saturday airport attack emboldened the terrorists to assault the train, a development it said further validated its position that the APC administration had conceded sovereignty over parts of Nigeria to terrorists.\n\n\u201cThe continued silence and obvious helplessness of the Buhari Presidency on these deadly attacks on our nation\u2019s key transportation sectors, raise apprehensions of possible complicity at the very top level of the APC administration.\n\n\u201cIt is callous and unfortunate that the APC government, in its usual insensitive nature attempted to suppress information by keeping mute over 24 hours after this horrendous attack, which claimed the lives of promising Nigerians among whom was a young medical doctor, Dr. Chinelo Megafu, who was fatally shot in the ill-fated train travel.\n\n\u201cNigerians can recall the confession by a former APC leader that these assailants are terrorists brought from neighboring countries by the APC as \u2018political mercenaries\u2019 to rig the 2019 general elections,\u201d the PDP stated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",
          "summary": "According to her, \u201cThe terrorists were moving about in the train, but they did not come to where I was seated.\nThe security personnel on the train announced that everybody should lie down on the floor of the train.\nMeanwhile, the Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai, has visited victims of the attacks in the hospitals.\nThe lawmaker, noted that terrorists had in recent times stepped up attacks on some communities and public facilities in Kaduna State.\nThis came as the police IG said seven people lost their lives while 29 persons sustained injuries in Monday\u2019s train attack along the Abuja- Kaduna route.",

          "text": "\u2022Says it\u2019s inefficient, creates uncertainty, instability\n\n\u2022Canvasses efficient tax administration for increased revenue\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has faulted the nation\u2019s current multiple and overlapping tax system saying it\u2019s inefficient and creates uncertainty and instability.\n\nHe therefore canvassed for efficient tax administration to boost the nation\u2019s revenue base.\n\nSpeaking yesterday while declaring open the second annual National Tax Dialogue Week in Abuja, the president said he was worried about the current tax system in the country, characterised by fragmented administration, multiple and sometimes, overlapping taxes.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cMultiplicity of tax administration is as undesirable as multiplicity of taxes; it creates uncertainty and instability; and above all, it is inefficient.\u201d\n\nHe, however, expressed his administration\u2019s commitment to an efficient tax system in order to improve tax revenue in the country.\n\nHe said: \u201dIn most tax-efficient nations, tax administrative processes and practices are harmonised within a single system.\n\n\u201dOne key deliverable of this year\u2019s tax dialogue is to promote synergy in tax administration among the different tiers of government.\n\n\u201dHarmonising taxpayer identification across the country is a good start; but we must do more to promote ease of doing business (including ease of tax compliance) in Nigeria.\n\n\u201dOn our part, we have started by clarifying in the 2021 Finance Act that FIRS is the sole authority to administer tax for the federal government.\n\n\u201dThis clarification became necessary in order to avoid taxpayers being burdened with multiple tax compliance obligations towards different agencies of the same government\u201d, the president said at the dialogue with the theme: \u201dTax Harmonisation for Enhanced Revenue Generation.\u201d\n\nIn the face of dwindling revenues from commodities, Buhari told participants that there was an urgent need to maximise domestic revenue within the extant tax policy and laws.\n\nHe, therefore, proposed improved tax revenue for the country which would not necessarily impose new tax rates on Nigerians.\n\n\u201dWe all know that good intentions are not enough as they simply cannot pay for infrastructure, security or social amenities. We must therefore improve tax revenue without necessarily raising new taxes.\n\n\u201dRevenue from commodities, including crude oil, are too volatile and unreliable. Therefore, I pledge government\u2019s support for any viable initiative for improving tax revenue that should emanate from this dialogue,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nOn Nigeria\u2019s tax-to-GDP ratio, the president declared that the country also needs to do more in securing a buoyant domestic revenue base of the country that bequeaths an enduring economic foundation, political stability and social harmony to the next generation.\n\n\u201dAccording to the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), in its Revenue Statistics in Africa 2021, the average ratio of Tax-to-GDP of 30 selected African countries in 2019 was 16.6 per cent while Nigeria recorded a mere six per cent.\n\n\u201dIt is obvious that much needs to be done in the area of tax revenue mobilisation. \u2018It is my expectation that the discussions at this 2022 National Tax Dialogue will be focused on what we must do to maximise legitimate revenue collection and massively improve the tax-to-GDP ratio. \u201d\n\nOn the importance of the tax dialogue, which was instituted by the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, and the Executive Chairman, Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), Buhari noted that the first edition in 2021, was productive and integral in influencing tax policy, as well as legislative and administrative changes that were introduced last year.\n\nHe added that the most important testament to the success of the first edition was the fact that the FIRS achieved 100 per cent of its collection target in 2021 and surpassed N6 trillion revenue threshold for the very first time.\n\nCongratulating the FIRS on the achievement, the president assured Nigerians that the present administration would continue to maintain prudent management of the collective resources.\n\nEarlier in her remarks, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, said the dialogue was designed to engage stakeholders in the Nigerian tax-space in meaningful discourse so as to glean information, ideas and experience in the aid of policy formulation and improved tax environment.\n\nAccording to her, he main tax revenue objectives of the federal government included developing an economy that does not lean too heavily on resource wealth.\n\nShe explained that Nigeria\u2019s economic history provides enough facts that resource wealth alone cannot lead to sustainable development, self-sufficiency and sustainable.\n\nAccording to her: \u201cThe other tax revenue objectives are:\n\n\u201dTo institutionalise a healthy tax culture among Nigerians. The right attitude towards taxation will enable every Nigerian to become a co-guardian of the tax system and the commonwealth.\n\n\u201dTo create a participatory system of taxation whereby the taxpayers and other stakeholders understand and accept that they have equal stakes in the tax system.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, the Chairman of FIRS, Muhammad Nami, thanked the president for his directive to government agencies to enable FIRS connect to their ICT systems; noting that this singular pronouncement softened the grounds for the Service to roll-out its system for seamless acquisition of data.\n\nHe said: \u201dWe are confident that by the time all the agencies achieve 100 per cent compliance with the president\u2019s directive, Nigeria shall be the envy of other countries for tax compliance and domestic tax revenue mobilisation.\u201d\n\nOn the remittances of the FIRS to the Federation Account, Nami announced that statistics from March 2022 Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) meeting show that out of a total revenue of N803.072 billion from all revenue agencies, tax revenue contributed by FIRS was N513.522 billion (63.94%) while non-tax revenue from all other agencies amounted to N289.55 billion (36.06%).\n\nHe noted that that the average tax or FIRS contribution to FAAC in 2021 was 59.45%.\n\n\u201dI mentioned in my welcome address to the 2021 edition of the Tax Dialogue that the world had begun a tax race of which Nigeria must be a winner.\n\n\u201dThe revenue profile of the country in 2021 has clearly shown that our continued survival as a nation depends on tax revenue.\n\n\u201dThis trend is set to continue for some time to come. As such, all hands must be on deck to support the tax system and make it function efficiently.\n\n\u201dHowever, it is surprising that some people have begun to play politics with tax revenue generation.\n\n\u201dWe humbly invite the President to step-in to dissuade political tax gladiators to sheath their swords. Tax revenue is an inherently apolitical issue; it should be treated as such by all, irrespective of their political leaning\u201d, the FIRS Chairman said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

As operational officers, you have the intel in terms of what has to be done, but I\u2019m constrained as the deputy speaker to continue the meeting because the accounting officers are the ones that are supposed to be here while you give them the necessary support,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI am saying with a heavy heart. No matter the assignment our generals are handling, I believe the parliament requires a listening ear. This is the house of the people. I am not happy expressing my disappointment.\n\n\u201cIn all the agencies, none of all the chief executives that were invited came. Maybe we are considered to be jokers, but we are not jokers.\u201d\n\nAbel Enitan, permanent secretary of the ministry of aviation, said Sirika is currently abroad on an official assignment with the knowledge of the president.\n\nResponding, Wase said: \u201cDon\u2019t use the name of Mr President. This institution is not under the presidency; it is an institution of its own.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nO.T. Akinjobi, a representative of the minister of defence, said his boss was in a meeting summoned by the president over the attack.\n\n\u201dThe expeditious nature of the assignment demanded that they hold the meeting immediately and they have been in session since last night up to this time,\u201d he added.\n\nBut unsatisfied, Wase described the reason as an excuse.\n\n\u201cAll these are excuses as far as I am concerned. The situation is like blackmail to the government. We are losing the only pride that we can showcase \u2014 that critical infrastructure that is about to be destroyed is one of the legacies of this administration,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs a parliament, we have cooperated to ensure the safety of our people. So, these are excuses that are not taken by the parliament.\u201d\n\nA representative of FAAN said the director-general is expected back in the country on Thursday from the US.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn his part, Sanusi Lemu, deputy inspector-general of police in charge of finance and administration who represented the IGP, said his boss respects the parliament which is why he sent a representative.\n\n\u201dIt is in Nigerian parliament that you summon accounting officers that they won\u2019t come. It doesn\u2019t happen in other democratic climes. It is not a favour done to us. If they are here, they are here to give an account of what they are responsible for. And here is the only place they can render a proper account,\u201d Wase responded.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe crafters of the constitution know the reason why they put us to do the scrutiny oversight. The president doesn\u2019t have that time. We are the ones to ask questions and our questions must be answered. It is an aberration.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s begin to do the right thing. This country belongs to us. If there is synergy in operation, this thing would not happen.\u201d",

          "title": "Beyond investing in startups, Factor[e] is de-risking them for other investors",
          "text": "\u201cThe reward for work well done is the opportunity to do more.\u201d\n\nThe origin story of Factor[e] Ventures best exemplifies this statement by Jonas Stalk.\n\nIn 2010, a company wanted to modify car engines to reduce tailpipe emissions, thereby reducing the amount of pollution in India. So it approached a group of people who were working at the Energy Institute of Colorado State University to help them.\n\nAmid efforts to modify the engine, the market got flooded with cheaper alternative engines that had better combustion and cleaner emissions. This meant the company had two options: try to compete in a more crowded market, or pivot. The company chose the latter, and, with help of a group of people which included Morgan DeFoort, they pivoted their know-how and technology towards making clean cookstoves.\n\nToday, that company is known as Envirofit. When the pivot successfully happened Shell Foundation (one of Envirofit\u2019s early funders) looked at the outcome and asked the trio if they could replicate the pivot with another company.\n\n\u201cShell Foundation asked, \u2018Can you identify early stage opportunities that could become viable commercial businesses in the future?\u2019\u201d Amanda Delcore, Director at Factor[e] said over a call with TechCabal.\n\nThis incident led to the creation of Factor[e] Ventures, a group of venture builders with the mission to take their technical skills and knowledge of markets like Southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and India, to help invest in early-stage companies.\n\nDelcore joined Factor[e] in 2016 and has since risen to become a director at Factor[e]. In this interview she shares insights on how Factor[e] invests in tech startups.\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: Factor[e] seems to focus on non-conventional sectors. Why?\n\nAmanda DelCore: Hmmm, that\u2019s a fair conclusion. Ampersand is probably the most attractive and popular company in our portfolio. They do electric mobility.\n\nBut sanitation is definitely not attractive. We\u2019re not investing in a widget to find the closest nail salon. What we are doing is looking at the sustainable development goals in the world, and, while there are a lot of different ways that people try to tackle them, some people try to tackle them through government policies or philanthropic efforts. We look at those goals and believe that the way to effect the most meaningful change is to invest in businesses whose core mission is about that development goal.\n\nIf we can get these companies to be profitable and scale, then we get a return on our investment and impact. That being said, the areas we invest in are big markets. The market for mobility and energy consumption is big. Agriculture is the primary source of GDP for most of the countries in sub-Saharan Africa, outside of, maybe, a few countries that export raw materials.\n\nThese are big markets, and it\u2019s appropriate for venture capitalists to be playing in them. Our approach to making these investments has been very specific as our investments start with a thesis.\n\nFor example, we don\u2019t just say we want to invest in post-harvest loss solutions. We say we want to invest in an ultra low-cost, shelf life extension technology that is not refrigeration. It\u2019s those kinds of thesis statements that direct us towards what we seek.\n\nTeam picture: L-R. Michael Emmerson, Joel Wanjohi, Bernard Kiprop, Lyndsay Holley Handler, Rodney Carew, Euler Ayaga, Terry Karungi Obel.\n\n\n\nDA: What do you look out for before investing in these startups?\n\nAD: Our ticket size is between $250,000\u2013$750,000 for the seed stage. We look at very early-stage ventures. While there are companies we invest in at the seed stage, we also invest at earlier stages. We invest in early-stage companies that may not yet have a proof of concept or companies that have a proof of concept but need technical de-risking or business model de-risking to get to commercialisation.\n\nSo, it just depends on where the company is, and if we think that there\u2019s a team there that can execute.\n\nDA: I noticed you\u2019ve invested in 23 companies over 5 years. Is that intentional?\n\nAD: We\u2019re not the kind of investor that makes 50 small bets a year. We make a much smaller number of bets and spend time and effort with them. As a result, the success rate of these companies continues to be very high. About 85% of our portfolio companies have gone on to raise further capital.\n\nIf there is a company or concept that is in a really early stage, without a formative team or proof of concept, we work with them to build it out. We have just launched the venture studio which is a practice out of Nairobi and is led by Lindsey Holly handler, who was formerly the CEO of Phoenix in Uganda. The venture studio will be taking these very early-stage businesses or concepts, running them through a tight and lean process to figure out if there is an investable business.\n\nOne example of how we\u2019re doing this with the venture studio today is our recent pilot of a sanitation technology that continuously removes and dries sludge from pits and toilets. This is actually a huge win because it reduces the pathways for viruses and solves the problem around pits being filled up. It also reduces the amount of waste that\u2019s transported, so less greenhouse gas emissions are created from moving sludge from one place to another place.\n\nDA: That\u2019s a very intentional approach.\n\nAD: Yes. I\u2019d also add that I think, in the first couple of years of Factor[e], there was a lot of setting things up and figuring out how they were going to go about helping companies. We had to agree on what the funding structure was going to be like creating an investment thesis in the first place. And so, I would say, the majority of our investments have happened in like the last 4 years. But, in all, it is fair to say we invest a larger ticket size and invest in fewer companies per year in order to spend a lot more time with them.\n\nDA: Fair enough. How long does it take to decide on investing in a company?\n\nAD: Our process could take 60\u201390 days from the first real conversation to investment commitment. That being said, it can always move faster if everything is set up. There are companies that don\u2019t really have all the answers yet and so it takes more time to work with them. It\u2019s most likely because many of these founders are first-time founders.\n\nThis is an open call to founders with experience to work on solving problems in markets that aren\u2019t so attractive but really make a difference. It\u2019s difficult to make a bet on the team, when most of the founders that we look at are first-time founders. I think that\u2019s starting to change a little bit, and so we might be able to start looking at teams and trust them to figure it out, considering that they know how to raise capital and run a business.\n\nIn addition, one of the reasons I think there are other investors or grant-issuing institutions that follow on to invest in our portfolio or issue a grant is because we spend the time to de-risk the companies we invest in. We are thoughtful and not like the handshake-deal type of investor, as fun as that would be.\n\nInterestingly, we were recently just talking about how we can increase our time to close without sacrificing quality. This is because it\u2019s been studied that the more hours you spend on a deal, the better your returns are. There\u2019s a study on angel investors that says, if they spent more than 40 hours on due diligence, they would have at least 2.5x or 3x returns. But for investors that spent more than that, the average returns were 7x.\n\nDA: Hmm interesting. So, what are some red flags you look out for when investing?\n\nHusband-and-wife founding teams. The thinking behind this is that building and leading a startup is challenging. I think a CEO or an entrepreneur needs a support system\u2014whether its family or friends\u2014that\u2019s outside of their work bubble.\n\nIn addition to that, it\u2019s important to point out that we as investors need to be conscious about the human aspect of running a startup. For example, I once spent about 8 months with one of our portfolio companies (60 Hertz) as a product manager, just because I wanted to understand their day-to-day activity. Doing that gave me a better understanding and appreciation of the amount of effort and time that\u2019s put into the companies and the pace at which they operate. As an investor, I think you can dream all you want about the long-term vision of the business and where they should go and what they should do. But to get a better sense of what we need to do tomorrow so that the company survives the next month, we ought not to get too separated from the founders.\n\nThe potential we look out for is progress over time. It\u2019s important that a company solving a problem is making significant progress. A long time between getting the technology ready and getting it into the market is a red flag.\n\nMembers of Factor[e] Nairobi office brainstorming\n\nDA: What are some market trends you notice or look out for?\n\nAD: The emphasis on greenhouse gas reduction and interest in clean tech globally is filtering into our markets.\n\nIt\u2019s a good move for our portfolio companies, which are typically in support of the reduction of greenhouse gas emission, because I think we\u2019re going to start to see the introduction of and more participation in voluntary markets for carbon credits. And that could become another revenue stream for the businesses that are operating in the electricity, utilities, or mobility space. The carbon trading market will see more participants.\n\nCertainly the tailwinds of electric vehicles worldwide is making the case for electrifying all transportation, especially as I\u2019m seeing more companies in sub-Saharan Africa do this. But I don\u2019t think it makes sense to electrify everything. I think that it only makes sense for bikes or tricycles that have either a known route or a very small footprint of operation. It makes sense because you don\u2019t get the range anxiety and are able to operate within a sphere that you can reasonably get around.\n\nLastly, there\u2019s a lot more global investor interest in agritech. And so I think we\u2019re going to start to see more exits and more investment from the global marketplace into agritech on the continent, which would be fantastic.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How Ire Aderinokun is helping to shape Helicarrier's culture",
          "text": "The search for remote work has increased by 490% since the beginning of the pandemic. This means more companies, including big tech ones, have had to move their operations online.\n\nRemote work comes with its own advantages including a reduction in overhead costs with this Stanford report stating that companies can save between $2,000 to $11,000 per employee when they switch to remote work.\n\nIt also expands a company\u2019s reach and allows them to employ global talent, as well as expand to other regions and markets. In 2021, there were a number of product/market expansions on the continent that were fueled by raises and eased by remote work options. This includes Zuri Health\u2019s expansion into Senegal, MarketForce\u2019s entry into Tanzania, Uganda, Ghana and Ethiopia, and even Mono\u2019s expansion into Ghana.\n\nRemote work, however, comes with its own disadvantages including decreased work/life balance, decreased employee visibility, a lack of team synergy, all of which can lead to harmful or stoic work culture.\n\nSo, how can founders, managers, and team leads build remote teams with healthy and sustainable cultures? How can companies manage distributed teams during their growth phase?\n\nIre Aderinokun, COO and VP, Engineering, at Helicarrier has a few answers. In the eighth episode of TechCabal\u2019s Building From Ground Up, Aderinokun speaks to TechCabal\u2019s Managing Editor Koromone Koroye and shares how she\u2019s helping Helicarrier manage its remote team.\n\nFounded in 2017 by Timi Ajiboye, Tomiwa Lasebikan and Ire Aderinokun, Helicarrier was originally Bitkoin Africa, a website for peer-to-peer (P2P) Bitcoin trading. Upon getting into Y Combinator in 2018, Bitkoin Africa morphed into BuyCoins with a number of product offerings including crypto trading. Last year, the trio created Helicarrier as the parent company to house all its products including BuyCoins, Sendcash, Sendcash Pay, and more.\n\nTomiwa Lasebikan, Ire Aderinokun, and Timi Ajiboye at Y Combinator in 2018\n\nWhile the team started with just 5 members, it quickly grew to 10 in its first year. Now, 5 years after launch, Helicarrier boasts of over 50 employees across 4 countries, all of whom are fully remote. So how does Aderinokun, whose office handles operations and staffing, manage her distributed team?\n\nUsing tools to build trust\n\nFor Aderinokun who studied psychology but ended up a software engineer, one of the most important ways Helicarrier has managed its remote team is by using no-code tools everyone can easily learn.\n\n\u201cWe rely a lot on the tools we use. Basecamp is our primary project management tool, and it allows us to keep track of what everyone is doing. But it also allows us to build trust,\u201d Aderinokun said.\n\nHelicarrier operates an asynchronous work structure. A synchronous work mode means that everyone is working simultaneously, and tasks or comments are responded to in real-time and without delay. It\u2019s the method employed by most companies globally. An asynchronous work structure, on the other hand, does not require all hands to work at the same time. This structure allows employees to maximise productivity by working when it best suits them, within reason of course.\n\n\u201cHaving an asynchronous work structure only really works when you have trust in the team, and enabling our team with tools has helped us do just that.\u201d\n\nFor a distributed remote team like Helicarrier\u2019s, asynchronous work also helps to address the difference in time zones. While most of Aderinokun\u2019s team is based in Lagos, Nigeria, a few are based in Ghana, Kenya, and even the UK.\n\n\u201cWe do have a working day, 10 AM to 5 PM and any team meetings we have are usually within this period. But we\u2019re not particular about when people get things done. If someone wants to do 4 hours of work in the middle of the night, that\u2019s fine with us. As long as you\u2019re achieving the set goals, you can work on your own time.\u201d\n\nAccording to Aderinokun, Helicarrier also tries to be sensitive toward its employees\u2019 needs. The company pays its employees dollar stable coins and also pays for daily lunches and internet subscriptions.\n\n\u201cFor our Nigerian-based staff, this helps keep them above water with the increasing inflation rate. It also helps the team understand our vision and value. We\u2019re a crypto company, paying our employees in crypto.\u201d\n\nSmall teams mean tighter bonds\n\nPaying salaries in crypto is not the only unconventional thing Helicarrier does.\n\nUpon hiring new team members, the company offers a one-month paid trial period that helps both employer and employee see if there\u2019s a culture fit. \u201cWith this method, they can see how we work and stay if they\u2019re comfortable. We\u2019ll also get to measure their skills up,\u201d Aderinokun said.\n\nOn building and maintaining company culture, Aderinokun states that most of the team members have direct relationships with 2 of the 3 co-founders.\n\n\u201cEven as we grow, one of the ways we install the company culture is by building direct relationships. So, everyone on the team works directly under one of the 3 co-founders. But we\u2019ve created a system where all team members can have a relationship with another co-founder they don\u2019t work under.\u201d\n\nBecause Helicarrier is still a small team of 50, its solution is feasible. As more team members get hired, though, Aderinokun believes that the team will have to find a sustainable method.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "What does it look like to build a payment network marketplace?",
          "text": "One of the economic importances of a marketplace is that it enables healthy competition. Merchants on ecommerce platforms, like Amazon and Jumia, can list their products for buyers to compare prices and go with the vendors that suit their budget. Aggregating vendors on one platform gives buyers the power of choice, and this drives price competition\u2014especially by bringing it down.\n\nHow would this look when the same model is applied to financial services like payment? Can payment networks be aggregated into one platform for people to compare and then choose a suitable provider? A few years ago, the answer to this would have been no. But, with the increasing need to move money faster across different countries and continents, and the number of available cross-border payment networks, the answer is now yes.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIn answering this question, 4 friends\u2014Kay Akinwunmi (CEO), Korede Fanilola (COO), Tosin Ekolie (CTO), Tola Alade (CDO)\u2014came together to found Zazuu, a fintech marketplace for cross-border payment networks into Africa. It was their way of solving the problem of sending money back home, which has sort of plagued them and their families from childhood. Akinwunmi, especially, who\u2019s originally from Nigeria but has lived in the UK with his family for 18 years, narrated how his mother would journey to Peckham just to send money to Nigeria through an agent because the banks charged a little too much for transfers at the time.\n\nAkinwunmi, who has worked as a software development consultant for 10 years, had the idea for Zazuu in 2016 after running a couple of businesses, including a digital marketing company and a chatbot on the costs of money transfers. Fanilola was a financial analyst who had worked with a couple of firms in the US and UK before Zazuu. Ekolie was one of the early engineers at Checkout.com. He\u2019s also an ex-JP Morgan and ex-Sky employee. Alade, on the other hand, is an award-winning designer.\n\nZazuu is a platform aggregating cross-border payment networks for people who want to send money to Africa from the UK and Europe. The platform stands as a recommendation engine for the best money transfer operators (MTOs) and helps users to compare and find the provider with the best rate and customer service.\n\n\u201cThe idea is to aggregate all the world-regulated money transfer companies into one place and give customers that greater visibility and seamless experience. At the point of sending money, they can see the best rate and just use a button to move money to wherever they want,\u201d Akinwunmi told TechCabal. \u201cAnd that process should be instant and a far better experience than they\u2019d get if they go directly to any of these partners.\u201d\n\nAccording to the World Bank, in 2021, remittances to the sub-Saharan region grew by 6.2% to $45 billion. However, Africa has the highest remittance costs globally, averaging around 9% for making a transaction of $200.\n\nKay Akinwunmi, co-founder and CEO at Zazuu\n\nZazuu\u2019s overarching mission is to bring down the cost of sending money into Africa by providing its users with the power of choice and always-on accessibility. Its platform shows users which money transfer operators (MTOs) are offering the lowest commissions for money transfers.\n\n\u201cSome MTOs charge between 9\u201311%,\u201d says Akinwunmi. \u201cWe look at the market and find the best providers. We show all the fees and also all the hidden costs. This way, we\u2019re getting the average commission down to under 2% for our users.\u201d\n\nTractions and growth\n\nAccording to the startup\u2019s website, users can send money from 8 sending countries including the UK, US, Canada, Belgium, Italy, France, and a few other European countries. On the receiving end, users can receive money in about 11 countries including China, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Uganda, Kenya, and Nigeria, which accounts for the largest international remittance in Africa.\n\nZazuu has 17 MTO partners on its platform including some of the biggest MTOs in the world like WorldRemit, Wise, Azimo, Remitly, and Ria. Akinwunmi also mentioned that the company continues to add more countries on both the sending and receiving end of its operations, and more MTOs.\n\nThe company has officially raised up to $800,000 in seed funding from investors like Founders Factory, in partnership with Standard Chartered Bank. According to the CEO, Zazuu has raised more than that, unofficially.\n\nAkinwunmi also mentioned that Zazuu is Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) regulated. FCA is the same license African fintech companies like Flutterwave and Chipper Cash have to be able to operate in the UK and Europe. \u201cFCA is a big deal for us because it will help us expand our operation globally and quickly,\u201d he added.\n\nHow powerful could Zazuu get?\n\nIt\u2019s somehow obvious that the more the company grows the more its potential for benchmarking how much MTOs charge on transfers becomes clearer. Zazuu is the first marketplace for cross-border payment in the world, and it\u2019s safe to say that the many ways its power can manifest haven\u2019t been fully realised yet.\n\nBut one thing is clear: it will control the rate of cross-border payment in Africa.\n\n\u201cTen years ago, the World Bank said it wanted to drive the cost of cross-border remittance to below 2%, but that hasn\u2019t materialised till now. Again, in 2019, the bank doubled down on that ambition, but nothing has changed because nobody is enforcing it. It\u2019s just all talk and no action,\u201d said Akinwunmi.\n\nAkinwunmi said Zazuu has already started influencing cost restructuring. As of the time of the interview, he mentioned that the rate on the platform is at 1.5%\u2014the lowest anyone transferring money to Africa can get.\n\nZazuu co-founders from L-R: Tola Alade, Kay Akinwunmi, Korede Fanilola, and Tosin Ekolie.\n\nBut the question is, why is the cost coming down when it\u2019s a free market and Zazuu isn\u2019t setting the price? According to Akinwunmi, when Zazuu soft-launched in 2020, the top MTOs on the platform were unpopular agents while big companies like Azimo and Revolut were nowhere to be found on the ranking table because their rates were sort of high and these small agents had the best rate.\n\nNow, to stay on top of the game, the big MTOs have to optimise their pricing to gain visibility on Zazuu. This is one of the powers the startup has. It can become the search engine of cross-border payment into Africa, and to rank high, MTOs would have to optimise their brand by offering the best services across board\u2014including rate and transfer time.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for Zazuu?\n\nIn e-commerce terms, Zazuu can be identified as a \u201cclassified marketplace\u201d because it only provides visibility and matching; everything else is done outside its platform. Once a user chooses a provider, they\u2019re redirected to the provider\u2019s web or mobile app.\n\nBut Zazuu wants more.\n\nApparently the founders have realised the scale of the power they are sitting on and are now ready to optimise and claim it to the fullest. Zazuu wants to scale into a one-stop-shop for cross-border payments; that is, when users come on the platform and choose a provider, they won\u2019t be redirected to the provider\u2019s platform but stay on Zazuu and explore all the functionalities of their chosen provider.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s about to come is going to be an absolute game changer. We want to enable end-to-end transactions within our platform without users having to leave,\u201d said Akinwunmi. \u201cThis is incredible, because right now, most of our customers have 3\u20135 money transfer apps on their phone, and they have to do KYC and identity verification and anti-money laundering checks for all of these different apps. But, now, they\u2019ll have to only deal with Zazuu.\u201d\n\nZazuu also wants to leverage the global increased demand for freelancers and globally distributed workforce to introduce its services to businesses that have employees or partners they need to pay in Africa.\n\nThis is not the first time Africa would experience a fintech marketplace: There was EvolveCredit which aggregated digital lending apps in Nigeria for users to compare and pick the one they wish to take a loan from, right from its platform. But has now become a credit infrastructure and profiling APIs for Africa. However, this is the first time in the world that a company is aggregating not just payment networks but cross-border payment networks. Akinwunmi believes that, soon, more companies with this same business model would spring up. But before then, they are focused on building and improving their products to create a seamless experience for their users.\n\nShare this article",
          "summary": "But, with the increasing need to move money faster across different countries and continents, and the number of available cross-border payment networks, the answer is now yes.\nZazuu is a platform aggregating cross-border payment networks for people who want to send money to Africa from the UK and Europe.\nZazuu is the first marketplace for cross-border payment in the world, and it\u2019s safe to say that the many ways its power can manifest haven\u2019t been fully realised yet.\nBut one thing is clear: it will control the rate of cross-border payment in Africa.\nHowever, this is the first time in the world that a company is aggregating not just payment networks but cross-border payment networks.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese days, everyone and their grandmother wants to be a startup founder or work at startups. You could blame it on the increased focus on entrepreneurship, the success recorded by successful founders, or the allure of a non-conventional work environment; whatever you choose, entrepreneurship has been elevated.\n\nIf you\u2019ve read any tech media recently, you\u2019ve come across funding terms like pre-seed, Series A, or Series B. On Monday, March 14, 2022, Nigerian mobility fintech, Moove, raised a Series A2, leaving many, including startup founders, asking what a Series A2 was. This guide will help you understand startup funding rounds.\n\nTo be clear, raising from investors is not the only option available to startups and many startups choose to bootstrap their operations. In 2021, Mailchimp was sold to Intuit for $12 billion, having been bootstrapped for 20 years.\n\nWhy do startups need to raise money?\n\nA few years ago, it was rare for African businesses to raise money and venture capital investments were infrequent, if not completely absent. The common practice was to save for years before starting a business and, where impossible, get a loan from a bank or family and friends.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, that has changed, and in 2021, African startups raised approximately $5 billion from investors. But why do these startups raise money?\n\nA significant reason is to facilitate growth. By their nature, startups are designed to be fast-paced environments, but that\u2019s not all; everyone involved expects a startup\u2019s growth to be quick.\n\nBetween marketing, product development, and hiring a team, startups often need more money than the founders can put up. In exchange for an investor\u2019s money, they give up a part of their company. This is called equity financing and means that the investor co-owns the business. However, unlike a loan, the investor could lose all their money if the company fails.\n\nPre-seed\n\nThe pre-seed round is considered unofficial by many people, especially outside Africa. However, it is common to see African startups refer to the first round of funds they raise as a pre-seed round.\n\nYour startup is probably still an idea at this stage, usually in its first few months to a year. You may not have evidence to prove that there\u2019s a market for your product or even a team.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmicheile-henderson-lZ_4nPFKcV8-unsplash\n\nInvestment gotten at this stage is often used for market research and building a minimum viable product (MVP). Unless you\u2019ve previously succeeded at a startup, the types of investors you\u2019ll get will often be limited to friends, family, and angel investors.\n\nPre-seed rounds are typically below $1 million, but numerous African startups have raised pre-seed rounds that are above $1 million.\n\nSeed funding\n\nAt the seed funding stage, your startup is ideally more mature than at the pre-seed stage. By this time, you\u2019ve moved from just an idea to a product with some traction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe level of traction will often be determined by the industry where your startup plays and could be anything from revenue to the number of users. Most startups will raise a seed funding round within their first three years of operation.\n\nA report by Briter Bridges and Catalyst Fund puts the average seed round of African startups at $1.7 million compared to $4.6 million and $5.7 million for Indian and Latin American startups, respectively.\n\nSeries A\n\nMany startups do not go beyond the seed funding stage as the founders may believe that what they raise is enough to get them started. There\u2019s no specific stage at which startups raise a Series A, but most will do it within their first five years.\n\nAt the Series A stage, you\u2019ve proven that people like your business and that your business model works. Now, it\u2019s time to scale, and you may be looking at expansion into new territories or significantly increasing your customer base.\n\nConsequently, you\u2019ll look to raise a large amount of money. According to Africa: The Big Deal, in 2021, Series A deals in Africa ranged from $225,000 to $200 million, while the median deal size was $8.3 million.\n\nSeries B\n\nFrom Series A onward, there\u2019s very little difference between the rounds. The funds are raised for growth and usually involve plans for expansion outside their primary market. Startups frequently raise intending to acquire other startups as part of an expansion strategy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, we have seen African startups make acquisitions even before raising a Series A round. The size of the rounds is also larger and for African startups ranges between $2.3 million and $110 million. Startups are ready for their Series B rounds at different times, which could be determined by the industry. Often, startups will be ready for a Series B within seven years of opening shop.\n\nSeries C\n\nVery few companies get to raise beyond a Series B round. Ideally, a startup at the Series A round has proven its business model and hit specific milestones that show progress. A startup is ready to go public or even get acquired from Series C onward.\n\nAt the Series C stage, investors make decisions based on data provided by the business. It is also common to see bigger investors, private equity firms, and hedge funds get involved.\n\nIn some cases, a startup may still raise beyond a Series C. One reason for this is that they have discovered new opportunities for growth and need some injection of capital to get there.\n\nAnother reason could be that they have failed to reach certain milestones, in which case they may raise funds but at a lower valuation than they would have ideally gotten.\n\nWhat kind of investors do you need?\n\nIf startups are vehicles, investors are the filling stations providing them with the fuel needed to drive growth. However, different types of investors exist for different stages of a startup\u2019s funding journey.\n\nSome investors choose to invest at the early stage (pre-seed to Series A), where there is greater risk but also greater reward, while others only invest in later stages (Series A and above). Generally, you\u2019ll have friends, family, angel investors, venture capital firms, private equity firms, hedge funds, and development organisations to choose from.\n\nAngel investors usually invest at the early stages when the startup is probably just an idea on paper and are usually individual investors. There are also angel groups that invest together and super angels \u2013 angel investors who can put up significant sums, often tens of millions.\n\nIt\u2019s also crucial to understand that most investors have a thesis that guides their activities. Some investors are driven by a gender or industry lens, and you\u2019ll boost your chances of success by understanding an investor\u2019s thesis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nWhy Y Combinator is interested in East and North Africa\n\nCredPal\u2019s bridge round\n\nDisney+\u2019s launch in South Africa\n\nWhy Y Combinator is interested in East and North Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaystack CEO, Shola Akinlade speaking to participants at a YC meetup in Lagos\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal with fundraising?\u201d I asked last week while talking with Ogheneruemu, Bolu, Chimgozirim, and Joy. Why do I need to announce that someone or a company has invested in my company?\n\nNonetheless, Bolu\u2019s response changed my perspective on funding news. \u201cIf you were building a business and someone deemed it appropriate to invest in what you are building, it\u2019ll be a big deal to you, believe me,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEssentially, if investors are willing to invest in your startup, you must be doing something spectacular. And one of the VCs I always watch out for is Y Combinator (YC). I don\u2019t know why, but they stand out to me, maybe because they\u2019ve been around for over a decade.\n\nLaunched in 2005, Y Combinator is a startup accelerator based in the United States. It has invested in over 3,000 companies.\n\nFun fact: Before 2012, the accelerator was primarily focused on the United States. It did, however, venture outside the box from time to time, investing in companies based in the United Kingdom and Canada. However, in 2012, the accelerator accepted its first African-focused startup, Wave, a Senegalese fintech startup.\n\nInterestingly, most African startups that have gone through the famous accelerator are founded or operate in the Big Four \u2013 the countries that receive the most venture capital investment.\n\nRecently, YC has invested in countries other than the Big Four, like Namibia. Why is this the case, and what are the chances of success?\n\nFind out here: Investors on high alert as Y Combinator shows interest in East and North Africa\n\nCredPal\u2019s bridge round\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome finance and investment jargons used in funding news are beyond my comprehension. Well, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone in this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy? Recently, Moove, a Nigerian mobility startup, announced a $105 million Series A2 round, and the question on the average Nigerian\u2019s lips was, \u201cWhat is a Series A2 round?\u201d\n\nBesides that, until I started writing this, I had no idea what the term \u201cbridge round\u201d meant. But before we can understand the concept of a bridge round, we must first understand what a bridge loan is.\n\nSo, what is a bridge loan? A bridge loan is a convertible loan that enables businesses to obtain funds between funding rounds quickly. Its goal is to \u201cbridge the gap\u201d between the company\u2019s major funding rounds by providing immediate funding.\n\nConsequently, bridge rounds assist startups in \u201cbridging\u201d the funding gap between larger funding rounds. While they are not always ideal, they may be required to keep the company afloat.\n\nMore information on bridge rounds, including why startups need them and how to structure one for your company, can be found here.\n\nHaving understood that, CredPal, a Nigerian buy now, pay later (BNPL) startup, has closed a bridge round of $15 million in equity and debt to expand its consumer credit offerings across Africa.\n\nThe equity funding was provided by Greenhouse Capital, Uncovered Fund, LongCommerce, First Circle Capital, and Adii Pienaar, Co-founder and former CEO of WooCommerce.\n\nIn 2018, CredPal launched a Point of Sale (PoS) consumer credit service for lower to middle-income earners. Because the concept of BNPL was new in Nigeria and adoption was low, the startup experimented with a new credit offering via cards, which increased usage.\n\nAlso, CredPal wants to expand into Kenya, Egypt, Ghana, and Cameroon. The company stated that a portion of the new investment would go toward securing a partnership with telecom operator, Airtel Nigeria, allowing low to middle-income earners to purchase smartphones in instalments.\n\nDisney+\u2019s launch in South Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Walt Disney Company has announced the South African launch date and prices for the Disney+ streaming service.\n\nOn May 18, 2022, the streaming service will be available in South Africa for R119 ($8.17) per month or R1,190 ($81.69) for an annual subscription.\n\nWhat do subscribers get? They enjoy four concurrent streams, unlimited downloads on ten devices, and the ability to create seven profiles. Parents can also create children\u2019s profiles with access to age-appropriate content.\n\nAlso, Disney will offer thousands of episodes and movies from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and National Geographic. It would also include general entertainment from Star \u2013 Disney\u2019s general entertainment content brand available in select international markets.\n\nThe impending launch adds to South Africa\u2019s already-competitive streaming video entertainment market, including homegrown Showmax, owned by MultiChoice Group, and international players like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Apple TV+.\n\nRecall that Netflix and MultiChoice have increased subscription fees. According to Netflix, the increases are due to the \u201cvalue it provides,\u201d which is the availability of more streaming shows and movies.\n\nGiven that Netflix is gradually phasing out password sharing, this move is a little odd. Netflix\u2019s new policy is one user, one password. Consequently, Netflix users will be charged a fee for sharing their passwords with a third party.\n\nFor context, please read: Netflix to restrict password sharing; how this could affect emerging markets\n\nOn the other hand, MultiChoice has a different story to tell about its subscription increase, citing inflation as its reason. According to the company, the funds raised from the hike will be used to drive quality content across Africa further.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nTo Overcome Your Insecurity, Recognize Where It Really Comes From.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2005, while walking home after dinner, Paul Graham and Jessica Livingston decided to start Y Combinator (YC). At the time, Livingston worked at an investment bank, was dissatisfied with her job, and was exploring other options.\n\nGraham, who had founded Viaweb with Robert Morris and Trevor Blackwell, had a few ideas on how VCs should operate but had put off investing in startups for seven years.\n\nWith a rough idea of how they were going to work, Graham called Morris and Blackwell, who brought $50,000 each while Graham put in $100,000, and so what is now known as Y Combinator was born.\n\nTiming its launch to coincide with the summer holidays for US college students, Y Combinator took in its first batch of startups, including social news aggregator, Reddit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company has invested in over 3,000 companies since 2005 and has expanded its focus to include startups from outside the United States.\n\nInvesting in African startups\n\nAlthough it invested in Infogami \u2013 a UK startup \u2013 YC did not invest in another startup outside the US until 2008, when it invested in a Canadian startup, A Thinking Ape.\n\nIn 2012, the accelerator accepted its first Africa-focused startup, Wave, a fintech startup in Senegal.\n\nOver the next three years, no other African startup made it into YC until 2015, when another Senegalese startup, Oolu, and Kenyan startup, Saida, joined its summer batch. Every year since then has seen at least one African startup get into the famous accelerator programme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWave was YC\u2019s first investment in Africa. Image source: TechCrunch\n\nIn addition, each year has seen more African startups get accepted to YC. In its Summer 2021 batch, 15 startups were from Africa, a record at the time. However, the Winter 2022 batch will smash that record with 24 startups.\n\nThe African startups that have gone through the famous accelerator reveal that most of them are founded or operate in the Big Four \u2013 countries that receive the most venture capital investment.\n\nNigeria leads the way with a whopping 49 startups, while Egypt, a distant second with 11 startups, and Kenya with seven round up the top three. The last member of the Big Four, South Africa, is tied in fifth with Tanzania, Senegal, and Ethiopia.\n\nInvesting in startups operating in these four countries is a no-brainer for most investors. For example, with a population of over 200 million people, Nigeria is Africa\u2019s most populous country. It also has a population mostly under 25 and one of the continent\u2019s highest Internet and smartphone penetration rates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoasting similarly attractive prospects to Nigeria, Egypt has a population of 102 million people. While a large population is not a guarantee of investment, the right environment could do that.\n\nThe Egyptian government\u2019s focus on promoting innovation has been vital, while its Central Bank\u2019s $57 million fund in 2019 has boosted innovation in the fintech sector. Consequently, it received $491 million from VCs in 2021, up from $191 million in 2020.\n\nWhy invest outside the Big Four?\n\nBeyond the usual suspects, Y Combinator has invested in startups founded or operating in Namibia, Uganda, Zambia, and Sudan in the last three years. These countries have received little VC investment in the past decade, so why would Y Combinator invest in startups operating there?\n\nLindsay Amos, Director of Communications at Y Combinator and Michael Siebel, Managing Director and Group Partner at Y Combinator, provided some answers.\n\nIn the beginning, YC invested in early-stage startups, some of which were just ideas. With no product or numbers to guide their judgement, the decision to invest frequently in a startup came down to the founder(s), and Amos says this is something they have retained. The accelerator now invests in startups at different stages but maintains its focus on their founders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfrican YC alumni founders\n\n\u201cWhen deciding whether to fund a startup, we are most interested in the team \u2014 specifically their technical skills, evidence they can build, and how well they work together. We also look for ideas that have the potential to become large companies if the business succeeds, but this is secondary to the founders. We saw this in Numida, Bloom, and Union54.\n\n\u201cWe like to see that the team has the ability to build. Often that means having a technical founder. It can also look like a track record of building or evidence that you can build an incredible team around you to help execute. When building in a highly-regulated industry like financial services, it\u2019s helpful to have some domain expertise,\u201d she said.\n\nA look at the founding teams of these startups supports her claim. For example, Bloom was founded by Ahmed Ismail, Khalid Keenan, Youcef Oudjidane, and Abdigani Diriye. The quartet all studied at top universities in Europe and America with experience gotten by working at companies like Amazon, Barclays Investment Bank, Goldman Sachs, and IBM.\n\nThe same could be said about Union54, another fintech startup founded in Zambia. The startup was built following the founders\u2019 frustration to create debit cards for their first startup, Zazu. Founded by Perseus Mlambo and Alessandra Martini, Union54 (an allusion to the number of African countries) is a card-issuing API startup.\n\nMeanwhile, Numida was founded by Mina Shahid, Catherine Denis, and Ben Best. They brought experience working at notable organisations like the World Bank and studying at the University of Toronto, and the University of Waterloo; also in the mix was the knowledge from having built businesses before.\n\nThe second part of Amos\u2019 response deals with building businesses that could grow big. At the time of YC\u2019s investment in Paystack, there were few payment processors in Nigeria. As one of the first payment processors in Nigeria, it had the potential to get big. A few years later, there are a lot of startups in Nigeria with similar services.\n\nHowever, while the fintech fever has spread across West Africa, the same cannot be said of East Africa, where startups like Bloom and Numida operate. Like their West African neighbours, a broken financial system means that most East Africans are cut off from essential financial services.\n\nAccording to a 2017 World Bank report, only 16% of Ugandans keep their savings in a formal deposit account. The report also stated that more than 65% of Ugandans couldn\u2019t access credit facilities. Without access to quality financial services, these individuals cannot improve the quality of their lives.\n\nNumida, for example, provides working capital loans to small and medium enterprises in the country that reportedly employ 90% of those working in the country\u2019s private sector. On the other hand, Bloom allows Sudanese residents to save in dollars, helping them hedge against inflation.\n\nWhat are the chances of success?\n\nIn some ways, investing in a startup is similar to investing in any other business. Startups don\u2019t succeed in a vacuum, and events in the countries they operate in could affect their operations, as Nigeria\u2019s fintech and mobility startups can attest to.\n\nSo, beyond great founders and business models, is there an enabling environment for these startups to thrive? We begin with Sudan.\n\nDue to the conflict in the North African country, there have been several sanctions from the United Nations, the United States, and the European Union since 1997. The sanctions were gradually removed from 2017, with the United States finally taking the country off its list of sponsors of terrorism in 2021. In October 2021, the country also received its first VC investment in over 25 years as digital marketplace, alsoug closed a $5 million round.\n\nA major reason for the Sudanese government seeking to get these sanctions removed was to improve the country\u2019s economy since it couldn\u2019t conduct business with most countries. However, a 2018 BBC report claimed that very little had changed in the country, with inflation going through the roof despite the sanctions being lifted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumida team. Source: TechCrunch\n\nAt the time, inflation was 55%, but it has since risen to 115%, according to data from the World Bank. Ironically, one of Bloom\u2019s value propositions is to help its users hedge against inflation by saving in dollars.\n\nAs great as that sounds, one would need to have money before thinking about hedging against inflation and with 36% of Sudanese living in poverty, it appears the problem is bigger than hedging against inflation.\n\nIn Uganda, the story is slightly different. With Numida focused on providing working capital to the country\u2019s SMEs, it would seem that they have found the perfect niche to play in serving the country\u2019s SMEs. With 77% of the population younger than 30 and only 75,000 jobs for the 700,000 Ugandans who reach working age annually, the country could do with more Numidas.\n\nFor Seibel, YC is committed to working with smart and motivated founders to bring more innovation and opportunity to Africa.\n\n\u201cWe believe that African startup founders will be a massive part of the continued development of the continent. I predict that many African countries will leapfrog countries in other parts of the world because they will be faster to adopt more modern software solutions in their economies,\u201d he said.\n\nWith Y Combinator\u2019s reputation for picking winners, one would hope that its recent investments will spur other investors to pay attention to startups from these regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "title": "Train attack: Names of prominient dead, missing, injured victims emerge as Buhari, NASS drop hint for security chiefs",
          "text": "Kaduna state Governor Nasir el-Rufai has confirmed that eight dead bodies were recovered, 26 people injured, with several passengers onboard the Abuja-Kaduna train attacked Monday night by bandits, still missing.\n\nThe train departed Abuja minutes after 6pm Monday evening and attacked between Kateri and Rijana, as bandits bombed the train track leaving it stranded before attacking the train and its passengers.\n\nKaduan state Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Mr Samuel Aruwan, in a statement Tuesday said: \u201cThe Kaduna state government has received from the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC), the detailed passenger manifest for the Abuja-Kaduna train service AK9 which was attacked by terrorists Monday.\n\n\u201cAccording to the documents received, 398 passengers bought tickets for the trip, but 362 were validated as having boarded the train through the recognized turnstile. The passenger manifest does not include NRC staff and security officials who were on board.\n\n\u201cSecurity agencies have reported that eight bodies were recovered and 26 persons were injured during the attack. Investigations are still ongoing to ascertain the status of the passengers who were on board the train and remain unaccounted for at the time of this update. Search operations are also being sustained.\n\n\u201cCitizens are requested to contact the Kaduna State Emergency Management Agency on the phone line 09088923398, to make enquiries or provide information regarding passengers who were on board the Abuja-Kaduna train AK9,\u201d Aruwan said.\n\nThe missing, dead passengers\n\nIn a related development, the Secretary General, Trade Union Congress (TUC), Comrade Musa Lawal Ozigi and the Kwara state branch chairman of the union, Comrade Akin Akinsola, were among victims of the Kaduna train attack.\n\nA statement by TUC president, Comrade Quadri Olaleye, said they were on their way to Kaduna for an official assignment slated for Tuesday 29 March, 2022.\n\nWhile expressing sadness over the development, Olaleye urged government at all levels to brace up by ensuring the safety of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cComrade Ozigi served in the capacity of General Secretary, Construction and Civil Engineering Senior Staff Association (CCESSA), an affiliate of TUC for almost two decades before he joined the Congress in 2012. Comrade Akinsola was a staff of Dangote Flour Mill under OLAM. They were both seasoned Trade Unionists.\n\n\u201cWe call on government at all levels, especially the Federal Government to rise up to the occasion to stop the killing of innocent Nigerians. As it stands, nowhere is safe now \u2013 we cannot travel by air, road is not safe and neither is the rail. Is Nigeria a failed state? It is unfortunate.\n\n\u201cThe Congress condoles with the families and friends of our comrades and the good people of Kogi State for this irreparable loss. May God rest their souls.\u201d\n\nAlso, a female medical doctor with St Gerald\u2019s Hospital, Chinelo Megafu, was also reported to have been killed in the incident.\n\nSimilarly, Managing Director Bank of Agriculture Alwan Hassan and his niece, were among missing victims of the train attack, just as a former deputy governor in Zamfara state, Malam Ibrahim Wakkala, was equally shot in the leg.\n\nHe is still in the hospital recuperating.\n\nHassan, whose line was reportedly switched off, it was gathered, may have been one of the victims whisked away by the terrorists with cars the criminals brought to the scene.\n\nCOAS orders\n\nMeanwhile, the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lt. General Faruk Yahaya, Tuesday visited the scene of the train attack, with a charge to troops to gun down the terrorists in the area.\n\nHe was accompanied on the visit by some principal staff officers of the Army Headquarters and the General Officer Commanding 1 Division.\n\nAfter assessing the level of damage, the COAS then ordered troops of the Nigerian Army and other security agencies to intensify their search and rescue operations to hunt down the terrorists and ensure rescue of the kidnapped victims.\n\nIn the same vein, the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) expressed shock at the twin attack which it described as unprecedented in Nigerian history.\n\nIn a statement by the state chairman of the party, Hon. Felix Hassan Hyat, the PDP said: \u201cThe PDP received with shock, news of an attack on a passenger train along the Abuja-Kaduna railway last night. This is coming barely 24 hours after a similar attack on the Kaduna International Airport by terrorists in which a staff of the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA) lost his life.\n\n\u201cThe speed at which bandits and terrorists are taking over communities, highways, and most recently the airport and railway is unprecedented in the history of Kaduna state. Hapless citizens have continued to be killed, maimed or displaced with no signs that the bandits would be slowing down or the APC-led government in the state would bring the insecurity challenge to an end.\n\n\u201cThe current security malaise in the state is certainly not what the people of Kaduna state bargained for. No one could ever have imagined, seven years ago, that a time would come when bandits and terrorists would take over our communities, our highways or even railways in such a brazen and daring fashion. There\u2019s simply a total failure of governance especially as it affects the security of lives and property. This is unacceptable.\u201d\n\nBuhari orders security chiefs\n\nAnd in his reaction, President Muhammadu Buhari condemned the attacks and directed the immediate conclusion of all the processes for the implementation of the integrated security surveillance and monitoring solution for the Abuja to Kaduna railway line.\n\nHe also directed that the system be extended to cover the Lagos-Ibadan railway line, a statement from his Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mr Garba Shehu, said.\n\nThe president gave these directives in Abuja Tuesday, after receiving briefs from the Service Chiefs led by the Chief of Defence Staff, General Lucky Irabor, with the Chief of Army Staff, Lt-General Yahaya, and the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Isiaka Amao.\n\nThe meeting, held in the State House, also had in attendance the Inspector General of Police, Usman Baba, Major General Samuel Adebayo, the Chief of Defence Intelligence and the Director General of the Department of State Services(DSS), Yusuf Magaji Bichi.\n\nThe statement quoted the president as charging the security chiefs to bring back all passengers kidnapped and ensure the terrorists were hunted down and made to face justice for their heinous acts.\n\n\u201cNo one should be allowed to hold the country to ransom,\u201d the statement quoted the President as saying.\n\nIt further said the president strongly condemned the bombing of the passenger train, describing it as a \u201cmatter of grave concern.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike most Nigerians, I am deeply pained by its occurrence, the second of its type, which has resulted in the death of a yet to be determined number of passengers and others who suffered injuries.\n\n\u201cThe attack on the train, a safe means of transport to many, is callous; and our thoughts are with the families of the deceased and prayers for the injured,\u201d he said.\n\nNASS worries\n\nSimilarly, the National Assembly also expressed grave concern over what it called the worsening security situation in the country.\n\nIt consequently called on the military and various security agencies to carry out full scale war against the terrorists and bandits in all their theatres of cooperation.\n\nIt specifically called on the Army and Air Force to carry out constant bombardments of hideouts of the devilish terrorists.\n\nThese were sequel to urgent motion sponsored to that effect by Senator Uba Sani (APC Kaduna Central).\n\nSenator Sani who rose through orders 41 and 51 of the Senate\u2019s standing rules to get his motion debated, lamented the security situation in Kaduna state , saying it is getting worrisome on daily basis with attendant loss of innocent lives .\n\nHe said: \u201cWithin the last one week, terrorists or bandits , have stepped up their attacks in the State with killings of innocent citizens and deadly attacks on government facilities , the latest of which was the Kaduna bound train attack on Monday evening where scores of passengers were kidnapped and some killed.\n\n\u201cThe latest attacks by these murderous elements took place in some communities in Giwa Local Government, namely Angwan Sarki Yahya, Tashar Shari, Bare-Bari, Tsaunin Natal, Dillalai, Durumi and Jatin Kanwa, all on Yakawada Ward.\n\n\u201d Other places affected include Kaya community, Mai kyauro and Fatika. They killed 50 persons and kidnapped over 100 people. They also made strategic roads in Giwa Local Government no go areas.\n\n\u201cNot done with their devilish acts, they made an attempt to penetrate the Kaduna International Airport. Although the attack was foiled by vigilant security operatives, one person lost his life.\n\n\u201cWhen people were trying to come to grips with a week-long wanton destruction of lives and property, the terrorists struck again. Bandits also attacked a Kaduna bound train carrying over 970 passengers around Kateri \u2013 Rijana axis in Kaduna, just a few kilometers to the Rigasa Train Station in Igabi Local Government Area of the State.\n\n\u201cThe train derailed after the first wave of attacks. Grenades and RPG were used. They rained bullets on all the coaches. Some passengers were killed, while many sustained bullet wounds.\n\n\u201cThere are reports that some of the passengers were abducted. The terrified passengers only breathed a sigh of relief when security agencies arrived and secured the train and the area. It\u2019s been a reign of undiluted terror.\n\n\u201cIt is disheartening that these enemies of the people are getting emboldened by the day. They are becoming more brazen. These blood cuddling vampires have no regard for human life. They have no place in a civilized society.\u201d\n\nIn separate contributions, Senators Suleiman Kwari (APC Kaduna North) and Danjumah La\u2019ah ( PDP Kaduna South ), said heinous operations by terrorists in Kaduna state were no longer news as they happen on daily basis\n\nIn particular, Senator Kwari gave gory details of violence unleashed on passengers of the ill-fated train by terrorists.\n\nAccording to him, those rescued by security agencies out of the 970 passengers trekked in the bush for two hours.\n\nReps\n\nAlso, after an extensive debate on the growing insecurity in Nigeria at the plenary, Tuesday, the House of Representatives resolved that its leadership should meet with the heads of military and paramilitary agencies to discuss the security situation in the country.\n\nThose to appear before the House include the National Security Adviser, Maj.-Gen. Babagana Monguno (retd.); Minister of Defence, Maj.-Gen. Bashir Magashi (retd.); Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Isiaka Amao; Director-General, Department of State Services, Yusuf Bichi; Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba; Minister of Transport, Rotimi Amaechi; Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika; Director-General, NCAA, Musa Nuhu; Managing Director, FAAN, Rabiu Yadudu; Managing Director, NAMA, Mathew Pwajok; and General Manager, Nigerian Railway Corporation, Fidet Okhiria.\n\nDeputy Speaker of the House, Ahmed Wase, who presided at the session, said the Committees on Aviation, National Security and Intelligence, Police Affairs, Army, Air Force, Defence and Land Transport would work with the leadership on the probe.\n\n\u201cWe beg that the invitation be sent as soon as possible. Hopefully, we will start the meeting from tomorrow (Wednesday),\u201d Wase said.\n\nThe resolution was based on a motion of urgent public importance moved by the Chairman of the House Committee on Aviation, Nnolim Nnaji, titled, \u2018Urgent Need for the Federal Government to Investigate the Recent Attack at Kaduna International Airport and Reinforce Security Surveillance and Personnel in All the Nigerian Airports.\u2019\n\nMoving the motion, Nnaji recalled that about a year ago, bandits attacked the staff quarters of the FAAN at the Kaduna International Airport and abducted about 12 persons.\n\nHe also recalled that on Friday, there was \u201ca horrific\u201d attack on the airport, leading to the death of a security guard working with NAMA.\n\nThe lawmaker expressed concern that the attacks on the airport might escalate to other airports across the country, if not prevented.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe House is worried that no one is safe to travel by air if positive steps are not taken urgently to safeguard our airports from bandits\u2019 attacks, considering the international standards on airport security management as outlined by International Civil Aviation Organisation.\u201d\n\nNnaji decried that while flights on the Kaduna route were being suspended over the attack on the airport, a train on the Abuja-Kaduna rail line was also attacked Monday night, with the Nigerian Railway Corporation suspending train services on the route indefinitely.\n\n\u201cWhat it means is that the only means of transportation now to Kaduna is the road. Definitely, if it happens in other places; if they start attacking our airports, the implication is that even the international airlines will stop coming to Nigeria. That is the implication.\n\n\u201cAnd the premium on our local airlines \u2013 the premium on their insurance \u2013 will go up and the implication is that (the cost of) air tickets will double. That is why I am asking that the leadership should come to our aid to see how we can solve this problem. It is not just a committee issue; it has to do with the entire House led by the leadership, to see how we can unravel this situation.\u201d\n\nDuring the debate, Leke Abejide made reference to a statement allegedly made by Governor , asking the Armed Forces to bombard the forests housing the terrorists and flush them out.\n\nAbejide partly said: \u201cI just want to know whether these bandits live in hell or they live here on earth. If they are living within Nigerian territory, how come our military cannot locate where they are?\n\n\u201cIf you notice now, a former Governor of Zamfara State was shot yesterday in the process of this attack. A lady \u2013 a medical doctor \u2013 was killed that same yesterday in the same attack. Who knows who would be the next? Most of our colleagues here depend on that train from Abuja to Kaduna every week, to visit their constituencies. How long will we continue to be talking about the same problem?\u201d\n\nIn his contribution, Majority Whip Mohammed Monguno said: \u201cMy suggestion is that, as part of our resolution, we should call on the executive arm of government to declare a state of emergency on the security sector.\u201d\n\nIn a similar position, another lawmaker, Aminu Suleiman said: \u201cI never believed that this incident really happened. It surprises me and truly troubles me as a person that this thing could happen in the Federal Republic of Nigeria. This thing that happened \u2013 that truly happened \u2013 actually challenged us as a nation.\n\n\u201cI think these bandits have taken these deliberate killings to the sovereignty of this country, far beyond what we can comprehend. So, we must accept collective failure.\u201d\n\nThe lawmaker urged the House to \u201cpresent a very formidable front\u201d to prevent a recurrence of such attacks. \u201cAnd for it not to happen, somebody somewhere must be held responsible,\u201d he stated.\n\nSuleiman also noted that, \u201cit couldn\u2019t have just been ordinary, that these people drive through the cities and challenge the security of our airport. It is not only reprehensible but also a display of general ineptitude on the part of the security (agencies) responsible for security in our airports.\u201d",

It must stop. First, as leaders, we owe the victims and their relations an apology as these unwarranted acts of violence are becoming too regular and they basically question our collective capacity to govern,\u201d the NGF said in the statement signed by Chairman, Kayode Fayemi.\n\nREAD ALSO: Abuja-Kaduna Train Attack: \u2018I Warned That Lives Will Be Lost\u2019 \u2013 Amaechi\n\nThey prayed that God would grant those that lost their lives eternal peace and wish those that were injured speedy recovery to resume their lives and put their heartless aggressors to shame.\n\nThe governors added that \u201cif the intention of the murderers is to disrupt the peaceful coexistence of Nigerians, they will not succeed and when eventually total peace returns to the country, they will surely either be lifeless or excluded. I can assure you that this is an ugly phase in our national experience. It will certainly pass.\u201d\n\nThey also expressed condolences to Nigerians, the Kaduna State government, and the people of Kaduna State.\n\nThey applauded the Nigerian security agents for their efforts in coming to the rescue of the victims of the attack.\n\n\u201cWe want to salute the bravery of our security forces in curtailing the magnitude of havoc this attack was intended to visit on innocent travelers. Our prayers are with you.\n\n\u201cWe would continue to drum our support for the professional work you do and provide assistance in enhancing your operational strength and combat readiness. We recognize the enormous risk you take every day,\u201d the forum said.\n\nThey added that those behind the attack will certainly not take over Nigeria.\n\n\u201cTheir violent demeanour will not result in anything positive instead it will confine them to an uncomfortable life in the jungle until the long arm of the law catches up with them.\u201d\n\nOn a final note, the NGF asked those in authority to immediately install all necessary safeguards to forestall future acts of banditry on our rail tracks, roads, ports, and borders.",

Of course not,\u201d he said, adding Russia had bombarded Chernihiv \u201call night long\u201d.\n\nOn Tuesday, Russia said it would cut back operations around Chernihiv and the capital, Kyiv.\n\nAir raid sirens sounded in Kyiv in the early hours of Wednesday, hours after Russia said it would withdraw some troops from around the capital.\n\nKyiv\u2019s deputy mayor, Mykola Povoroznyk, said the capital itself had not been shelled overnight, although gunfire had been heard from battles around the city.\n\nUS and Ukrainian officials say Russia is continuing to reposition forces away from Kyiv, probably as part of an effort to refocus on eastern regions.\n\nRussia\u2019s Deputy Defence Minister, Alexander Fomin, said the country would \u201cradically, by several times reduce the military activity\u201d in an effort to \u201cboost mutual trust\u201d in peace talks.\n\nDelegations from Moscow and Kyiv held three hours of discussions in Istanbul on Tuesday aimed at bringing to a close more than a month of fighting in Ukraine.\n\nUkraine said it had proposed to become a neutral state in exchange for security guarantees. A key aim of Russia\u2019s invasion was to stop Ukraine joining the Nato alliance and Russian officials said the talks had moved to a practical stage.\n\nRussia\u2019s pledge to cut back military activity was met with scepticism. \u201cUkrainians are not naive people,\u201d President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an overnight video address.\n\nMr Zelensky said that initial signs from the peace talks were \u201cpositive\u201d, but added that they did not \u201cdrown out\u201d the explosions of Russian shells.\n\nOther countries also reacted with caution. US President Joe Biden said: \u201cI don\u2019t read anything into it until I see what their actions are.\u201d\n\nLeaders from UK, France, Germany and Italy also urged the West not to drop its guard against Russia.\n\nIn his comments on Telegram, Mr Chaus said Russian forces had been \u201ccarrying out strikes on [the city of] Nizhyn, including air strikes, and all night long they hit [the city of] Chernihiv\u201d.\n\nThe BBC has not been able to confirm this independently.\n\nOne resident of Chernihiv told the BBC: \u201cThis night was rough. We heard there was fighting all night in the suburbs, away from the city centre. We heard artillery. But there was no aviation tonight.\u201d\n\nThe mayor of Chernihiv city, Vladyslav Atroshenko, said Russia\u2019s pledge to ease its assaults on Kyiv and Chernihiv would be good news if it could be trusted.\n\nHe told the BBC that as recently as Tuesday, \u201cinhuman artillery shelling of several residential areas of the city took place, where about 35 people were hospitalised, where people lost their legs and some people were killed\u201d.",

          "text": "Russia\u2019s pledge to scale back some military operations in Ukraine drew skepticism, a bitter reality check in a rare moment of optimism five weeks into what has devolved into a bloody war of attrition.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said there was no reason to believe Russia\u2019s announcement that it would reduce military activity near Kyiv, the capital, as well as in the northern city of Chernihiv, given what\u2019s happening on the ground.\n\n\u201cWe can call those signals that we hear at the negotiations positive,\u201d he said in his nightly video address to the Ukrainian people. \u201cBut those signals don\u2019t silence the explosions of Russian shells.\u201d\n\nStill, Tuesday\u2019s talks sketched out what could end up being a framework for ending the war that has imposed an increasingly punishing toll, with thousands dead and more than 4 million Ukrainians fleeing the country. The talks had been expected to resume on Wednesday, but with what Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu called \u201cmeaningful\u201d progress made, the two sides decided to return home for consultations.\n\nAt the conference in Istanbul, Ukraine\u2019s delegation laid a framework under which the country would declare itself neutral and its security would be guaranteed by an array of other nations.\n\nRussian Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin said Moscow would in the meantime \u201cfundamentally \u2026 cut back military activity in the direction of Kyiv and Chernihiv\u201d to \u201cincrease mutual trust and create conditions for further negotiations.\u201d\n\nHe did not spell out what that would mean in practical terms.\n\nRussian delegation head Vladimir Medinsky said negotiators would take Ukraine\u2019s proposals to Russian President Vladimir Putin and then Moscow would provide a response, but he did not say when.\n\nCavusoglu said he expected a meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers at an unspecified time. Another between the presidents of the two countries is also \u201con the agenda,\u201d he said. Russian state news agency Tass reported that Moscow\u2019s delegates arrived back in Russia late Tuesday.\n\nIn the wake of the flurry of proposals and some muted optimism, Zelenskyy warned the world and his own people not to get ahead of themselves. He said Ukrainian troops had forced Russia\u2019s hand, adding that \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t let down our guard\u201d because the invading army can still carry out attacks.\n\n\u201cUkrainians are not na\u00efve people,\u201d he said. \u201cUkrainians have already learned during the 34 days of the invasion and during the past eight years of war in the Donbas that you can trust only concrete results.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. and others also expressed doubts about Russia\u2019s intentions.\n\nWhile Moscow portrayed it as a goodwill gesture, its ground troops have become bogged down and taken heavy losses in their attempts to seize Kyiv and other cities. Last week and again on Tuesday, the Kremlin seemed to lower its war aims, saying its \u201cmain goal\u201d is gaining control of the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas region in eastern Ukraine.\n\n\u201cWe judge the Russian military machine by its actions, not just its words,\u201d British Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab told Sky News on Wednesday. \u201cThere\u2019s obviously some skepticism that it will regroup to attack again rather than seriously engaging in diplomacy.\u201d\n\nHe added that \u201cof course the door to diplomacy will always be left ajar, but I don\u2019t think you can trust what is coming out of the mouth of Putin\u2019s war machine.\u201d\n\nBritain\u2019s Ministry of Defense said Wednesday that Russia stating a focus on Donetsk and Luhansk in the Donbas region \u201cis likely a tacit admission that it is struggling to sustain more than one significant axis of advance.\u201d\n\n\u201cRussian units suffering heavy losses have been forced to return to Belarus and Russia to reorganize and supply,\u201d the ministry said in a statement. \u201cSuch activity is placing further pressure on Russia\u2019s already strained logistics and demonstrates the difficulties Russia is having reorganizing its units in forward areas within Ukraine.\u201d",
