          "text": "The United States has given conditions for recognising a Taliban government in Afghanistan.\n\nUS Department spokesman, Ned Price, said on Monday that the US would only recognise a Taliban government in Afghanistan if it respects the rights of women and shuns, denounces extremist movements such as Al-Qaeda.\n\n\u201cUltimately when it comes to our posture towards any future government in Afghanistan, it will depend upon the actions of that government. It will depend upon the actions of the Taliban,\u201d State Price told reporters when asked about recognition.\n\n\u201cA future Afghan government that upholds the basic rights of its people, that doesn\u2019t harbor terrorists and that protects the basic rights of its people including the basic fundamental rights of half of its population \u2013 its women and girls \u2014 that is a government we would be able to work with,\u201d AFP quoted Price as saying.\n\nHe said that the US negotiator on Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, remained in the Taliban\u2019s diplomatic base of Qatar and that US officials have been in talks with the insurgents in the Gulf state.\n\nAlso, US President Joe Biden promised to prioritise the treatment of women and girls under the Taliban in Afghanistan.\n\nBiden said this during his national address on Monday.\n\nIn a copy of the speech obtained by The PUNCH, the US president said, \u201cWe will continue to support the Afghan people. We will lead with our diplomacy, our international influence and our humanitarian aid. We\u2019ll continue to push for regional diplomacy and engagement to prevent violence and instability.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll continue to speak out for the basic rights of the Afghan people, of women and girls, just as we speak out all over the world.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been clear, the human rights must be the centre of our foreign policy, not the periphery. But the way to do it is not through endless military deployments. It\u2019s with our diplomacy, our economic tools and rallying the world to join us.\u201d",

          "text": "The Nigeria Police Force has arrested 39 suspected criminals in some parts of the country for their involvement in armed robbery, kidnapping, murder, arms trafficking, and cybercrime.\n\nSome of the exhibits recovered from the suspects are two RPG launchers, 13 AK47 rifles, four locally made pistols, 58 wraps of dynamite, 769 AK47 live ammunition, 14 AK47 magazines, 30 live cartridges, mobile phones, 157 SIM cards, amongst other incriminating items.\n\nThis was disclosed in a statement issued and signed by Force Public Relations Officer, CP Frank Mba on Tuesday.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cNotable among the cases is the arrest of a four-man notorious trans-border arms smuggling syndicate in Cross River State. The principal suspect, Ntui Lambert, \u2018m\u2019, a 36-year-old native of Ikom, in Cross River State \u2013 whose father is a Nigerian and mother, a Cameroonian \u2013 was arrested in possession of different calibre of sophisticated weapons, 58 wraps of explosive materials suspected to be dynamite and ammunition through an intelligence-led operation by Police operatives. Further investigations by the Police team revealed that the suspect engages in trans-border arms smuggling with his three other gang members who are members of a secessionist group in Cameroun.\n\n\u201cSimilarly is the arrest of one Yahaya Zakari a.k.a Excellency, \u2018m\u2019, 46 years old, in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. Yahaya is a member of a cybercrime syndicate that specialises in stealing mobile phones of innocent citizens and using their SIM cards to gain access to their bank accounts to carry out unauthorised financial transactions. Other members of his gang are Shehu Aliyu \u2018m\u2019 22 years old, Umar Abubakar \u2018m\u2019 42 years old, and Abubakar Mohammed \u2018m\u2019 41 years old. A total of 157 SIM cards were recovered from the gang by the Police team.\n\n\u201cEqually, two Rocket Propelled Grenade launchers were also recovered from one 78-year-old Okala Joseph in Makurdi, Benue State. Investigations revealed that the suspect is a middleman between criminal suppliers of the weapon and the end-users. He is currently assisting the Police with vital information that will further help in breaking the supply chain and arresting other suspects.\n\n\u201cThe Inspector-General of Police, IGP Usman Alkali Baba, psc (+), fdc, NPM has reassured citizens that the Force remains committed to ensuring that perpetrators of criminal acts are brought to book and justice served to their victims. He enjoined members of the public to be vigilant and promptly report any suspicious activity to the Police. He further advised that citizens should exercise necessary caution in the use of their mobile phones, especially those with SIM cards linked to their bank accounts.\n\n\u201cAll the suspects will be charged to court on completion of investigations.\u201d",

          "title": "Moet and Nicole: Spilling The Tea",
          "text": "With the COVID-19 pandemic, the rise of digital media such as podcasts has only continued to increase. Jumping on the train of making it a part of their life and most importantly, giving listeners an opportunity to learn from different life issues, celebrity radio presenter and actress, Moet Abebe, and multimedia journalist Nicole Abebe are poised to giving the audience visual elements of a Talk Show, as well as the possibility of enjoying a show on a podcast format with the launch of in producart format ; \u2018Spill the Tea With the Abebes.\u2019\n\nThe show seeks to \u2018address topics that affect young people, but often shy away from. For the Abebes, talking about these topics such as rape, human trafficking, sexual assault, and gender violence amongsts others need to be discussed because talking about, them they believe is the beginning of making certain individual corrections and ultimately correcting the ills prevalent in our society today. They tell us more.\n\nMOET ABEBE: Being an only child helped shape me Between you and Nicole, whose idea was Spill the Tea and what inspired it?\n\nIt was a joint effort as well as that of the new Director and Producer, Sefinah Lamii. We all were casually having a \u201cgirl\u2019s night, in\u201d and we all realized how well Nicole and I work together, our chemistry and banter are effortless. So, it just came about naturally that we should work together.\n\nWho is your target audience and why?\n\nOur target audiences are millennials both here in Africa and in the Diaspora. That is, men and mostly, women between the age of 25 and 45.\n\nWhat should your viewers expect from your podcasts?\n\nThey should expect a show that entertains, enlightens, and educates. Viewers should be expecting to see different perspectives, opinions and views about these said topics. This would leave them no choice but to want to do their own bit, to change some of these backdated social narratives.\n\nAre you planning on bringing guests and what would you look out for in your guests?\n\nYes, we are planning on having guests on the show. The guests on the show have been handpicked specifically in relation to the topics. Every guest present on this season is able to add their own perspective ,by bringing in their personal experiences, and using them as examples. The viewer will easily be able to relate to these guests because they are all celebrities and social contributors who are doing very well in their various fields. The guests give out their own advice and also gain a thing or two from myself and Nicole\u2019s contributions and vice versa.\n\nTell us a bit about yourself, growing up years and events that shaped you into who you are today?\n\nI spent most of my developing years here in Nigeria and the United Kingdom. I did my nursery and primary education in Lagos, then secondary and University was in the UK. I feel the constant back and forth between these two countries really shaped me into becoming the open-minded and non judgmental person that I am today. I have always had to deal with the two cultures and to create a balance. As an only child, this has really helped to shape me into becoming an independent and hardworking woman.\n\nYou read Law but have been in the media for some time now; tell us what informed the switch?\n\nYes, I have. I honestly didn\u2019t want a monotonous life. I felt I could contribute more and what better way than delve into the media industry where my voice can be heard and creatively expressed.\n\nWhat do you find fascinating about being a radio personality?\n\nI love the fact that my voice and input can touch someone many miles away. The fact that people know the voice and can spot it anywhere is exciting. The fact that just being myself and speaking on my interests or things that affect me, equally affect the listener is such an exhilarating and powerful feeling. I absolutely love it.\n\nWhat or who inspires you in life and why?\n\nIn all honesty, I inspire myself. I am such a survivor and fighter. I keep pushing myself. I believe I can do more and guess what, I keep proving myself that I can achieve anything I put my mind to\n\nDo you intend to practice law in future?\n\nNo, I do not intend to practice.\n\nShare an example of when you established and accomplished a goal that was personally challenging. What helped you succeed?\n\nBeing the Executive Producer of this show has been the most challenging thing I have done. Having to do everything practically on my own, especially the funding of the show. From its inception to now, the accomplished product has not been an easy road. However, what I believe helped me succeed definitely has been God, and having the best production team to support me and bring my ideas to life.\n\nWhat do you do to keep fit and stay healthy?\n\nI try to, at least, stay active as much as I can. I am also very particular about what I take into my body and at what time.\n\nHow do you balance your work and private life?\n\nI\u2019m able to balance the two, by not allowing factors from either, cross into the other. I just try my best not to mix the two. The parties present in my work life are not in my private life and vice versa.\n\nWhen you are not working, how do you spend your \u201cme\u201d time?\n\nThere are two things I love aside from being in front of the camera and a microphone. They are going to the spa and going to the beach. Those are the ways I really get to relax and spend \u201cme\u201d time.\n\nBest holiday destination?\n\nIt would have to be Seychelles.\n\nWhat lessons would you say life has taught you over the years?\n\nNothing is permanent, not even being alive. So just live your life to the fullest, and love with a pure and good heart.\n\nNICHOLE ABEBE: Our visual podcasts provide fresh and fun new content\n\nHow did you and Moet get together on this job, what is your relationship like?\n\nWhere do I begin with my big cousin Moet? In my first year of university, we had to gain some work experience in the media industry, and luckily for me, I was coming home to Nigeria for the summer. It is where I first met Moet, and I am glad I met her. Moet has become one of my favourite people in this world. She\u2019s beyond caring, as real as real can be, and I know hands down she\u2019s got my back. I love to annoy her at times (which you will see in the podcast) but it\u2019s really all love. I\u2019m super grateful to have her in my life. We always joke about working together one day, but now that it\u2019s a reality, I wouldn\u2019t want to do it with anyone else.\n\nOf what benefit do you think the podcast will be to your viewers?\n\nI believe our visual podcasts will provide viewers with fresh and fun new content. When Moet and I set out to create \u2018Spill The Tea\u2019, we wanted something people could get lost in. From the visually appealing set design, to the fun and colourful outfits we wear, down to the intriguing conversations we have. Every aspect of Spill The Tea With The Abebes was intentional. We only got better as the season went on.\n\nHow do you hope to come up with fresh interview ideas?\n\nThe fact that we wake up every morning, with breath in our lungs, and God\u2019s grace to be granted the gift of sight, we will always have new content. Things happen every day, not just to us, but to the viewers watching. As human beings, we have so much in common that we don\u2019t even realise. We all go through similar emotions and experiences at different stages in our lives. As long as our content is relatable, I don\u2019t think we have a problem there.\n\nWhat was growing up like for you?\n\nI was born in London before I moved back to Lagos when I was three months old. I attended Corona Primary School in Victoria Island up until primary three. At this point, my family moved back to London where I finished up my primary school education at Lady Banks Junior School. When I was 11 years old, I attended Burford School, a boarding school in Oxfordshire.\n\nI spent my formidable years there. I often say this is where I spent some of my best school years. I left Burford when I was 16 and attended The Chelsea Independent College in London for my A-Levels. I gained my undergrad degree from the University of Bedfordshire in Broadcast Journalism, before attending The New York Film Academy in New York City for my masters in Broadcasting. I have great memories when I think back to my school days, a lot of cringe memories too\u2026but I\u2019m trying to forget those.\n\nWhat informed your choice of career as a teenager?\n\nSo, growing up, I loved Hollywood for all the amazing movies they produced. I used to say to myself, \u201cwell I know I can\u2019t act, so how can I be a part of Hollywood without being in the movies?\u201d That was when my attention moved to Ryan Seacrest, the American television presenter, producer. I became obsessed with his job and how he did it so well. I looked into his education and that was when I started visualising a path for myself. I thought to myself that if I could gain the same skills he has, what would stop me from getting on E? I actually wrote my University application letter about him and got accepted to all my choices: So it worked. Here I am today. Thanks to Ryan.\n\nWho is your biggest role model?\n\nMy mother! She is the strongest, most helpful, caring, supportive, hard-working individual I have ever come across. I thank God every day that he made her my mother. I wouldn\u2019t be the young woman I am today if not for the discipline she instilled in me at a young age. She is the last person I ever want to disappoint. I\u2019m working so hard so that one day, my brothers and I can tell her to sit back and relax.\n\nWhat do you do to keep fit and stay healthy?\n\nI\u2019m striving every day to become a full-time member of a Fitness club but it\u2019s hard. I\u2019ve learned to reduce my portion sizes. My choice of exercise is swimming. I love the fact that it works your whole body, plus, I find being in a huge body of water extremely calming and relaxing.\n\nWhat puts you off in people?\n\nI hate bad attitudes for no reason. If someone else upsets you, don\u2019t put that negative energy on me, it\u2019s not my fault. So when you first meet someone, show them the good sides of you. My mum always used to tell me, \u201calways look your best and act your best, people never forget the first impression\u201d.\n\nWhen you are not working, how do you spend your \u2018me\u2019 time?\n\nWhen I\u2019m not working, I like to catch up on my favourite TV shows. I\u2019ve also gotten into exploring TV shows from other countries. I also find time to self-care. I give myself a facial every Sunday night and that makes me feel great when I wake up on Monday morning.\n\nBest holiday destination?\n\nMy best holiday destination is anywhere that gives me a tropical vibe. On my bucket list, I\u2019d like to visit places like Thailand, Bali, Greece, more destinations in the Caribbean and of course, The Maldives \u2013 but I\u2019ll save that one for my honeymoon.\n\nWhat lessons would you say life has taught you over the years?\n\nOver the years, life has taught me to look out for number one. I used to be a people pleaser and would get really upset when people weren\u2019t giving me the same energy I give them. It was a rude awakening when I realised most people don\u2019t care how they make you feel.",

When I was 11 years old, I attended Burford School, a boarding school in Oxfordshire.\n\nI spent my formidable years there. I often say this is where I spent some of my best school years. I left Burford when I was 16 and attended The Chelsea Independent College in London for my A-Levels. I gained my undergrad degree from the University of Bedfordshire in Broadcast Journalism, before attending The New York Film Academy in New York City for my masters in Broadcasting. I have great memories when I think back to my school days, a lot of cringe memories too\u2026but I\u2019m trying to forget those.\n\nWhat informed your choice of career as a teenager?\n\nSo, growing up, I loved Hollywood for all the amazing movies they produced. I used to say to myself, \u201cwell I know I can\u2019t act, so how can I be a part of Hollywood without being in the movies?\u201d That was when my attention moved to Ryan Seacrest, the American television presenter, producer. I became obsessed with his job and how he did it so well. I looked into his education and that was when I started visualising a path for myself. I thought to myself that if I could gain the same skills he has, what would stop me from getting on E? I actually wrote my University application letter about him and got accepted to all my choices: So it worked. Here I am today. Thanks to Ryan.\n\nWho is your biggest role model?\n\nMy mother! She is the strongest, most helpful, caring, supportive, hard-working individual I have ever come across. I thank God every day that he made her my mother. I wouldn\u2019t be the young woman I am today if not for the discipline she instilled in me at a young age. She is the last person I ever want to disappoint. I\u2019m working so hard so that one day, my brothers and I can tell her to sit back and relax.\n\nWhat do you do to keep fit and stay healthy?\n\nI\u2019m striving every day to become a full-time member of a Fitness club but it\u2019s hard. I\u2019ve learned to reduce my portion sizes. My choice of exercise is swimming. I love the fact that it works your whole body, plus, I find being in a huge body of water extremely calming and relaxing.\n\nWhat puts you off in people?\n\nI hate bad attitudes for no reason. If someone else upsets you, don\u2019t put that negative energy on me, it\u2019s not my fault. So when you first meet someone, show them the good sides of you. My mum always used to tell me, \u201calways look your best and act your best, people never forget the first impression\u201d.\n\nWhen you are not working, how do you spend your \u2018me\u2019 time?\n\nWhen I\u2019m not working, I like to catch up on my favourite TV shows. I\u2019ve also gotten into exploring TV shows from other countries. I also find time to self-care. I give myself a facial every Sunday night and that makes me feel great when I wake up on Monday morning.\n\nBest holiday destination?\n\nMy best holiday destination is anywhere that gives me a tropical vibe. On my bucket list, I\u2019d like to visit places like Thailand, Bali, Greece, more destinations in the Caribbean and of course, The Maldives \u2013 but I\u2019ll save that one for my honeymoon.\n\nWhat lessons would you say life has taught you over the years?\n\nOver the years, life has taught me to look out for number one. I used to be a people pleaser and would get really upset when people weren\u2019t giving me the same energy I give them. It was a rude awakening when I realised most people don\u2019t care how they make you feel.",

          "title": "Ruth Kadiri Ezerika: Life as Filmmaker",
          "text": "By Rita Okoye\n\nRuth Kadiri Ezerika is a multiple award-winning Nigerian actress, scriptwriter, and film producer. She is also the CEO/Founder of Ruth Kadiri Films and Ruthkolors; an online hair store. Her passion for acting started in the church; she sees her career as a compulsory service unto God. After bagging an Ordinary National Diploma (OND) in Business Administration from Yaba College of Technology, and a degree in Mass Communication from the University of Lagos, Ruth in her quest for more knowledge proceeded to writing school. She wrote her first script, Wild and Dirty and eventually started featuring in her movies as an actress. Thus far, Ruth has featured in over 100 movies, and has also written and co-written several movies.\n\nNow happily married to Mr Ezerika, and blessed with a daughter, Reign Ezerika, the beautiful actress, shares with us her journey so far as a filmmaker, challenges of a female producer, changes brought on by motherhood and more.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nWhat is new with Ruth Kadiri?\n\nWhat\u2019s new is that I\u2019m working on my first cinema project. We are still in the pre-production stage and I\u2019m trying to get partnership deals because it\u2019s all incorporated in the story. We hope everything goes well, that\u2019s where we are.\n\nHow has life been since COVID-19?\n\nPersonally, it\u2019s been good but a lot of people were affected. However, new streams of revenues have been created. I have also used the opportunity to create more income-making avenues for myself.\n\nYou are an Actor, Screenwriter and Producer. Why didn\u2019t you just confine yourself to acting?\n\nI\u2019m a very restless soul. I pretty much started as a writer. I love writing and working behind the scenes. It gives me a different kind of feeling than I get being on screen. There are two different things; making money as an actor, and making money as a producer. One is way bigger and riskier. As a producer, you are taking more risks but making more money.\n\nWhat are the lessons of life that you have learnt in the course of your profession as \u201can imitator of life?\u201d\n\nLife is a journey and not everyone is meant to stay forever in your life.\n\nEvery filmmaker has a philosophy of life that is reflected in their movies. What is yours and how do you reflect it in your films?\n\nMy philosophy of life is, \u201cit only gets better.\u201d You can\u2019t meet me where you left me. Don\u2019t block anyone and no one will block you. I\u2019m sure these things don\u2019t make sense to you but I promise you, these are the things that keep me going in an industry where it is pretty hard to trust anyone.\n\nYour movies are always family oriented. Why is that so?\n\nNigeria as a country is a family-oriented nation and as a filmmaker, I get my creativity from happenings around me. So, regardless of how crazy Nigerian movies eventually get in the future, there will always be a streak of family in most of our stories.\n\nWhat has been your best and worst moments in the movie industry?\n\nMy best moments are moments when I feel like I\u2019m doing good, and my worst moments are moments when I feel like I\u2019m under-achieving. It\u2019s basically a general thing.\n\nSome female actors have complained about sexual harassment in the industry. Give us your perspective about this much-talked-about issue?\n\nThe higher you go in life, the more difficult it becomes to understand the pain of the people that are down there. Most of the sexual harassment cases in the industry are of people who are struggling to get into the field, or trying to find their feet. We don\u2019t hear of many cases anymore. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because I\u2019ve grown to a point where nobody can say nonsense to me. I have my ears to the ground. People are not coming to me anymore to say, this person requested sex for a role. This may also be because the industry is now female-dominated. These are the reasons why I think that sexual harassment has reduced. I can\u2019t say it has been eradicated, but I think it has drastically reduced. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong.\n\nIt is said that you are one of the Nollywood actors without baggage (scandals). How did you manage it?\n\nThe word scandal is relative. What is called scandal to one person might mean absolutely nothing to another person. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019ve been without a scandal, I\u2019ll just say that some of the things that might have disastrously affected a lot of other people, I have been able to manage well to the point where it didn\u2019t look like a scandal.\n\nGive us your Nollywood survival tips?\n\nI think it\u2019s forgiveness! Nollywood is a place where close friends constantly betray you, fall short of your expectations, do things that you probably didn\u2019t expect them to do that do not make sense to you. I grew up in the industry and I told myself that I wasn\u2019t going to let myself carry all the unhealthy burdens that a lot of people are letting themselves carry. Many are bottling things up. If I feel uncomfortable about something, I say it. If you offend me, I say it. I\u2019m always able to articulate my feelings and I forgive you. I just have to let it go for my sake.\n\nWhat triggered your outburst on the Eko Film Festival awards?\n\nIt still boils down to what I said earlier. If I feel something is not right, I say it. I would rather not bottle things, see you on the street, say \u2018hello, hi\u2019 and fake a smile. I can\u2019t do that. If I feel uncomfortable about something, I just say it and move on. You know, when you are upset about something and you express yourself, the anger will always reduce. When you can express yourself to someone who listens. So, that was just one of them. It wasn\u2019t about any form of drama.\n\nDo you feel it was a \u2018clique thing\u2019?\n\nI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m over that now.\n\nIf you are not a filmmaker, what other profession do you think would have caught your fancy?\n\nIf I were not a Filmmaker, I would have been a Prophetess! It\u2019s not easy to combine both worlds but personally and deeply, I know that\u2019s where I should have been.\n\nWhat are some of the burdens of filmmaking that producers have to shoulder because of the Nigerian socio-economic matrix?\n\nFilmmaking in Nigeria is a lot more difficult because of noise, getting funds, and a no- friendly, film-making nation where you can literally walk into somewhere with all the paperwork and say please, I want to make a film. It doesn\u2019t work like that. There are so many places that won\u2019t let you in. These are the things that basically limit your ability to tell certain stories because there\u2019s just a lot of NOs that people get when trying to get to a certain location. Certain things that should be made available for us are just not there. So, we literally pay our way through everything. Even when you have your money to pay, they will still say no.\n\nWhat types of roles will never appeal to you as an actor?\n\nThe moment you sign up to be an actor, you should be able to play any role.That\u2019s what being an actor is all about, I think.\n\nROK TV has continued to serve Nigerian movie lovers with great movies, what is your position with the brand?\n\nI have a good relationship with ROK. I am a ROK producer and actor; and so far, ROK has been so supportive, much more than they take credit for. ROK Tv has also been able to redefine the face of filmmakers and actors. Seeing where we are coming from and where we are now, I know that one platform that actually cares about its people is ROK.\n\nGod rest his soul, there was a colleague, Abiodun Alega, a producer who recently passed. You know that as a producer, people don\u2019t know you. It\u2019s easier to raise money when an actor falls ill because he is known. But as a Producer, so many people don\u2019t know you and because they don\u2019t know you, they don\u2019t feel compelled to help you. When this man died, in no time, we were able to raise about five to six million Naira for him.\n\nThis is one of the benefits and reasons why I love being part of the ROK family. There are many other things I cannot even mention publicly. It\u2019s beyond a production company, it\u2019s a production company that does care for its people. This is a lifestyle I\u2019m personally trying to emulate in every other thing I do moving forward.\n\nWhat has been your staying power in Nollywood?\n\nI think it\u2019s basically being myself and constantly aspiring to be a better version of myself. Most importantly, it\u2019s making my own money. Laughs.\n\nYou have a hair brand, how has it been running such a competitive business?\n\nI\u2019m already in the filmmaking business, which is very competitive; that\u2019s why I don\u2019t consider the hair business as a competition. Also, knowing that I try to cater to certain kinds of women; people who find it difficult to go to a salon because of their busy schedule, and people who are skeptical and scared to spend their money online because of social media scams. These are the two key staying powers that I feel like I have and of course, the hair itself is very good.\n\nHow affordable are your products?\n\nIt\u2019s quite affordable for the quality that you\u2019ll get. May God help us with this dollar rate but so far, it\u2019s good. It\u2019s just that the cost of goods is increasing but what can we do?\n\nA lot of women complain about the price of motherhood such as loss of their body shape, impact on their career and lack of time to pursue personal developments. How has it been with you?\n\nThese are all genuine concerns and cause for worry. Every person that has been a mother has gone through that process of worry. But, when you have supportive people around you; your partner, your family, it\u2019s always easier to deal with and eventually, you\u2019ll come to terms with the new reality. Nothing is ever lost. The time you used to cater for your baby is never lost. Whatever is yours will always come to you regardless of when. So far, it\u2019s been good. I have loving people around and so; I don\u2019t feel that much pressure. I thought I was even going to have it so; basically, it was just fear that held me down at some point. But, after the whole process, I don\u2019t even feel any of such pressures or restraints.\n\nHow do you cope with the demands of motherhood?\n\nI just cope. I\u2019m still a mother, am I not? I\u2019m doing okay. It\u2019s an endless journey, there\u2019s no coping, you just cope.\n\nYou have continued to keep your marriage and husband a top-secret, what scares you?\n\nOkay, first of all, my marriage is not top-secret. If it were top-secret, you wouldn\u2019t know that I\u2019m married. Secondly, my husband is not top-secret, if you are close to me and you know me in the real sense, you would know that he\u2019s not a secret. My husband goes to the location, he visits my set when I\u2019m working. He\u2019s home, my friends come home, they know him, they\u2019ve had interactions with him, family and friends know him, what else? That\u2019s just about it. I\u2019m not about stressing emotionally, mentally, I\u2019m just okay. Anybody who knows me personally, knows my husband and that\u2019s alright.\n\nWho are your three best Nigerian fashion designers?\n\nDT Clothing, CEO Lumini and Tope Efinara.\n\nWhat will you not be caught wearing?\n\nNothing. I will not be caught wearing \u2018nothing\u2019.",

I have loving people around and so; I don\u2019t feel that much pressure. I thought I was even going to have it so; basically, it was just fear that held me down at some point. But, after the whole process, I don\u2019t even feel any of such pressures or restraints.\n\nHow do you cope with the demands of motherhood?\n\nI just cope. I\u2019m still a mother, am I not? I\u2019m doing okay. It\u2019s an endless journey, there\u2019s no coping, you just cope.\n\nYou have continued to keep your marriage and husband a top-secret, what scares you?\n\nOkay, first of all, my marriage is not top-secret. If it were top-secret, you wouldn\u2019t know that I\u2019m married. Secondly, my husband is not top-secret, if you are close to me and you know me in the real sense, you would know that he\u2019s not a secret. My husband goes to the location, he visits my set when I\u2019m working. He\u2019s home, my friends come home, they know him, they\u2019ve had interactions with him, family and friends know him, what else? That\u2019s just about it. I\u2019m not about stressing emotionally, mentally, I\u2019m just okay. Anybody who knows me personally, knows my husband and that\u2019s alright.\n\nWho are your three best Nigerian fashion designers?\n\nDT Clothing, CEO Lumini and Tope Efinara.\n\nWhat will you not be caught wearing?\n\nNothing. I will not be caught wearing \u2018nothing\u2019.",

          "title": "Tolulope Onalaja: Soft Heart For Real Estate",
          "text": "By Yemisi Suleiman\n\nTolulope Onalaja began her career in the facility Management sector, working as the chief operating officer of IFS/Draiklinas. Years later, she left to join her husband\u2019s foremost Real Estate Company, RevolutionPlus Properties. Today, Tolu as she is fondly called, who sits pretty as Group Executive Director and her husband, make a dynamic Real Estate team, building a successful business empire.\n\nBorn and raised in Lagos, Mrs Onalaja had her first degree in Counselling and Psychology from the University of Ibadan, a Post Graduate Diploma in Management, and a Masters in Business Administration (MBA) from the University of Calabar in 2010. The business woman who also holds a Certificate in Entrepreneurial Management from Pan Atlantic University, recently bagged another MBA from Loyola University in Chicago.\n\nAs the company celebrates seven years recently, Onalaja shares the thrills of working with her husband as a partner, wife, mother, their success secret, as well as issues facing the housing industry in Nigeria.\n\nAs your husband\u2019s business partner, how do you two operate without getting on each other\u2019s nerves?\n\nMy husband and I divided the entire business; so, everyone takes his or her area of specialty. I am in charge of Administration, HR, and Accounts in all of the businesses in and outside the country. Project teams report to my husband. So, even if he has a requisition in payment, he forwards it to me. If I have anything that has to do with a project, I forward it to him and he will now designate.\n\nHow would you describe the experience in the last seven years?\n\nIt has been beautiful.\n\nIs it something you enjoy doing?\n\nOh yes, I enjoy it a lot and it has helped my marriage. We don\u2019t fight and when we do, we settle almost immediately because the business brings us together, we always have something to talk about. I might want to get clarity or he wants me to make payment to a client. So, in such a situation, how do you actually keep malice? We can\u2019t fight, it is impossible.\n\nAgain, my husband is not a domineering, typical African man. If you are good at something, he leaves you to be good at what you are good at. He does not drag anything with you. You are still his wife anyways, whatever you achieve. In fact, he brags about me more than himself and it\u2019s something we sometimes laugh about. So it has been fantastic. We have won a couple of awards as Real Estate couple of the year, and have also won several awards together as a couple.\n\nWhat does winning these awards as a couple of the year mean to you?\n\nWhat it tells us is that we are inspirations and a lot of people are learning from us. A lot of people have told us that we have shown that it is possible for husband and wife to work together and actually succeed. We have seen ourselves as examples to other people who have started involving their wives in their businesses.\n\nWhat was life like when you started RevolutionPlus?\n\nRevolutionPlus started in 2014. But, because the business was new, it couldn\u2019t even feed the family nor pay our bills.\n\nI was actually the one paying the bills of the business when we started; I was paying from my salary. It was after two years when things started picking up in bits that he said we needed to join forces. I even used to laugh then, because RevolutionPlus was paying me one hundred and fifty thousand naira in 2016 when I joined, while I was almost earning a million where I was coming from. The business could not pay me at that time, but today, the rest is history.\n\nThe company started as RevolutionPlus properties but has now evolved into a holding company; tell us about your evolution journey.\n\nIt started as RevolutionPlus properties, which in seven years has given birth to all these subsidiaries. From RevolutionPlus properties we moved into RevolutionPlus Construction. The construction part of the business is in charge of building the houses, while the properties sell the land.\n\nHowever, during the COVID-19 restrictions, we realised that food was very important apart from shelter and we do residential properties. So, residential housing started booming like never before because everybody now values the home due to the quarantine. So, instead of it being a disadvantage the way other businesses were, it was an advantage for the real estate. People started seeing the importance of having a home and shelter, because if something happens, where do you go? You need your home; you can\u2019t stay in your car. When they were closing down event centers, hotels and the like, they couldn\u2019t close down food and since my husband has always had the vision of having a bakery and table water factory, he felt it was time to actually start his bakery. On my part, I have always loved eateries, so when a friend walked up to me and said she has a passion for cooking and wanted to know if I still wanted to set up an eatery, I said of course. That was how the idea to start up the eatery combined with the water factory and bakery started. So that is the business we will be launching by God\u2019s Grace, between July and August.\n\nYou also have a lingerie store-Angelic Lingerie; how do you joggle all these as wife and mother?\n\nI have energy, that is one thing God gave me. I have a lot of strength, a lot of inner strength, and I thank God for the gift. Again, I am naturally multi-talented and I can multi-task a lot. If I don\u2019t multi-task, it\u2019s like a part of me is slowing down. I just want to do too many things, that is what keeps me going. So, I don\u2019t see it as a challenge and of course, my husband and I have worked in the bank for years and I also worked in the corporate world. So, we have some kind of structure in place.\n\nFor the new businesses we would be working with Consultants who are experts at what they do. I believe putting the right structures in place along with control, is all one needs in business to succeed.\n\nNeither the business nor the home front has suffered. I am someone who plans ahead, so that is why I said nothing ruffles me, It doesn\u2019t catch me unawares. My children love me for that, and they brag to their friends that their mummy is always there. With all of the businesses that I am managing, I go to the US at least once in every three months to see my children. I ensure they are okay and then, on their graduation day, I am there. I try to balance everything just to be sure that there are no lapses. I always believe that naturally, God gave us women the ability to multi- task; it just now depends on how we develop that potential in us.\n\nWhat would you say are the major problems facing the housing sector?\n\nThe problem we usually have is the cost of building materials, which is a very big challenge for developers. The inflation rate in Nigeria is crazy. For example, if today I say I want to sell this house for 50million, you can wake up the next day and there is an increment in the price of cement. Meanwhile, you have done your contract with your buyer, you can\u2019t go back to them and say you can\u2019t build. So, the longer you stay on a project, the more money you are losing.\n\nThen titling and documentation is another. When you buy a property in America, within 24 to 48 hours, a titling company will title the property in your name and all documentations will be done and recorded in their system unlike Nigeria where it takes a longer period. That is a big challenge. When people in the diaspora want to buy a property from us, and they ask when they are going to get their title, we can\u2019t even give them a timeline because we don\u2019t even know what the timelines are. So, we have to keep explaining to them to bear with us. Those are some of the few challenges that we have.\n\nSo, if you have to advise the government on these challenges, what would you tell them?\n\nWe have spoken to the government about it. They said they are working on it and that they are digitalising their systems in Alausa. With the digitalisation, we should be able to get C of O in 90 days, from the comfort of our homes without going to Alausa. We are just hopeful that it will see the light of day.\n\nWhat are your criteria for location when you decide to build an estate?\n\nWhat we usually do is that we go to a place where we see development coming, we quickly go ahead because once you go after development, you buy it higher. If you go before development you get it cheaper. So that is one of the things we look out for.\n\nBecause we preach affordable housing at RevolutionPlus, we don\u2019t pride ourselves in expensive properties. We just want everyone to own a home even if you are just a petty trader. We do not believe that housing should be for some levels of people, we believe that housing should be for all. We try as much as possible to help those who never thought they could own a house to do so.\n\nWhen you are not working what do you do? How do you spend your \u2018me time\u2019?\n\nI swim and I watch movies. Before COVID-19, I used to like to travel but not so much now. My hobby is dancing, I love to dance. If I want to ease stress, I listen to music and dance. I like staying by the beach or poolside. That is where I receive inspiration. I like to read, I used to read a lot. So, basically, that is what I do. I can just do a weekend getaway just to be by myself.\n\nSo, who or what inspires you in life generally?\n\nIt\u2019s God that inspires me. I am a very good Christian and I\u2019m not apologetic about it. I\u2019ll say it anywhere I go that I am all I am by God\u2019s grace, and one person that has been a major inspiration to me is my Pastor, Chris Oyakilome. He has inspired us so much with the word of God. Looking back at my journey with my husband and how we started in a Face-me-I-Face-you house, it\u2019s really been an inspiring journey.\n\nAnother person that inspires me is my husband; he is very hardworking and a giver. He can give his eyes. I told him one day that God made him special; a few of him. I\u2019m yet to meet anyone as generous as my husband. He is generous to a fault and I love him for that. He has taught me a lot about selfless giving; even, when we didn\u2019t have anything, when we were still struggling; he still gave from the little we had. So getting married to someone like that is truly inspiring for me.\n\nWhat is fashion like for you? How would you describe your style?\n\nI am very simple when it comes to fashion. When I shop, it has to be classy, expensive but simple. I am not one for loud fashion and you will never see me wear bogus jewelry. Anything bogus, it is not me, from shoes to bag. So my style is simple and classy.\n\nIf you have to splooge on anything what will it be?\n\nIt is jewelry and travel. I like traveling and knowing new places. I love adventure.\n\nWhere is your best holiday destination?\n\nI have plenty, but I still want to go to Greece for my wedding anniversary, but because of COVID19, we couldn\u2019t go. Someone just told me about a place in Mexico, I am waiting for ease of travel restrictions and I will start traveling. I am very adventurous and not afraid.\n\nWhat would be your advice for young girls who look up to you for inspiration?\n\nBe content. If you are a contented person you will go far in life. I don\u2019t struggle. What I cannot afford, I don\u2019t go for it. You will never find my name on a credit list. Anything that I can\u2019t afford from a place of comfort, I don\u2019t do it. I don\u2019t put myself under pressure which is why my husband respects and trusts me with a lot of things.",

          "text": "The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) has suggested ways to save electricity consumption among Nigerians.\n\nThis is in light of the recent increase in electricity billing.\n\nHere are Nine ways you can save electricity consumption in your residence or place of business.\n\n\u00b7 Turn off lights and electrical appliances when not in use: Don\u2019t leave your electronics or light bulbs on all day long.\n\n\u00b7 Switch to energy-efficient light bulbs: Traditional light bulbs waste 95% of the energy they use giving off heat with only 5% going toward the light. Switch them out or use them sparingly.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLeaving them on for long periods is highly wasteful. Halogen incandescent bulbs, compact fluorescent lights (CFLs), and light-emitting diode bulbs (LEDs) use anywhere from 25-80 per cent less electricity and last 3 to 25 times longer than traditional bulbs.\n\n\u00b7 Reduce use of water heaters: Water heating is a major contributor to your total energy consumption. Other than purchasing an energy-efficient water heater, there are two methods of reducing your water heating expenses. You can simply use less hot water or turn down the thermostat on your water heater.\n\nRead Also: Free prepaid meters\n\n\u00b7 Purchase energy-efficient appliances: Appliances account for a large amount of enemy consumed in households, offices, and industries. With this in mind, it is important to be intentional about purchases made to ensure that energy-efficient appliances are installed.\n\n\u00b7 Set refrigerator temperature to the manufacturer recommendation: This is important to avoid excessive cooling and wasting energy.\n\n\u00b7 Unplug battery chargers when not in use: Many devices, including battery chargers draw power continuously even when not in use.\n\n\u00b7 Plug home electronics into power strips: Use power strips such as adaptors and extension boards to reduce energy consumption. Turn the power strips off when equipment is not in use. You\u2019ll stop these devices from using energy when idle with one convenient switch.\n\n\u00b7 Bring in sunlight: During daylight hours, switch off artificial lights and use windows and skylights to brighten your home.\n\n\u00b7 Service your air conditioner: Easy maintenance, such as routinely replacing or cleaning air filters can lower your cooling systems energy consumption.",

          "title": "Overthrow of Shonekan confirmed our fears about June 12 \u2013 IBB",
          "text": "Twenty-eight years after he left office as Military President, General Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida (IBB) remains a phenomenon in Nigeria. His home in Minna, Niger State capital, is still a Mecca of a sort, where Nigerians from all tribes congregate, to consult or pay homage.\n\nBabangida\u2019s 80th birthday, which is being celebrated today, served as a veritable avenue for the convergence of associates, who want to identify with him and media men, in search of news. ONUOHA UKEH, Managing Director/Editor-in-Chief, ADETUTU FOLASADE-KOYI, Editor, Nation\u2019s Capital & the North, and PAULINUS AIDOGHIE, Correspondent, fell into the latter category, having journeyed to the famous Hilltop home of Babangida in Minna.\n\nIn an exclusive interview, Babangida was candid and frank. He addressed events after the annulment of the June 12, 1993, presidential election, removal of the Interim National Government headed by Chief Ernest Shonekan and the regime of the late General Sani Abacha.\n\nThe former president opened up on his life\u2019s experiences, military career, tenure as head of state and on some knotty issues associated with his regime.\n\nAt 80, you have seen and experienced so many things. In all these years, what would you call your greatest memory? And what has life taught you?\n\nMy goodness! That is a tough one. My greatest memory in 80 years? That is indeed a very tough one. My greatest memory in 80 years! I think one of the things is to lose your parents when you are still young. You did not have the opportunity to interact with them. They did not mentor you, train you to imbibe some values into you, that is personal to you. I think this is the greatest thing, and the fact that they are not alive to see me grow, reaching up to this level.\n\nSo, what has life taught you?\n\nA lot of things! There are a lot of challenges in life, but you have to be willing and determined to go through them. Life has taught me always to be patient, not to be in a hurry in taking up anything; to be patient because you are going to meet a lot of people from different cultures, from different backgrounds, people who have different beliefs from what you believe. You have to be patient to deal with them, to work with them.\n\nWhen one is getting old, there are many things one cannot do. What are those things that you miss\u2026\n\n(Cuts in) That I cannot do?\n\nYes\n\nThe physical activities I used to do, like playing soccer, like travelling to see friends and people; you find that these have reduced very, very significantly.\n\nIt has been 28 years since you left office. Looking back, are there things you did then that, if you were to do them now, you would do differently?\n\nNot much! As far as I am concerned, the sum total is: look, I believe in what I did or what we did and, after 28 years of leaving office, a lot of things have happened that gave me the impression that our thoughts were very correct. So, there aren\u2019t much that I could have done otherwise.\n\nDo you have any regrets whatsoever, whether as a military officer or as a military president, looking back now?\n\nWhile in office, my only regret was that things didn\u2019t seem to be working the way we wanted them and I wished people would develop different habits about the country. I feel bad that people still talk about tribe, sometimes religion. That was not what we envisaged Nigeria would be. It should be a united country and nobody should be talking about \u2018my people,\u2019 \u2018my tribe,\u2019 or something like that. It still persists. This is something we didn\u2019t envisage would continue.\n\nWhen would you say we lost it? Where did we lose it as a country?\n\nIt was caused by the inability by proponents of ethnicity to either believe or to forge ahead within the concept of Nigeria. We lost it because they were unable to compete. Anybody who is unable to compete within the system tries to create something new and thinks that he should achieve what he wants under that.\n\nYou told a television station recently that, if the June 12, 1993, presidential election was concluded, there could have been a coup thereafter. Could you throw more light on this? Secondly, why didn\u2019t you retire those who you thought could have plotted a coup if the results had been announced?\n\nWhen we set up the interim government and asked Chief Ernest Shonekan to head it, that interim government had a constitution. That constitution was drawn by experts, lawyers and non-lawyers in the country. The interim government\u2019s tenure was supposed to be from November 1993 to February 1994, within which there would have been an election to usher in a democratically elected government. Now, what really happened? The people, that is, Nigerians, because of the anger and venom they had about the annulment of the June 12 (election), worked against it. The two political parties agreed with the interim government and we also went further to say that the two aspirants who contested for that election should present themselves for re-election in February 1994.\n\nBut you see, in Nigeria, people didn\u2019t like it. I remember the media saying that \u2018Nigerians are weary of elections; Nigerians are tired of elections, we don\u2019t need another election.\u2019\n\nAll the same, we set the programme and contrived it the way we did. We also called very notable people, people we thought were affected more, people who had been most vehement, vocal about that. There were consultations by Shonekan, after I had left, with them. But then there was a court ruling that the interim government was a contraption. Now, as I said, there would have been a coup. There was an interim government; it was short lived; the military pushed it aside and that military lived there with you guys for five years under the stronger dictatorship. There was no political party for people to participate, people didn\u2019t have the right to do a lot of things that would have happened if they allowed that system (ING) to work. So, if I look back, the fact is that there was a coup! Shonekan was shoved aside! Abacha came in, got some of the strong believers of June 12 into his government to serve him; so, that gave him some legitimacy. And you had to live with him for five years and, thereafter, you started all over again. I feel bad about it that something that we envisaged could have been done within the shortest possible time in the interest of the country was not done. Nigeria wasted five years to accept the simple truth, to come back to what would have been the endpoint of interim government.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t you retire the people who were potential coupists? Why didn\u2019t you take them out of the system?\n\nI would say that I knew the thinking of some of the officers at that time, but if you retire people just like that, on the slightest suspicion, you create instability within the system and, if you do that, whoever that comes is not going to find it easy at all.\n\nIt\u2019s also curious that the constitution of the interim government said in an event that the interim president resigned, the most senior military officer would take over. Abacha was the most senior, who eventually took over government. Was it by design?\n\nNo. We left him there to stabilise the system because of the fear we had about coups. So, we said we needed a strongman who had some ideas, who knew what should be done to give that interim government the confidence that he is in charge of the military. We wanted Shonekan to have confidence that there was a military officer with him who would serve as a Defence Minister and who everybody knew. The name was known, both in the Armed Forces and in the society. So, the idea was to give Shonekan some strength and stability in the system.\n\nDo you feel betrayed that Abacha, eventually, instead of protecting the government, took over government?\n\nI didn\u2019t feel betrayed because I know this is the society in which we live. I have always said that a coup succeeds in a society that is frustrated. All coups succeed when the society is frustrated. There was frustration in the Nigerian society to the extent that the frustration was openly discussed by the masses. That gave the military the courage to venture into a coup because they knew the society was saturated with all the wrong things that were done at that time.\n\nYou guys were old enough at that time to realise that there were statements against the interim government we put in place; there was a court ruling that said it was a contraption. There were political leaders who were angry about June 12, who said the worst military dictatorship was better than this (interim government). So, the society prepared (the grounds for) that coup. The military took advantage of it and stayed.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about creation of states. What informed your selection or decision to create 11 states? Secondly, there was a contention about Delta State, that the Igbos asked for Anioma State but you created Delta with Asaba as capital. So, what informed the decision on state creation and what would you say about agitation for more states?\n\nWell, I will tell you something. First of all, let me clear one thing because that question will lead to that. I did not make Asaba the state capital because my wife came from Asaba. That is out of it. We listed criteria for state creation for the country and we strictly followed those criteria to create states. We started with two states, Katsina and Akwa Ibom. Why did we do that? These two states were the most prominent among agitations for creation of states. And you can understand there was no serious contention about this. Katsina used to be in the North Central, with Kaduna and so on when they were once together. So, it was easier to handle that because two provinces \u2013 Katsina Province and Zaria Province, were earlier put together to form Kaduna State. So, we created Katsina and brought it out of Kaduna. And, politically, it was a very good decision\n\nNow, Akwa Ibom. The agitation for the state started as far back as 1938. They had been very consistent. They talked about it, they fought for it. I don\u2019t know whether you were born when people were talking about CORE State \u2013 Cross River, Ogoja and so on. So, because of history, we had no problem in creating Akwa Ibom State. Then we realised that people would continue to agitate and we didn\u2019t close our doors to that. We had to take a second look again to see which ones were viable.\n\nI will tell you a very good story. I had very good friends from the South East at that time. I remember people like the late Pius Okigbo and other very prominent persons who came to me as my friends and talked about creation of Abia State. We looked at the whole thing and decided to strike a balance between the South East, South South and the South West, especially about the number of states that occupied the Yoruba and Igbo territories. They are the most dominant tribes in these regions. I think you are old enough to know that there were times when people argued that there was still no balance, that there should be balance between the East and the West. That is the greatest contention up till now. We tried to strike that balance. Unfortunately, it remains the way it is now.\n\nI am not surprised that these agitations are even becoming more vocal now, trying to balance the South East and the South West. It is a very serious issue; I believe the next administration would have to find a solution to that. Otherwise, knowing Nigerians, there will come a time when people will like their towns or villages to be states. Right now, I think I read last week, agitation for 20 more states! So, we could get to a stage where somebody would say, perhaps, Item (the MD\u2019s village in Abia State) should be a state!\n\nGovernment needs to have a position and stick to that position. I am glad the Senate said the news of creating 20 more states is fake news, otherwise, it will be most unviable. But, whether it is viable or not, government should not close the chapter but look at it very dispassionately without interest to say \u2018yes, this criteria qualify for a state.\u2019\n\nLet\u2019s talk about 2023. There is a contention now, the South\u2026\n\n(Cuts in) You are not 60 yet? Are you?\n\nNo.\n\nThank you (general laughter).\n\nThe South says it should be its turn now, in the spirit of rotation, and some people in the North are saying it will not happen that way. Where would you, in your wisdom, want the presidency to go? Secondly, the 60-year mark that you have set, what informed that, especially when we have a country like the United States whose president is above 70? The last president of the U.S. and the current one are above 70.\n\nI think somebody who has reached that stage (60 years) in Nigeria, not in America, must have gone through a lot of things. That is why I tried to calculate it and relate it to age. You must have done some public service for the country, you must have done some work, either in your profession, in any leadership position and, as a process, you must have acquired a lot of education, experience about higher management to serve society after going through all these. If you calculate, if you add them up, you will find that anybody around that age must have gone through these processes, and, therefore, easily qualified.\n\nI can use myself as an example. I became the military president, as you guys in the media would like to say, when I was 44. When I was 44, I had gone through a lot in public service. I must have put not less than 30 years in public service and so on. I think that prepared me a lot. However, in Nigeria, we are still a developing country; there are not many people who would have the opportunity to go through some of the things I went through when I was in public service. So, I just generalised that people who have undergone that in Nigeria, because it is a shared population and shared opportunity, must have served and they will live to be in the 60s. People who are in the 60s easily must have gone through some of these.\n\nWhat of this North-South agitation on where the next president should come from? And the South East is insisting the next president should actually be from that zone.\n\nThe presidency should be claimed by every Nigerian, irrespective of where he comes from. That is number one. It is your inalienable right to aspire to be a president. So, anybody who wants to be president, I believe, should start preparing himself now. Right? The person should begin to visualise, to train, to aspire and prepare himself to make that. He must be good and have the confidence to say, look I am the right person, you chose me because I did this and that in the past. Competence is also a factor. I did say he must be a politician. That is what politics is all about, telling people, interacting with people, convincing people, saying convincingly, \u2018I want to do this, elect me,\u2019 and people will ask you, \u2018Why do you think I should give you my vote?\u2019 The aspirant should have competence and vision, not to say simply I am from Minna or you are from Item, that is why they should vote for you. They should vote for you because of yourself, because you are qualified, because of your competence and so on. This is an idea I want people to start getting, that you can aspire for that office. People should recognise that you are a good material for president of the country.\n\nWe have to take a decision, either we want to practice democracy the way the world knows it and allow it to continue as a means for us in the country so that, in the next 100 years, we are not talking about zoning or about where a president comes from, but about competence. The best time to start thinking along that line is now. If we do that now, we are going to continue doing it for the next 50, 100 years.\n\nThere is insecurity in the country and it seems we are losing it. That has led to the agitation for separation and all that. Yet, you are saying we shouldn\u2019t talk about breakup? What measures should we take to arrest the situation?\n\nWell, I believe the government is trying now, by what they are doing. Maybe it is not enough; a lot more needs to be done. They are doing well in terms of launching operations against the bandits or trying to arrest the bandits and so on. Maybe the armed forces are overstretched. Personally, let me tell you, the way to do this thing is to do a general mobilisation of the entire country, like we did during the Civil War. It is to mobilise the country against what is happening now and have a good plan on how to go about it and a good plan on reorganisation and, after you must have finished, there should be reconstruction and rehabilitation. If we have a general mobilisation to fight this, I want to believe it will work. You mobilise the entire country against banditry, against kidnapping.\n\nHow would you want to be remembered?\n\nI served this country during the course of my existence in various capacities \u2013 military, for the defence of the country; I also went into politics because I found myself as a president. So, most of the things I did were political decisions and I put in my best. So, I would like to be remembered as a patriot.\n\nWhy did you step aside on August 27, 1993?\n\nTo give you, Nigerians, the opportunity to do what you believed, then, I was doing wrong.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t you say you were retiring rather than saying you were stepping aside?\n\nI have always given an example with the military. I was a military man. If a soldier is marching in a column, following the music and so on, normally, it is the soldier\u2019s leg. He steps, first, with the left leg forward and then the other foot follows. It was believed that everybody\u2019s feet were going left, while mine was going right. In such situation in the military, the man in charge of the parade will call me, shout out my name and say: \u2018Look, Babangida, step aside.\u2019\n\nNigerians said I was going with the wrong foot; so, I stepped aside so that you could go with the perceived correct foot. That was why I used the military term: step aside.",

          "title": "Watershed Moment, As Buhari Signs Petroleum Act to Overhaul Oil Industry",
          "text": "\u2022Senate President, Speaker, OPEC, NEITI, industry stakeholders hail new legislation\n\n\u2022PDP, PANDEF, IJC kick against Act, condemn assent, say President has demonstrated he is not a listening leader\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Emmanuel Addeh,\n\nUdora Orizu in Abuja and Olusegun Samuel in Yenagoa\n\nIn a historic move yesterday, President Muhammadu Buhari signed into law the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), a piece of legislation that will serve as the framework for the operations in the oil and gas industry.\n\nThe legislation which has suffered several setbacks since 2008, when it was first presented to the National Assembly, aims at removing legal and regulatory uncertainties that have held back the industry\u2019s growth.\n\nThe Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) provides legal, governance, regulatory and fiscal framework for the Nigerian petroleum industry, the development of host communities, and related matters.\n\nThis is just as the President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan; Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila; the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) and some industry players have said the PIA would positively reshape Nigeria\u2019s industry.\n\nOn the contrary, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF), ljaw National Congress (INC), have expressed displeasure over the development, saying the president failed to heed to the complaints on certain areas in the law.\n\nA statement issued by the President\u2019s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, said President Buhari assented to the Bill working from home.\n\nIt stated: \u201cWorking from home in five days quarantine as required by the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19 after returning from London on Friday August 13, the President assented to the Bill Monday August 16, in his determination to fulfill his constitutional duty.\n\n\u201cThe ceremonial part of the new legislation will be done on Wednesday, after the days of mandatory isolation would have been fulfilled.\n\n\u201cThe Petroleum Industry Act provides legal, governance, regulatory and fiscal framework for the Nigerian petroleum industry, the development of host communities, and related matters.\u201d\n\nBuhari\u2019s government is banking that the reforms will attract a greater share of global capital allocated to fossil fuel projects.\n\nThe Senate and House of Representatives had last month passed the bill, thus ending a long wait since early 2000s.\n\nBut while the Senate had approved three per cent as operating expenditure to the host communities, the House of Representatives, on its part had approved five per cent.\n\nBoth chambers had equally approved 30 per cent of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC) profit share for exploration of frontier basins such as Lake Chad, Benue trough, Anambra, Dahomey (Lagos) and Gombe Basins.\n\nThe disparity in the percentage approved for the Host Communities by the two chambers resulted in the setting up of a Conference committee headed by the Senate Leader, Senator Yahaya Abdullahi, to harmonise the two positions.\n\nEventually, the committee recommended three per cent to the Host Communities which both the Senate and the House of Representatives adopted and sent to the President for assent.\n\nThe presidential assent has rekindled hope that although late in coming, some part of the losses, by one estimate by NEITI exceeding $200 billion, may be recouped before big oil finally goes into extinction.\n\nWith the new law, the establishment of an Upstream Regulatory Commission to oversee upstream petroleum operations, including technical, operational and commercial activities and ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations governing upstream petroleum operations, will soon be set up.\n\nIt will also see the transformation of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) into a profit-oriented company devoid of political interferences.\n\nAdded to that, is the establishment of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority which would be responsible for the technical and commercial regulation of midstream and downstream petroleum operations in the petroleum industry in Nigeria.\n\nThe new law will see the deregulation of the sector and ensure strict environmental implementation of policies, laws and regulations for midstream and downstream petroleum operations; and to develop and enforce a framework on tariff and pricing for natural gas and petroleum products.\n\nWith the signing of the bill into law, NNPC now becomes commercialised as Nigerians will have the opportunity to buy shares in the business and ensure more transparency in its operations.\n\nSenate, Gbajabiamila Say Legislation Positive for Nigeria\u2019s Economy\n\nThe Senate described the new PIA as a major victory that has the potential of bailing Nigeria out of its economic predicament.\n\nAccording to the upper legislative chamber, the Act will also enable the country to make the most of economic gains of the oil industry for the benefit of Nigerians.\n\nChairman of the Senate committee on Media and Public Affairs, Senator Ajibola Basiru, in a statement congratulated the Executive arm of government, the leadership and members of the National Assembly and all other stakeholders in the oil industry for the realization of the new Act.\n\nHe noted that efforts at reaching this stage had been a protracted affair as the Bill, first initiated in 2003 had been subjected to a ping pong affair between the previous legislatures and the Executive.\n\nAccording to him, the Ninth National Assembly finally broke the jinx when it recently passed the Bill after working dispassionately by putting the interest of the nation first over petty squabbles and other self-interests, thereby laying finally to rest previous failed attempts.\n\nThe Senate spokesman further attributed the success of the accent to the bill to the cooperative efforts of all participating sectors in the process and also the non-confrontational policy of the current National Assembly.\n\nOn benefits of the new law, Basiru said the PIA will juice up the national economy by liberalising the petroleum sector which will pave way for investors, both local and international, to invest in the oil sector with government on a competitive basis.\n\nIn his contribution, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, also hailed President Muhammadu Buhari for assenting to the PIA, saying Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas industry will now receive a breath of fresh air and allow investments and transparency to flourish.\n\nGbajabiamila, in a statement, noted that the coming into being of the law was a victory for Nigerians and a landmark achievement that ended the two-decade-long journey.\n\nAccording to him, when massive investments come in as a result of the PIA, many Nigerians will gain employment.\n\nHe expressed optimism that with the law, Nigerians would also benefit from reduced fuel prices as there would be competition among the industry players.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs I said before, this is a landmark achievement. It has been 20 years in coming. This ninth Assembly will be recorded on the right side of history for this big score. I call on investors to take full advantage of the opportunities that the new law provided.\u201d\n\nOPEC: Buhari Has Ushered in New Era for Oil Sector\n\nThe Secretary General, OPEC, Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, in a statement congratulated President Buhari, saying it marked significant milestone for Nigeria\u2019s oil industry and an historic achievement for the Presidency.\n\nAccording to Barkindo, with the stroke of a pen, the president has inaugurated a new era for the industry following years of legislative efforts to strengthen the legal, regulatory, fiscal and governance framework of the petroleum sector.\n\n\u201cIndeed, the new law will enhance the Nigerian petroleum industry\u2019s reputation, open the door to new investment, and ultimately strengthen its position to meet the world\u2019s growing demand for energy. The enactment of this legislation is especially timely as the investment outlook becomes clouded by efforts aimed at accelerating a lower-carbon future.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the new law will help harness Nigeria\u2019s potential to achieve its programme of raising oil production to four million barrels per day and oil reserves to 40 billion barrels, while also drawing on the country\u2019s vast natural gas reserves to provide clean and efficient energy.\n\n\u201cIn addition, these resources will be vital to supplying world markets with a broad portfolio of energy options, and support global efforts to alleviate energy poverty as outlined in the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goal 7,\u201d the OPEC scribe added.\n\nHe noted that the signing into law of the legislation also coincided with another significant milestone in Nigeria\u2019s history \u2013 the 50th anniversary of Nigeria\u2019s Membership of OPEC.\n\nAccording to Barkindo, the golden moment provides a unique opportunity to reflect upon Nigeria\u2019s rise as a global energy supplier and partner.\n\n\u201cSince the 24th OPEC Conference on 12 July 1971, when Nigeria received a unanimous and enthusiastic welcome as the 11th Member Country of the Organisation, our country has come to symbolise Africa\u2019s within OPEC and its pivotal support for global oil market stability.\n\n\u201cExcellency, the past year has been a time of enormous challenges for our world, for our Organisation, and for each Member Country. Yet throughout this difficult period, we have demonstrated the enduring importance of OPEC and its timeless commitment to dialogue, cooperation, multilateralism and respect among all nations,\u201d he added.\n\nNEITI: Law Has Ended Uncertainty of Future of Nigeria\u2019s Oil Sector\n\nIn its assessment, NEITI also described the development as historic.\n\nThe Executive Secretary of NEITI, Dr. Orji Ogbonnaya Orji, in a statement, noted that the new law has ended decades of uncertainty concerning the future of Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas sector.\n\nAccording to Orji, \u201cThe new law has opened a new phase of wider opportunities in the oil and gas industry. For us in NEITI, President Buhari has broken new grounds, created new business horizon built on healthy legal frameworks that will push the boundaries of reforms in the sector with realistic optimism for inflow of investments, revenue growth and job opportunities.\u201d\n\nThe transparency boss applauded the significance of the Presidential assent to the Bill, adding that NEITI looks forward to playing active roles in designing a new future for Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas industry under the new Petroleum Industry Act.\n\n\u201cThe signing into Law of the PIB has demonstrated government\u2019s resolve to strengthen governance processes and systems especially in the extractive industry through an institutional and legal framework. NEITI is encouraged by the development,\u201d he added.\n\nThe NEITI Executive Secretary expressed delight that the, \u201cPetroleum Industry Law will provide the dynamic legal governance framework required to re-position Nigeria\u2019s Petroleum industry to fully embrace competition, openness, accountability, professionalism and better profit returns on investments to both companies and government.\u201d\n\nHe further stated, \u201cI want to also use this opportunity to call on companies, government agencies and civil society involved in the oil and gas sector governance to give this Law a chance to succeed. NEITI as an agency with legitimate interest in the Law will carefully study the contents of the new Law and work closely with national and global partners especially the EITI to use the Law to open the Nigeria oil and gas sector for transparency, accountability and inflow of foreign direct investments into Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIndustry Stakeholders Say Legislation Big Win for Nigeria\n\nIn his reaction to the promulgation of the new law, Chairman, Board of Trustees of the Oil and Gas Trainers Association of Nigeria (OGTAN), Dr. Mayowa Afe, told THISDAY that it was a happy day for the industry and a big win for the country.\n\nThe former President, Nigerian Association of Petroleum Explorationists (NAPE) and current President, European Association of Geoscientists and Engineers (EAGE), explained that aside the argument over the three per cent or five per cent for host communities, the law is a foundation that can be built upon in the future.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good news that the president has come all the way from his holiday and on his first day of work assented to the bill. It is good news for all of us. It has been there for 20 years although it\u2019s not perfect. No law is perfect, but we can begin to work on it from here, particularly the three per cent or five per cent for the communities.\n\n\u201cNow, we have a law regulating the oil and gas industry and the ones that are not up to what we want, we begin to work on it and there will be a lot of advocacy concerning this. So, it is a good day for all of us.\n\n\u201cFor investors, those who are bringing their money into the country, they now know what they are bargaining for and the communities will know what to expect. I am happy, the industry is happy.\n\n\u201cNow every company knows what they are working against, because there is now a regulation and a framework, so I can put my money there. It\u2019s different from a situation where people didn\u2019t really know what was going on, no regulation and those we had were archaic, he stressed.\n\nIn his remarks, President of the Petroleum Products Retail Outlets Owners Association of Nigeria (PETROAN), Dr. Billis Gillis-Harry, stated that although the law was largely unfair to the Niger Delta, it wasn\u2019t a bad place to lay a solid foundation for the sector.\n\nHe noted that the country\u2019s scarce resources that were being used to fund the petrol subsidy regime will now be used for developmental purposes, saying that the organisation had always supported deregulation.\n\n\u201cAs for the three per cent, it is unfair to the Niger Delta that bears the burden of oil production in the country to be so unfairly treated.\n\n\u201cWhen you compare this to 30 per cent of NNPC profits even as a private company, being reserved for the frontier exploration, it doesn\u2019t add up.\n\n\u201cHowever, bills are made by man. I believe that at the right time some factors should change, but I congratulate Nigerians that this bill has been passed, though it had been jinxed for a number of years. It\u2019s a landmark event,\u201d he stated.\n\nChairman, Petroleum Technology Associated of Nigeria (PETAN), Mr. Nicholas Odinuwe, in his remarks expressed joy that the bill had been signed into law, adding that the views of the organisation were taken into consideration in the process of consultations.\n\n\u201cThe president has signed the PIB and there\u2019s no comment from me that will change anything. We are happy that our views were taken into consideration. We are happy, so let the bill work for Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, a Niger Delta activist and the National President, Niger Delta Nonviolence Agitators Forum (NDNAF), Wisdom Ikuli, hailed President Buhari\u2019s prompt signing into law of the legislation.\n\nIkuli, said the action of the President showed his high level of responsibility and responsiveness and a further confirmation of his proactive and compassionate disposition especially to the plights of the over exploited people of the Niger Delta and the Oil Producing Communities in particular.\n\nPDP, PANDEF, Others Kick\n\nBut despite the accolades that have been heaped on Buhari over the new oil and gas law, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has berated the president.\n\nAccording to the political party, the president ignored the outcry by Nigerians across board not to sign the law, describing it as offensive, repugnant and anti-people.\n\nThe party in a statement by the National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, noted that the signing of the law, despite widespread public rejection, amounted to endorsement of imposition, saying it further confirmed that, \u201cPresident Buhari and his All Progressives Congress (APC) have no iota of respect for the people as well as the tenets of democracy as a system of government.\u201d\n\nAccording to the PDP, \u201cBy his action, President Buhari has only authenticated that he is not a listening leader and that the APC and its leaders are only out to trample on the will of Nigerians for their selfish interests.\n\n\u201cIn putting his hands to endorse the obnoxious bill, even with its distasteful, paltry and provocative three per cent revenue to oil producing communities, President Buhari and the APC have again displayed disdain and insensitivity to the sufferings of the people of the Niger Delta.\u201d\n\nThe PDP said the President could have returned the bill to the National Assembly with a request that it was made to address the demands of the oil producing communities.\n\nIt added: \u201cOur party fears that the new law cannot guarantee the desired stability and development in the oil and gas sector as well as respite in the Niger Delta region.\n\n\u201cIf anything, the Act as signed by President Buhari is a dangerous recipe for avoidable crisis in the sector.\u201d\n\nThe PDP called on President Buhari to salvage the situation by immediately forwarding an amendment bill to the National Assembly to reflect the true wishes and aspirations of every segment of the nation.\n\nWhile calling for calm across the country, particularly the South-South geo-political zone, the PDP also charged lawmakers elected on its platform to be at alert even as preparation must be commenced for an urgent amendment to this law.\n\nAlso, the Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) faulted Buhari\u2019s assent signing of the bill into law, describing it as unfortunate especially with the public outcry associated with the passage of the bill by the National Assembly.\n\nIt stated that the Niger Delta people may have no option but to take a position on the issue which include seeking political as well as legal response to the issue at stake.\n\nThe group in a statement by its spokesman, Ken Robinson, wondered why President Buhari assented to the bill to become law despite condemnation of some of its provisions including the paltry three per cent provision for the Host Communities Development Trust Fund and the appropriation of 30 per cent of NNPC Limited\u2019s profit for the Frontier Oil Exploration Fund.\n\nAccording to the group, the law fell short of the expectations of the Oil and Gas Producing Communities, which bear the brunt of unconscionable industry operations.\n\nIt further stated: \u201cThis assent, by President Buhari, simply speaks to the repugnant attitude of disregard, propelled by arrogance, disdain and contempt with which issues concerning the Niger Delta Region are treated, particularly, by the present Administration.\n\n\u201cWhat this act signifies is an unequivocal message to the Niger Delta people that how they feel and what they say, do not count, at all, in the Schemes of the Nigerian Project.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s insensitive, abominable and afar every boundary of proper Democratic practice, and, therefore, unacceptable to the good people of the Niger Delta, the critical economic nexus of the entire Nigerian territory.\n\n\u201cThe Niger Delta people will speak, shortly, after full consultations, on this callous act, on the best legal and political response.\u201d\n\nOn their part, the ljaw National Congress (INC) said it remains resolute on its earlier stance on the minimum acceptable allocation of 10 per cent to the oil bearing communities as compensation for the various degrees of damages suffered in course of oil and gas production in the area.\n\nThe president of the umbrella body of Ijaws worldwide, Prof. Benjamin Okaba, said with President Buhari\u2019s assent, their next line of action after the passage of paltry three per cent would be announced after further consultations with critical stakeholders within and outside the region.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Kyari: Host Communities to Get $500m Annually from New PIA",
          "text": "\u2022New petroleum Act marks beginning of full deregulation\n\nEmmanuel Addeh and James Emejo in Abuja\n\nThe Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kyari, yesterday calmed frayed nerves among some indigenes of oil producing communities in the Niger Delta, maintaining that the three per cent approved under the new Petroleum Industry Act could be bigger than what the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) currently gets.\n\nSpeaking when he appeared on Arise Television, THISDAY\u2019s broadcast arm, Kyari noted that given about $16 billion total expenditure by the oil and gas sector last year, host oil communities could earn as much as $500 million yearly if the trend continues.\n\nThe new law mandates the payment of three per cent of oil companies\u2019 operating expenses in the previous year to the host oil communities, which are mostly in the Niger Delta.\n\nThe GMD noted that whereas the oil-producing communities could not determine what projects would be located in their areas before now, from now on, the new legislation ensures that they largely control their funds and projects in the communities.\n\nKyari said although in the past there were attempts to make sure that oil companies provided for the host communities, it was not done in the right manner, even if carried out in the name of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) projects.\n\n\u201cAnd three per cent of your operating expenditure is a huge number. Many people argue around whether it should be 10 per cent or five per cent or three per cent. But percentage of what? I think that\u2019s what most people don\u2019t understand today.\n\n\u201cLast year\u2019s operating expenses for the year was about $16 billion. Three per cent of $16 billion is a large number, somewhere around $500 million plus. That\u2019s because in today\u2019s context, it is probably bigger than the NDDC. That\u2019s really what it is. That\u2019s what you\u2019re providing,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe stressed that the signing into law of the new Act essentially means transforming from a law that is 54 years old to something new, saying that with the legislation, the NNPC would now operate under the Company and Allied Matters Act (CAMA).\n\n\u201cThe meaning of this is that this company will just be another privately-owned company in a sense, this company will pay taxes, this company will pay royalties, and this company will deliver dividend to its shareholders. This isn\u2019t the situation today, because the corporation has no such obligation today.\n\n\u201cWhat this bill will do now is that in the very short term, within the framework of the petroleum industry act, within six months a new company will be incorporated. That means all liabilities and assets of this company will be transferred to the new company, not all of them.\n\n\u201cBy the way, the bill is also very clear that some toxic assets of the corporation would no longer would be with the corporation, but the shareholders can decide to keep some of the assets and leave some within the corporation,\u201d he explained.\n\nGiven the new scenario, Kyari pointed out that the NNPC would become more efficient, much slimmer and a much more commercial national oil company at par with its peers across the globe, pledging that the company will do better under the new arrangement.\n\nHe added that there was already a framework established by government, which would take care of the new transition within the timeframe of six months to incorporate and transfer assets, personnel among others.\n\nThe GMD noted that while he recognises that the NNPC is a national oil company operating in a resource-dependent country, with some obligations to the people, the new law would effectively mean the deregulation of the sector.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a CAMA company, you cannot put those obligations or those responsibilities on the company, and therefore, somebody will have to pay for it. Here, it is all of us because once you are selling petroleum below market price, and essentially that\u2019s the meaning of subsidy, and somebody will have to pay for it and that\u2019s the state, all of us.\n\n\u201cThe PIB did envisage that we\u2019re going to have a market regulated petroleum market regime. And by the way, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware that only petroleum is regulated today. And every other petroleum product prices are determined by the market. And therefore the only one element that is not resolved today is petrol,\u201d he noted.\n\nWhile the new law envisages a fully deregulated market, Kyari stressed that a number of engagements have been going on to ensure a smooth transition.\n\nHowever, he said when deregulation eventually happens, there would be safeguards against market manipulation to ensure the poor and vulnerable are not unduly exposed.\n\n\u201cThe provision of the law is such that it recognises that subsidy will be out someday. But it didn\u2019t say that we\u2019ll do it tomorrow. So there are a number of balancing that we will do, there\u2019s clearly a policy issue for government to say that I\u2019m going to let go of this,\u201d he explained.\n\nFurther commenting on the possible impact of subsidy removal on ordinary Nigerians, the NNPC GMD admitted that eliminating the subsidy regime could have adverse consequences on the ordinary person if not properly managed.\n\nHe said certain conditions needed to be fulfilled by government before the policy action is taken.\n\nAmong other things, he said there must be some arrangement to provide alternative for petroleum by making gas readily available to consumers at a more affordable prices.\n\nHe also said there\u2019s need to put in place some structures that would stabilise prices to avoid exploitation of the ordinary people under the new regime.\n\n\u201cAnd therefore, those conditions and provisions must take place before you can think of exit,\u201d he said.\n\nKyari said there are already ongoing engagements with stakeholders including labour on how to deal with the issue of subsidy in the new regime.\n\nHe said,\u201dI think two things would play out, first of all, timing is everything in this conversation. When will that happen? Obviously it is not tomorrow and is there any engagement going on?\n\n\u201cAbsolutely correct today because as we speak now there are a number of engagements that has been going on and there\u2019s one element that is not resolved which is that will any removal of subsidy have adverse impact on the ordinary person?\n\n\u201cThe answer is correct if you don\u2019t manage it properly. And so what can you do about it. \u201c\n\nThe NNPC GMD said, \u201cWith passage of the PIB into law, you must determine how you are going to transit out of this.\n\n\u201cTransition means you either set platform for market manipulation; do you have safeguards against potentially a transportation cost rises and is it going to affect some labour issues that you have to deal with? And so many other things that have happened in other jurisdictions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not what you can do in one, three two months but obviously make up your mind that the market is going to determine the price of petroleum and then you must put up a process and that process is clearly determined by what us really practical today.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cAs an insider, I know that Mr. President\u2019s key concern around the price of petroleum is that how is this going to affect the ordinary person? How are we going to deal with it and what excuses do we have to make sure that we don\u2019t sell at the prices we sell today and of course, this is a very obvious and germane concern but can you afford it?\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s the other question we have to ask in the long term but in the short term those engagement must take place; the provision of the law is such that it recognizes that subsidy will be out someday but it didn\u2019t say we will do it tomorrow.\n\n\u201cBut I also agree as an insider that you do need to have some structures on ground to ensure that there\u2019s no some form of adverse effects on the ordinary Nigerian and that includes stabilisation of how prices are fixed in the market so that you done have exploitation of the ordinary people.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Iyin Aboyeji, Caleb Zipperstein, on why Future Africa is opening an office in Israel",
          "text": "Last week, a former associate director with leading Isreali VC OurCrowd Caleb Zipperstein, announced his appointment as a venture partner with Future Africa, and the launch of their Israeli office. This was a bit of a surprise as most local startups or funds have historically looked to Europe or Asia, as alternative sources of capital. So we sat down with Future Africa co-founder Iyin Aboyeji and Caleb to get some insight behind the move.\n\nAdegoke: Iyin. You have a reputation of being ahead of the curve and spotting the next best startup idea or trend so I\u2019m curious. Why are you opening an office in Tel Aviv, Israel? When everyone else is looking to the West then maybe Asia, for capital?\n\nIyin: The first reason is Caleb. You can\u2019t go to Israel without a professional like Caleb to support you both in terms of his political savvy with the existing prime minister\u2019s office and experience and numbers with Israeli VC OurCrowd which is a firm that is tailored after ours. Working with Caleb was the first direction. I think we would have worked with Caleb anywhere he was in the world.\n\nThe other benefit is when we think of the kind of challenges we face here, from security to agriculture, I think there\u2019s a lot we can learn from the Israeli venture community. We are in the US you know. So it\u2019s not a question of us looking away from the West but really looking in places where others wouldn\u2019t, to find a new class of limited partners (LPs).\n\nAdegoke: What does the current state of ecosystem relationship between Africa and Israel look like and where will Future Africa take that relationship to?\n\nIyin: There\u2019s been a long history, maybe hidden, when it comes to things like cybersecurity. A lot of us know Cybersun. That\u2019s an Israeli firm in Nigeria. Even agriculture. A lot of drip irrigation technology that is used across the country is Israeli tech.\n\nCaleb: Yeah. Netafim. In fact, they announced last year a $60 million deal or something like that with Rwanda. Tala communications which is in Kenya raised from an Israeli VC. Zipline raised from an Israeli VC. There are lots of collaborations. Today, Israel has three direct flights to Addis Ababa and their schedules were barely altered during the pandemic.\n\nIyin: My mindset is there are hidden relationships between the Nigerian and Israeli tech communities. It\u2019s not at an all-time high though. So there\u2019s an opportunity for us to really build that with Caleb in Israel, get more Israeli LPs, people that are very optimistic about technology and its use for solving real problems. And we\u2019re not stopping with Tel Aviv. At the moment, we\u2019re having conversations about an office opening in Dubai and London. We\u2019re going to be scaling Future Africa very fast around the world and building this global investment firm that\u2019s focused on Africa.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAdegoke: How did you meet Caleb?\n\nIyin: I had this bunch of really interesting calls with Caleb. He reached out to me when he was thinking about moving to Rwanda during the pandemic to learn about and explore the innovation and VC ecosystem in Africa. We met online and started talking a lot and I told him that a good way for him to get involved would be to work with us especially around investor success. This is because he comes with that understanding of how to get investors infectiously excited about Africa.\n\nCaleb Zipperstein\n\nAdegoke: I agree! Caleb is always enthusiastic every time I speak with him.\n\nIyin: Yeah. That\u2019s the kind of energy we need in our firm to bring more investment into Africa.\n\nAdegoke: How would you characterize the Israeli ecosystem in terms of the size of investments, the biggest startups, or entrepreneurs?\n\nCaleb: What\u2019s going on in the Israeli ecosystem is that the economy is maturing. We\u2019re seeing more unicorns and growth deals than ever before. There were 19 IPOs last year. We\u2019re not seeing less private capital coming into the country but we\u2019re seeing a little bit less of early-stage investing. I\u2019m a little bit curious if this then presents some market opportunity for investors who are looking for early-stage deals. Through the pandemic, Israelis have these key hidden records in fundraising. We\u2019ve had more unicorns, Lemonade, and two companies\u2019 IPO recently. The former commander of the Israeli Mossad, the most elite secret service spy agency in the world, was just hired to be Israel\u2019s representative for SoftBank. It\u2019s crazy what is happening within the tech ecosystem in terms of big solutions. Israel\u2019s Prime Minister was a cybersecurity entrepreneur and an investor. The former mayor of Jerusalem made his money as an early investor in Checkpoint Cybersecurity. Generally, through the pandemic, the Israeli tech ecosystem has grown, the values have grown, the companies have matured. Now the question really is how this affects the early stage landscape. Israel will always be entrepreneurial, innovative, looking to solve problems. I\u2019m interested in if there\u2019ll be more opportunities for collaboration with neighbouring markets, which in this case would include Africa.\n\nAdegoke: Outside of Israel, which market would you say receives most of Israeli tech investment?\n\nCaleb: I\u2019d say Silicon Valley. VCs like Ribbit Capital. I think Ribbit led the last round in ChipperCash. So there could be a really interesting Israeli-African connection. I\u2019m really hoping that Israeli innovators will look to Africa and also that Israeli startups, growth companies, and corporate venture funds in Israel will be working closely with Future Africa and its portfolio companies. There\u2019s a huge fintech following but there are not enough jobs for Israelis. There\u2019s room for more great fintech but seeing the fintech boom in Africa, we think there could be some great ways for talent exchange and collaboration.\n\nAdegoke: Is the predominant investment thesis in Israel similar to what we have here? Beyond key sectors like fintech, do you see investors putting their money in other business areas?\n\nCaleb: Israel is not a B2C market. We\u2019ve also very recently have become more of a scale-up market. There are many startups that were sold for hundreds of millions of dollars before they were even selling a single product. In Africa, the way to become a unicorn is to have a great product, management team, execution. I think the potential ways in which Israel is.\n\nIyin: Caleb\u2019s remit is going to go beyond Israel. So the presence in Israel is just a part of the full picture. We want to be visible to investors, particularly to those that can add a lot of value to our portfolio. And this is where we may be looking for partnerships and solutions. Like in Dubai, there\u2019s a whole bunch of companies coming particularly from Europe who leverage Israel as their premier headquarters. Caleb\u2019s going to be working with us across the world, with our investors. We currently have over 300 investors from across the world. And we\u2019re looking to further scale our presence for investors all over the world \u2013 from current offices in the U.S., Tel Aviv, and Lagos, with plans to set up in London, Dubai, etc, \u2013 and we\u2019re hiring quite a number of people for the expansion.\n\nAdegoke: Nice! How do you plan to sell the African story to entrepreneurs and investors?\n\nCaleb: I\u2019m going to show them articles on TechCabal which have been showing stories about big rounds in companies, startups reaching unicorn status, Paystack getting sold, Flutterwave creating the impact that they\u2019ve had, and reaching business milestones that they\u2019ve had. The numbers don\u2019t lie. The number of deals in Africa is growing year over year \u2013 literally at an out-of-control pace. And early investors in those deals have been able to benefit demonstrably from those wins which is the embodiment of VC \u2013 high risk, high reward. Honestly, I cannot think of a better person to introduce the African VC ecosystem to this country than E because of his experience as an entrepreneur and an investor.\n\nShare this article\n\nAdegoke Oyeniyi | Author @seunadegoke01",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

At the event, I learnt practical strategies on how to navigate through Nigeria\u2019s unique market. With the grant my business won, I was able to get a refrigerator for my business, which was a pressing need at the time.

Since then, we have gone on to increase our product offerings, added to our collection, and leveraged technology for the best of publicity.\u201d \u2014 W. Habib, CEO Smiley Socks Company.\n\n\u201cGiven the nature of my business, it\u2019s one that\u2019s full of unpredictable turns.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in the workplace, and this also plays out in the venture capital space. According to Crunchbase, global VC funding to female founders dropped in 2020. Their figures show that 800 female-founded startups received $4.9bn from investors \u2014 a 27% decrease from the same period in 2019.\n\nOne reason for this is low representation in VC firms. Axios reports that 12.4% of decision-makers in US venture capital firms are women. And only 10% of West African startups that cumulatively raised $1m between 2010 and 2020 had at least one female co-founder.\n\nThis is a problem Yemi Keri, one of a handful of women investing in African startups, is passionate about solving. After getting a taste of angel investing with the Lagos Angel Network and seeing how hard it was for women to get funded, she co-founded Rising Tide Africa to get more women involved in angel investing.\n\nTechpoint Africa caught up with her for a chat, and she held nothing back as she shared her experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nI got into angel investing by referral with the Lagos Angel Network. Now I\u2019m on the board, but I got started there. I think this was 2014/2015, and Tomi Davies had started off Lagos Angel Network and wanted a group of us to come in and understand what it was all about. If I recall correctly, he brought about 50 of us together, and every so often, we would meet and listen to pitches.\n\nI used to watch and listen to the kind of questions that were asked. My background is in information technology, so this was new to me at the time. I made two investments \u2014 in Cafe Neo and Big Cabal \u2014 with Lagos Angel Network, and that\u2019s how I came into angel investment.\n\nWhat was the attraction to these companies?\n\nFor Cafe Neo, it was the revenue and expansion model and the target audience (youthful demography). In the case of Big Cabal, the passionate team, the possibility of catering for multiple audiences, and the various products that were in the pipeline when we invested won me over.\n\nWhat influenced the founding of Rising Tide?\n\nAround 2016, I began to toy with the idea of having a female-focused angel network because many of the people who came to pitch were men who got more attention and interest than the few women who showed up. And this made me wonder. It wasn\u2019t by design, but I began to notice that, first of all, the questions they asked women were kind of different.\n\nSecondly, the women were not communicating effectively to the investor team, and the kinds of businesses they pitched were slightly different. Women often do their businesses with a sense of passion. As we approached 2017, a lady came to pitch one of the best products in the healthcare sector \u2014 it still is today \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t convey it very well.\n\nI think it was her first few months of fundraising, so Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien and I took her aside and began to mentor her. We took her to pitches; we would put a group of women together and tell her to pitch. We would then question her thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nAfter a while, we brought her back to the team, and everybody was impressed and wanted to invest. They got to the point of negotiations, and the rest is history. Though we did not invest then, she\u2019s doing well. I knew that there was a gap and that we had hit on something we could develop.\n\nSo Ndidi and I got together and started Rising Tide Africa, which has been my major focus. We founded Rising Tide to increase women\u2019s participation in angel investing so that they can see it as an asset class; the end goal is to invest in more female founders. We believe that with more female angel investors, we can reduce the gender funding gap for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the genesis of Rising Tide, and it is a vehicle in which we are now investing. Lagos Angel Network has metamorphosed into a network of networks. Now we have different networks within Lagos Angel Network.\n\nHow many startups has Rising Tide invested in?\n\nBy 2019, we had done six. By the end of 2020, we had 15 investments. In 2021 we have made six investments. That would mean 21 investments in all, and we have completed the due diligence for two others, for which we are about to call for funds.\n\nHow many investments have you made?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m on my 19th investment.\n\nWhat is Rising Tide\u2019s average ticket size?\n\nWe initially said we would start with $25,000, but so far, our largest ticket size is $289,000. We intend to do between $50,000 and $200,000.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to increase female participation in both startups and angel investing. What else drives your investment mission?\n\nRising Tide is set up on four major pillars, one of which is investments.\n\nThe other thing that we do is education. We now have about 64 members at Rising Tide, and some of them are new to angel investing, so we have to do a lot of educating.\n\nWe try to teach them about things going on in the ecosystem so they can be better investors. We also educate the entrepreneurs. Over the years, we\u2019ve organised training and masterclasses for our founders and others in the ecosystem. We are now developing Entrepreneurship 101, which contains several courses to help entrepreneurs become investment-ready. We plan to develop other curricula that will be required for the ecosystem.\n\nThe other arm is networking. Just like what you\u2019re doing, having us talk about investments and enabling entrepreneurs to have access to investors, we also do our bit in terms of networking. We attend events where we meet many entrepreneurs.\n\nWe organise events where entrepreneurs can meet many investors not only within Rising Tide but also outside. We do a lot of coaching and panel roles for other networks or groups of networks. So we try to develop not only Rising Tide but also the ecosystem.\n\nThe fourth arm is mentoring, which is very crucial. We act as individual mentors for our portfolio. We don\u2019t believe that investments alone are what we need to provide for our businesses. We believe in growing with them and holding their hands.\n\nYou get a pool of people who can mentor you for a period. So we have one-offs like that. We also have mentoring sessions where we spend three to six months mentoring a business. Our goal is to mentor them until they are investment-ready, either for Rising Tide or any other network willing to invest in them.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is giving back to the ecosystem and ensuring that it develops so that our businesses do not die within the first three years. Those are the four pillars that Rising Tide operates by.\n\nAre there specific markets or industries that you focus on?\n\nWe are sector-agnostic; however, we try to invest in certain sectors. We look at sectors that have volume and the most impact on our economy \u2014 like education, for instance. Apart from education, we\u2019re looking at something related to healthcare. So education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, essential goods, and services are our areas of interest.\n\nHow do you determine what startups to invest in?\n\nWe have an investment process that guides us. First of all, tech and tech-enabled startups get our attention. We prioritise female-owned, female-led, and gender diverse companies. We look at their business model critically. We look at the market. Of course, we look at their financials and their corporate documents.\n\nSo we filter based on our investment philosophy. After we do that, if they qualify, we look at factors like their team. We look at their qualification and prior experience, their commitment to the business itself; we don\u2019t want people doing part-time coming to us for investment.\n\nWe look at diversity. We go as far as looking at who sits on your board of directors and talking to some of your references. We also look at your business model. Don\u2019t forget that these are early-stage startups, and there\u2019s only so far we can go in terms of due diligence, but we look at these basic things.\n\nWhat are their revenue sources? Who are their potential customers and suppliers? What kind of pipeline do they have? What\u2019s their value proposition? We look at the size of the market and the key drivers within that landscape. These are external things that we look at in terms of whether there\u2019s a unique selling point, the barriers to entry, and the competitive landscape.\n\nSome don\u2019t have historical financials, but we look at how objective their revenue projections are? What will their gross margins be? Their burn rate of cash \u2014 how long our investment can carry them. Also, because we are angel investors, we want to exit between a three to five year holding period, so we look at the exit potential.\n\nThis is how we filter and look at the kind of businesses that we invest in. If we are not investing in Nigeria, we would require a local investment network in that country to co-invest with us because those are the people who understand the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI will talk about the team first. If a founder says, \u201cI am still keeping my day job until we get funding,\u201d that\u2019s a red flag because it means that the founder is not confident about their business. You will quickly lose the interest of an investor. So, when you are pitching, make sure you are fully committed to your startup.\n\nThe other thing is that while you are putting your team together, try and understand the kind of skill sets that you require based on what you are doing and ensure that you have those requisite skills. Ensure that you are not relying on one person to the point that if your technology person or CTO leaves, your startup shuts down.\n\nSome founders tend to make the CTO a co-founder, but you have to be sure about the interest of your CTO. Even though you make them your co-founder, that might not be enough to hold them down.\n\nDon\u2019t rely solely on raising capital from investors, solely being the keyword. Fundraising is a different ball game in itself, and sometimes, it makes you shift focus from your business. A founder needs to determine how much they need over a fixed period so that they\u2019re not continuously raising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re raising funds, remember that an investor does not want to fund your overhead. Do not raise $100,000 and then use it to rent a place or pay salaries. That is not what we\u2019re interested in investing in.\n\nEven if you use some of it for your overheads, let most of it be for improving or scaling your product or whatever it is that will make the business grow. We also advise founders not to give out majority equity of their business. As angel investors, we also say, \u201ctry not to take more than 15% of the business, so you do not kill it.\u201d\n\nThey will always need to have that kind of authority because if other investors are coming in down the line and you have given away 30% already without even getting to Series A, then it starts to become a major challenge.\n\nAnother issue that investors are beginning to see is the level of valuation. It\u2019s incredible how a company that started business 5 or 12 months ago and is still in product development is valuing itself at $1 million. That is ticking off a lot of investors. Be realistic in your valuation.\n\nWe are not in the mature European and American markets, so stop equating your business to startups in those regions; it is bad for the ecosystem. You have to be able to justify your valuation to angel investors. If we see that something is overvalued, we walk away.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nAmayi Foods and Migo in terms of expansion into other environments. Amayi is on Amazon Prime and sells globally, and Migo \u2014 formally Mine.io \u2014 has expanded its services to Brazil.\n\nHave you had bad investments, and how did you deal with them?\n\nIn your portfolio as an investor, you should be ready to lose some funds. Before we onboard our investors, we always tell them only to invest what will not affect their lifestyles because statistically, only one or two of your investments will become a unicorn. However, they will make up for your other investments.\n\nWe started off investing really critically in 2019. We have two that are not looking promising so far. As for the others, it\u2019s still too early for us to say they have failed. What we do when we are investing is to position the team lead of that investment as a board observer or a board member in that startup, so they act as a liaison between Rising Tide and the startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried everything from mentoring to handholding to board observing, and we\u2019ve made recommendations, but we\u2019re still watching. It\u2019s still early to say that they are really bad. We hope that the recommendations we\u2019ve made can take them out of the hole that they\u2019re in.\n\nWhat startups are in your portfolio?\n\nSo we have Migo, Amayi foods, Big Cabal, Cafe Neo, Aruwa Capital, OZ\u00c9, Kwik, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Eden, Blackbet \u2014 which we co-invested in with Lagos Angel Network.\n\nInkblot is an interesting one because we decided to try entertainment. We have Seso Global, Emergency Response Africa \u2014 very early stage but gaining a lot of traction. We have Bankly, Chekkit, and Gradely.\n\nAre there any deals that you passed on that you regret?\n\n(Laughs) There will always be deals that you pass on. I think in the early stages of Lagos Angel Network, we let Flutterwave go. We also let Paystack go. That\u2019s for Lagos Angel Network. Now, I don\u2019t know if any we let go has done well, but you will always have those companies.\n\nThere\u2019s a company called Termii. We didn\u2019t want to pass up on them, but before we could conclude, they had gotten other investors. At that time, our investment process took so long because we were at the teething stages ourselves. This was 2018/2019. As an investor, you win some and lose some.\n\nHow do you deal with the fear of missing out as an angel investor?\n\nThere will always be deals. If you miss one bus, there will always be others. If you miss out in the early stages, you might get another opportunity later. There will always be a chance for you to get on board, and if there is none, it wasn\u2019t yours.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nFor Rising Tide Africa, you can send an email to info@risingtideafrica.com. You can also visit the website at www.risingtideafrica.com if you want to join us as an angel investor. Finally, you can send your pitches to pitches@risingtideafrica.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

          "text": "\u2018I Married Two Wives Same Day So That I Can Always Have An Alternative\u2019 \u2013 Delta Farmer\n\nShare Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nWARRI \u2013 Thirty three (33) year old farmer, Akpove Blessing, from Isoko in Delta State , whose photograph with his two wives surfaced on social media last week of his intention to marry two wives on Sunday, August 15, 2021, has said his decision was borne out of his desire to always have an alternative to fall back on.\n\nSpeaking with the Nigerian Observer on Sunday at Lagos-Igbide, Isoko South Local Government Area, Delta State, where the wedding took place, Akpove, added that although he is not rich, he married the two wives in order to have an alternative when one of them is not ready for conjugal activity.\n\n\u200c\u201d You know that women can be difficult at times; so I took the decision so that, when there is a problem with one, or I hurt any of them, I can always fall back on my other wife, to satisfy myself\u201d\n\n\u201c But my father didn\u2019t marry more than one,\u201d he noted.\n\nHe said although the two wives already had six children (four boys and two girls) for him, the Sunday ceremony was the climax of the event which had started the previous day(Saturday) with visits to his in-laws for the official payment of bride price to the two families ,one after the other.\n\n\u201cMy first wife is the one that they brought to me first. I married two wives because I love to marry two women.\n\nHe admonished men to marry as many wives as possible rather than running after side chicks and endanger their lives.\n\n\u201cRegarding cheating, that\u2019s why it\u2019s good to marry as many as possible. I don\u2019t want to behave like those big men or Nigerian politicians who keep their wives at home and go after side chicks old enough to be their daughters so as to satisfy their appetite.\n\n\u201cThey bear my name. We live together. They have children for me already. My firstborn is 11years old . I started dating them at different times. I\u2019m a farmer. Only God is blessing me to care for them. With little work, God helps me.\n\n\u201cOne of them is a hairdresser and the other a nurse. They\u2019re not really rich. I wish I can be empowered to cater for them: such as making me minister of women affairs. That could help and will help me maintain their beautiful looks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a burden to marry two. But with Nigeria economy now, the only that gives a man happiness is women; you\u2019re not rich to enjoy life, the other thing that can make you happy is women.\n\n\u201d If you\u2019re rich and your manhood is not functioning, anger will take over you.\n\n\u201cMy friends love it. They encourage me. Though they do not marry two wives. I\u2019ll keep encouraging my wives that things will be better. Both have two boys and one girl each. So both have given me four boys, two girls.\n\n\u201cTo manage them is in God\u2019s hands. I\u2019m a Christian, but not a man of God, I am just a churchgoer .Solomon had several. I only have two. I believe God will help me to care for them. If one shuns me, I go to the other for solace. I love them equally. I\u2019ll have both of them by my side for our honeymoon in the hotel room,\u201d he disclosed.\n\nOne of the wives, which he addressed as the first one, Oghenekome Okoro alias Kome, however, said she would not be pleased if her husband goes for more wives.\n\n\u201cI like my husband marrying two of us. I know that if my second cooperates with me, we\u2019ll live peacefully like sisters. We don\u2019t envy each other.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known my husband for 12 years. It\u2019s not a big thing to marry two wives. Instead of having side chicks like even some pastors do, is it not better to marry two wives?\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t allow him to marry another wife again. We two are enough for him,\u201d she quipped.\n\nOn her part, the second wife, Oghenemaro, said , it will be fine, if her husband decides to marry additional wife.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see anything wrong with it; I cannot stop that decision.

          "title": "Recovered Loot: State governments sue FG over alleged diversion of N1.8trn, N450bn assets",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s 36 state governments have jointly sued the federal government at the Supreme Court over alleged illegal diversion of over N1.8 trillion in recovered loot.\n\nAlso allegedly diverted by the federal government, according to the plaintiffs, are N450 billion worth of non-cash assets recovered proceeds of crime since 2015.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that, instead of paying the cash into the Federation Account, the federal government illegally diverted it into the Consolidated Revenue Accounts (CRA) and other accounts not recognised by the Nigerian constitution.\n\nA \u201ccommon pool of all revenues of the federation of Nigeria\u201d, the Federation Account houses the funds that are meant to be shared among the federating units based on agreed revenue sharing formula, the plaintiffs explained in an affidavit filed in support of the suit.\n\nOn the other hand, the CRA, according to the plaintiffs, is the account into which the federal government\u2019s share from the Federation Account, other federal earnings, and funds belonging to specific state governments are paid.\n\nOther federal earnings payable to the CRAs include receipts from federal government licenses and land revenue, administrative fees, earnings and sales, rent of government property, interests from federal government investments, repayments from state governments, Personal Income Tax of Armed Forces, and others.\n\nThe funds in the CRAs strictly belonging to the federal government and specific states, are not distributable among the federating units, the Director-General of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), Asishana Okauru, who deposed to the affidavit on behalf of plaintiffs, stated.\n\n\u201cWhen funds are allocated from the Federation Account to the Federal or State Governments as the case may be, they are transferred to the respective Consolidated Revenue Accounts from which appropriation for government expenditure is made by an Appropriation Act or a Supplementary Appropriation Act, whichever the case,\u201d the supporting affidavit added.\n\nThe plaintiffs, citing sections 162(1), 162 (10) and 80 of the Nigerian constitution and section 2 of the Finance (Control and Management) Act, 1958, argued that recovered funds qualify as revenue payable to the Federation Account instead of the Consolidated Revenue Account of the federal government.\n\nTherefore, it is \u201cunconstitutional to remit or divert revenue payable into the Federation Account to the Consolidated Revenue Account of the Federal Government or any other account whatsoever, or to apply the said revenue to any other purpose,\u201d the plaintiffs argued.\n\nThey are therefore asking for the remittance of N1.8 trillion (cash) and N450billion (non-cash) in recovered loot since 2015 into the federation account.\n\nThey are also asking for a detailed account of the recovered assets not remitted into the Federation Account by President Muhammadu Buhari, as well as all the relevant officials and agencies of government.\n\nThey also want the apex court to compel the federal government through the\n\nRevenue Mobilisation and Fiscal Commission (RMFAC) to design the modalities for distributing recovered assets among the federating units.\n\nThe state governments, whose legal team is led by widely known Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Femi Falana, filed the suit with far-reaching implications on the handling of forfeited assets in Nigeria at the Supreme Court on June 16, 2021.\n\nThe court document seen by PREMIUM TIMES late Monday, has the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, representing the federal government, as the sole defendant in the suit marked, SCN/CV/393/2021.\n\n\u2018How Buhari violates Nigerian constitution\u2019\n\nA legal action spearheaded by the NGF led by Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State and supported by all the 36 state governors across party lines, the suit accuses President Buhari of various constitutional breaches in his handling of the forfeited assets.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe plaintiffs said, while claiming to be promoting his anti-corruption agenda, Mr Buhari \u201chas consistently contravened the provisions of the Constitution, violated the rights of the states and abused the Federal Government\u2019s position as trustee of the Federation Account\u201d.\n\nThey accused him of committing these violations \u201cby diverting funds meant for the Federation Account into other accounts owned and operated by the federal government, including the Consolidated Revenue Accounts, and applied the said revenues for the sole benefit of the Federal Government\u201d.\n\nThey also attributed more constitutional violations to the Asset Tracing, Recovery and Management Regulation, 2019, made by the Buhari administration through the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami.\n\nContrary to the constitutional provisions, the plaintiff argued, the Regulation \u201cestablishes the Federal Government of Nigeria Asset Recovery Account domiciled with the Central Bank of Nigeria and prescribes that all proceeds from the Final Forfeited Assets should be paid into the said account\u201d.\n\nThey added that the Regulation also establishes the Interim Forfeiture Recovery Account into which all funds belonging to other tiers, or forfeited to other tiers shall be paid into.\n\n\u201cBy establishing the Asset Recovery Account and interim Forfeiture Recovery Account into which revenue from recovered assets is to be paid, the Asset Recovery Regulation contradicts the provisions of the Constitution. The Honorable Attorney General of the Federation has also acted beyond his constitutional powers,\u201d they said further.\n\nDiverted recovered loot\n\nThe plaintiffs noted that since 2015, \u201cnumerous recoveries of illegally acquired assets have been secured through anti-corruption and law enforcement agencies\u201d ,including the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC), the Nigerian Police Force and the Office of the Attorney General of the Federation.\n\nBetween 2015 till date, they said, the federal government has secured both international and municipal forfeiture, recovery and repatriation of stolen assets, including a total sum of N1, 836, 906, 543, 658.73.\n\nOther such recovered assets, according to the plaintiffs include, about 167 properties, 450 cars, 300 trucks and cargoes, and 20, 000,000 barrels of crude oil worth over N450 billion, according to the state governments.\n\nThey, however, said the President, through his ministers and anti-corruption and law enforcement agencies \u201chave failed to remit the receipts, proceeds or income derived from the recovered assets to the Federation Account as constitutionally required\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe federal government has consistently diverted these funds to other purposes, including payment into its Consolidated Revenue Account for its sole benefit,\u201d Mr Otauru said in the supporting affidavit.\n\n\u201cWhere revenues payable into the Federation Account have been illegally diverted into the Consolidated Revenue Fund, or applied to any other contrary purpose by the Federal Government, the illegally diverted revenue must be repaid, and the repayment is charged on\n\nthe Consolidated Revenue Account of the Federal Government or its share of allocation from the Federation Account,\u201d the plaintiffs argued further.\n\nPrayers\n\nThe plaintiffs asked the court to grant them 13 specific prayers.\n\nThese include, a declaration that \u201cby the provisions of Section 162(1) and Section 162(10) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (As Amended), all income, returns, proceeds or receipts howsoever described derived from confiscated, forfeited and/or recovered assets constitute revenue of the Federal Republic of Nigeria which must be remitted to Federation Account for the collective benefit of the Federal, State and Local Governments\u201d.\n\nThe plaintiffs also urged the court to declare that the failure and/or refusal of the President, the Minister of Finance, the AGF office and the Accountant General of the Federation, and all other relevant authorities and/or agencies of the federation to remit the receipts, income, returns or proceeds derived from all assets recovered, seized, confiscated and forfeited into the Federation Account to be distributed in accordance with the provisions of Section 162 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (As Amended)among the Federal, State and Local Governments is unconstitutional.\n\nThey sought, among others, an order directing the President, the Minister of Finance, the AGF office, the Accountant General of the Federation, and all other relevant authorities and/or agencies of the Federation to give an account of the receipts, income, returns or proceeds derived from all assets recovered, seized, confiscated and/or forfeited to the The Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\nThe assets the plaintiffs asked the apex court to compel the officials to account for include N1, 836, 906, 543, 658.73 (cash) and N450, 000, 000, 000.00 (non-cash) ,which were not remitted to the Federation Account in line with Section 162 of the Nigerian constitution.\n\nThe plaintiffs also sought another order directing the President, the Minister of Finance, the AGF, the Accountant General of the Federation and all other relevant officials and agencies \u201cto remit\u201d the N1, 836, 906, 543, 658.73 (cash) and N450, 000, 000, 000.00 (non-cash) into the Federation Account immediately.\n\nThey also asked the apex court to direct Mr Buhari and the officials and aforementioned officials and agencies, including the Revenue Mobilisation and Fiscal Commission (RMFAC) \u201cto determine forthwith, the modalities for distributing the receipts from seized, forfeited and recovered assets among the Federal, State and Local Government from the Federation Account\u201d.\n\nNext stage\n\nThe Supreme Court is the court of original jurisdiction on disputes between the federal government and the federating units.\n\nAnd being a constitutional matter, it will be heard by a full panel of seven Justices of the Supreme Court.\n\nBut as of Tuesday, the federal government, through the office of the AGF has yet to file its defence.",
          "summary": "Nigeria\u2019s 36 state governments have jointly sued the federal government at the Supreme Court over alleged illegal diversion of over N1.8 trillion in recovered loot.\nAlso allegedly diverted by the federal government, according to the plaintiffs, are N450 billion worth of non-cash assets recovered proceeds of crime since 2015.\nOn the other hand, the CRA, according to the plaintiffs, is the account into which the federal government\u2019s share from the Federation Account, other federal earnings, and funds belonging to specific state governments are paid.\nThey are therefore asking for the remittance of N1.8 trillion (cash) and N450billion (non-cash) in recovered loot since 2015 into the federation account.\nThey are also asking for a detailed account of the recovered assets not remitted into the Federation Account by President Muhammadu Buhari, as well as all the relevant officials and agencies of government.",

          "text": "The group managing director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mele Kyari, has said host communities of oil companies in the Niger Delta could get $500 million annually from the new Petroleum Industry Act (PIA).\n\nKyari who spoke in an interview on Arise TV, said the percentage is sufficient as it could be bigger than the current share allocated to the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC).\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari on Monday, signed the PIB into law.\n\nAccording to Kyari, $16 billion was recorded as the total operating expenses by the oil and gas sector in the previous year, saying three percent of such figure is around $500 million.\n\n\u201cLast year\u2019s operating expenses for the year was about $16 billion. Three per cent of $16 billion is a large number, somewhere around $500 million plus. That\u2019s because in today\u2019s context, it is probably bigger than the NDDC. That\u2019s really what it is. That\u2019s what you\u2019re providing,\u201d he said.\n\nKyari said the signed bill, now known as the Petroleum Industry Act, will ensure that the NNPC operates under the Company and Allied Matters Act (CAMA) as a new company.\n\nHe said the NNPC would become more efficient and operate effectively as a commercial national oil company.\n\n\u201cThe meaning of this is that this company will just be another privately-owned company in a sense, this company will pay taxes, this company will pay royalties, and this company will deliver dividend to its shareholders. This isn\u2019t the situation today, because the corporation has no such obligation today,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cWhat this bill will do now is that in the very short term, within the framework of the petroleum industry act, within six months a new company will be incorporated. That means all liabilities and assets of this company will be transferred to the new company, not all of them.\n\n\u201cBy the way, the bill is also very clear that some toxic assets of the corporation would no longer would be with the corporation, but the shareholders can decide to keep some of the assets and leave some within the corporation.\n\n\u201cThe PIB did envisage that we\u2019re going to have a market regulated petroleum market regime. And by the way, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware that only petroleum is regulated today. And every other petroleum product prices are determined by the market. And therefore the only one element that is not resolved today is petrol.\u201d",

Civil society leaders believe that opposition to the government is a requirement for their work.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, government functionaries have contempt for civil society and their leaders.\n\n\u201cA major problem is when being independent from government is applied in a way that blocked relationship with Nigerian government but encourages relationship with foreign governments, which may have similar, or even worse risks that could be interpreted to project Nigerian civil society and their leaders as unpatriotic. Why should relationship with Nigerian government be considered bad, but relationship with foreign governments good?,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the way forward, Lukman said there has to be continuous negotiation between the government and civil society organisations and a framework that guarantees the independence of civil society organisations.",

          "text": "The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has failed to submit its audited account to the Office of the Accountant General of the Federation (OAGF) for scrutiny, since 2010.\n\nThis was confirmed by the Chairman of the House Committee on Finance Rep. James Faleke on Monday.\n\nFaleke, in an interactive session with the Deputy Governor, Corporate Services Department of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Edward Adamu, said the apex bank also failed to remit about N800 billion to the Federal Government.\n\nFaleke, however, ordered the CBN to present its audited account to the Office of the Accountant General of the Federation (OAGF) for scrutiny.\n\nAdamu, however, responded by saying the apex bank would interface with the OAGF and reconcile any difference there was and report to the committee in two weeks, through the Minister of Finance.\n\nAdamu, also explained why Naira is loosing value.\n\nHe said the depreciation in the value of the Naira was due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy.\n\nAdamu, during the interactive session with the House Committee on Finance on the 2022-2024 Medium-Term Expenditure Framework/Fiscal Strategy Paper (MTEF/FSP), also explained that the exchange rate was determined by the forces of demand and supply and that there were three main avenues by which Nigeria got its foreign exchange.\n\n\u201cWe have proceeds from the sale of crude oil, we have foreign portfolio inflows and remittances; those are the three major ways that we get forex.\n\n\u201cCrude oil sale has not been as high as we all will want it to be and obviously in the aftermath of COVID-19, the global economy grounded to a halt and the use of crude oil was also halted.\n\n\u201cTo the extent that sometimes in April last year, we had crude oil selling at a negative, which means that people were being paid to store what they bought and so that the avenue for forex inflows was significantly reduced.\n\n\u201cYou go on to foreign portfolio inflows, you notice that investors also settled their affairs on the side of caution and so, once COVID-19 outbreak occurred, they moved out about $120 billion dollars from emerging markets to safe havens in America and Nigeria is one of those countries from where monies were withdrawn.\n\n\u201cOn the side of remittances, once our brothers and sisters abroad were not working because of the situation they found themselves; they had very little to send to us here and so, we also saw remittances reduced.\n\n\u201cOn the demand side, we saw speculative demand on the side of Nigerians, if you needed a truck of goods because you are not sure of the uncertainties of COVID, you wanted to get three trucks.\n\n\u201cAll these pressures on both the demand and supply side, the availability of dollar became more difficult and we had a decline or depreciation in the value of the naira,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nAdamu, however, said that a lot of efforts within the CBN and the recovering global economy were helping oil prices and remittances to recover.\n\n\u201dThis is why we are happy that the exchange rate has stabilised somewhat; it is a moving target, but it has stabilised in the import and export window for a while\u201d, he added.",

          "text": "Former Head of State, General Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida (retd), remains a different personality to different people. While his tenure lasted, the military president always smarted from one controversy to the other. Just two days to his 80th birthday, he spoke in an impromptu interview with Blueprint at his Hilltop Residence in Minna, Niger state, Sunday, on a range of issues, including resource control, security and corruption among others. CLEM OLUWOLE, ABDULRAHMAN A. ABDULRAUF and AIDELOJE OJO report.\n\nMore than any other regime in the history of Nigeria, your administration, it could be argued, intelligently assembled some of the best brains in charting a way forward to develop the nation. Would you say we are putting our best brains to use today as a nation?\n\nYeah, I think you need to do more search. There are a lot of good brains in the country. You search for them; look for them\u2026 they are there.\n\nAre we really making use of our best brains as things are today?\n\nYou introduce politics into some of these issues and that makes it difficult. When I say politics, I do not mean whether they belong to All Progressives Congress (APC) or Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). I mean you bring in some other extraneous factors. But we could do better.\n\nOne of the decisions of your regime to ensure a secured nation was the establishment of the National Guard. However, the concept was heavily criticized from inception. Looking back today, what would the situation have been if the outfit were in place considering the nation\u2019s current security challenges?\n\nMay be we could have not found ourselves in the present situation as far as security is concerned if you people had allowed us to implement the National Guard concept.\n\nAt that time, they were even said to have occupied the Sambisa forest. How true?\n\n\u2026Yes, they went in there and carried out a reconnaissance of the place and so on and so forth.\n\nSo, when we said that you were being futuristic then, would you agree with us?\n\nNot only futuristic but also because of the fact that I belong to the profession of violence, meaning I was in the military. So I could put up an idea of what we might need in the future.\n\nYou played a major role in the setting up of ECOMOG, an interventional military group to ensure peace in West Africa. Looking back today, how fulfilled are you in this regard?\n\nI will say yes, you all were well aware of the situations at that time in Liberia and subsequently in Sierra Leone. These two countries were more or less torn apart and this is within our neighbourhood of Economic Community of West Africa States (ECOWAS). If we had allowed it, or looked at it without intervention, may be a lot of other West African countries would have been in trouble in their respective countries. It was in order to stop that happening, spreading into the region that we had to intervene. It is good that Nigeria played a very leading role in trying to settle the region and give it stability.\n\nYour Excellency sir, it would be recalled that you set up a political bureau at that time which came out with a two-party system. The argument then was that there was a sort of restriction in terms of options people had. Today we have two leading political parties along with other \u2018mushroom\u2019 political parties. What would you suggest as a kind of solution to this seeming challenge we have politically?\n\nI think it is good that you were old enough to remember that there was a political bureau set up and were able to produce before Nigerians all the problems about governance in the country. So, we itemised about 30 subjects that Nigeria should look into. Things like restructuring that everybody is talking about now. In the report, it was talking about devolution of powers, establishment of political parties, whether to call Nigeria a socialist country or whatever it is. There were about 30 items. The reports were based on very sound arguments. On political parties, they recommended Socialist Republic of Nigeria or something like that. We didn\u2019t want that, we preferred what is happening now, free economy we wanted, free democratic association and so on. And don\u2019t forget that at that time the world was changing. You can remember, I am sure you were old enough to remember when the then Soviet Union was beginning to go, Glasnost, Perestroika and so on and so forth. All it is either economic management or political. Nigeria would not be left alone, we belong to the comity of nations. Whatever that was happening, people were seeing and people were also agitating for these things. So we were not left out and we would not want to be caught pants down, we needed to join the process of what was happening in the world.\n\nPresently in some quarters, people are agitating for people of a particular age bracket as the nation\u2019s president come 2023. This takes us back to your era when you introduced concept of new breed politicians. But against the backdrop of your recent interview where you said people of over 60 years should take charge as president of this country, does this not contradict your earlier position on new breed politicians?\n\nWhen we introduced new breed concept, it is about 38 years now. Even those who are new breed at that time are now old breed. So it is an ongoing situation. And what I said, and you media misquoted me to say that I said Atiku and Tinubu should not contest. I never mentioned anybody. I just tried to talk about what I thought we should be looking for. My take is that once you achieved that age of about 60, in the sixties, you must have been a public servant, a private person and a professional; somebody who has been there. So you must have acquired a lot of experience over a period of years that would prepare you to take on a higher responsibility for the country. That is all. I am not saying it to rule out anybody in the country.\n\nAs an elder statesman and a major national figure, your position on resource control appeared to shock some people, especially from this part (north) of the country\u2026.\n\n\u2026Yes. I know and I said it in my interview that if I talk of resource control, somebody will put a knife and cut my neck because they don\u2019t believe in it. But I said it is a very simple thing. People who produce the resources should be able to make them benefit from whatever it is or that area should be able to pay royalties to the federal government. In fact, the federal government will even be richer if states that are oil producers are paying their royalties to the federal government. That is all simple common sense thing that I thought we should start talking about. You have organisations that pay a lot of taxes to federal government more than what we are even getting under normal circumstances.\n\nThere is no doubt that corruption has become a major problem in the country. Several measures have been put in place. What in your view is the way out of this menace?\n\nI think that we talked about that. Corruption, you have to fight it from the beginning, from the source. For example, we the military, we thought if you decentralise governance, it is a sure way of getting rid of certain corrupt aspects of our way of life. You do not have to give somebody a bribe in the bank to allow you get foreign exchange. We liberalised it, we said you can go and get it without any hindrances by establishing bureau de change and all others. Then, we gave you another example of where the ordinary man is being cheated, about commodity boards and the rest of them. In existence then, you have to pay to get your cocoa rated as Grade A or groundnut rated as Grade B. So, you stop all those controls, people feel that they can do it themselves, they don\u2019t have to wait for somebody in government. So, they have to do a lot of mobilisation and tried to make people understand and this is part of the job that (MAMSER) was doing in those days. Yet, you had everything in your own hands that would substantially add value. And the people should also know that we can get this, I do not have to go and bribe to obtain a license or anything and so on and so forth. So, it requires the people to understand and it requires us as government to put lot of other institutions in place that would facilitate these aspects of our national life in the country.\n\nWhat is your take on creation of state police?\n\nWhat I said in the past was that in those days we had Yandoka during the First Republic. Old people would say the ruling political parties are going to use them against their opponents, so kill it. However, you cannot sit down in the last 50 years still thinking about what happened to you 50 years back. You must have grown, become wiser, more informed and enlightened, and you must have developed politically. So, these are the things. Okay, who would ever believe Nigerians on their own, could resist whenever they are going to be stifled by a government when the media is being stifled. It happened not long ago. It is the Nigerians that fought against it because they are informed, they see the need for unfettered press that could rise, propagate philosophies not propagate succession of the country and so on because those are settled issues.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has signed the Petroleum Industry Bill 2021 into law.\n\nWorking from home in five days quarantine as required by the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19 after returning from London Friday August 13, the president assented to the Bill Monday August 16 in his determination to fulfil his constitutional duty.\n\nThe ceremonial part of the new legislation would be done Wednesday after the days of mandatory isolation would have been fulfilled.\n\nThe PIB Act provides legal, governance, regulatory and fiscal framework for the Nigerian petroleum industry, the development of host communities, and related matters.\n\nThe Senate had passed the Bill July 15, 2021, while the House of Representatives did same July 16, thus ending a long wait since early 2000s, and notching another high for the Buhari administration.\n\nSenate lauds president\n\nMeanwhile, the Senate has commended President Buhari for assenting to the bill.\n\nIn a statement by its spokesman, Senator Surajudeen Ajibola Basiru, the upper chamber described the presidential assent \u201cas a major victory that has the potential of bailing Nigeria out of its economic predicament and an act that will enable the country to make the most of economic gains of the oil industry for the benefit of Nigerians.\u201d\n\nBasiru said with the passage of the bill by both chambers of the National Assembly for third reading last month and signing it into law by the president, the current crop of lawmakers had broken the jinx.\n\nEfforts at reaching this stage has been a protracted affair as the Bill, first initiated in 2003 had been subjected to a ping pong affair between the previous Legislatures and the Executive.\n\n\u201cThe 9th National Assembly finally broke the jinx when it recently passed the Bill after working dispassionately by putting the interest of the Nation first, over petty squabbles and other self interests, thereby laying finally to rest previous failed attempts,\u201d he said.\n\nThe lawmaker further attributed the success of the assent to the Bill which has now become an Act to the cooperative efforts of all participating sectors in the process and also the non confrontational policy of the present National Assembly.\n\nOn the benefits of the law, Basiru said, \u201cit will juice up the National Economy by liberalising the Petroleum Sector and that it will pave way for investors, both local and international to invest in the oil sector with government on a competitive basis.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari had on September 2, 2020 forwarded a draft of the bill to both chambers of the National Assembly.\n\nIt will boost economy\n\nMeanwhile, a Capital Market Professor, Uche Uwaleke has said the presidential assent to bill would open up the sector for more investments and boost economic growth.\n\nHe said Act would not only translate to the establishment of more refineries but also end continuous importation of fuel.\n\n\u201cThe Bill makes provision for speedy granting of licenses to investors, especially in the downstream sector. This is likely to translate to the establishment of more refineries in Nigeria which will go a long way to meet local consumption with prospects of ending fuel importation and the loss of forex associated with it.\n\n\u201cThis could strengthen the value of the naira in the long run as well as create job opportunities in the petroleum value chain.\n\n\u201cThe Bill also provided for the application of cost reflective tariffs by operators and the commercialisation of NNPC Limited. One implication of this is that fuel subsidy will completely be removed,\u201d the capital market expert said.\n\nHe, however, noted some \u2018grey areas\u2019 that needed to be addressed.\n\n\u201cFor instance, the PIB made attempt to curb pipelines vandalism and restiveness in the Niger Delta region through various provisions that entitle the Host Communities to a percentage of oil revenue. Unfortunately, this area has not been properly tidied up as the percentage of oil revenue initially proposed for Host Communities was reduced.\n\n\u201cThe PIB did not also make provision for eventual partial privatisation of NNPC Limited which guarantees a more efficiently run company,\u201d the former Imo state finance commissioner added.\n\nOn his part, political economist and development researcher, Mr Adefolarin A. Olamilekan, told one of our correspondents that \u201cthe signing of the PIB is a paradigm shift in national priorities that will emphasise transparency, prompt management and engagement in the oil and gas sector in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nOlamilekan, commended the 9th Assembly and the Buhari- led administration for the drive to deregulate the oil and gas sector.\n\n\u201cIt is our hope that things would be done differently and the economy is prosperous. PIB, perhaps, provides opportunity for the economy to perform well coming from oil and gas sector that is to primarily drive competitiveness among all stakeholders.\n\n\u201cAgain, it is our belief that PIB would reassure and help build the confidence of stakeholders, investors and better host communities -oil companies\u2019 relations. Besides, we hope it will help eliminate all forms of corruption in the oil and gas sector translating into positive macro and micro economics goodies for all Nigerians,\u201d he said.\n\nPDP kicks\n\nBut the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has faulted the presidential assent to the bill for allegedly ignoring the outcry by Nigerians across board.\n\nIn a statement Monday by its National Publicity Secretary Kola Ologbondiyan, the PDP said: \u201cThe signing of the law, despite widespread public rejection, amounts to endorsement of imposition and further confirms that President Buhari and his All Progressives Congress (APC) have no iota of respect for the people as well as the tenets of democracy as a system of government.\n\n\u201cBy his action, President Buhari has only authenticated that he is not a listening leader and that the APC and its leaders are only out to trample on the will of Nigerians for their selfish interests, the party added.\n\n\u201cIn putting his hands to endorse the obnoxious bill, even with its distasteful, paltry and provocative 3% revenue to oil producing communities, President Buhari and the APC have again displayed disdain and insensitivity to the sufferings of the people of the Niger Delta, \u201cit said.\n\nThe statement further said: \u201cThe PDP holds that such is the height of contempt to oil producing communities, particularly in the face of the challenges which they face as a result of oil exploration.\n\n\u201cNoting that Mr. President could have returned the bill to the National Assembly with a request that it is made to address the demands of the oil producing communities, our party fears that the new law cannot guarantee the desired stability and development in the oil and gas sector as well as respite in the Niger Delta region.\n\n\u201cIf anything, the Act as signed by President Buhari is a dangerous recipe for avoidable crisis in the sector. The PDP calls on President Buhari to salvage the situation by immediately forwarding an amendment bill to the National Assembly to reflect the true wishes and aspirations of every segment of our nation.\n\n\u201cWhile calling for calm across the country, particularly the South-South geo-political zone, the PDP also charges lawmakers elected on its platform to be at alert even as preparation must be commenced for an urgent amendment to this law,\u201d the party said.",

The development generated criticisms notably from the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum and leaders of the South-South region, including a former minister, Edwin Clark.\n\nBut Rewane, who is the Managing Director of Financial Derivatives Company Limited, described the development as improper.\n\nREAD ALSO: PIB: 3% Too Small For Those Who Suffer Burden Of Producing Oil, Says Oyebode\n\n\u201cI am not sure that it is fair for the oil-producing communities, who suffer \u2013 if you go there, compared to other parts of the country where they produce no oil and see the level of affluence, there are multi-dimensional theft and degradation in the host communities. It is rape and that is what is happening but an imperfect bill is better than no bill,\u201d he said during an interview on Channels Television\u2019s Politics Today on Monday,\n\n\u201cFinally, the big elephant in the room; the host communities and the three percent allocation. Is the three percent the ideal, optimal compensation for the host communities? I will say, \u2018No\u2019 because I come from there but at the same time, what is more, important for the oil communities is the transparency of the money that is spent and the impact it has rather than having a tea party.\n\n\u201cOil contributes 10 percent of our GDP but it contributes 75 to 80 percent of our foreign exchange earnings, 70 percent of our fiscal revenues and when we take LNG and add it to oil, we\u2019ll have 95 percent of revenues. So, directly or indirectly, this is the goose that lays the golden egg. We\u2019ve got to nurture it even though the obsolescence of oil is a declining function of time right now. Two, the irrelevance of OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) is staring at us, so, we have to make hay while the sun is shining even though the cloud is overcast.\u201d\n\nThe economist noted that the signing of the bill would bring an end to the \u201cabuse of NNPC officials in the running of the company,\u201d noting that President Buhari\u2019s assent to the bill is symbolic and a major milestone.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s President Muhammadu Buhari signed the Petroleum Industry Bill into law, which will now to be known as Petroleum Industry Act.\n\nWith the new act, the entire framework for doing business in Nnigeria\u2019s oil sector changes fundamentally. See some of the highlights of the new Act that will now govern operations in the sector going forward:\n\n\u2022 FG to Conclude Commercialisation of NNPC by February 2022\n\n\u2022 Act retains 3% for host communities, 30% for frontier basins\n\n\u2022 New law creates two regulatory agencies for oil industry\n\n\u2022 Commission to collect rents, royalties, production share\n\n\u2022 Downstream authority to collect gas flare from midstream\n\n\u2022 PIA imposes 1% levy on wholesale price of petroleum products\n\n\u2022 Corporation to retain 10% of profit as management fee\n\n\u2022 Oil companies to be sanctioned for understating profits, overstating losses\n\n\u2022 New legislation repeals 10 existing laws\n\n\u2022 BoT, executive members of host communities\u2019 board may not be indigenes\n\n\u2022 Oil areas to distribute funds for capital projects (75%), reserve (20%), administrative (5%)\n\n\u2022 Bill divided into fiscal, administrative, governance and institutions as well as host communities\n\n\u2022 Host communities\u2019 fund to be set up within 12 months from Monday\n\n\u2022 All employees of NNPC deemed new staff of NNPC limited\n\n\u2022 When incorporated, board appointments to be made by shareholders, not the president alone\n\n\u2022 Host communities to forfeit entitlement to extent of damage in cases of vandalism\n\nThe new Petroleum Industry Act mandates that the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) will be commercialised within the next six months, effectively transforming the national oil company into a limited liability company.\n\nAdded to that is the establishment of the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC), which shall be responsible for the technical and commercial regulation of upstream petroleum operations.\n\nAccording to the new law, the commission will ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations governing upstream petroleum operations in a manner to minimise waste and achieve optimal government revenue as well as promote healthy, safe, efficient and effective conduct of upstream petroleum operations.\n\nBut despite the hue and cry from some groups in the Niger Delta on the need to increase the host communities\u2019 fund, the new Act retained three per cent of total expenditure by the oil companies for the previous year for oil-producing areas and 30 per cent of NNPC Limited\u2019s profit oil and gas in product sharing, profit sharing and risk service contract for frontier basins exploration.\n\nAlso established is the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) which shall be responsible for the technical and commercial regulation of midstream and downstream petroleum operations in the petroleum industry.\n\nFurthermore, the NMDPR, which effectively means the extinction of the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) will ensure efficient, safe, effective and sustainable infrastructural development of midstream and downstream petroleum operation as well as promote healthy, safe, efficient and effective conduct of midstream and downstream petroleum.\n\nAmong others, the new body will promote a competitive market for midstream and downstream petroleum operations; promote the supply and distribution of natural gas and petroleum products and ensure the security of natural gas supply for the domestic gas market as well as ensure crude oil supply for domestic refineries.\n\nAlso to be floated is the Midstream and Downstream Gas Infrastructure Fund (MDGIF) which shall be funded from 0.5 per cent of the wholesale price of petroleum products and natural gas sold in Nigeria, which shall be collected from wholesale customers.\n\nOther sources of funding for the new body are grants accruing from multilateral agencies, bilateral institutions and related sources dedicated partly or wholly for the development of infrastructure for midstream and downstream gas operations in Nigeria and interest payable in respect of money in the fund.\n\nAlso, monies received from gas flaring penalties by the commission for the purpose of environmental remediation and relief of the host communities of the settlor on which the penalties are levied and any other sum freely donated shall be paid into the fund.\n\nOn the commercialisation of the NNPC, it states: \u201cThe minister shall within six months from the commencement of this Act, cause to be incorporated under the Companies and Allied Matters Act, a limited liability company, which shall be called the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC Limited).\n\n\u201cThe Minister shall at the incorporation of NNPC Limited, consult with the minister of finance to determine the number and nominal value of the shares to be allotted, which shall form the initial paid-up share capital of NNPC Limited and the government shall subscribe and pay cash for the shares.\n\n\u201cOwnership of all shares in NNPC Limited shall be vested in the government at incorporation and held by the ministry of finance incorporated and the ministry of petroleum incorporated in equal portions on behalf of the federation and the ministry.\u201d\n\nThe document further states that assets, interests and liabilities of NNPC not transferred to NNPC Limited or its subsidiary under subsection (1), shall remain the assets, interests and liabilities of NNPC until they become extinguished or transferred to the government in six months following the determination while the minister of finance and the attorney general of the federation shall develop a framework for the payment of the liabilities.\n\nAccording to the new law: \u201cNNPC shall cease to exist after its remaining assets, interests and liabilities other than its assets, interests and liabilities transferred to NNPC Limited or its subsidiaries under subsection (1) shall have been extinguished or transferred to the government.\u201d\n\nTo allay the fears expressed by beneficiaries of host community funds that oil companies may continue to under-declare expenses or profits and overstate losses, the law also set out appropriate punishments for any person who makes incorrect accounts by omitting or understating any profits or overstating any losses of which he is required under the act to make accounts.\n\nIt added: \u201cA person who prepares or causes to be prepared any incorrect schedule or statement required to be prepared under section 277 of this Act by overstating any expenditure or overstating any royalties or other sums or by omitting or understating any amounts repaid, refunded, waived or released, or gives or causes to be given any false;\n\n\u201cOr misleading information in relation to any matter or thing affecting his liability to hydrocarbon tax is liable to an administrative penalty of the sum of N15,000,000 or 1 per cent of the amount of tax which has been undercharged in consequence of such incorrect account.\u201d\n\nAs part of the implementation process, the law mandated the minister to within 24 months of the effective date cause an inter agency transfer of any staff of the institutions to the commission, the authority or NNPC Limited based on skills and competence requirements of the new institutions.\n\nIt stated that every settlor shall transfer any existing host communities development project or scheme under its corporate social responsibility or memorandum of understanding or any other agreement to a host communities development trust established under the act.\n\n\u201cEvery applicable settlor shall notify the commission or authority, as the case may be, upon completion of any transfer under subsection (1) to any one or more host communities development trusts of any of its existing host communities development projects or schemes.\n\n\u201cAny financial contribution made by a settlor from the effective date until the date falling 12 months after the effective date to any ongoing host communities development project or scheme in accordance with their terms, shall be deemed to constitute a contribution made by such holder or holder nominee under section 240 (2) of this act,\u201d it stated.\n\nIt stressed that rules, orders, notices or other subsidiary legislation made under the Petroleum Act, the Petroleum Profits Tax Act and the Deep Offshore and Inland Basin Production Sharing Contract Act shall continue to have effect as if made under the corresponding provisions of the Act.\n\nThe new act further mandated each settlor through its operator to make the 3 per cent available for the host communities, with each of the trusts allowed to receive donations, gifts, grants or honoraria that are provided to such host communities development trust for the attainment of its objectives.\n\n\u201cEach settlor, where applicable through the operator, shall make an annual contribution to the applicable host communities development trust fund of an amount equal to 3 per cent of its actual annual operating expenditure of the preceding financial year in the upstream petroleum operations affecting the host communities for which the applicable host

          "text": "Ivory Coast is set to roll out vaccinations against Ebola after the country recorded its first known case of the disease since 1994, the health ministry said.\n\n\u201cHealth workers, close relatives and contacts of the victim\u201d will be vaccinated from Monday afternoon, using 5,000 doses sent from Guinea, spokesman Germain Mahan Sehi told the AFP news agency.\n\nIvorian health workers had previously said vaccinations of \u201ctargeted groups\u201d had already begun on Sunday.\n\nThe case was recorded in Abidjan, Ivory Coast\u2019s economic hub, in an 18-year-old Guinean woman who had arrived in the country on Wednesday after travelling by road from Labe in Guinea, the authorities said on Saturday.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) said genetic sequencing of a virus sample would determine whether the case was linked to a recent flare-up of Ebola in neighbouring Guinea.\n\nThe fact that it had occurred in a region of more than four million people was of \u201cimmense concern\u201d, it said.\n\nEbola causes severe fever and, in the worst cases, unstoppable bleeding. It is transmitted through close contact with bodily fluids, and people who live with or care for patients are most at risk.\n\nThe death rate varies from 25 to 90 percent, according to past outbreaks, although the chance of survival rises significantly if the disease is spotted at an early stage.\n\nCombatting Ebola outbreaks mainly involves the time-honoured technique of tracing and isolating people who have been in contact with patients.\n\nThis has recently been joined by a vaccine that was extensively deployed against an epidemic that ran in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo from August 2018 to June 2020, claiming more than 2,200 lives.\n\nThe discovery in Ivory Coast comes nearly two months after the WHO declared an end to Guinea\u2019s second outbreak of Ebola, which started last year and killed 12 people.\n\nFive WHO experts have been sent from Guinea to help train several dozen Ivorian health workers in using the vaccines.",
