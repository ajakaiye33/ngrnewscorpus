          "text": "Residents of Magboro community in the Obafemi Owode Local Government Area of Ogun State have decried the activities of a dredging company, Teejay Sand Dredging, around the power grid in the area.\n\nThey accused the firm of eroding the base of the grid, which passed through the Ogun River in the Gaun area of the community.\n\nThe residents said the activities of the firm could collapse the power grid and cause hardship to the community.\n\nThe residents stormed the Cele-Oke-Ayo Road on Saturday to protest against the activities of the firm.\n\nDuring the protest, they prevented heavy-duty trucks from moving to the dredging site.\n\nThey alleged that the heavy-duty trucks also damaged their road and made it impassable for smaller vehicles.\n\nThe Coordinating Chairman of the community development association in the area, Mr Adekunle Adebanjo, said a letter was sent to the Transmission Company of Nigeria over the impending danger.\n\n\u201cAbout three teams of TCN came and commended the community for raising the alarm. On Saturday, another team came to take pictures of the fragile state of the power grid base,\u201d he added.\n\nDuring the protest, the Chairman of the New Generation Estate, one of the communities in the area, Mr Kunle Awosiyan, said the chief executive officer of the company had been evasive despite efforts by the community to have a meeting with him.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe only had a meeting with him once online and he promised to show up, but never did. His foot soldiers drop stones on the road once in a while for their trucks to pass, while our cars are stuck in the gullies created by the heavy vehicles.\n\n\u201cThese dredgers and the truck drivers always threaten to attack residents and shop owners along the road if they dare to block their way. The matter was reported to the state government, a meeting was held and the dredging company was sealed only for it to be opened again.\n\n\u201cAt the meeting, the Special Adviser to the Ogun State Governor on Environment, Mr Ola Oresanya, told the dredgers to listen to the residents by providing the necessary palliatives on the road. But till now, nothing has been done and residents are living in panic over the looming disaster.\u201d\n\nThe Regional Transmission Manager of the TCN, Oluwagbenga Ajiboye, told our correspondent that the agency was working on the matter.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe sent it to our cooperate headquarters and a team of TCN engineers was sent last week from Abuja to access the site of the incident and report back to the head office in Abuja, to enable the company to determine the next steps.\n\n\u201cThe issue is being handled and in a very short time, we will be informed about what has been decided. We\u2019re definitely working on the matter.\u201d\n\nThe owner of the dredging firm, Tajudeen Abioye, said the community was witch-hunting him for sending away another dredger who used his (Abioye) licence, adding that he was not dredging around the power grid.\n\nHe said, \u201cBut after the person was driven away, the community started writing petitions to the state government and the media that I was dredging towards the power grid, the state government shut down our site and I went to Abeokuta and showed them my documents and the site was opened back.\n\n\u201cWhen the site was opened, the community was shocked and didn\u2019t know what to do, so they said we should do a meeting and in that meeting, they said I should repair the road. I told them we could not repair the road in the rainy season and I also asked them to write the bill that would be spent on the road and they wrote N136m. I told them I could not spend that amount on the road after spending about N100m before.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

You have given us your positions.\n\n\u201cThe Joint Health Sector Unions (JOHESU) covering other professional unions in the health sector has done same and over time, we have had various associations written us at one time or the other, which is allowed in Collective Bargaining Agreements (CBAs).\n\n\u201cEven CBAs can be changed over time. What you people did is in consonance with the social dialogue on fixing wages and allowances.\n\n\u201cOn the government side, we are giving you our commitment that this is the last meeting on this matter. After this meeting, the government will study the proposals and make our recommendations, which will go to Mr President for final approval, \u2018he said.\n\nThe minister reiterated the earlier position of the government that the present hazard allowance of N5000 was not envisaged by anybody and not meant for people working in a hazardous environment, such as health workers.\n\nNgige further noted that nothing could be deemed as commensurate for the risk taken by any health worker because the person had undertaken the profession, adding that whilst professions in the health sector all have their risks in various degrees, a risk is a risk.\n\nHe, therefore, noted that nothing could be paid to equate exposure to danger in treating a patient with highly infectious diseases, such as Ebola, COVID-19, Lassa fever and the rest.\n\n\u201cWe are putting a review of the hazard allowance and also vigorously pursuing the issue of Group Life Insurance. Besides.\n\n\u201cThere is compensation for injuries sustained by any worker in the course of work through the Employee Compensation Act, ECA, handled by the Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF).\n\n\u201cWe intend in the 2022 fiscal year to make it a very universal item or application for all classes of workers including health workers,\u201d he said.\n\nResponding, the President of NMA, Dr Innocent Ujah, noted that they made mistakes at the start of the discussion on the hazard allowances, but they were corrected, expressing happiness that things were going to move forward.\n\nUjah said though the matter had prolonged for too long, they would not mind if it would be positive at the end of the day.\n\n\u201cThe issue of brain drain has become an albatross on their neck, which if not quickly contained, the country would be sitting on a time bomb.\n\n\u201cVery soon we will be faced with the stack reality of not having competent hands to manage our cases and we are exporting our best to those who would not probably need them as much as we do.\n\n\u201cIt is on record that Nigerian doctors are very well trained. Anywhere we go, not only are we well received, we do the best we can to project the image of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe also earn foreign exchange. But what is the value of money when people will die because we did not stay to look after our people? We need to produce for our people first before we produce for others,\u201d he said.",
          "summary": "The Federal Government says it would make its final decision on the proposed new hazard allowance for health workers next week.\n\u201cThe Joint Health Sector Unions (JOHESU) covering other professional unions in the health sector has done same and over time, we have had various associations written us at one time or the other, which is allowed in Collective Bargaining Agreements (CBAs).\nThe minister reiterated the earlier position of the government that the present hazard allowance of N5000 was not envisaged by anybody and not meant for people working in a hazardous environment, such as health workers.\n\u201cWe are putting a review of the hazard allowance and also vigorously pursuing the issue of Group Life Insurance.\n\u201cWe intend in the 2022 fiscal year to make it a very universal item or application for all classes of workers including health workers,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "*AfDB president says Africa should not be penalised for new strain\n\n*Wants vaccine manufacturing accelerated in continent\n\n*Emefiele, OPS seek proactive action Ramaphosa urges countries to reverse travel ban\n\nObinna Chima and Dike Onwuamaeze\n\nNigeria yesterday expressed solidarity with South Africa as it struggled with some of the difficulties posed by a new COVID-19 variant, Omicron, discovered in the country. The Nigerian government warned Western countries against discrimination against South Africa following travel restrictions imposed on Southern African countries in the aftermath of the new virus discovery.\n\nThe federal government said President Muhammadu Buhari would go ahead to receive South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, who had been scheduled to visit Nigeria from today with other top officials of his administration, on a three-day visit.\n\nMinister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, stated Nigeria\u2019s position in a chat with THISDAY ahead of a media briefing scheduled for today in Abuja on the matter.\n\nRamaphosa called for reversal of the travels restriction.\n\nIn a similar vein, President of the African Development Bank (AfDB), Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, yesterday voiced displeasure at the stigmatisation and penalisation of Africa for new COVID-19 variants discovered on the continent. Adesina urged the acceleration of vaccine production in Africa.\n\nLikewise, some members of the organised private sector (OPS) advised the federal and state governments in Nigeria to take proactive steps to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus. The OPS members said this during separate interviews with THISDAY.\n\nThat was as Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, said at the weekend in Lagos that the dire implications of the food export restrictions by some countries during the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020 should not be lost on Nigeria.\n\nEhanire insisted that the move by Western countries to ban or try to isolate South Africa was discriminatory. He this was because the variant detected in South Africa and also in Botswana and other countries had similarly been detected in Belgium, Italy, Germany and other countries.\n\n\u201cSo, the federal government condemned the rush to ban or isolate South Africa by European countries, without isolating Belgium, Italy and other European countries that have more direct flights into the United States of America and among themselves,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister argued that the position of the Western countries on the virus was not backed by science, saying so far, even if it is a mutation, the new COVID-19 variant has not caused any new deaths or proved to be worse than the Delta variant.\n\nEhanire stated, \u201cTherefore, the world should wait for that time, than to be enmeshed in heavy discrimination against South Africa. Why would they isolate South Africa? The federal government would open its doors to Ramaphosa and others who are coming from South Africa until science says otherwise. People should be vigilant.\u201d\n\nThe AfDB president, who wrote on his Twitter handle, stressed that Africa was not the source of the COVID-19 virus, which had continued to put the world on edge.\n\nThe new COVID-19 variant was first discovered in South Africa and has since been detected in Australia, United Kingdom, Germany, Israel, Italy, the Czech Republic, and Hong Kong.\n\nOwing to its discovery, Israel on Saturday announced that it was banning all foreigners from entering the country. The ban, pending government approval, was expected to last two weeks. Israelis returning from countries on the red list, which included countries in Southern Africa, would be required to isolate for seven days in a designated hotel.\n\nAustralia also banned the entry of foreigners who had travelled to nine Southern African countries in the past 14 days, including South Africa, Lesotho, Botswana, and Zimbabwe.\n\nSouth Korea, too, imposed restrictions on travellers from eight southern African countries, its Disease Control and Prevention Agency announced Saturday.\n\nForeign nationals traveling from South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Eswatini, Malawi and Mozambique were banned from entering South Korea, the agency said.\n\nBut Adesina warned, \u201cAfrica should not be labelled and penalised for COVID-19 variants and mutations that occur randomly elsewhere in the world. Africa is not the source of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cThere must be global justice, equity and fairness in access to vaccine. Global vaccine supply system has underserved Africa. Protecting one\u2019s home alone in the midst of a forest does not work.\n\nPut out the forest fire.\n\n\u201cAfrica must accelerate the manufacturing of its own vaccines and set up its own \u2018healthcare security defence system\u2019. Africa must no longer outsource health security of its 1.8 billion people to the benevolence of others.\u201d\n\nEmefiele reiterated the need for Nigerians to look inwards, considering the country\u2019s huge population. He said the pandemic presented an opportunity to fix critical infrastructure in the country so as to reduce dependence on other countries for most of the continent\u2019s needs.\n\nThe CBN governor stated, \u201cAs I\u2019ve asked in some of my recent treatises on the opportunities of the pandemic, what if the pandemic occurs again and we witness an extended restriction in movements and export bans? What if these restrictions become a new normal? What if another pandemic occurs in which all borders are closed, with food and medical imports significantly curtailed? What if the rich among us, even when they can afford to pay for their medical bills abroad, cannot travel out of our shores because of these extended lockdowns?\n\n\u201cAre we going to allow our hospitals to remain in their current state without equipment and state of the art facilities? For how long shall we continue to rely on the world for anything and everything?\u201d\n\nHe noted that in 2020, following the provision of vaccines, countries began to ease movement restrictions and demand in certain sectors began to recover to pre-COVID levels. Unfortunately, the surge in demand for the vaccines contributed to significant supply chain disruptions, which contributed to elevated inflation in advanced and developing markets, Emefiele added.\n\n\u201cFor example,\u201d he said, \u201cthe Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) food price index, which measures monthly change in international prices of a basket of food commodities, in October 2021, stood at its highest level since July 2011, because of the initially exogenous supply disruption I am about to describe.\n\n\u201cFinally, tragic as these outcomes were, even more alarming was the reaction of many countries at the height of the pandemic. All over the world, countries responded by fighting for themselves and taking measures to protect their own people, regardless of the spill-over effects on the rest of the world. According to the World Customs organisation, a total of 32 countries and territories adopted stringent and immediate export restrictions on critical medical supplies and drugs that were specifically meant to respond to COVID-19.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA) urged the federal and state governments to be vigilant in testing people arriving Nigeria in order to track and contain the spread of Omicron in the country.\n\nDirector General of the NACCIMA, Mr. Ayo Olukanni, told THISDAY yesterday that government should not let their guards down but pay attention to the possibility of the spread of the new variant in the country.\n\nOlukanni advised government at all levels to encourage Nigerians that had not taken the COVID-19 vaccines to do so.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe should not let our guards down on this issue. Implicitly, there will be more testing and, of course, those people who have not taken the COVID-19 vaccine should be encouraged to take it now. In fact, this is the time to make it compulsory for everyone to have the vaccine.\n\n\u201cWe should also be more stringent with people who are coming in from Omicron\u2019s high risk areas.\u201d\n\nHe, however, said government should not contemplate locking down the economy because of the new variant.\n\nOlukanni said, \u201cNo! I do not think that a lockdown will achieve any purpose. Our economy is just coming out of recession and we should not take actions that would push it back to another round of recession.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Chief Executive Officer of the Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise (CPPE), Dr. Muda Yusuf, said the government should be vigilant and proactive in managing the spread of the new variant in the country. Yusuf, the immediate past Director General of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, also told THISDAY that the government should apply a risk-based approach by tracing arrivals into Nigeria from high-risk locations. He also advised against another lockdown of the economy.\n\nYusuf said, \u201cWhat the government should do is to trace the locations that represent high risk of importing the new variant into Nigeria and restrict entries from those locations for now.\n\n\u201cConsidering that Nigerians in those countries will be coming home and no one can say that they will not come home. But government has to isolate people from high-risk areas because I learnt that the new variant spreads very fast. So we need to be proactive.\n\n\u201cWhat I have in mind is that when people come in, they have to quarantine them for some time, especially those coming from high-risk areas. It has to be risk-based approach.\n\n\u201cBut, I do not foresee another lockdown of the economy.\u201d\n\nRamaphosa Urges Countries to Reverse Travel Ban\n\nMeanwhile, Ramaphosa has called on countries to \u201curgently\u201d reverse \u201cscientifically unjustified\u201d travel bans linked to the discovery of the Omicron.\n\nThe South African president was quoted as saying in his first address to the nation following the detection of the new variant, \u201cWe call upon all those countries that have imposed travel bans on our country and our southern African sister countries to immediately and urgently reverse their decisions.\n\n\u201cThe prohibition of travel is not informed by science.\u201d\n\nRamaphosa said his country should expect a fourth wave of coronavirus infections in the wake of the discovery of the omicron variant.\n\nBut he said authorities would not be considering economic lockdown restrictions for the time being.\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) said it was not yet clear if Omicron caused more severe diseases.\n\n\u201cPreliminary data suggests that there are increasing rates of hospitalisation in South Africa, but this may be due to increasing overall numbers of people becoming infected, rather than a result of specific infection with Omicron.\u201d\n\nThe head of WHO in Africa also urged countries to follow the science rather than imposing flight bans in a bid to contain the new Omicron variant.\n\n\u201cWith the Omicron variant now detected in several regions of the world, putting in place travel bans that target Africa attacks global solidarity,\u201d said WHO\u2019s regional director general Matshidiso Moeti.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Says in event of banks\u2019 failure, 97% depositors would be covered\n\nUgo Aliogo\n\nThe Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) said it was reviewing its approach for determining the premium by banks to its Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF), with a view to adopting a risk-based approach.\n\nManaging Director of NDIC, Mr. Bello Hassan, disclosed this in a keynote address he delivered at the 2021 Editors\u2019 Forum, with the theme, \u201cEnduring Extreme Disruptions: Resilience and Reinvention for Banking System Stability and Deposit Insurance,\u201d organised by the corporation in Lagos at the weekend.\n\nThe NDIC, in calculating premiums from deposit money banks, usually chose between adopting a flat-rate premium or a system that sought to differentiate premiums on the basis of individual-bank risk profiles.\n\nA flat-rate premium system has the advantage of being relatively easy to understand and administer. Also, it allows the strong banks to subsidise the weak ones for the stability of the financial system.\n\nHowever, it does not take into account the level of risk that a bank poses to the deposit insurance system, and can, therefore, be perceived as unfair, in that the same premium rate is charged to all banks, regardless of their degrees of risk.\n\nHassan explained NDIC had commenced the review of its approach \u201cto the determination of premium/contribution by banks to our DIF to a more risk-based approach to ensure that, the probability of the risk crystallising becomes a major factor in the pricing methodology of our premium going forward.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cOn timely support to insured institutions, we have identified the need to reconsider our criteria for qualification of financial institutions to provide realistic terms and conditions in order to facilitate prompt access to technical and/or financial support in line with the Sec\n\n(2)(1)(b) of the NDIC Act whilst also protecting the corporation from possible downside risk.\u201d\n\nHe also revealed that the corporation had commenced the process of strengthening its failure resolution and liquidation mandate through the improvement of its internal processes and procedures as well as enhancing effective collaboration with relevant stakeholders to ensure that it discharges its responsibilities more efficiently.\n\nHe said the review became imperative given the need to implement prompt corrective actions on ailing or failed banks, improve processes in addressing challenges in liquidation and, most importantly, provide timely reimbursement of insured sums to depositors of failed banks.\n\nIn the area of deposit insurance as a distinct mandate of the corporation, the NDIC boss pointed out that from statistics, the corporation\u2019s deposit insurance coverage limits were not only adequate but also robust enough to engender confidence in the banking system.\n\nFor instance, in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019, the total number of accounts in the deposit money banks stood at 83 million; 99.1million; 112 million and 128.4 million respectively.\n\nHe added, \u201cOut of these numbers, the N500,000 coverage limit fully covered 99.4 per cent; 97.6 per cent; 97.5 per cent and 97.6 per cent of accounts, respectively. The implication is that in the event of bank failure, above 97 per cent of depositors would be fully covered by the corporation.\u201d\n\nHe also stated that pursuant to the provisions of the NDIC Act, several failure resolution initiatives, such as Open Bank Assistance (OBA), Purchase & Assumption (P&A), and Mergers & Acquisition (M&A) had been adopted in resolving distress in various banks from 1989, culminating in the novel bridge bank option to resolve four problem banks in 2011 and 2018.\n\nThe bridge bank option, according to him, did not only prevent a systemic crisis, it secured N1.021 trillion deposits which ensured that depositors had continued access to their funds and financial services. The implementation of the bridge bank option also saved over 12,667 jobs while over 877 branch network and services of the affected banks were maintained.\n\nHassan said, \u201cThe corporation\u2019s accomplishment in the payment of guaranteed sums and liquidation dividends speaks volumes for its commitment to the discharge of its unique mandate. NDIC had paid a cumulative sum of N8.268 billion to 443,946 insured depositors and N100.080 billion to uninsured depositors of deposit money banks in-liquidation as at September 30th, 2021, while N3.413 billion was paid to 90,945 insured depositors of microfinance banks and N1.218 million to uninsured depositors. In the same vein, cumulative insured amount paid to 1,553 depositors of closed primary mortgage banks as at 30th September, 2021 stood at N110.15 million while N7.965 million was paid as uninsured deposits.\n\n\u201cMost importantly, the payment of N1.274 billion to 991 creditors and N4.886 billion to 965 shareholders of banks in-liquidation as at September 30, 2021 underscored the corporation\u2019s success story in bank liquidation. What this implies is that the corporation had realised enough assets to pay all the insured and uninsured depositors of the banks that present themselves for payment.\n\nCurrently, 19 out of the 49 DMBs in-liquidation fall into this category.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "How Army, Using Informants, Infiltrated, Arrested Fleeing Terrorists in Lagos",
          "text": "*9 Brigade intercepts, arrests another with explosives\n\n*Uncovers more sleeper cells in Lagos, Ogun\n\n*Army establishes new brigade in Adamawa\n\nChiemelie Ezeobi\n\nMore details have emerged on how the Nigerian Army trailed and arrested in Lagos some 13 Boko Haram terrorists, who had coordinated and carried out several deadly attacks on troops in the North-east, including those that killed many security operatives.\n\nThe suspects were arrested during a raid on their hideouts at the Itapeju area of Apapa, in Lagos.\n\nTHISDAY reliably gathered that after carrying out several deadly attacks on civilians and troops, the suspects fled to Lagos and hid in a terrorist sleeper cell at Itapeju.\n\nAccording to findings, the terrorists had fled to Lagos because operatives of Operation Hadin Kai (OPHK), a Joint Task Force in the North-east, launched a massive reprisal onslaught, which dealt decisively with the terrorists, bandits and other criminals in the axis.\n\nHowever, the troops gradually built intelligence, with the help of credible informants, and infiltrated the terrorists, leading to their arrest.\n\nIn a tight need-to-know operation, the army had swooped in on the hideouts and arrested the suspects. At the moment, they have been transferred back to Maiduguri theatre of operation for profiling before hand over to the appropriate authorities for prosecution.\n\nIn a similar development, the 9 Brigade, 81 Division of the Nigerian Army, on Friday in Lagos arrested one Ibrahim Abdullahi with eight 600mm mortar bomb explosives.\n\nThe 24-year-old suspect, alongside his accomplices, were said to have attempted to infiltrate the Ikeja cantonment with the explosives, when they were accosted by operatives, who demanded to know the contents of their bag.\n\nMeanwhile, the Chief of Army Staff, Lt Gen Faruk Yahaya, charged officers and soldiers of the newly formed 6 Brigade of the Nigerian Army to exhibit professionalism and discipline in the conduct of their operations and other engagements in their area of responsibility. Yahaya gave the charge today during a tour of the Headquarters, 6 Brigade, Nigerian Army, Jalingo, as part of his operational and assessment visit to formations and units of the Nigerian Army across the country.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the officers on duty at 9 Brigade, Nigerian Army, Lagos, were alerted by the suspicious movements of the suspect and his collaborators currently at large.\n\nOn sighting the uncharged mortar and the detonators, Abdullahi was swiftly arrested while the others fled. He was immediately profiled and handed over to the State Criminal Intelligence Department (SCID), Panti, Yaba, which had equally commenced investigation.\n\nThat same Friday, the suspect was charged before the Ebute Meta Magistrates\u2019 Court and consequently remanded in custody while moves are in top gear to mop up other fleeing suspects.\n\nThe prosecutor, Inspector Olatunde Kehinde, asked the court to remand the defendant in custody pending the outcome of investigation and the advice of Department of Public Prosecution (DPP).\n\nPresiding Magistrate, Mrs. A.A. Oshoniyi, ordered the remand of Abdullahi pending the outcome of DPP\u2019s advice.\n\nIn another breath, THISDAY has gathered that the recent mop up of suspects in Lagos had spurred the army to intensify moves to uncover all probable sleeper cells in the state and Ogun, both under same jurisdiction.\n\nGiven the continuous onslaught in the North-east, the dislodged terrorists have continued to move down to Lagos and other South-west states to hide as they hatch further plans to carry out their nefarious activities. In the past five years, there have been several attempts by terrorists to wreak havoc on Lagos, especially, volatile areas like Apapa with tank farms, which were foiled by security agencies. There have also been alleged plans to blow up the Third Mainland Bridge.\n\nIntelligence made available to THISDAY indicated that the dislodged terrorists from the North were scattered across Lagos.\n\nLagos State Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, once confirmed intelligence reports about the growing number of sleeper cells across the state. Odumosu had, however, reassured citizens that the police and other security agencies were on top of their game to infiltrate the groups, dislodge and arrest them.\n\nTHISDAY\u2019s independent checks at the Kirikiri Maximum Correctional Centre attested to the large number of Boko Haram suspects, who had been tried and sentenced for their acts against humanity.\n\nSome of the aborted attacks were re-echoed by the Department of State Services (DSS), which in a recent memo to the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS), dated November 25, 2021, raised the alarm over plans by insurgents to attack military bases and border towns.\n\nIn the alert addressed to the Customs Area Controller, Ogun Area Command, Abeokuta, the DSS advised customs and other security agencies in the country to put counter-measures in place.\n\nTitled, \u201cPlans by insurgents to launch attacks on military bases in various border communities,\u201d the letter, signed by the DSS Director, Ogun State Command, M.B. Abdullahi, said, \u201cAvailable intelligence indicates plans by insurgents and criminal elements to carry out simultaneous attacks on military posts and bases in various border communities across the nation anytime from now.\u201d\n\nIt added, \u201cIn view of the foregoing and the likelihood, such attacks not limited to the military personnel only, all law enforcement and security agencies with operational bases at border communities are advised to take note of the above threat and emplace countermeasures with emphasis on personal security of operatives to frustrate the planned attack, please.\u201d\n\nIn Jalingo, Yahaya was given a security brief on the brigade\u2019s area of responsibility by the Commander 6 Brigade, Brig Gen Hillary Mabeokwu.\n\nThe army chief pledged to provide requisite logistics for the full take-off of the new brigade. He later commissioned the newly constructed 6 Brigade Garrison office and Quarter Guard, before proceeding to inspect the proposed permanent site of the brigade.\n\nAn army statement said the Chief of Army Staff expressed appreciation to the government and people of Taraba State for providing the Nigerian Army land to build the brigade.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Are Ugandan telcos equipped to protect user data?",
          "text": "\n\nA recent report from Unwanted Witness, a Uganda-based civil society organisation, reveals that two years on from the implementation of Uganda\u2019s Data Protection and Privacy Act, the nation\u2019s tech companies are still struggling with compliance.\n\nTelecommunication operators are at the core of Uganda\u2019s digital development, and yet are among the worst offenders on privacy violations, raising questions about their ability to protect sensitive user data.\n\nLaw in action\n\nUganda implemented its first codified legislation on data protection, the Data Protection, and Privacy Act, in 2019. The act, which establishes principles surrounding the protection, collection, and storage of customers\u2019 personal data, designates the National Information Technology Authority \u2013 Uganda (NITA-U) as the official regulator for data protection in the country and lays out penalties for violators.\n\nSince its implementation, Uganda\u2019s core data privacy act has proven to be an effective regulator, to some extent.\n\nIn 2020, Unwanted Witness investigated motorcycle ride-hailing startup Safeboda\u2019s compliance with data privacy regulations in the country. Their findings revealed that the company was not only guilty of using a privacy policy that did not comply with Uganda\u2019s data protection standards but also using a third-party tracker called CleverTap. When asked about its use of CleverTap, Safeboda\u2019s Chief Financial Officer claimed it was for \u201ctracking marketing communication and identifying product issues\u201d.\n\nThough no punitive measures were taken against Safeboda, the NITA-U did publish a report on its own investigation into the company\u2019s practices in early 2021. The regulator concluded that Safeboda was, in fact, in violation of the Data Protection and Privacy Act and ordered the company to address \u201call areas of non-compliance\u201d over a four-month period.\n\nTelecom offenders\n\nWhile the work of Unwanted Witness and Uganda\u2019s Data Privacy Act helped stop some of Safeboda\u2019s practices, Uganda\u2019s telecommunication operators are still among the worst offenders.\n\nThe Privacy Scorecard Report 2021 revealed that telecom operators in Uganda failed to give adequate information to data subjects, mention third-party sharing of personal data, and give information on the quantity of information shared.\n\nThis resulted in a low overall score of 35% for the industry when it came to data compliance.\n\nThese digital failures have real-life consequences.\n\nAccording to Dorothy Mukasa, CEO at Unwanted Witness, \u201cTelecom companies are the highest data collectors [in Uganda]\u201d, and they are still struggling to ensure that they protect individuals.\u201d\n\nThis is particularly dangerous in an environment where telecom companies occupy a fundamental position in a nation\u2019s economy and tech industry.\n\nThe number of mobile subscribers in Uganda is rapidly on the rise, increasing by 21,200% from 2000\u20132020. As mobile subscriptions have grown, telcos in Uganda have also received new access to personal information from Ugandan citizens.\n\nIn 2018, the Uganda Communications Commission (UCC) issued new SIM card validation guidelines that required telcos to verify a registered mobile number against a citizen\u2019s National Identification Number (NIN). The regulation was meant to tackle fraud and crime, but, in the hands of telcos with suboptimal data privacy frameworks, it offered new capabilities for exploitation.\n\nHacking\n\nSince the onset of COVID-19, the use of mobile money\u2014of which MTN and Airtel Uganda maintain a 90% share of the market\u2014has increased by around 12.7%.\n\nAlongside this jump in users has also been more frequent instances of cyber fraud aimed at telecom companies, revealing just how essential proper data management and protection is.\n\nA 2019 Uganda Police Annual Crime Report revealed a 25% increase in cybercrime over a one-year period, leading to a loss of around $11 million from SIM card swapping and hacking digital financial accounts.\n\nIn 2020, MTN and Airtel Uganda were forced to temporarily suspend mobile money operations after their systems were compromised by hackers. Unconfirmed reports estimate that billions of Ugandan shillings were lost in the breach.\n\nWhy tech offends\n\nBeyond the value that an application garners from its products and services is the data it collects. Generally, a tech company, in its early stages, is not profitable in the traditional sense. At this point, its value is, in part, based on the data the company has access to through its user base.\n\nOften, as in the case of Safeboda, tech companies add trackers and third-party software on top of their applications to process the data they collect. Updating users each and every time a company adds a new tracker and explaining exactly what that tracker does can be bad for business.\n\nWhen Apple rolled out a new update allowing customers to opt-out of data trackers used by social media platforms earlier this year, digital citizens leaped at the opportunity, resulting in an estimated loss of $9.85 billion in revenue by Snap, Meta (formerly Facebook), Twitter, and YouTube.\n\nIn Uganda\u2019s case, the tech companies that operate there gather data on a traditionally underserved tech market where there is \u201clow awareness of the power that they have to change and control their personal data,\u201d according to Mukasa.\n\nThis leaves Uganda\u2019s digital citizens vulnerable to unscrupulous tech companies who \u201care exploiting the low levels of awareness among the population to be able to collect as much as they can,\u201d said Mukasa.\n\nCountries around the world whose tech industries developed faster than regulation could keep up with had to learn hard lessons about digital privacy.\n\nThe Cybersecurity Administration of China (CAC) has embarked on a year-long campaign to rein in powerful tech companies the government feels have had unchecked access to user data for far too long.\n\nFacebook has also been in and out of courts in the US and UK over data privacy issues, since 2018.\n\nAs Uganda\u2019s tech industry continues to develop, it too will have to contend with the benefits and costs of tech development.\n\nWhile this is going on, monitoring and evaluation by independent, civil society organisations like Unwanted Witness will become more important than ever.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "African female founders need access to high-impact mentors",
          "text": "Beyond funding, African female entrepreneurs need access to high-impact mentors and who are willing to open up their network and teach what they know.\n\nA few weeks into January this year, Eloho Omame and Odunayo Eweniyi announced their female-focused angel investment fund. Aptly named FirstCheck Africa, the angel fund is on a mission to \u201cadvance equity, capital and leadership for a generation of women in Africa through technology & entrepreneurship\u201d. While FirstCheck argues that African women in tech are \u201cover-mentored\u201d and \u201cunder-funded\u201d, early-stage female founders need some handholding. Our ecosystem is still male-dominated, and female entrepreneurs need experienced mentors to guide them on their journey to success.\n\nIt\u2019s essential to not have a cart-before-the-horse mentality when it comes to helping African female entrepreneurs succeed. Of course, funding women-led businesses is important because entrepreneurs need capital to scale. But it\u2019s also important to level the playing field, invite female founders to join active networks, and connect them to successful high-impact mentors.\n\nFor Africa to build a more equitable tech ecosystem, mentoring and funding African women in tech must work hand-in-hand, not one after the other. Local and global investors must do the work of creating short-term or long-term mentorship programs that cater to underrepresented female founders. These mentorship programs should teach African women in tech how to network, grow their social equity, pitch to accelerators or funds with larger check sizes, and much more.\n\nThe conversation about mentorship is tricky because most female entrepreneurs are interested in getting the capital they need to run their businesses. But venture capitalists like Sohaila Ouffata believe that working with highly trained and experienced mentors is just as important as applying to receive funding from accelerators and venture funds. So Ouffata founded The African Tech Vision (ATV) to create and open up entrepreneurial pathways for ambitious African female founders and executive leaders.\n\nEmpowering African female entrepreneurs at scale\n\nThe African Tech Vision is a free entrepreneurial programme designed to support early-stage African female founders and help them achieve their goals. Over six weeks, selected female founders are paired with mentors and industry experts from local and international startup scenes and technology hubs. During the programme, participants gain access to hands-on mentoring and coaching sessions provided by vetted ATV mentors. While most accelerator and mentorship programs are held in-person at specific locations, ATV kicked off its inaugural program online in April of this year. Hosting virtual mentoring sessions means more African female founders can apply to the programme without worrying about visa applications, travel fees, and sourcing for accommodation.\n\n\u201cThe style of the hands-on mentoring session is based on virtual interactions. Most mentors prefer video calls and structure the session based on the needs of the entrepreneur,\u201d said Ouffata in an emailed response to TechCabal.\n\n\u201cWe spent time with each entrepreneur at the beginning of the programme to define areas in which they are looking for mentorship. This is also the basis for matchmaking with selected mentors. For example, some founders prefer to speak multiple times a week with some of their mentors. Others prefer to ping their mentors with questions over WhatsApp. As we are a founder-friendly programme, we leave the decision to the founders and their mentors.\u201d\n\nATV offered its inaugural cohort a mix of recorded and live workshops, founder stories (events where experienced founders shared stories of success, challenges, and failures in their fields), and social activities every week. In the last programme, some of the content models made available to the cohort of African female founders include \u2018Engaging with Mentors\u2019, \u2018Elevator Pitch\u2018, \u2018Investors 101\u2018, \u2018Product Market Fit\u2019, and \u2018Sales Fundamentals\u2018.\n\nSome of the previous cohort\u2019s early-stage female founders were from Ghana, Rwanda, Morocco, Tunisia, Ethiopia, and Nigeria. Therefore, Ouffata and her team need to pull as many female founders from different African countries as possible before their next program kicks off in 2022.\n\nSource: TechCabal Insights\n\nWhy is The African Tech Vision betting on African women?\n\nFor Ouffata, betting on African female founders is a personal decision that fits into the larger vision of The African Tech Vision program.\n\n\u201cThe African Tech Vision was born out of a desire to honour my African heritage and to create and open up entrepreneurial pathways for other African women,\u201d said Ouffata. \u201cOur vision is to connect female entrepreneurs with experienced international role models and aim to inspire and nurture the next generation of purpose-driven African female entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nNo doubt ATV\u2019s vision is audacious, but Africa\u2019s male-dominated technology and business ecosystem is a reality that can longer be ignored or explained away. ATV\u2019s model is designed to spotlight, empower, and back high-impact female founders in Africa.\n\nBeyond sentiments and national pride, ATV\u2019s reasons for backing female entrepreneurs are also rooted in profitability and nation-building. Businesses owned or founded by women are said to deliver higher revenue and better bet to a group of niche investors. Additionally, women typically reinvest up to 90% of their income back into their families and extended communities. This means that more girls and women need to be included in the global economy through education, employment, and mentorship.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Bolt partners with MAX to expand its vehicle finance scheme in Nigeria",
          "text": "In Nigeria, insufficient purchasing power among middle-class citizens, coupled with limited or no access to vehicle financing, puts car purchases out of reach for over 90% of the population. Also, most taxis and public transport buses in Nigerian cities are leased by drivers, who have to deliver rental fees to the owners periodically.\n\nThat means ride-hailing companies such as Uber and Bolt that launch in Nigeria are likely to face a shortage of driver-partners, especially if they\u2019re looking to cover all of the country\u2019s major cities.\n\nEarlier this year, Bolt launched a vehicle financing programme that offered drivers a flexible plan through which they could purchase their own vehicles. The scheme allows drivers to own a car or motorbike with low equity repayment for about four years and no interest.\n\n\u201cAs we expand our presence into more cities across the country, it is important to provide solutions that ensure working with Bolt is more flexible and profitable for drivers,\u201d Bolt\u2019s Country Manager, Femi Akin-Laguda, said at the time.\n\nAfter a pilot phase, which Akin-Laguda tells TechCabal \u201cenjoyed great success\u201d, the company has now partnered with Metro Africa Xpress (MAX), a Nigerian mobility company with a fintech play, to expand the program in the country.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nMAX originally started out as a motorcycle-based operator for delivery services. With its mobile app, users could order pickup riders who could fulfil deliveries quickly in the congested city of Lagos. By 2017, MAX had expanded into bike hailing, becoming the first company to pioneer the innovation in Nigeria. But in February 2020, the Lagos government\u2019s restrictions on passenger motorcycles threatened the company\u2019s growth in Nigeria\u2019s largest city.\n\nIn an interview with TechCabal, MAX\u2019s CFO, Guy-Bertrand Njoya, explains that the company has had to double down on its other mobility solutions since the ban. One of these is a subscription platform for low-to-zero emission vehicles in five cities across Nigeria, and Ghana. The subscription product includes credit and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) services, which the more than 13,000 drivers on its platform opt into.\n\nFor the partnership with Bolt, the company\u2019s alternative credit-scoring technology will allow access to proprietary performance and revenue analytics to underwrite the Bolt car loans for drivers.\n\n\u201cMAX is a renowned vehicle subscription platform with the capacity to support a truly wide placement of this type of partnership,\u201d Akin-Laguda said on Bolt\u2019s preferred car financing partner in Nigeria. \u201cTheir approach and insight to meet our goal of empowering drivers suited our desired proposition.\u201d\n\nMAX motorcycle riders.\n\nThe car financing programme is currently open only to drivers in Lagos and Abuja, with Bolt planning to expand the offer to all active drivers across Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Bolt, an agreement can be reached for up to 100% of the purchase, both for new and used cars, within 24 hours of signing up. This is given that drivers have provided all the information required. They can choose to pay back their loans using a percentage of the weekly revenue generated while driving on Bolt for up to five years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking to expand our commitment to helping those on the Bolt platform to earn more and at their own pace, either driving full-time or part-time,\u201d Akin-Laguda said. \u201cImproving the earnings of drivers is fundamental to our business operations.\u201d\n\nFor drivers, Bolt\u2019s loan repayment process is more flexible than what traditionally exists in the market. Loan tenors from Nigerian banks often don\u2019t exceed two years whereas Bolt\u2019s repayment duration ranges from two to five. In the long run, Yamaha-backed MAX plans to add electric vehicles to the financing mix.\n\nIn addition to extending the lease-to-own framework to more e-hailing drivers, the partnership is expected to enable drivers access value-add services provided by MAX. These include licenses and permits, insurance, health coverage, and other financial products.\n\nThe low rate of vehicle ownership in Nigeria is similar across Africa, a continent with the lowest per capita vehicle ownership in the world.\n\nWith the majority of Africa\u2019s more than one billion population having limited or no access to vehicle financing, the continent recorded fewer than 900,000 new vehicle sales in 2019, compared to more than 17 million in the United States alone.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Warning, there might be a little Wild West reference; I couldn\u2019t resist.\n\nLast week, we decided to talk with Adedeji Olowe (Trustee, Open Banking Nigeria) and Abdul Hassan, Mono Founder and CEO, to get their opinions on what the next frontier for the fintech industry would look like.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst prediction: more regulations.\n\nSecond prediction: disruptive business models.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t want to let the cat out of the bag too soon, so if you want to know more, you can find other predictions here: The next frontier for fintech: Disruptive business models.\n\nSabi raises $6 million bridge round\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: TechCrunch\n\nSector-agnostic B2B platform, Sabi has announced the raise of a $6 million bridge round led by pan-African VC firm, CRE Venture Capital, with participation from others, including Janngo Capital, Atlantica Ventures, and Waarde Capital\n\nThe company, a spin-off from power-as-a-service startup, Rensource, came out of stealth in March 2021, after several months of building beginning in October 2020.\n\nThis is Sabi\u2019s second raise, after a seed round secured in August 2021, which saw participation from the same crop of investors in the current round.\n\nFounded by Anu Adasolum and Ademola Adesina, Sabi helps connect merchants \u2014 read manufacturers, distributors, wholesalers, and retailers \u2014 bringing them access to a larger marketplace and enabling them with other helpful products like loans and inventory management.\n\nAccording to TechCrunch, the company has set up shop in Kenya and made a few hires in South Africa and hopes to conclude a Series A raise in time to fund these expansions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis bridge round is to be used to support its growth in Nigeria and beyond, a trend that has seen Sabi onboard more than 150,000 merchants and claim an almost $12 million GMV.\n\nAfrica\u2019s informal trade sector contributes around 50% of economic output and 85% of employment. And with companies like MaxAB, Sokowatch, and Sabi playing in the space, it does look like one to watch.\n\nNigeria\u2019s cooking gas woes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are like me and have contemplated using firewood as an alternative to cooking gas in the last few weeks, then some of these statistics might not surprise you.\n\nIn October 2021, the average price of 12.5kg cooking gas in Nigeria increased by 62.76% compared to October 2020. Between August 2021 and October 2021, the price increased by 47%.\n\nAccording to data from the National Bureau of Statistics, Oyo State has the highest average cost of cooking gas as of October 2021.\n\nThe graph above shows the increase in the price of cooking gas since November 2019.\n\nTo see the top ten states by average cost of cooking gas as of October 2021, kindly follow this link.\n\nThis is brought to you courtesy of our Intelligence by Techpoint team; for more insights like this, you can follow them here and here\n\nAfrica-focused Sanicle raises $160k\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSanicle\u2019s website\n\nLast week, women-focused startup, Sanicle (Padbanque) received an impact investment of $160,000 from Platform Capital,\n\nCo-founded by Chaste Inegbedion (Chief Period Officer), Roxanne Stewart (CEO), and Sage Oni (CTO), Sanicle officially launched in January 2021 with a plan to demystify periods by promoting period literacy while destigmatising women in menstruation.\n\nIts primary offerings, however, include a period box, a book, and a board game called Period Genie. The Period Box, which contains period essentials, and the book (Period Passport) authored by one of the co-founders are available on the business\u2019 eCommerce platform, sanicle.shop.\n\nThe impact fund, as the CPO revealed, would be deployed to make the eCommerce platform more robust and evolve the game to become a community to period management.\n\nWith more technology positioned towards period tracking, Sanicle\u2019s end game is to make period literacy mainstream to all genders, and not only women.\n\nYou probably didn\u2019t see this\n\nWhat I\u2019m listening to/reading/watching\n\nFound this gem of an artiste, thanks to a friend this weekend.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week, we introduced our latest series, The Next Frontier, and talked about the shape of the edtech industry in the future. This week, as you\u2019ve probably guessed, we\u2019ll be talking about fintechs.\n\nAfrica\u2019s fintech industry is one of the largest and probably the most advanced. Having produced five of Africa\u2019s seven unicorns and some of the largest funding rounds we\u2019ve seen, that\u2019s probably a safe assumption.\n\nBut what\u2019s the next big thing? What kind of models can we expect to see? This week, we talked with Adedeji Olowe (Trustee, Open Banking Nigeria) and Abdul Hassan, Mono Founder and CEO.\n\nDisclaimer: We can\u2019t necessarily tell the future. All opinions in this article are educated guesses and might not happen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe next big thing\n\nThe very first question we asked Olowe was the level of growth the industry has achieved so far.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had significant growth so far. But the interesting bit to me is not where we are coming from, it\u2019s how far we still have to grow. So whatever is exciting you about fintech right now, you haven\u2019t seen anything. I don\u2019t think the space has grown up to 2-3% of its capacity.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, using the example of Nigeria\u2019s average transaction size for transfer, he believes transfers would be free.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get to a level where transfers of a certain amount would be free, and after that, we can actually bring in financial inclusion for everybody. So you will now see transactions like, \u2018Oh, I want to send \u20a650 to Ogheneruemu,\u2019 \u2018 I want to spend \u20a6100 to buy bole,\u2018 and then it would be free.\u201d\n\nOf course, he agreed that there would be a limit to transferable amounts, putting the benchmark at \u20a610,000 weekly. But in his words, \u201cat that level, it would just become explosive.\u201d\n\nHow soon will this happen? Well, he believes this could happen as soon as next year, helping to drive Nigeria\u2019s sluggish cashless policy.\n\nOn the other hand, the first question Techpoint asked Hassan centred around the direction the industry would be going in. His answer, three phases of growth.\n\n\u201cI believe that there will be a lot of regulatory involvement in the next two to three years. And what this means is that we would see the regulators actually actively helping the ecosystem. I\u2019m someone that supports regulation because where there\u2019s regulation, I feel like there would be a lot of innovation as well.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOlowe had a similar opinion, albeit somewhat different. \u201cI know that people don\u2019t like CBN (Central Bank of Nigeria) regulating prices. But the funny thing is that CBN\u2019s pricing has done more to expand the market than anything else.\u201d\n\nFor some context, at some point, transfers in Nigeria cost \u20a6100; now, they cost between \u20a610 and \u20a650.\n\nThe second phase, according to Hassan, however, would be a hotbed of mergers and acquisitions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by Nattanan Kanchanaprat from Pixabay\n\n\u201cI think there will be a lot of mergers and acquisitions coming up next year because I feel like there are a lot of companies doing similar things. And it doesn\u2019t really make sense to have about 20 companies doing the same thing when they can all put together the demand power, the resources, and the talent to build something that is really massive out of Africa.\u201d\n\nThe third phase is a companies-funding-companies stage.\n\n\u201cWe would see more fintech companies, funding more fintech companies. And what this means is that you could see a company like Mono investing in other interesting companies that are, for example, using our infrastructure. We\u2019ve seen this happen with Visa and Mastercard.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s already happening, but people are not talking about it. But I think it will be more public next year, and this is mostly because of the traction we\u2019ve seen in the fintech industry.\u201d\n\nFor him, all of the attention the fintech industry is and would be getting would be very helpful to aid other industries in getting more funding. Olowe agrees.\n\nNew technology or new business models?\n\nCurrently, the fintech industry is very API and cloud computing driven. However, Olowe and Hassan believe that rather than disruptive technologies, it would be a more disruptive business model.\n\nCiting companies like Inflow Finance and Sproutly Nigeria, Hassan says infrastructure like Mono\u2019s would be the base of novel business models.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy sense is that we would see more business models, more developers, and more interesting companies coming up because of infrastructure like us. I mean, if you look at it, in 2016 and 2017, Paystack made PiggyVest possible. Without Paystack, PiggyVest wouldn\u2019t be a company.\n\n\u201cThat was a new business model that wasn\u2019t available in Nigeria before Paystack. So I think that kind of emergence of new business models and successful companies is what we will see in the next couple of years. And that\u2019s what excites me most.\u201d\n\nFor example, a business model that enables seamless confirmation of transactions or rounds up the remainder of every transaction made into money that can be put into savings.\n\nBut maybe some technology\n\nFor Olowe, apart from free transfers, one aspect he believes has been severely overlooked is contactless cards. Interestingly, according to him, banks have been given out contactless cards in the past year.\n\nA quick Google search reveals that a contactless card would look something like this with a sideways WiFi signal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by kreatikar on Pixabay\n\nTo confirm this, we did a quick experiment using both old and new debit cards. We found that the new cards had sideways WiFi signals while the old cards didn\u2019t.\n\nEssentially, a contactless card can be used without being handed to PoS merchants or shop attendants. You can place it directly on the machine, and your transaction is immediately approved.\n\nSo, why are they not being used? Olowe gives two reasons: acceptance and payments.\n\n\u201cThe only challenge is that the amount to spend is not on those cards. Number two, the PoS needs to accept contactless cards, and those two things need to meet each other.\u201d\n\nAccording to Olowe, these contactless cards are supposed to act as a limited store of value. For example, the Cowry cards used for payment in the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system in Lagos State. You have to put some money in the card to use it, essentially transferring a specific amount to be used for payment.\n\nSo, for this to work, you need to transfer money for use into the card itself and not your bank account, and then readers for these cards must be available.\n\nMerging the old with the new\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn July 2021, Guaranty Trust Bank (GTB) changed its name to Guaranty Trust Holding Company (GTCO). According to Group CEO Segun Agbaje, \u201cWe believe that a holding company structure will allow us to take advantage of new business opportunities in the emerging competitive landscape and strengthen our earnings base.\u201d\n\nWhile there have been no outright moves, there have been speculations that this signals the company\u2019s shift into a more technological arena.\n\nWe asked Olowe what he thought of banks playing in the fintech space in the future, and he believes it would be pretty impossible.\n\n\u201cTraditional banks would go into fintechs, and they would fail miserably, and that is not a guess. Why? Because they don\u2019t have the DNA to run a fintech. Banks can\u2019t be agile. Banks don\u2019t place customer service, user experience as paramount. Forget about them talking about it. It\u2019s not just part of them.\u201d\n\nHe says it is doubly worse for traditional institutions in the insurance space.\n\nInterestingly, Hassan disagrees, and he believes this could mean better and stiffer competition and even more acquisitions.\n\nOther predictions\n\nEvery week, I receive a newsletter from Samora Kariuki called Frontier Fintech. I first subscribed in August 2021. Since then, he has talked about several things like the modernisation of banks, the possibility of an African super app \u2014 one of my favourites \u2014 and digital bank valuations.\n\nIn last week\u2019s newsletter, Kariuki made some interesting predictions, which you can find here.\n\nIntrigued? Then you\u2019d love to be at Techpoint Build 2021, where discussions like this and concerning other industries would be held.

After the lull in investment activities in 2020, investments in African startups are on track to exceed the $2 billion record set in 2019.\n\nAs has been the case in previous years, the bulk of the funding has gone to fintech startups with the fragmented nature of the continent\u2019s financial system providing an opportunity for innovative founders and investors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaurin Hainy, CEO and Co-Founder of FairMoney\n\nAs of October 2021, Africa: The Big Deal reported that 57% of the amounts raised which was slightly above $1.6 billion has gone to fintech startups. One such fintech is FairMoney, a digital bank that currently offers lending services in Nigeria, India, and France.\n\nIn July, the startup raised a $42 million Series B led by Tiger Global to consolidate its position in India and Nigeria. This follows its $10 million Series A round raised in 2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Thursday, November 18, 2021, the company hosted investors, the media, and industry leaders at its first investor conference. Following a brief introduction, the CEO and co-founder, Laurin Hainy took to the stage to share the startup\u2019s journey since inception.\n\nIn his welcome address, Hainy revealed that the conference was \u201cconceived to provide an avenue for capital market operators, investors, fintech players, regulators, industry associations, and other financial industry participants to discuss the role of digital financial models in providing meaningful financial inclusion for Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL \u2013 R: Patryk Kalisz, Head of Controlling and Reporting, FairMoney; Siddharth Kulkarni,\n\nExecutive Sponsor, Lending, Nigeria at FairMoney; Nicolas Berthozat, Co-Founder\n\nFairMoney and Juris Rieksts-Riekstin\u0161, Head of Risk, Nigeria, at the FairMoney investor\u2019s\n\nconference.\n\nIn Nigeria, traditional banks have typically shied away from offering loans to individuals and small businesses without collateral. This is the segment FairMoney serves and Yaw Mante, the startup\u2019s Head of Finance revealed that not only have they been able to offer loans to these people, but they have also had a very low default rate.\n\nHe disclosed that in order to do this, the startup makes use of data science and underwriting algorithms to predict how likely an individual is to default on their loan before deciding how much risk they are able to take.\n\nIn the absence of data on users, the startup may initially give such customers smaller amounts to gauge their ability to repay the loans. Depending on how the borrower performs, they are then able to offer higher amounts to them. So far, in 2021, the startup has given out loans worth more than \u20a670 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL \u2013 R: Oluwatomide Oluwole, Finance Manager, FairMoney; Henry Obiekea, VP Capital\n\nMarkets, FairMoney; Yaw Mante, Head, Finance \u2013 FairMoney and James Edeh, Head,\n\nCompliance, FairMoney, at the FairMoney investor\u2019s conference.\n\nHaving recently acquired a microfinance license, Mante explained the reason for that, \u201cLoans are not the only products that our customers need. They need to be able to pay, they need to be able to save, they need to be able to invest. The way that we think about our business is that we look at our customers, we look at what they need and we try to work with them to provide that.\n\nIn order to do all of these things, we need to upscale our license and hence why we acquired the microfinance license. Over time, we\u2019ll look at our options to continue to provide more complex products and services to our customers.\u201d\n\nWith several players in the fintech industry, Mante discussed the startup\u2019s evolution towards a multi-product full-fledged digital bank. \u201cOur unique selling point is we want to be able to provide all of the banking needs of our customers but we start with the product we think is the most pressing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor a lot of startups, a Series B is often followed by expansion. However, Hainy says FairMoney would consolidate its position in its current markets. \u201cI think we\u2019re very excited about the opportunities in Nigeria and India. They are two out of the four biggest countries in the world and they\u2019re very underserved.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHenry Obiekea, VP Capital Markets, FairMoney\n\nHe also pointed out that while the fintech space in India and Nigeria possess some similarities, there are more people in India who possess some level of digital identification compared to Nigeria.\n\nThere was also a panel session on the role of fintech startups in financial inclusion in Nigeria. It featured Nicole Yembra, Founder and Managing Partner of Chrysalis Capital, Sonnie Ayere, GMD/CEO, DLM Capital Group, Yaw Mante, Head of Finance, FairMoney, and Bayo Rotimi, Managing Director of Greenwich Merchant Bank.\n\nDespite the progress recorded by fintech startups in the country, the jury is still out on how much impact they really have with the vast majority of the country still lacking access to the financial system. Hainy sees this as a challenge and believes that FairMoney is perfectly positioned to solve this challenge.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Msughve Tsavsaa, a 35-year-old father of six, lost his home, his farmland and his leg after his community was attacked during the farmer/herder clash in 2018 in Benue state.\n\nSince then, living has been traumatic and difficult for him.\n\nTsavsaa who was a successful rice, maize and yam farmer before the conflict can no longer cater for himself or his family and is now relying on support by humanitarian agencies at the Gbajimba Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camp.\n\nHe had just returned from the farm when his community was attacked, two people were instantly killed. Tsavsaa, while trying to save his family, got shot in the leg.\n\nStill desperate to live, he crawled into the bush and I stayed there till the next day with a bullet buried deep in his leg.\n\n\u201cLuckily,\u201d he said, \u201cI was rescued by security agents who took me to the Benue State Teaching Hospital, where my leg was amputated.\n\n\u201cLiving has been painful; I can no longer cater for my family. My wife goes out for menial jobs, but the pay is poor and never enough.\u201d\n\nLike Tsavsaa, Mdodo Nyitor fled her home in Taraba state to take shelter in the camp. The mother of four and farmer said she was attacked during the violent clash and her attackers killed her husband and one of her children on the spot.\n\nShe said the persisting conflict between farmers and herders remains the biggest reason they are still displaced. At the camp, she lives with 38 others in a room. With insufficient rooms, some use the toilet areas as shelter, BusinessDay observed.\n\nWith abject socio-economic degradation at the camp, Nyitor survives by taking up menial jobs for people who sometimes cannot afford to pay for her labour.\n\nShe desperately wants to return home but said the government is not doing much to tackle the conflict.\n\n\u201cI want to go home. Life is difficult for me,\u201d she said. \u201cToday I did a farm job but I was paid with a measure of melon seed. I will have to remove the shell and sell it to see if I can make up to N1,000 to feed my children.\u201d\n\nRead Also: Solution underway for farmers-herders clashes as Northern Governors move to end nomadic grazing\n\nTsavsaa and Nyitor are two of the cases of millions of people whose lives have been plunged into untold hardship due to the conflict. Available data shows that at least 1.5 million displaced persons are taking shelter in various camps.\n\nIt was learnt that the number of displaced persons is increasing on a daily basis, resulting in serious humanitarian crises in the state.\n\nThe devastation brought by these deadly clashes are \u2018immeasurable\u2019 farmers and herders in the state lamented. For more than five years, thousands of people have been killed; millions displaced and lost their means of livelihoods.\n\nAgro-economic activities have been crippled as farmlands have been deserted. At the border area alone, BusinessDay learnt that about 120, 000 hectares of land used for cultivation every year has been completely deserted. This situation has pushed many into hunger and extreme poverty.\n\nAs a result, families are taking inhumane and irrational steps to survive. For instance, there was a peculiar case of a father in one of the camps who gave out his 14-year-old daughter in exchange for a basin of corn.\n\nIt was also gathered that families who are displaced often give out their children because they do not have the means to cater for them\u2014a situation that has fuelled child marriage in most northern states.\n\nIn addition to poverty, Benue state risks a generation of illiterates as more children are falling out-of-school.\n\nOver 1.5 million people in host communities and IDP camps are not going to school, according to Magdalyne Dura, special adviser on Development Cooperation, SDGs and NEPAD. Even though some form of emergency education is ongoing in these IDP camps, Dura said the standard of learning is too poor.\n\nUNDP\u2019s intervention projects\n\nWith limited government provision, displaced persons are surviving intervention initiatives by humanitarian agencies such as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).\n\nThe UNDP in partnership with UNHCR, and FAO is building standard shelters for these displaced persons and is providing Critical Rescue Items (CRIs) and Non-Food Items (NFIs) such as mattresses, buckets, mosquito nets.\n\nFocusing on long term development goals, is improving infrastructure and irrigation facilities to support livelihood and farming. Four boreholes\u2019 installations are 90 completed in three local government areas.\n\nThe additional water sources aim to directly support displaced farmers in crop and pasture production, and by extension, mitigate the water needs of the various communities\u2019 members totalling 826,600 and broken down as follows\u2014Guma262,100, Kwande 335,600, and Logo 228,900.\n\nAt least 400 persons across five local government areas have been empowered with sustainable vocational skills and all beneficiaries received start-up kits to enable them to meet their family needs. This is in a bid to restore hope and dignity to displaced people.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t let them lose hope, we have built houses close to the IDP camps so that they can start having hope of settling a new life,\u201d Ashraf Usman, conflict and political economy specialist, UNDP said.\n\nIn order to end clashes between farmers and herders, a cause of their displacement, UNDP established a peace forum made up of farmers, herders, CSOs, religious & traditional leaders, and government officials.\n\nThe Forum meets monthly and succeeded in the advocacy for the passage of the Peacebuilding Agency Bill which is currently at the Benue State House of Assembly, with prospects for speedy passage.\n\nDespite these interventions, many IDPs said their greatest desire is to return home, but they are disappointed with the government\u2019s effort in resolving the conflict. This view is also held by both farmers and herders who are working towards peace but need the federal government\u2019s intervention.\n\nThe conflict between farmers and herders has lasted for more than five years, but has not improved and is still at a worrying level, according to Usman.\n\nThe drivers of this conflict persist in the state. Usman noted that the farmer/herder crisis is a complex issue with multiple drivers, but the leading causes according to him, are socio-economic factors evidenced in the lack of jobs, rising population which puts pressure on basic services.\n\nHe added that the presence of the government is not being felt by the people, while ethnicity and poor education is escalating the conflict.\n\nIn addition, the All-Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN), and Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) Benue State Chapter told BusinessDay that the conflict is largely being fuelled by cross border herders, most of whom are criminals.\n\nIbrahim Galma, state secretary of MACBAN Benue State chapter noted that Benue state is an important grazing area to herders, so they move freely from neighbouring states and even from the far north especially during dry season.\n\nDuring this period, he explains, the state witnesses an influx of herders into the state, including those who are not \u201cgenuine herders.\u201d\n\nBusinessDay gathered that before the conflict began, it was tradition for herders to come into the state during the dry season and leave during the rainy season, but now, herders who come in decide to stay back and resort to violence.\n\nGalma said the association is however now seeking partnership with government and security agencies to identify the genuine herders at the borders and stop the free movement of cattle herders into the state.\n\nIt is also trying to register all \u201cgenuine herders\u201d in the state for easy identification of aliens in the state.\n\nFarmers, herders embrace ranching, but policy implementation crawls\n\nWhile many policies have been proposed by the state and federal governments to quell the deadly clashes, the most accepted solution by both farmers and herders in the state is ranching as contained in the National Livestock Transformation Plan (NLTP) initiated in 2019.\n\nBut the implementation of this policy by the federal government has been slow due to the lack of political will and inconsistencies in policy implementation, stakeholders on the matter said.\n\nIf implemented, the policy could address the grievances of both parties and restore peace in a sustainable manner. This will enable the displaced persons to return home and get their lives back.\n\n\u201cThis livestock plan is our greatest desire\u201d, the state chairman AFAN said.\n\nThe plan was adopted as an alternative to the open grazing of cattle. It identifies five main pillars as priority areas, including conflict resolution; justice and peace; humanitarian relief; human capital development and cross-cutting issues.\n\nSo far, 22 states including Benue state have indicated readiness to domesticate this law. In phase one, the NLTP would initially support the development of pilot ranches in each of seven pilot states of Benue, Kaduna, Nasarawa, Plateau, Taraba, Adamawa and Zamfara.\n\nDura (mentioned earlier) the special adviser on Development Cooperation, SDGs and NEPAD explained that the implementation of the policy is based on cost-sharing\u2014the federal government will bring a percentage of funding and the state government will counter the fund, which was accepted by interested states.\n\nDura said Benue state has met all the requirements, including setting up an office, providing land for pilot ranches, done all training since 2019, and set up a committee that has domesticated the plan.\n\n\u201cBut, we are waiting on the federal government to flag-off the programme, instead of doing that, we are back to cattle routes, that\u2019s just the problem,\u201d she said.\n\nIf the federal government had shown commitment and sincerity in implementing the plan, according to her, Benue state would have made significant progress.\n\nThe state would have its model ranches, \u201cbut we really don\u2019t understand why there is inconsistency in policy implementation,\u201d Dura adds.\n\nMeanwhile, Benue state has the anti-grazing law already in place, which stipulates that all dwellers including indigenes and herders must keep their animals in enclosed spaces, but farmers in the state said the law is being violated especially by herders who invade communities.\n\nBut some stakeholders argue that the law has doused tension and put some level of stability in the state.\n\nThey, however, want advocate and sensitization towards the benefits of ranches to continue. Herders need to be educated in what ranches are, as \u201cthey are completely ignorant of this.\u201d\n\nFarmers/herders\u2019 economic interdependence could bring lasting peace\n\nWhile the federal government has failed to end clashes between farmers and herders by implementing the NLTP, in addition to providing succour and humanitarian interventions, the UNDP is developing and fostering economic interdependence between farmers and herders in communities where farmers and herders coexist.\n\nUnder this approach, farmers are empowered to grow and sell products that are relevant to herders such as feed, fodders and at a decent price, while the herders sell products such as milk to the farmers at affordable prices. Hence, they coexist economically by depending on each other.\n\nThis is being achieved in places like Ohimini in Agatu Local Government Area of the state which still has a significant number of herders.\n\nIn this community, the economic exchange is fostering communication and understanding between both parties, proving that herders and farmers can coexist with less chance of conflict, when they understand their economic usefulness.\n\nIn addition to fostering economic interdependence, as aforementioned, the UNDP is fostering the development of peace institutions, strengthening the peacebuilding capacities of communities.\n\nFunded through the human security trust fund and the peacebuilding fund, UNDP is building the capacity of various communities to identify issues before they become conflicts through an early warning system.\n\nTo support that process, the agency recently presented the draft of a bill called Peace Building Agency Bill to Titus Uba, speaker of the Benue State House of Assembly.\n\nThe Peace Building Agency Bill has been identified as a potential asset that will institutionalise the peace process and drive more investment from the government.\n\nIt is expected to institutionalise training of people and advocacy to identify early warning signs and promote early response to potential crises situations.\n\nAgri-business innovation hub underway\n\nAs an agro-based economy, the UNDP seeks the establishment of an innovation hub, to empower locals to add value to agricultural products in the state. The agency is also working with the state government to provide those trained in agri-business with land, extension services, and farm inputs.",

Herders need to be educated in what ranches are, as \u201cthey are completely ignorant of this.\u201d\n\nFarmers/herders\u2019 economic interdependence could bring lasting peace\n\nWhile the federal government has failed to end clashes between farmers and herders by implementing the NLTP, in addition to providing succour and humanitarian interventions, the UNDP is developing and fostering economic interdependence between farmers and herders in communities where farmers and herders coexist.\n\nUnder this approach, farmers are empowered to grow and sell products that are relevant to herders such as feed, fodders and at a decent price, while the herders sell products such as milk to the farmers at affordable prices. Hence, they coexist economically by depending on each other.\n\nThis is being achieved in places like Ohimini in Agatu Local Government Area of the state which still has a significant number of herders.\n\nIn this community, the economic exchange is fostering communication and understanding between both parties, proving that herders and farmers can coexist with less chance of conflict, when they understand their economic usefulness.\n\nIn addition to fostering economic interdependence, as aforementioned, the UNDP is fostering the development of peace institutions, strengthening the peacebuilding capacities of communities.\n\nFunded through the human security trust fund and the peacebuilding fund, UNDP is building the capacity of various communities to identify issues before they become conflicts through an early warning system.\n\nTo support that process, the agency recently presented the draft of a bill called Peace Building Agency Bill to Titus Uba, speaker of the Benue State House of Assembly.\n\nThe Peace Building Agency Bill has been identified as a potential asset that will institutionalise the peace process and drive more investment from the government.\n\nIt is expected to institutionalise training of people and advocacy to identify early warning signs and promote early response to potential crises situations.\n\nAgri-business innovation hub underway\n\nAs an agro-based economy, the UNDP seeks the establishment of an innovation hub, to empower locals to add value to agricultural products in the state. The agency is also working with the state government to provide those trained in agri-business with land, extension services, and farm inputs.",
          "summary": "\u201cLuckily,\u201d he said, \u201cI was rescued by security agents who took me to the Benue State Teaching Hospital, where my leg was amputated.\nShe said the persisting conflict between farmers and herders remains the biggest reason they are still displaced.\nAvailable data shows that at least 1.5 million displaced persons are taking shelter in various camps.\nIn addition to poverty, Benue state risks a generation of illiterates as more children are falling out-of-school.\nIn order to end clashes between farmers and herders, a cause of their displacement, UNDP established a peace forum made up of farmers, herders, CSOs, religious & traditional leaders, and government officials.",

          "text": "Benue State government, under the leadership of governor Samuel Ortom, has set plans in motion to enact a law targeted at fostering peace between farmers and herders in the state in order to secure the state\u2019s economy and development gains.\n\nBusinessDay learnt that a technical team from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) presented the draft of a bill called Peace Building Agency Bill to Titus Uba, speaker of the Benue State House of Assembly.\n\nPresented at a meeting involving UNDP\u2019s technical team and members of the state\u2019s legislature, the bill seeks to institutionalise peace building efforts in the state.\n\nThe Speaker of the House expressed gratitude for the technical support provided by UNDP to the government and local civil society organizations in the drafting process, and promised \u201cspeedy deliberation with a view to passing the bill into law.\u201d\n\nSince 2018, high levels of insecurity caused by deadly clashes between farmers and pastoralists in the middle belt region have provoked a sharp drop in food production in the state by 50 percent.\n\nRead Also: Rising food price and wellbeing of Nigerians\n\nThe situation affects not only the food security of the state but that of the whole country since the majority of the food consumed in Nigeria is produced in Benue. Farmers say they have suffered \u201cimmeasurable and massive\u201d losses of crops.\n\nFarmers and herders\n\nSome farmlands are completely deserted, BusinessDay learnt. For instance, a farmland of about 120,000 hectares at the border areas where production occurs has been totally deserted.\n\n\u201cFood security is threatened,\u201d said Magdalyne Dura, special adviser to the governor on Development Cooperation, SDGs and NEPAD. \u201cPoverty is being created because our economy is agro-based.\u201d\n\nShe added that the crisis is fuelling the creation of a new generation of illiterates as hundreds of children are displaced and do not attend school.\n\nThe state considered the idea of a peace architecture when killings persisted. It then involved UNDP for technical support and drafting.\n\nThe Peace Building Agency Bill will institutionalise training of people and advocacy to identify early warning signs and promote early response to potential crisis situations.\n\nIt will also extend to the local levels where women will be involved as peace ambassadors to create a system of effective communication targeting at preventing destructive conflict.\n\nIf passed into law, Benue State will join other states like Nasarawa, and Kaduna where peace-building agencies already exist.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the peace agency, if it comes in, will be one of the most commendable structures that will help us in engaging and doing what we need to do to ensure we have peace in the state,\u201d Dura said.\n\nMore so, UNDP team leaders said they identified the agency as a potential structural asset and if institutionalised, they believe it will encourage the state to take ownership of and invest in dispute management.\n\nAshraf Usman, conflict and political economy specialist, UNDP, noted that security is the state\u2019s responsibility at all levels and it makes sense to lobby the government to take up peace-building\n\nprocesses themselves and do it in a sustainable way rather than rely on international NGOs.\n\n\u201cYou rarely hear that the government is investing in early warning systems,\u201d said Usman. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to get the state government to do the things that we believe work, because for the longest\n\ntime, the state government hasn\u2019t seen it as its responsibility and they felt someone else will cover for it.\u201d\n\nAlthough the UNDP team and the special adviser could not state the exact time the bill will be passed into law, based on the speaker\u2019s assurances of a speedy hearing, they are certain that it would not take long.\n\nWilliam Tsuma, senior advisor at UNDP Nigeria, also thinks that the agency will work by being passed into law because peacebuilding is only sustainable when the solutions are local, adding that the agency bill was not externally programmed but locally demanded.\n\nPut more specifically, according to him, it was Benue State that decided that they needed the bill and approached UNDP for technical support, which it will provide in diverse areas including capacity building and induction of commissioners.\n\nAll stakeholders are said to have unanimously agreed that the agency would be invaluable in restoring peace in the state; they include state chairman, All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN), and Ibrahim Galma, state secretary of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) Benue State Chapter.\n\nThey however stated that both organisations must be involved in the process for the agency bill to be viable and sustainable.\n\nThis is because \u201c90 percent of the crisis emanates from farmers and herders\u201d. If they are closely coordinated, with clear communication messages to help them to understand our problem, then\n\ntogether with the peace-building agency, all the early warning signs will be established and people will get important information,\u201d Galma argues.",

          "title": "Battle for non-interest banking hots up",
          "text": "By AYOOLA OLAOLUWA\n\nA new entrant in the Nigerian non-banking market, Lotus Bank, is steadily gaining ground on market leaders, Jaiz Bank Plc and TajBank Limited, by taking out a significant portion of their business and individual accounts, Business Hallmark findings can reveal.\n\nAcross the nation, the bank is rapidly changing the face of non-interest banking by innovating consumer financial services and creating digital systems and infrastructure, thereby building trust among customers.\n\nIt would be recalled that the market leader, Jaiz Bank, took the nation by storm in 2012 when it received an operating license from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) as a regional bank with offices and branches in Kano, Kaduna and Abuja as Nigeria\u2019s first non-interest bank.\n\nIt soon grew in bounds, expanding to all the 36 states capitals and major cities after the CBN approved its application to transform into a national bank.\n\nFrom a modest institution with total assets valued at US$88.8million; deposits base of N3.5billion, shareholders\u2019 equity of about US$63.6million, balance sheet of N12billion and 3 branches in 2012, the bank as at September 2021, has a total assets of N250billion; deposit base of over N60billion; 40 branches; balance sheet of N62 billion; asset financing of over N30 billion; over 1 million customer base and Profit After Tax (PAT) of N1.99billionattheendofJune2021.\n\nTAJ Bank was also given a licence by the CBN in 2019 to operate non-interest banking under the Islamic banking principles, seven years after Jaiz started operations.\n\nAs of December 2020, the bank operated four branches in FCT Abuja, the National Assembly Complex, Abuja, Kano and Sokoto States, totalassetsofN10billion, Profit Before Tax (PBT) of N3.456billion in its 2020 financial year, deposit growth rate of 1,524 per cent and customer base of 103,853, from 1,809 at inception.\n\nIn 2020, the bank was appointed by the Federal Government to act as receiving agent for its N150 billion Sukuk Bond, the first time in the firm\u2019s history.\n\nHowever, Lotus Bank\u2019s entry into the fray has distorted the status quo, and has put a major dent in Jaiz and TAJ\u2019s balance sheets, with the bank (Lotus) now controlling a major chunk of the market hitherto controlled by the two.\n\nFounded in July 2021 by Mrs. Hajara Adeola, wife of the former Group Managing Director of Guarantee Trust Bank (GTB) Mr. Fola Adeola, the bank within one year of commencing operations from its headquarters in Victoria Island has entrenched itself as the bank of preference in the South Western part of the country.\n\nAccording to impeccable sources in the bank, its management decided to largely focus on its niche market, the South West.\n\n\u201cThe founders hope to use their expertise and influence as sons and daughters of Yorubaland to gain control of the South West market. Though, Jaiz and TAJ started first as non-interest banks, Lotus Capital, owned by the Adeolas, was the pioneer of non-interest finance in Nigeria.\n\nThe firm used to organise non-interest funding for interested individuals and businesses. It even played a major role in the establishment of Jaiz and TAJ, controlled by northern business concerns, which before now controlled the South West market.\n\n\u201cBut the coming of Lotus has changed the narratives. In just over one year of coming on board, the bank has displaced Jaiz in the South West, and is doing relatively well in Abuja due to its deployment of technology\u201d, one of the sources who craved anonymity told BH.\n\nIn a bold move to take the bank directly to the doorsteps of people in the South West, the banks is establishing branches and offices in major towns and cities in the zone.\n\nApart from its flagship headquarter located in the upscale Adetokunbo Ademola Street in Victoria Island, Lagos, the bank recently opened three other branches in the state. They are the Idumagbo, Lagos Island, Allen Avenue, Ikeja and Terminal 2, Oshodi Transport Interchange, Oshodi branches.\n\nThe bank specialise in three major areas, ethical banking, Islamic finance and investment, deploying digital technology to help its customers experience banking with ease.\n\nAlso, apart from issuing free debit cards to account holders with zero-account maintenance charges, the bank\u2019s digital offerings enable customers to open accounts online and transact business through USSD banking.\n\nThe bank is also sweeping the carpet off the feet of her competitors by operating Hajj Saving Schemes for Muslim pilgrims nationwide.\n\nBH reliably gathered that the pilgrims\u2019 boards of all the six South Western states have retained the bank as the preferred banker for all Hajj related matters.\n\nThe bank\u2019s greatest strength is in the array of professionals that pilot its affairs. The team is led by its Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Mrs. Kafilat Araoye, a thoroughbred professional with over 25 years of commercial banking experience.\n\nThe bank\u2019s Divisional Head, Corporate Services (Human Resources, Brand and Marketing Communications), Funso Tooki, said the bank started its operations on a solid foundation of experienced leadership and a strong advisory council of experts.\n\n\u201cOur focus and guiding principle is to deliver an alternative option to interest-based banking and to cater to the needs of not just the banked but also the under-banked and unbanked population.\n\n\u201cNon-Interest Banking is geared towards supporting the real sector and LOTUS Bank aims to improve financial inclusion in the country. In addition, the bank will operate transparent pricing models as is the norm in non-interest banking\u201d, Tooki said.\n\nAlso speaking, the bank\u2019s CEO, Kafilat Araoye, said Lotus Bank was set up with the aim of financially embracing all classes of people.\n\n\u201cWith evolving digital solutions and a millennial generation coming into centre-stage, LOTUS Bank is bringing onboard innovative and comprehensive non-interest compliant financial solutions in investment banking, consumer banking, asset management, private banking, and wealth management.\n\n\u201cAt LOTUS Bank, we believe in fairness to all parties in every business transaction. This is a requirement for building a strong economy.\n\n\u201cEveryone can thrive where fairness prevails. Non-interest banking stands for equity and ethics in business, as well as growth for the real sector.",

          "title": "Mkpuru Mmiri: havoc in South East",
          "text": "By OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nBefore now, Nigerians had only read or watched news about the deadly drug cartels in the central American country of Mexico; a country where drug gangs are known to have committed mass murder and rendered whole neighbourhoods desolate. But now, the same Mexican cartel is being fingered in a new drug epidemic that has enveloped Africa\u2019s most populous country. Precisely, in the country\u2019s Southeast region where the scourge of Methamphetamine or simply Crystal Meth, known locally as Mkpuru mmiri; a powerful, highly addictive stimulant that affects the central nervous system, is ruining lives, destroying homes and has put the entire region on edge.\n\nMeth, as it\u2019s often called, looks like glass fragments or shiny, bluish-whiterocks. It is chemically similar to amphetamine, a drug used to treat attention-deficit hyper activity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy, a sleep disorder.\n\nThe substance increases the amount of the natural chemical dopamine in the brain. Dopamine is involved in body movement, motivation, and reinforcement of rewarding behaviors. The drug\u2019s ability to rapidly release high levels of dopamine in reward areas of the brain strongly reinforces drug-taking behavior, making the user want to repeat the experience, hence the ease with which people are addicted to it.\n\nConsuming of even small amounts of the substance can result in many health effects such increased wakefulness and physical activity, changes in libido, decreased appetite, faster breathing, rapid and/or irregular heartbeat, increased blood pressure and body temperature, among others in the short term.\n\nLong term effects on the other hand, include extreme weight loss, severe dental problems known as \u201cmeth mouth,\u201d intense itching, leading to skin sores from scratching, anxiety, changes in brain structure and function, confusion, memory loss, sleeping problems, violent behavior, paranoia\u2014extreme and unreasonable distrust of others and hallucinations.\n\nNigeria has historically had drug problems. And it\u2019s a challenge that has kept getting worse with a youth bulge battling unemployment and harsh economic realities. One in every seven people, chairman of the country\u2019s National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Buba Marwa said, is addicted to drugs. More so in Kano, Northwest where according to him, it\u2019s one in every six persons.\n\n\u201cThe drug scourge is now an epidemic in Nigeria. The prevalence is 15 percent, three times the global average,\u201d Marwa said when he visited Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu in March. \u201cOne in seven Nigerians take drugs. We have found out that there is a nexus between drug use and crime.\n\n\u201cIn Kano State, drug abuse prevalence is 16 per cent; that is, in every six persons, one is a drug addict and they are between the ages of 15 years and 64 years.\u201d\n\nMarwa\u2019s point that there is a nexus between drug addiction and crime is a given; a reality many residents of the Southeast are waking up to in the wake of the enveloping addiction to meth.\n\n\u201cThe young men who take the substance are increasingly taking to crime. In the night they would be going about stealing and constituting nuisance in the society,\u201d said Chidi Nwafor a business owner in Amawbia, Anambra State.\n\n\u201cIf you go to my place in Nibo, there are a number of young men who are addicted to the drug. At night, they would be going to people\u2019s homes to steal money, goats, generators and so on. The consumption rate is quite alarming especially among young people, even in Amawbia here.\u201d\n\nIn Anambra, like the rest of South Eastern states, the challenge is becoming endemic. Perhaps even more so in Imo.\n\nLast week, a young man from Mgbidi, Oru West Local Government of Imo State, not more than 25, was said to have killed his mother and sister after overdosing on meth, an atrocity that drew the ire of community members who quickly rallied and stoned him to death.\n\nIt\u2019s not an isolated incident. Since the consumption of meth took root in the region in the last three years or so, it\u2019s been tales of crime, ruined livelihoods and death. Young men looking haggard from obvious effect of are a routine sight.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big problem,\u201d said Kenneth Nnaji, a community leader in Amechi, Enugu State. \u201cA lot of people are taking Mkpuru Mmiri, but it\u2019s those it is already having effects on their bodies that you easily tell. We are compiling the names of people selling the drugs, and those taking it. When we are done, we will begin to take serious action.\u201d\n\nVarious communities have taken up the challenge of fighting the menace. In various communities in Anambra, Imo and elsewhere, identified addicts are given corporal punishment; tied to stakes and whipped severely. Feedbacks suggest it\u2019s achieving results. Some have turned the corner. But drug problem is often hardly tractable. It is still a huge challenge and stakeholders are not oblivious of the enormity of the problem.\n\n\u201cLike every effort, you will just keep doing your best, but the results may not come immediately,\u201d said Chief Alex Ogbonnia, spokesperson for Ohanaeze Ndigbo. \u201cWhen it is something that affect the youth, you may not see the results immediately. But the important thing is that an awareness has been created in all the communities in Igboland with respect to the dangers in taking Mkpuru Mmiri. That awareness has made a lot of people to stop taking the drug.\u201d\n\nOhanaeze, the apex Igbo socio cultural group, said it is coordinating effort in this regard, through various town unions. But tackling a challenge of such magnitude requires a lot more, especially from state authorities, which appear to be lacking at the moment.\n\n\u201cOhanaeze is structured in such away that every town union president is a vice chairman at the local government level. That makes the coordination easy,\u201d Chief Ogbonnia said. \u201cWe are working with town union presidents. It is a holistic effort.\u201d\n\nBoth Ohanaeze youth wing and the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), have also taken up the challenge.\n\nOn Friday, November 19, Ohanaeze the Ohanaeze Ndi-Igbo Worldwide-Youth Wing met in Owerri and constituted a task force chaired by Comrade Onyekachi Eweh, with the mandate to carry out far-reaching sensitization campaigns across the length and breadth of Igboland, using the mass media and through seminars and road walks with the aim to enlighten members of the public, especially; youths, parents, teachers ,guardians, community vigilantes, and all relevant stakeholders on the dangers, attributes and distribution channels of \u201cthese illicit and invidious substances.\u201d\n\nThe task force is also to liaise with relevant security agencies, especially, the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, towards eradicating the production, distribution and peddling of these harmful substances anywhere in Igboland.\n\nOn Tuesday last week, IPOB in a statement by its spokesman, Emma Powerful, vowed to go after the distributors and consumers of the substance in the zone, noting that consumption and selling of the destructive hard drug by South east youths can never be accepted or welcomed in any part of the region.\n\n\u201cWe the global movement and family of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) ably led by our great leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, notes with utter displeasure a very ugly and disturbing trend among some youths in Biafra land who have resorted to the consumption of a destructive hard drug methamphetamine, popularly known as \u2018Mkpuru Mmiri.\u2019 This development is very strange and completely unacceptable,\u201d Mr. Powerful said\n\n\u201cIPOB hereby declares war against this nonsense. We shall go after those taking or distributing this harmful illicit drug. Henceforth, anyone found peddling, consuming or in any way involved in the distribution of this illicit drug shall be decisively dealt with.\u201d\n\nFrantic efforts are being made by all stakeholders to curb the menace. But tracking the supply chain has remained a challenge, even as there is no clear answer yet as to how the substance finds its way into the country on such large scale. Most meth in North America is produced by transactional criminal organizations in Mexico, hence the idea that the cartel in Nigeria came from the country. But the suggestion that the supply chain is run by a Mexican cartel is not supported by much evidence. Others have said the cartel is run by local drug dealers who have set up laboratories in the country.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of such laboratories in Nigeria; in the Southeast, and some actions are ongoing to clamp down on them. We are cutting the supply from source,\u201d said Mr. Femi Babafemi, spokesperson for NDLEA.\n\nBabafemi said arrests have been made, and 18 of such laboratories have so far been destroyed.\n\n\u201cThere have been some arrests,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe issue statements on this almost weekly. We arrest people every week. We are moving to the next phase, which is shutting down the pipelines themselves, that is the laboratories. So far in recent years, the agency has shut down 18 of such laboratories. We are going to be doing something intensive very soon. When you shut the pipeline, you are cutting availability and access to that drug. That\u2019s exactly what we are doing because if it is not available then it can\u2019t circulate.\u201d\n\nNDLEA\u2019s effort has not yielded very obvious results thus far. But the agency has a lot on its plate in a country where abuse of drug is endemic, and it\u2019s an ongoing effort. From concoctions made from local materials to hemp and codeine and cocaine, drug use, mostly among youths in the country, is common place. But meth, for its devastating effects on the body, is attracting most attention in the interim.\n\nPerhaps not surprising in a country with 42.5 percent youth unemployment. There also appears to be a nexus between drug use prevalence and high rate of unemployment. Until recently, drug abuse in the country was thought to be mostly a Northern problem, even if the South was not immune from it.\n\nBut the growing consumption of meth with its devastating consequences has shifted the focus to the Southeast. The region, coincidentally is battling its worst unemployment crisis ever, worsened by lack of access to funds which having your own people in power in Abuja provides, especially in a largely rentier economy like Nigeria\u2019s. The zone, many say, is practically shut out from the national tap in Abuja by the government of President Muhammadu Buhari whose body language is seen as mostly anti Southeast.\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s a very tempting argument to link prevalence of drug use to poverty and unemployment. There is a tendency for those confronted with harsh economic realities to take to drugs as a sort of escape. But the link between poverty and drug is fluid. Drug abuse is prevalent, too, among the rich, perhaps even worse, observers say.\n\n\u201cDrug use is endemic in Nigeria, but it is not only among the poor. It is a problem even in rich homes,\u201d said Dr. Bongo Adi, a senior lecturer at Lagos Business School. \u201cIn fact, there are many rich people that are struggling with drug. A lot of the elite you know in Nigeria are addicts but you wouldn\u2019t know.\n\n\u201cThe people who brought this culture of drug are not the poor people in the villages. It is actually exposed individuals who have access to these drugs because to sustain a lifestyle of drug is not cheap. The young men will only go down to the level of meth may be because it is cheaper or more affordable compared to other substances. But so many people that walk around in Lagos actually addicted to drugs.\u201d\n\nMeth, is indeed highly pure, potent, and low in price. The drug can easily be made in small clandestine laboratories, with relatively in expensive over-the-counter ingredients such as pseudoephedrine, a common ingredient in cold medications. The production also involves a number of other very dangerous chemicals whose effects can remain in the environment long after the lab has been shut down, causing a wide range of health problems for people living in the area.\n\n\u201cIt is a menace,\u201d Adi said. \u201cBut it\u2019s been there. Drug addiction and drug abuse have been an issue for Nigerian youths for a very long time. Before now, we thought it was mainly a problem of the North be cause I have been in the fore front of fighting drug abuse in the country.\n\n\u201cDrug abuse was prevalent in the North and when I returned from the American University around year 2000; between 2000 and 2005, what we did at the time was to try to root it out by attacking the sources of supply. But what happens is that when you tackle the source of supply for a particular drug they device other means of getting high.\n\n\u201cAt that time I didn\u2019t know that it was also endemic in the Southeast. In fact it is a nationwide problem. Even here in Lagos, it is a big problem. If you move around the construction sites, you will see crowd of young people taking all manner of substances. They take a whole lot of drugs.\n\n\u201cI had an experience when I followed a friend of mine who is in to construction to one of his construction sites. And when I saw a lot of young women taking drugs here and there, I approached them to ask why they were doing so and whether they didn\u2019t know that what they were taking was harmful.\n\n\u201cThey told me that taking the drug was the only way they could get inspiration and the strength to do the work that they do. Some of them are married. That\u2019s really what gives them the inspiration to keep going; to do those very hard jobs.\u201d",

          "text": "BY EMEKA EJERE\n\nGlobal rating agency, Fitch Solutions, has predicted that even as the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) continues to intervene to support the naira exchange rate, the currency will still weaken from a spot rate of N412.75/$ to N416.00/$ by the end of 2022.\n\nAccording to the agency, despite the upsurge in foreign reserves, the naira will weaken further \u2013 to an average of N428.00/$ \u2013 in 2022 as dollar demand continues to rise on the back of the strengthening economic recovery.\n\nThis is even as the CBN governor, Godwin Emefiele, had penultimate week assured that Nigeria\u2019s foreign reserves will surpass the $42 billion threshold by the middle of next year.\n\nEmefiele, who spoke at the France-Nigeria Security and Economic Summit, in Paris, France, said, \u201cNigeria\u2019s external reserves are expected to surpass US$42 billion by mid-2022. This is due to the sustained increase in crude oil price, the impact of Eurobond Issuance, and the stable exchange rate condition.\u201d\n\nBut Fitch, in its Nigeria Country Risk study, said:\n\n\u201cThe naira will weaken further \u2013 to an average of NGN428.00/USD \u2013 in 2022 as dollar demand continues to rise on the back of the strengthening economic recovery.\n\n\u201cHowever, \u201cwe expect Nigeria\u2019s international reserves to continue to improve in the coming quarters, thus bolstering the CBN\u2019s ability to manage the pace of currency depreciation.\n\n\u201cAt Fitch Solutions, we expect that the Central Bank of Nigeria will seek to maintain the current value of the managed naira exchange rate until the end of 2021, after it implemented a devaluation in May 2021 that saw the currency fall from N380.00/$ on May 11 to N408.16/ $ on May 12.\n\n\u201cThe devaluation involved the adoption of the weaker exchange rate for investors and exporters (known as the Nafex) as the new official rate.\n\n\u201cSince then, the naira has fallen slightly to a spot of N412.75/$, weakening by a total of 8.4 per cent in the year to date.\n\n\u201cWhile we previously expected that the CBN would implement a substantial further devaluation to N437.10/$ by the end of 2021, we now forecast that the currency will depreciate moderately to N416.00/$.\n\n\u201cThe revision reflects our expectation of a significant improvement in Nigeria\u2019s foreign reserves in the coming months. Weakening reserves have in the past pointed to imminent devaluations by the CBN,\u201d the agency said.\n\nAccording to the report, reserves rapidly declined from $36.4 billion in January to $33.3 billion in July, owing to steadily rising imports (due to the slow economic recovery) and weak oil output (88.7 per cent of export earnings in 2020).\n\nHowever, the IMF approved a new allotment of Special Drawing Rights (SDR) in late August, with Nigeria receiving USD3.4 billion. SDRs are special reserve assets issued by the IMF and pegged to a basket of major currencies; they are held at central banks as reserves.\n\nIn late September, Nigeria issued a $4.0 billion eurobond as International reserves are expected to rise rapidly in September as a result of this and the SDR allocation.\n\n\u201cWe have revised up our year-end prediction from 4.1 months of import cover to 5.1 months (or USD41.6 billion), bolstering the CBN\u2019s ability to sustain the naira in the short term,\u201d Fitch added.\n\nThe gross external reserves stood at $41.41 billion as at November 18, 2021, compared with $41.34 billion in October 2021, a moderate increase of 0.17 per cent.\n\nMeanwhile, the exchange rate between the naira and the US dollar closed at N415.07/$1, at the official Investors and Exporters (I&E) window on Thursday.\n\nNaira closed flat against the US dollar on Thursday at N415.07/$1, the same as recorded in the previous trading session. This is despite a 59.7% decline in forex turnover at the official window from $243.34 million recorded on Wednesday to $98.07 million.\n\nSimilarly, naira remained flat at the parallel market, as it closed at N560/$1 on Thursday the rate that was recorded in the previous trading session, according to information obtained from BDC operators.",

          "text": "Ogun, Nasarawa, Oyo, Osun and Ekiti states have been ranked the best in ramping up of COVID-19 vaccination in the country.\n\nThis was revealed by the executive director of the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), Dr Faisal Shuaib at the national briefing of the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19 (PSC).\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe have been monitoring how states have been intensifying the ramp up of COVID-19 vaccination. We have ranked them according to performance. As of today, the top five states are: 1st : Ogun State, 2nd: Nasarawa State, 3rd: Oyo State, 4th : Osun State and 5th: Ekiti State.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to provide you with daily updates of how governors of states are leading the effort to ensure their citizens are fully protected with COVID-19 vaccination.\u201d\n\nOn the December 1 deadline for vaccine mandate for all federal civil servants, Dr Shuaib said: \u201d I would like to remind all federal government employees that starting from December 1st, 2021, they would be required to show evidence of being vaccinated against COVID-19, or a negative PCR result done within 72 hours before being allowed into their offices.\n\n\u201cTo further ease access to COVID-19 vaccines by government employees, we have also commenced office-to-office vaccination in Federal Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs). What this simply means is that employees who are yet to be vaccinated will find a vaccination site around their offices to register and get vaccinated. This will help in preventing the excuse of having to leave their place of employment to a distant vaccination site.\n\n\u201cWe would like to also state that, from time to time, civil servants will be picked at random to check or assess their COVID-19 antibody titre to detect persons who may have fraudulently acquired the vaccination cards without vaccination. Anyone who has been found to have fraudulently obtained the vaccination card without vaccination would be handed over to the law enforcement authorities. The vaccines are free and are available at sites close to you.\n\n\u201cWe have also engaged and are collaborating with the Nigerian Military, Police and the Para-Military institutions in the establishment of mass vaccination sites in their locations around the country. We will also be assisting with the deployment of our vaccination teams to all sites identified by these institutions.\u201d\n\nThe NPHCDA boss also called on Nigerians and the residents to vaccinate, noting that \u201cevery COVID-19 infection gives the coronavirus a chance to mutate. Therefore, being vaccinated helps prevent variants. At this point, we would also like to address the myth that says if one has had the COVID-19 disease and has recovered from it, they are protected and do not need to get vaccinated. This is false as studies have shown that if you have had COVID-19 before and are not vaccinated, your risk of getting reinfected is more than two times higher than those who were infected and got vaccinated.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe are aware that people hesitate to get vaccinated against COVID-19 for many reasons, ranging from personal views and fears to logistical problems of getting to vaccination sites. But waiting too long to be vaccinated allows the virus to continue spreading in the community with the emergence of new variants. Severe COVID-19 can be very dangerous, so the sooner you get vaccinated, the sooner you are protected. This is a period of intensive drive to protect Nigerians against this new variant and indeed a 4th wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. We are not taking anything for granted; we are not compromising on safety and standards, and we are fully monitoring all adverse events following immunization (AEFI). But as I have always appealed, we need the support of all Nigerians. We need every vaccinated Nigerian to appeal to their family members, their loved ones, their neighbours, and members of their communities to get vaccinated so that we are all protected. It is indeed a collective responsibility.\n\n\u201cThis is a clarion call to those who are yet to be vaccinated to hurry up and take advantage of our mass vaccination campaign to receive COVID-19 vaccines. Those who have received their first dose should also endeavour to go and get their second dose on their due dates, for full protection.\u201dI",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nThe Federal Government on Monday insisted Nigeria is yet to record a case of the Omicron variant of the COVID-19, despite Canadian authorities\u2019 claims that two passengers from Nigeria had tested positive.\n\nSpeaking at the Presidential Steering Committee briefing in Abuja, Director-General of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, Ifedayo Adetifa, said there was no need to give in to speculations.\n\n\u201cI do not encourage citizens to waste energy on speculating,\u201d he said. \u201cI think what we need to do is to focus on what we actually know. And what we know, for now, is that we do not have a case in Nigeria at the moment.\n\n\u201cNow, we have a pipeline of samples that are in process, whose results will be ready tomorrow; so this situation, of course, can change.\u201d\n\nMinister of Health, Osagie Ehanire, said authorities were \u201cadopting a watchful, waiting posture.\u201d\n\nThe Omicron variant, first detected in South Africa, is believed to be highly transmissible, but it is not yet clear how deadly it is to public health.\n\nREAD ALSO: Biden Rules Out Further Travel Restrictions Over Omicron\n\nThe World Health Organization has listed Omicron as a \u201cvariant of concern\u201d and countries around the world are now restricting travel from southern Africa, where the new strain was first detected and taking other new precautions.\n\nOn Sunday, Canadian authorities said the country had detected its first cases of the new strain of in two people who had traveled recently to Nigeria.\n\nBut members of the PSC said they were waiting on their Canadian counterparts for more details since there are no direct flights between Nigeria and Canada.\n\nPandemic treaty\n\nMeanwhile, the WHO believes the world must study the wreckage of Covid-19 and say \u201cnever again\u201d by striking a pandemic preparedness treaty.\n\nDirector-General of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Monday said another disastrous pandemic was bound to happen unless countries showed the resolve to strengthen global defences.\n\nNations are meeting in Geneva from Monday to Wednesday to discuss an international agreement setting out how to handle the next pandemic \u2014 which experts fear is only a matter of time.\n\nThe gathering comes with the planet still besieged by Covid-19, nearly two years on from the first cases recorded in China, and now shaken by Omicron/\n\nWHO member states reached a consensus Sunday on kick-starting the process towards a pandemic treaty.\n\nThe draft decision was secured after countries agreed to compromise \u2014 notably the United States, which is luke-warm on whether the outcome needs to be a legally-binding treaty.\n\nThe decision is expected to be formalised on Wednesday.\n\nShadow of Omicron\n\n\u201cThe emergence of the highly-mutated Omicron variant underlines just how perilous and precarious our situation is,\u201d Tedros told world leaders at the start of the three-day gathering.\n\n\u201cOmicron demonstrates just why the world needs a new accord on pandemics.\n\n\u201cOmicron\u2019s very emergence is another reminder that although many of us might think we\u2019re done with Covid-19, it\u2019s not done with us.\n\n\u201cIt will all happen again unless you, the nations of the world, can come together to say with one voice: never again.\u201d\n\nThis meeting of the World Health Assembly \u2014 the WHO\u2019s decision-making body comprising all 194 member states \u2014 is an unprecedented special session on how to handle the next pandemic.\n\nIt should thrash out how far countries are prepared to go towards legally-binding commitments on issues like equitable vaccine distribution, knowledge-sharing, financing and oversight structures, with any final deal due to come into force in 2024.\n\nA key issue down the line could be whether countries want beefed-up powers for the WHO to investigate the sources of outbreaks. Tedros said the lack of data-sharing early in the Covid pandemic had been a hindrance.\n\n\u201cOne of the expectations of this treaty is to be able to improve the WHO\u2019s capacity to monitor and assess the situation in countries: the investigative power of WHO,\u201d a French diplomatic source said.\n\n\u2018Make history\u2019\n\nChilean President Sebastian Pinera said the world was unprepared for Covid-19 and \u201cfor that weakness, we all paid a great price.\u201d\n\n\u201cSteps must be taken to ensure that this will not happen again, that when the next pandemic comes, and it will come, it will find us better prepared,\u201d he said.\n\nUnder the draft decision, WHO member states agree to establish an intergovernmental negotiating body \u201cto draft and negotiate a WHO convention, agreement or other international instrument on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response\u201d.\n\nThe body\u2019s first meeting must be no later than March 1 next year to elect two co-chairs and four vice-chairs.\n\nA progress report will be presented at the regular World Health Assembly annual gathering in 2023, with the final outcome presented for consideration at the 2024 WHA.\n\nEuropean Council President Charles Michel, who first got the ball rolling on a pandemic treaty, said: \u201cI hope we will make history. The situation in the world demands it.\n\n\u201cYesterday\u2019s informal agreement is a huge step, and now it\u2019s time to capitalise on this momentum to make the world a safer place.\u201d\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel called for reform of how countries fund the WHO so it can react more flexibly to crises.\n\n\u201cMeasures for better prevention and response to pandemics should be laid down in a pandemic treaty, binding under international law,\u201d she said.\n\nSwiss Health Minister Alain Berset said the world needed to take immediate, bold action, as he called for a legally-binding instrument.\n\n\u201cThe issues at stake are too important. We don\u2019t have the right to fail,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "An Efficient Civil Service Crucial For National Development, Governance \u2013 Osinbajo",
          "text": "Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, SAN, has said that the public sector is critical for national development, very vital for governance, and quality public service delivery.\n\nProf. Osinbajo stated this on Monday at the commissioning of the new multi-billion-naira civil service secretariat complex in Asaba, Delta State capital, which was named after the Asagba of Asaba (traditional ruler of Asaba), Prof. Chike Edozien.\n\nThe Vice President, who was received at the Asaba airport by the Delta State governor, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, noted at the secretariat that the commissioning was historic, \u201cbecause the seat of the civil service of any arm of government anywhere in the world is usually one of the major monuments enshrining not just the power, but also the splendour of the authority of government.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis imposing complex clearly meets this requirement. In due course, such buildings become historical monuments,\u201d a statement by the VP\u2019s spokesman, Laolu Akande, quoted him as saying.\n\nREAD ALSO: Gunmen Shoot Kogi Commissioner, Kidnap Others\n\nAccording to the VP, the civil service is the very tip of the spear of governance, and optimal public service delivery requires an efficient civil service.\n\n\u201cSuch a public service requires training, and capacity building but also workspaces that are well equipped, conducive, and inspirational. We have heard already how inspired the public servants today are and they are even spending long hours in the office. This is very commendable indeed. Public servants require environments that bring out the best in them. This secretariat complex will provide such an environment,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe VP, who described the new secretariat as a state-of-the-art, functional, and befitting secretariat complex, said it was befitting that the state decided to immortalize the name of one of Delta State\u2019s and Nigeria\u2019s most illustrious sons.\n\nHe also observed that the recognition the Delta State government has accorded Prof. Edozien would serve as an inspiration and a pointer to the kind of excellence required in public service.\n\nAccording to Prof, Osinbajo, \u201cin naming this building after His Royal Majesty, you are not just celebrating a highly respected and deserving son of Delta State and Nigeria, you are also signaling the sort of excellence in public service that we wish to see incubated within this complex.\n\n\u201cBut perhaps more importantly, you are saying to a generation, not old enough to be employed in the civil service today, that integrity, diligence, and service to community and country still pay. It is my hope that this place will, like the eminent personage after whom it is named, be a symbol of unity and distinction.\u201d\n\nThe VP commended Delta State Governor, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, for recognizing the critical role of the public sector.\n\nHe further said the State Governor deserved commendation for being able to provide the funding for the laudable project \u201cdespite dwindling revenue receipts and severe resource constraints across all levels of government in our country.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Vice President had also commissioned an 8.5MW Power Plant with a 25km distribution network in Asaba right behind the new secretariat.\n\nThe Independent Power Project, which was jointly facilitated by the Delta State government and Bastanchury Power Solutions, is now providing 24/7 electricity supply to the State Government House and the Secretariat in Asaba.\n\nThe plant was set up under a Willing Buyer-Willing Seller basis, an arrangement between the state and the firm that did not require a Power Purchase Agreement, PPA, which would normally require a Sovereign Guarantee.\n\nOn the essence of building capacity in the public sector, the VP noted that \u201cwhether we are talking about the need for more internally generated revenues and greater tax efficiency to compensate for resource deficits, or the management of a public health crisis such as a pandemic, or even the drive for more internally generated revenue, it is the capacity of the public sector that is invariably at issue.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President, who had earlier paid a courtesy call to the Palace of the Asagba of Asaba, noted that the traditional ruler was a bridge builder who brings people together.\n\n\u201cHis Royal Majesty, Prof. Chike Edozien, the Asagba of Asaba \u2013 Nigeria\u2019s oldest living professor in any discipline and an internationally renowned Professor of Medicine, but more importantly an outstanding bridge-builder and patriot.\n\n\u201cAs Your Excellency confirms, His Majesty has played and continues to play an important role as a symbol of unity in this State. And that during his thirty-year reign so far, the town of Asaba has changed dramatically becoming the capital of the newly-created Delta State in 1991 and has attracted people from far and wide that have come to seek their fortunes here,\u201d the VP stated.\n\nIn his remarks at his palace, the Asagba of Asaba, Prof. Chike Edozien, who thanked Okowa for the recognition given him, described Vice President Osinbajo as a wise man.\n\n\u201cAs the Vice President of this great country, Nigeria, we know you as a very distinguished and eminent supporter of law, and we know you as a pastor of the Redeemed Church. Put together, we can say that with all these qualifications and experience, you are a wise man.\n\n\u201cOnce again, Mr. Vice President, I thank you for coming to Asaba to listen to us. We wish you well, and that after the commissioning, you return safely to Abuja. Our love and regard to Mr. President. God bless you.\u201d\n\nAlso, at the commissioning of the Secretariat, Governor Ifeanyi Okowa while welcoming Prof. Osinbajo to the State, noted that \u201cMr. Vice President is a true statesman and an uncommon leader.\u201d",

          "text": "Some of the most illustrious names in soccer\u2019s long history only managed to win the Ballon d\u2019Or, the sport\u2019s most prestigious individual prize, once. George Best, Zinedine Zidane and E\u00fasebio all have just a single award to their names. Ronaldo, the great Brazilian striker, won two. Johan Cruyff, arguably the finest European player in history, has three.\n\nAfter Monday night, Lionel Messi has seven.\n\nMessi, 34, effectively retained the trophy he last won in 2019 \u2014 controversially, the award was not handed out by France Football last year because of the coronavirus pandemic \u2014 after a year in which he ended his long wait for an international honor, winning the Copa Am\u00e9rica with Argentina, and left Barcelona, the club where he had spent all of his career, for Paris St.-Germain.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredible to be here again,\u201d Messi said. \u201cTwo years ago I thought it was the last time. Winning the Copa Am\u00e9rica was the key.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how many years I have left,\u201d he added, \u201cbut I hope many more.\u201d\n\nBarcelona may have lost Messi this year, but it still took home some hardware on Monday: Alexia Putellas, a star midfielder on its treble-winning women\u2019s team, was an easy winner in voting for the women\u2019s Ballon d\u2019Or, and the teenager Pedri, a rising talent who is already a fixture for Barcelona and Spain\u2019s national team, was honored as the world\u2019s best player under 21.\n\nMessi, who had arrived at the gala at Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet in Paris in a shimmering tuxedo, a look matched by his three young sons, was typically soft-spoken in accepting his award. He praised his former teammates at Barcelona and his countrymen with Argentina, and vowed to fight for new trophies with his new club, P.S.G.\n\nMessi defeated his closest contender, Bayern Munich\u2019s Polish striker Robert Lewandowski, in voting by 176 journalists and conducted by France Football, which awards the prize (almost) every year. Many experts argued Lewandowski deserved the honor in 2020, when it was not handed out because, organizers said, disruptions to the soccer calendar had made it impossible to judge. Messi said he agreed with that position.\n\n\u201cI think you deserved to win the award last year,\u201d Messi told Lewandowski from the stage, calling it \u201can honor\u201d to battle him for top honors in 2021.\n\nJorginho, the Brazil-born Italy midfielder, was third, reward for a season in which his club team, Chelsea, won the Champions League and Italy won the European Championship. Real Madrid and France striker Karim Benzema was fourth, and Jorginho\u2019s Chelsea midfield partner, N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9, was fifth.\n\nThough it has hardly been a vintage year by Messi\u2019s standards \u2014 Barcelona was beaten to the Spanish title by Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and eliminated from last season\u2019s Champions League in the round of 16 by P.S.G. \u2014 his achievement with Argentina, as well as the attention drawn by his move to France after winning six Ballons d\u2019Or at Barcelona, was enough to convince the award\u2019s jurors.\n\nThat Messi had never won an international trophy with his national team had always been held against him in the debate over whether he warrants the status as soccer\u2019s greatest ever player. His rivals, after all, had triumphed with their countries as well as their clubs: Pel\u00e9 led Brazil to three World Cups, Diego Maradona inspired Argentina to one and Cristiano Ronaldo helped Portugal claim the European Championship in 2016.\n\nMessi finally put that idea to rest in this summer\u2019s Copa Am\u00e9rica, breaking down in tears on the field after \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda\u2019s goal had given Argentina its first international trophy since 1993, beating Brazil, the host, in the final.\n\nHis tally of seven Ballons d\u2019Or now puts him two clear of Ronaldo, his great rival: The Portuguese forward remains on five, but he has not won the prize since 2017, and at age 36 he is more than two years older than Messi.\n\nRonaldo, who finished sixth in the voting, was absent from Monday\u2019s ceremony, but his rivalry with Messi was not. On his Instagram account, Ronaldo angrily took issue with a comment made recently by France Football\u2019s editor in chief, Pascal Ferr\u00e9, in an interview with The New York Times about the award\u2019s prestige.\n\n\u201cRonaldo has only one ambition, and that is to retire with more Ballons d\u2019Or than Messi,\u201d Ferr\u00e9 said, \u201cand I know that because he has told me.\u201d\n\nRonaldo \u2014 despite suggesting as much in other interviews \u2014 denied he had made the comment, saying, \u201cFerr\u00e9 lied, used my name to promote himself and to promote the publication he works for.\u201d\n\nPutellas, the 27-year-old midfielder who is captain of Barcelona\u2019s all-conquering women\u2019s team, won the women\u2019s Ballon d\u2019Or. Her victory completed a clean sweep of last season\u2019s prizes, after she led her Barcelona side to the Champions League title and a league and cup double in Spain, and then was honored as Europe\u2019s player of the year.\n\nHer main rivals for the Ballon d\u2019Or were mostly familiar faces: Barcelona had become the first women\u2019s team to register five nominees in a single year, and two of Putellas\u2019s teammates \u2014 Jennifer Hermoso, who was second, and Lieke Martens, who was fifth \u2014 finished in the top five in the voting.\n\n\u201cHonestly it\u2019s a bit emotional, and very special,\u201d Putellas said. \u201cIt\u2019s great to be here with all of my teammates, since we have lived and experienced so much together, especially in the past year.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is an individual prize,\u201d she added, \u201cbut football is a team sport.\u201d\n\nNew York Times",
