          "title": "Fuel subsidy: FG\u2019s policy retention disappointing, says energy expert",
          "text": "An energy expert, Dr Diran Fawibe, has expressed disappointment that the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), and his regime, retained the provisions of the Petroleum Industry Act fuel in the country.\n\nFawibe, the Group Chairman of International Energy Services Limited, spoke to Business Morning, a programme of Channels Television, on Wednesday, monitored by our correspondent.\n\nFawibe noted that the issue of fuel shortages and fuel subsidy has lingered in national discourse for four decades without any solution.\n\nHe noted that the current subsidy was brought to the fore because of the need to import fuel from foreign refineries to sustain the economy.\n\n\u201cWe are disappointed because government hopes to transfer this issue to the next administration. Unfortunately, the issue of subsidy removal may not be as serious as we are currently having it. This matter has been in the public domain for four decades. There has been a panel since 1975. If our refineries were working there will be no issue of subsidy. Until we are able to solve the problem of the supply of fuel, the challenge that occasioned subsidy will remain,\u201d he said\n\nThe energy expert also noted that government can help the economy by putting pressure on contractors who are revamping our refineries, so that supply of fuel and other extracts from crude oil would be locally produced.\n\nFor Fawibe, this will contribute to the demand for fuel and the intervention of the Dangote refinery.\n\n\u201cIf the Dangote refinery comes upstream in the third quarter of the year and the govt puts pressure on the contractors who are working on the refineries, especially the Port Harcourt refinery, then we will be able to reduce importation. If we can produce 650,000 per day through our refineries, then we will be able to solve the problem of subsidy,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also urged the government to support local content especially when the refineries are working, as this would go a long way in reducing the cost of fuel to the common man.\n\n\u201cWhen we import fuel from abroad, you cannot prevent refineries from pricing their product based on world market prices. There are also processing, shipping, and handling fees that accrue to the government before they are deposited and transferred to their depots in the country. If the refineries are working, there will be a difference in price from what we are having now,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe have to look at market forces. The govt can give local refineries a discount so that they can pass it on to users. But if Dangote is getting crude at the international market price, there won\u2019t be a substantial decrease in oil prices,\u201d Fawibe said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "The Federal Government says it is set to amend its relevant statutes and code to enforce the operational conditions of Twitter in Nigeria on other social media platforms.\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed disclosed this in Cairo at a meeting with his counterpart, Egypt Minister of Communication and Information Technology, Dr Amir Talaat.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria reports that the meeting was on the sidelines of a bilateral discussion with Africa Export Import Bank (Afreximbank) on how Nigeria can access funding to support its growing creative industry.\n\nNAN reports that Mohammed had led some private sector stakeholders involved in Digital Switch Over, to Afreximbank to assist them on how they can source fund to complete the wholly private sector financially driven project.\n\nIn his interaction with Talaat, the minister disclosed that Nigeria was amending its National Broadcasting Act and Broadcasting Code to ensure that all online platforms operating in the country must comply with stipulated conditions.\n\nMohammed said the decision was borne out of the recent development on suspension of Twitter operations in the country and the agreement reached before the suspension was lifted.\n\n\u201cThe beauty of the engagement with Twitter is immense.\n\n\u201cWhatever applies to twitter will apply to all other social media platforms, be it WhatsApp, Facebook or any other.\n\n\u201cThat is why we will be having a retreat to amend the NBC Act and the NBC Code to incorporate these new gains we made with the engagement with Twitter,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nOn the agreement reached with Twitter which the minister said would be applicable to other online platforms, he said the micro blogging site had agreed to open the Nigerian office within the first quarter of 2022.\n\nHe said Twitter agreed to appoint a designated country representative within one month of lifting its suspension while its global policy team would also be available to engage directly with the government\n\nThe minister said twitter agreed to meet all regulatory demands, including Companies and Allied Matters Act, Nigeria Communication Commission laws and rules and National Broadcasting Commission Code.\n\n\u201cTwitter has agreed to comply to all payable taxes as they are operating under the Nigerian laws and this they agreed to do within one week of restoring their operations.\n\n\u201cTwitter agreed to immediately work with the Federal Government in the area of code of conduct which is in line with global best practices\n\n\u201cTwitter agreed to immediately enroll Nigerians in its Law Enforcement portals and Partners Support Portal.\n\n\u201cThe law enforcement portal will provide dedicated channels for the Nigerian laws enforcement agencies to escalate reports on contents that violate the code of conduct or the national laws.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the partner support portal provides a direct channel for government to engage twitter staff to manage prohibited contents,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister explained to his counterpart that Twitter\u2019s operation was not suspended in Nigerian because they wrote something about president as being carried about in certain quarters.\n\nHe said the operation was suspended because Twitter had become the platform of choice for those who wanted to destabilise Nigeria and create disunity and heat up the polity.\n\n\u201cWe met with a barrage of knocks, we were accused of running authoritarian government, trying to infringe on freedom of press, violating the constitution but we were sure in our mind of what we were doing.\n\n\u201cWe were glad that after seven months of serious engagement with twitter, we can say that what we achieved is what the suspension of the operations of twitter was all about,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso speaking, the Egyptian minister said his country had similar challenges in the area of dissemination of policies and programmes of government.\n\nHe said he was a recent victim of fake news report which was very devastating to him.\n\nTo combat the menace, he said a department was established in the Office of the Prime Minister where they monitor on hourly basis what kind of fake news was being cooked up.\n\nHe said government would immediately react to such news by giving the truthful perspective to the issue.\n\n(NAN)",

          "text": "Spends \u00a33 million on repairs\n\nBy Davies Iheamnachor \u2013 Port Harcourt\n\nRivers State Governor, Chief Nyesom Wike, said the state has through government intelligence discovered one of the state\u2019s owned Legacy 600 aircraft, flown to and abandoned in Germany.\n\nWike said the aircraft was abandoned in the European nation since 2012 by the Governor Chibuike Amaechi-led administration, saying it was bad for the immediate past administration to have secretly taken a state-owned asset to Germany and abandoned it without any documentation.\n\nThe Governor according to a statement by his Special Assistant on Media, Kelvin Ebiri, had led a delegation of Rivers leaders to General Atomics Aerotec in Munich, Germany, where the aircraft had been abandoned for ten years.\n\nHe said efforts to repair and retrieve the aircraft have cost the State government over Three Million Euros.\n\nSpeaking during a meeting with the General Manager, Business Development, General Atomics Aerotec, Markus Froetschi, Governor Wike explained that his administration in a bid to recover State assets had through intelligence discovered that the Legacy 600 jet purchased by Dr Peter Odili\u2019s administration was in Germany.\n\nWike said: \u201cWhen we came into office in 2015, we never had an idea that our plane was in your facility. It was a matter of asking questions before we got the information that Legacy 600 belonging to our State is in RUAG , before General Atomics. We tried to make contact with you and which you obliged. So, we want to sincerely thank you for not hiding anything from us, because it is the property of the State government.\n\n\u201cThis plane was bought in 2003 by the government of Dr Peter Odili, and by 2007 he had handed over to the next government which was my predecessors now, Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi. While he was in office, by 2012 this plane was brought here. Reasons we do not know.\u201d\n\nHe said there was no documentation indicating that the State-owned aircraft was flown to Germany and abandoned for inexplicable reasons.\n\nWike said he had to travel to Munich, Germany with a state delegation to prove that the Legacy 600 aircraft has been discovered and about to be returned to the State government.\n\n\u201cThe issue is; why was there no documentation to let the incoming government know that we have this facility and we sent it to RUAG for inspection? Again, I do know from experience that inspection of such a facility does not take more than six months. So, if it was brought in 2012, expectantly at least, by early 2013, the plane ought to have come back for use,\u201d he said.\n\nThose on the governor\u2019s entourage included the Speaker Rivers State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Ikuinyi-Owaji Ibani; Deputy Speaker, Rivers State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Ehie Ogerenye Edison; Rivers State Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Prof. Zacchaeus Adangor; member of House of Representatives, Ken Chikere; Rivers State chairman, Peoples Democratic Party, Ambassador Desmond Akawor; Chairman, Ikwerre LGA, Hon. Samuel Nwanosike among others.\n\nHowever, the General Manager, Business Development, General Atomics Aerotec, Markus Froetschi, said the aircraft was brought to Germany by the immediate past administration and abandoned since 2012.\n\nFroeschi expressed delight that Governor Wike took the initiative to repair and return the aircraft to Nigeria for use by the State government, adding that his company would soon be through with general maintenance work and deliver the aircraft to the State government in March.\n\nMeanwhile, the Speaker, Rivers State House of Assembly, Ikuinyi-Owaji Ibani, said he was happy that the aircraft has been recovered by the State government, promising that the State lawmakers would continue to support every effort to recover all government assets and property.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "The Federal Government says it is set to amend relevant statutes and codes to enforce the operational conditions of Twitter in Nigeria on other social media platforms.\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, disclosed this in Cairo at a meeting with his counterpart, Egypt Minister of Communication and Information Technology, Dr Amir Talaat.\n\nThe meeting was on the sidelines of a bilateral discussion with Africa Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) on how Nigeria can access funding to support its growing creative industry.\n\nNAN reports that Mohammed had led some private sector stakeholders involved in Digital Switch Over (DSO), to Afreximbank to assist them on how they can source funds to complete the wholly private sector financially driven project.\n\nIn his interaction with Talaat, the minister disclosed that Nigeria was amending its National Broadcasting Act and Broadcasting Code to ensure that all online platforms operating in the country comply with stipulated conditions.\n\nMohammed said the decision was borne out of the recent development on the suspension of Twitter operations in the country and the agreement reached before the suspension was lifted.\n\n\u201cThe beauty of the engagement with Twitter is immense.\n\n\u201cWhatever applies to Twitter will apply to all other social media platforms, be it WhatsApp, Facebook or any other.\n\n\u201cThat is why we will be having a retreat to amend the NBC Act and the NBC Code to incorporate these new gains we made with the engagement with Twitter,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nOn the agreement reached with twitter which the minister said would apply to other online platforms, he said the microblogging site had agreed to open the Nigerian office within the first quarter of 2022.\n\nHe said twitter agreed to appoint a designated country representative within one month of lifting its suspension while its global policy team would also be available to engage directly with the government.\n\nThe minister said twitter agreed to meet all regulatory demands, including the Companies and Allied Matters Act, Nigeria Communication Commission laws and rules and National Broadcasting Commission Code.\n\n\u201cTwitter has agreed to comply with all payable taxes as they are operating under the Nigerian laws and this they agreed to do within one week of restoring their operations.\n\n\u201cTwitter agreed to immediately work with the Federal Government in the area of code of conduct which is in line with global best practices.\n\n\u201cTwitter agreed to immediately enrol Nigerians in its Law Enforcement portals and Partners Support Portal.\n\n\u201cThe law enforcement portal will provide dedicated channels for the Nigerian law enforcement agencies to escalate reports on contents that violate the code of conduct or the national laws.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the partner support portal provides a direct channel for the government to engage twitter staff to manage prohibited contents,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe minister explained to his counterpart that Twitter operations were not suspended in Nigeria because they wrote something about the president as being carried about in certain quarters.\n\nHe said the operation was suspended because Twitter had become the platform of choice for those who wanted to destabilize Nigeria, create disunity and heat the polity.\n\n\u201cWe met with a barrage of knocks, we were accused of running an authoritarian government, trying to infringe on freedom of the press, violating the constitution, but we were sure in our mind of what we were doing.\n\n\u201cWe are glad that after seven months of serious engagement with Twitter, we can say that what we achieved is what the suspension of the operations of Twitter was all about,\u201d he said.",

Somebody who should be in jail is saying he wants to contest to become the president of Nigeria; what an insult to the sensibility of all Nigerians.

His assent to the bill was in furtherance to the passage of the Bill by both the Senate and the House of Representatives earlier in July 2021. The PIA is expected to grow investors\u2019 confidence in the petroleum industry and create more employment opportunities for the populace in the host communities.\n\nSylva explained that the suspension is to give all stakeholders time to ensure the implementation is carried out in a manner that guarantees that all necessary modalities are in place to cushion the effect of the PMS subsidy removal.\n\n\u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari has agreed to an extension of the statutory period for the implementation of the removal of subsidy on petrol (Premium Motor Spirit, PMS) in accordance with extant laws.\n\n\u201cHowever, following extensive consultations with all key stakeholders within and outside the government, it has been agreed that the implementation period for the removal of the subsidy should be extended.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood.

That is why we are making this announcement.\u201d\n\nOn the possible legal implications after the assent to the PIA by President Buhari, the minister said: \u201cWe also see the legal implications. There is six months provision in the PIA which will expire in February and that is why we are coming out to to say that before the expiration of this time, as I said earlier, we will engage the legislature. We believe that this will go to the legislature, we are applying for some amendment of the law so that we would still be within the law.\n\n\u201cWe are proposing an 18months extension but what the National Assembly is going to approve is up to them. We would approve an 18 months extension and then it is up to the national Assembly to look at it and pass the amendment as the see it.\u201d\n\nAsked if the suspension has something to do with 2023 elections, he said: \u201cOf course not. As I told , first it\u2019s just the human face of the government, Mr. President especially wants certain structures to be in place. And he insisted if we want to remove subsidy, we must make sure that we put every measure in place to protect the suffering masses of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nOn the possibility of gradual increase, that is not on the table right now, the minister said: \u201cGradual or increment in whatever guise is not on the table. We are going to see how to rejig the law, this is not going to be the only amendment to the PIA. A few months ago, the President already proposed an amendment to the law.\u201d",

          "title": "At Last, Senate, House Pass Amended Electoral Bill",
          "text": "\u2022Okay direct, indirect, consensus primaries for parties\n\n\u2022Stipulate conditions for consensus \u2022Proposed legislation to be transmitted to Buhari in seven days\n\nUdora Orizu and Sunday Aborisade in Abuja\n\nThe Senate yesterday passed the harmonised Clause 84 of the 2010 Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2022, which allows political parties to adopt three modes of primaries.\n\nThe proposed legislation, earlier passed last year, was not assented to by President Muhammadu Buhari. Buhari had cited the provisions of Clause 84, which made direct primary compulsory for all political parties in electing candidates for elections, as his reason for refusing assent to the bill. The two chambers of the National Assembly then recommitted the bill for fresh legislation and added other options, as advised by the president.\n\nThe harmonised version accommodated the direct, indirect, and consensus modes of primary election.\n\nThe Senate had earlier passed the three modes of primaries, but the version of the House of Representatives did not include the consensus arrangement.\n\nThe upper chamber considered the harmonised version of the bill at plenary and passed it.\n\nSenate President, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, said the bill had given sufficient and clear definition to the modes of primary election now adopted by both chambers of the National Assembly.\n\nThe re-amendment was sequel to a motion on \u201crescission on clause 84 of the Electoral Act No. 26 2010 (Amendment) Bill, 2022 and Committal to the Committee of the Whole.\u201d The motion was sponsored by Senate Leader, Yahaya Abdullahi (Kebbi North).\n\nThe amended bill provides in clause 84 (2), \u201cThe procedure for the nomination of candidates by political parties for the various elective positions shall be by direct, indirect primaries or consensus.\u201d\n\nIt adds in 84(3), \u201cA political party shall not impose nomination qualification or disqualification criteria, measures, or conditions on any aspirant or candidate for any election in its constitution, guidelines, or rules for nomination of candidates for elections, except as prescribed under sections 65, 66, 106, 107, 131, 137, 177 and 187 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended).\u201d\n\nOn direct primaries in 84 (4), the amended version provides, \u201cA political party that adopts the direct primaries procedure shall ensure that all aspirants are given equal opportunity of being voted for by members of the party and shall adopt the procedure outlined below:\n\n\u201c(a) In the case of presidential primaries, all registered members of the party shall vote for aspirants of their choice at a designated centre at each ward of the federation.\n\n\u201c(b) The procedure in paragraph (a) above of this subsection shall be adopted for direct primaries in respect of gubernatorial, senatorial, federal and state constituencies.\n\n\u201c(c) Special Conventions or Congresses shall be held to ratify the candidate with the highest number of votes at designated centres at the national, state, senatorial, federal and state constituencies, as the case may be.\u201d\n\nIn terms of indirect primaries, the bill provides under 84(5), \u201cA political party that adopts the system of indirect primaries for the choice of its candidate shall adopt the procedure outlined below: (a) In the case of nominations to the position of presidential candidate, the political party shall \u2013 (i) hold a Special Presidential Convention at a designated centre in the Federal Capital Territory or any other place within the federation that is agreed to by the National Executive Committee of the party where delegates shall vote for aspirants of their choice.\n\n\u201c(ii) the aspirant with the highest number of votes cast at the end of voting shall be declared the winner of the presidential primaries of the political party and that aspirant\u2019s name shall be forwarded to the Commission as the candidate of the party.\u201d\n\nIt further provides under 84(7), \u201cWhere there is only one aspirant or a consensus candidate in a political party for any of the elective positions mentioned in subsection (5)(a), (b), (c) and (d), the party shall convene a special convention or congress at a designated centre on a specified date for the confirmation of such aspirant and the name of the aspirant shall be forwarded to the Independent National Electoral Commission as the candidate of the party.\u201d\n\nThe Electoral Bill provides in 84(8), \u201cA political party that adopts the system of indirect primaries for the choice of its candidate shall clearly outline in its constitution and rule the procedure for the democratic election of delegates to vote at the convention, congress meeting.\u201d\n\nOn consensus candidate, the bill in 84(9)(a) provides, \u201cA political party that adopts a consensus candidate shall secure the written consent of all cleared aspirants for the position, indicating their voluntary withdrawal from the race and their endorsement of the consensus candidate.\u201d\n\nIt states further in paragraph (b), \u201cWhere a political party is unable to secure the written consent of all cleared aspirants for the purpose of a consensus candidate, it shall revert to the choice of direct or indirect primaries for the nomination of candidates for the aforesaid elective positions.\u201d\n\nThe bill states in paragraph (c), \u201cA Special Convention or nomination congress shall be held to ratify the choice of consensus candidates at designated centres at the national, state, senatorial, federal and state constituencies, as the case may be.\u201d\n\nHouse of Representatives Speaker, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, explained during plenary that the leadership of the House met on Monday and decided that to facilitate speedy passage of the bill and deepen democracy, both chambers of the National Assembly decided to add the consensus provision. Gbajabiamila, however, said the inclusion came with certain provisos so as to protect all aspirants for all positions, and give all an even playing field.\n\nHe explained, \u201cYou will recall that this House last week, as soon as we returned, looked into the complaints and added the provision of indirect primaries to our law. Unfortunately, the Senate added both indirect and consensus, which necessitated the possible need for a conference committee of both chambers.\n\n\u201cThe leadership of the House met yesterday and decided that in the interest of speedy passage and also to deepen our democracy, the House and Senate decided to add the consensus provision, so there will be no need for conference but with certain provisos.\u201d\n\nBriefing journalists shortly after plenary, the House spokesman, Hon. Benjamin Kalu, said the bill would be transmitted to Buhari within seven days and hopefully he would look at it as quickly as possible.\n\nThe speaker said though the lawmakers included the consensus option, it did not mean political godfathers would seat in a room, prepare a list and call it consensus. He added that anyone who went against the provisions, as stipulated in the bill, could be taken to court.\n\nKalu said, \u201cIt\u2019s not the way it used to be before, that political godfathers will sit in a room and then prepare a list and call it consensus. That\u2019s not in the script of this particular section.\n\n\u201cSo, if you prepare a list and you\u2019re not able to give an evidence of a written withdrawal by those who are aspiring, who have now agreed for one candidate to go, you have gone against the spirit of this particular provision. In that extent one can approach the court.\u201d\n\nThe House spokesman said in preparing the new version of the electoral bill, \u201cWe are not doing anybody\u2019s bidding, we are partners in nation-building. It needs partnership, synergy.\u201d\n\nHe said good ideas for nation building could come from any of the arms of government.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we are concerned about,\u201d he stated, adding, \u201cIn it all what we have done are consultations, we have been consulting with Nigerians and Nigerians are saying give us the full option; we have to do that.\n\n\u201cNigerians should be happy that the options have conditions and those conditions will tailor the options to the ethos of democracy.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Seeks 18 months suspension, to send PIA amendment to N\u2019Assembly\n\n\u2022 FG says decision has nothing to do with 2023 elections\n\n\u2022IMF insists on end, wants funds channeled to health, social devt\n\n\u2022 NLC: Why we suspended nationwide protest\n\n\u2022LCCI calls for phased implementation, NACCIMA seeks wider consultation\n\nDeji Elumoye, Onyebuchi Ezigbo, Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja and Nume Ekeghe and Dike Onwuamaeze in Lagos\n\nThe federal government finally failed in its efforts to remove the highly contentious subsidy on petrol yesterday when it disclosed plan to recommend an 18-month extension of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) to the National Assembly.\n\nThis clearly means that the burden of the policy which has been described as a major drain and waste of resources would be shifted to the next administration from May 29, 2023, if the National Assembly approves an extension of the PIA\u2019s implementation.\n\nThe government\u2019s inability to take the tough decision on the subsidy issue is bound to have massive consequence on the overall implementation of the PIA.\n\nThe implementation of the PIA which stipulates the removal of petrol subsidy ought to be in February 2022 and was later shifted to July 2022. However, due to pressure and threats of protests by the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and the Trade Union Congress (TUC), the decision was on Monday suspended.\n\nSpeaking with journalists in Abuja, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, who spoke after a closed-door meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari, said the president graciously okayed the suspension of the removal of fuel subsidy until further notice.\n\nBut the International Monetary Fund (IMF) yesterday reiterated the need for Nigeria to remove subsidies on petrol and channel such funds to health, social development and other critical sectors of the economy.\n\nThe Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) also announced the suspension of its nationwide protest.\n\nThis was just as the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) has advised the federal government to adopt a phased removal approach to the dilemma it was facing over the subsidy issue and the Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA) called for wider consultation on the matter.\n\nAccording to Sylva, the executive would propose 18 months extension to National Assembly for the implementation of the PIA.\n\nOn the possible legal implications after the assent to the PIA by President Buhari, Sylva said: \u201cWe also see the legal implications. There is six months provision in the PIA which will expire in February and that is why we are coming out to say that before the expiration of this time, as I said earlier, we will engage the legislature.\n\n\u201cWe believe that this will go to the legislature, we are applying for some amendment of the law so that we would still be within the law.\n\n\u201cWe are proposing an 18 months extension but what the National Assembly is going to approve is up to them. We would approve an 18 months extension and then it is up to the national Assembly to look at it and pass the amendment as they see it.\n\n\u201cWe are going to see how to rejig the law, this is not going to be the only amendment to the PIA. A few months ago, the President already proposed an amendment to the law. Mr. President already proposed some amendment.\n\n\u201cNow we are going to propose this amendment. There might be other amendments that will be proposed because that is the way the law is; we will continue to adjust it as we see fit, as we operate it.\u201d\n\nThe minister explained that the suspension of the subsidy removal was to give all stakeholders time to ensure that the implementation was carried out in a manner that guarantees that all necessary modalities are in place to cushion the effect of the planned removal.\n\nThe modalities, he said, included getting the refineries to work, introducing an alternate fuel for cars in form of auto gas and possible palliatives for Nigerians.\n\n\u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari has agreed to an extension of the statutory period for the implementation of the removal of subsidy on petrol in accordance with extant laws.\n\n\u201cHowever, following extensive consultations with all key stakeholders within and outside the government, it has been agreed that the implementation period for the removal of the subsidy should be extended.\n\n\u201cThis extension will give all the stakeholders time to ensure that the implementation is carried out in a manner that guarantees that all necessary modalities are in place to cushion the effect of the petrol subsidy removal in line with prevailing economic realities.\u2019\n\n\u201cAll those structures are not right now in place. One of those is to ensure that the refineries are working and you\u2019re all aware that steps are being taken for all the refineries to be functional very soon. The Dangote Refinery is expected to come on stream at the end of this year.\n\n\u201cAll our refineries, the Port Harcourt Refinery is expected to be performing at a certain capacity, not full capacity, by end of this year. There are some modular refineries that are also going to come on steam later this year.\n\n\u201cOf course, you\u2019re also aware that the rehabilitation of the refineries are ongoing, I already said that. Dangote Refinery is already on, we are hoping that by the end of this year, the refineries will be functional, at least to a great extent, not necessarily the nameplate capacity, Port Harcourt Refineries especially, will be producing. We are also expecting that Dangote Refinery will also have come on stream,\u201d he explained.\n\nSpeaking further he said: \u201cAlso, there is discussion of introducing an alternate fuel for cars in the form of auto gas and somebody asked, what has happened since launching. A lot has gone on there, in fact, even today, if you had noticed, I briefed Mr. President on the progress that has been made on auto gas. We are hoping that in March or April, the conversion processes will begin.\n\n\u201cWe promised that one million cars will be converted initially, and of course, the corresponding amount of gas filling stations will also be built. That is in progress and I want to assure you that it will happen very soon. That also has to be in place before we say okay, we want to take out subsidies.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also looking at palliatives. The Minister of Finance and her team are looking at possible palliatives for Nigerians as well. So, because all these have to converge before we announce the complete removal of subsidy, because Mr. President, especially wants us to ensure that this doesn\u2019t have too much impact on the people, we are now extending the time for subsidy removal.\n\n\u201cI will not want to specifically mention the time of extension because that will be a product of a discussion with the National Assembly, because it is likely to involve an amendment of the PIA to extend extended time and I always do not want to preempt what timeframe the National Assembly will allow. But definitely at this moment, fuel subsidy removal is not on the card.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the likely effect of the subsidy removal on livelihoods of the poor, the Minister said: \u201cThe President assures that his administration will continue to put in place all necessary measures to protect the livelihoods of all Nigerians, especially the most vulnerable.\u2019\u2019\n\nOn queues at petrol stations that had resurfaced, he advised Nigerians to stop hoarding fuel nor engage in panic buying as government has no plans remove subsidy, Sylva said: \u201cWe don\u2019t intend to remove subsidy now. That is why we are making this announcement.\u201d\n\nAsked if the suspension has anything to do with 2023 general elections, he said: \u201cOf course not. It\u2019s just the human face of the government, Mr. President especially wants certain structures to in place. And he insisted if we want to remove subsidy, we must make sure that we put every measure in place to protect the suffering masses of Nigeria. That is the President\u2019s insistence. So we are now taking steps to ensure that these processes are in place.\u201d\n\nThe minister also assured that government would continue to engage the labour unions on the fuel subsidy issue saying, \u201cwe are already talking with labour, and our discussion with labour is also around this palliatives and mitigations.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cEngagement with labour, of course, this will continue. This is an ongoing process; we want to start. We\u2019ve been engaging labour for a long time, if you are aware and that engagement will be ongoing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a development process and maybe by July 2022, we\u2019ll be able to get back to you and give you additional developments from here.\n\n\u201cSo all these will have to come together. That\u2019s why we decided at this time, especially since we are running against time, with the legal timeframe approaching very quickly, we thought we should come to you and let you know that we are taking steps to amend the law and to ensure that we are within the law.\u201d\n\nOn the possibility of gradual increase in fuel price the, Sylva said: \u201cGradual or increment in whatever guise is not on the table.\u201d\n\nA THISDAY\u2019s analysis of documents from the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) showed that between January and December 2021, the federal government spent over N1.43 trillion on what it terms under-recovery on petrol.\n\nA breakdown of the various payments last year, indicated that the subsidy burden has increased progressively, growing from N24.3 billion in February 2021, to N60.3 billion in March and N61.9 billion in April this year.\n\nFurthermore, in May, the NNPC removed N126 billion as subsidy, while June came next with N164.3 billion. In July, the analysis showed that N103.2 billion was spent on under-recovery.\n\nHitherto, August had last year\u2019s lion\u2019s share of N173.1 billion, but was overtaken by the deduction in November of N200 billion, while September\u2019s deduction stood at N149.28 billion and the October figure was N163.709 billion, before the highest deductible amount yet of N270 billion in December.\n\nNigeria has not been able to reap the full benefits of rising international oil prices, which is now about $88 per barrel because it doesn\u2019t refine a drop of the fuel it consumes locally.\n\n\u201cOur refineries, the Port Harcourt refinery, is expected to be performing at a certain capacity, not full capacity by the end of this year. There are some modular refineries that are also going to come on stream later this year,\u201d Sylva stated.\n\nIMF Urges Nigeria to Remove Subsidy, Channel Funds to Health, Social Devt\n\nThe IMF has stressed the need for Nigeria to remove petrol subsidy and channel such funds to the health and social development sectors.\n\nThe Washington-based institution gave the advice in response to a THISDAY question during a media briefing on its latest World Economic Outlook (WEO).\n\nThe IMF however left its 2022 economic growth projection for Nigeria at 2.7 per cent, but raised the country\u2019s 2023 growth projection from 2.6 per cent to 2.7 per cent, which represented a 0.1 percentage points increase.\n\nThe Division Chief, Research Department, IMF, Mr. Malhar Nabar, said: \u201cIn terms of subsidy, we have for long not just for Nigeria, but for many low-income countries that have these programme of subsidy schemes in place, called for scaling back of poorly targeted subsidies to create fiscal space that can then be repurposed for meeting vital health and social spending needs. That recommendation applies in the case of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on Nigeria\u2019s growth projection, he said: \u201cWe have an unchanged growth projection for Nigeria for 2022 and this reflects offsetting effects that we had a slightly stronger outcome in the second half of last year, especially in the non-oil sector and this this momentum is expected to continue into 2022.\n\n\u201cBut now with the external headwinds with the impacts of Omicron, we do expect some drag going forward which will counterbalance a strong momentum going into this year.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, he noted that Nigeria\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio was low which if properly harnessed could put the country on a path to sustainable recovery.\n\nNabar added: \u201cIn terms of the debt situation, among low-income countries, Nigeria in terms of its public debt to GDP ratio, is actually relatively on the low side compared to other low-income countries.\n\n\u201cSo, going forward, that is certainly providing a little bit more space to provide the needed support for combating the health emergency and also putting Nigeria on the path to a sustainable recovery.\u201d\n\nNLC: Why We Suspended Protest\n\nThe labour movement said it\u2019s decision to suspend the protest was based on the policy reversal by the government which was formally communicated to it on Monday.\n\nAddressing journalists shortly after a virtual National Executive Council (NEC) meeting of the NLC yesterday, its President, Mr. Ayuba Wabba said: \u201cNEC after vigorous debates took a decision to suspend the planned nationwide protest scheduled for 27\u2033 January 2022 and the national protest scheduled for 2\u2033 February 2022.\u201d\n\nHe said NEC met Tuesday morning virtually to consider the new position of the government and that at the end of the meeting, it resolved to suspend the protest and to direct the state chapters and all affiliates to discontinue mobilisation for the protest.\n\nHe said: \u201cAt the peak of very rigorous mobilisation of Nigerians by the NLC and a host of her civil society allies, the government through the Minister of Finance yesterday, 24\u201d January 2022 made a public announcement reversing the plans to increase petrol pump price.\n\n\u201cThe position of the government was also officially communicated to the Congress with calls for further engagement. Following the reversal and reapproach by government, the National Executive Council of the Nigeria Labour Congress met this morning virtually to consider the new position of the government.\u201d\n\nWabba said going forward, labour would continue to engage with the government on the very critical issues of ensuring local refining of petroleum, creation of sustainable jobs and affordable price of petrol for Nigerian workers and people.\n\nWhen asked about the steps labour would take to ensure that federal government does not renege on its pledge to shelve the policy on removal of fuel subsidy, Wabba said organised labour has a traditional of holding authorities accountable to their words, adding that NLC and its allies would use all instruments available to them to ensure that no policy measure that is injurious to workers and their families is allowed to go unchallenged.\n\nLCCI Calls for Phased Removal of Fuel Subsidy\n\nThe LCCI urged the government to do all it could to avoid truncating the implementation of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), which it said has suffered a flip-flop as some of its provisions are being suspended.\n\nThe Director General of the LCCI, Dr. Chinyere Almona, who expressed the chamber\u2019s reaction yesterday in a statement titled: \u201cLCCI Statement on the Suspension of Fuel Subsidy Removal,\u201d said: \u201cIn the face of this dilemma, we recommend that the removal is phased and with a complement of heavy investment in critical infrastructure that supports production in the economy. More production means more job creation, poverty reduction, and improved economic growth.\n\n\u201cThe federal government must consider doing all that is possible not to truncate the implementation of the PIA 2021, which has already brought so much hope for industry watchers as a big game-changer for the oil and gas sector.\n\n\u201cThere is a need for stakeholders\u2019 consultations on addressing the implications of lapsed provisions of the Act and forging the way ahead towards the full implementation of the PIA.\u201d\n\nAlmona pointed out that the major implication of the suspension was that it would increase the 2022 national budget\u2019s deficit by N1.5 trillion and constrain the federal government to borrow more than it has projected within the fiscal year.\n\nShe said: \u201cWith a monthly payment of about N250 billion to subsidise fuel consumption, the implication is that an additional N1.5 trillion expenditure has to be provided for in the 2022 federal budget.\n\n\u201cWith additional expenditure against the projected revenue, deficit financing will be needed to support the budget expenditure. We are likely to see government borrow more than projected to finance the bloated expenditure in the face of revenue mobilization challenge.\u201d\n\nThe LCCI stated that while it supported the full implementation of the PIA and the total deregulation of the oil and gas sector, \u201cwe are not insensitive to the plight of the masses that may feel the pains of some of the provisions like the removal of fuel subsidies.\u201d\n\nNACCIMA Calls for Wider Consultation\n\nNACCIMA has described the federal government\u2019s suspension of the implementation of fuel subsidy removal as a welcomed development, adding that it was not surprised by the development.\n\nIt said: \u201cWe acknowledge government\u2019s dilemma and difficulties for an enduring solution to the issue of removal of petroleum subsidy especially the prices of PMS. This decision to move the date and suspend subsidy removal beyond June is therefore not surprising. It appears as kicking the can down the road again. It is a welcome development.\n\n\u201cOn one hand is the issue of problem of relieving itself of the onerous burden of a burgeoning petrol subsidy. On the other hand, is how to come up with commensurate benefits to cushion the effect of removal of subsidy on the people or economy at large.\u201d\n\nThe Director General of NACCIMA, Ambassador Ayo Olukanni, said yesterday that, \u201cit is absolutely necessary to consider a practical and acceptable implementation plan in the quest to gradually weaning the public off petrol subsidy and cushion the impact with appropriate palliatives.\n\n\u201cThis can only be done in consultation with organised labour and other stakeholders including the private sector.

          "text": "\u2022Launches national policy on 5th generation tech for digital economy\n\n\u2022Allays safety concerns\n\nDeji Elumoye\n\n\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday launched the national policy on 5G for Nigeria\u2019s digital economy, with a clear directive to all the security agencies to immediately leverage the technology to enhance security in the country when it has been deployed.\n\nThe president who spoke at the State House, Abuja, said the federal government would take full advantage of the opportunities that 5G provides for the economy, security and well-being of the nation.\n\n\u201dIt will also support security institutions with real time communication. 5G technology is significantly faster than earlier digital technologies and it provides near real-time communication. This can play a key role in boosting our efforts towards enhancing security across the nation.\n\n\u201dIt will enable our security institutions to effectively deploy robotics, autonomous vehicles, augmented and virtual reality to address any security challenges that we face,\u201d he said at the launch of the policy, which was presented and approved at the Federal Executive Council meeting on September 8, 2021, following a robust debate.\n\nPresident Buhari also allayed fears over health safety of 5G, affirming that such issues had been, \u201deffectively addressed\u201d in developing a policy that suits the country.\n\nCommenting on the benefits of 5G technologies, the president stressed that it would support virtually every sector of the economy, including enhanced connectivity, improved healthcare, support for education while fostering smart cities, and boosting agriculture, among other advantages.\n\nThe president explained that the National 5G Policy includes a deployment plan to ensure that major cities across the country benefit from the technologies.\n\nAccording to him, the policy, which was in line with the commitment of this administration to support the digital economy, \u201cas an enabler for the diversification of our national economy, also seeks to make 5G a major driver of the economy, a catalyst for smart cities in the country and a platform for the creation of jobs that support digital economy.\u201d\n\nHe, therefore, assured investors that the federal government would continue to provide an enabling environment for their businesses to be very successful as Nigeria begins the roll-out of the technology.\n\nBuhari directed the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Prof. Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami, to supervise the implementation of the Policy, being done by the Nigerian Communications Commission, with the support of other government institutions.\n\nThe president also gave a rundown of how his administration had created an enabling environment for investments to thrive in Nigeria\u2019s digital economy.\n\nHe recalled that the journey to the launch of the 5G National policy started with the launch of the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy in November 2019, as well as the launch of a number of policies to strengthen the digital economy, including the Nigerian National Broadband Plan and the National Policy for the Promotion of Indigenous Content in the Nigerian Telecommunications Sector.\n\nBuhari noted that under his watch the agreement of the National Economic Council to peg the cost of the Right of Way at N145 per linear metre which was made in 2013, was only implemented in late 2019, after the intervention of the federal government.\n\nAccording to the President, the Information and Communications Technology sector played a prime role in enabling Nigeria\u2019s economy to swiftly exit the recession that was triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201dThe GDP Report of the National Bureau of Statistics showed that the ICT sector was the fastest growing sector in the fourth quarter of 2020 and entire year 2020, recording double-digit growth rates of 14.70 per cent and 12.90 per cent respectively.\n\n\u201dThe sector also recorded a 17.92 per cent contribution to our GDP in the second quarter of last year- this was its highest ever contribution. All these impressive and significant achievements have justified our efforts to support the growth of our digital economy,\u201d he added.\n\nDescribing the process of developing the National 5G Policy as painstaking, inclusive and focused, Buhari recalled that 5G trials commenced in some selected locations in November 2019.\n\n\u201dMulti-sectoral stakeholders then deliberated on the report of the trials to ensure that health, security and other concerns were effectively addressed in developing a policy that suits our country.\n\n\u201dThe National 5G Policy will position Nigeria to harness the potentials of 5G technologies to further develop the economy and improve the indices of well-being in the nation,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier in his speech, the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy affirmed that the sector recorded unprecedented achievements with increased remittances to the Federation Account, resolution of lingering issues in the industry and successful auctioning of the 3.5 gigahertz (GHz) spectrum for the deployment of 5G technology.\n\nPantami thanked the president for the consistent support to the sector, announcing that within two years, the federal government completed 1,667 ICT related projects.\n\nAccording to him: \u201dAs at August 2021, the sector remitted over N1 trillion to the Federation Account and this is unprecedented because the usual remittances is around 200 billion annually and this has been increased substantially.\u201d\n\nOn the spectrum auction for the 5G, he explained that from the reserve price of N75 billion per spectrum, each spectrum was assigned to the winners at the price of over N250 billion per spectrum.\n\nThe minister expressed confidence that given the experiences from other countries and available research, Nigeria would derive maximum benefits from the deployment of 5G technology.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says Nigeria not exposed to effects of US policy normalisation, others\n\n\u2022Banking industry NPLs drop 4.85%, lowest in 10 years\n\n\u2022Warns against patronage of loan sharks\n\nJames Emejo\n\nThe Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, yesterday said the apex bank would not raise interest rate following the policy normalisation being undertaken by some advanced economies such as the United States and the European Union.\n\nThe CBN governor said Nigeria did not benefit from those funds which were released into advanced economies during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic in which some found their way into emerging markets.\n\nOrdinarily, such policy normalisation should be of great concern to the Nigerian economy as it would have led to huge foreign exchange (forex) outflows with dire consequence on the economy.\n\nBut, Emefiele, while reacting to the development after the two-day meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), the first in 2022, further allayed concerns that the monetary authority might possibly react by raising interest rates as well.\n\nThis came as the apex bank after its meeting, resolved to leave all monetary policy parameters unchanged in a bid to support the recovery and growth of the economy.\n\nThe CBN left the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR), otherwise known as the interest rate unchanged at 11.5 per cent with the asymmetric corridor of +100/-700 basis points around the MPR.\n\nThe MPR is the rate at which the CBN lends to commercial banks and often determines the cost of borrowing in the economy.\n\nThe MPC also voted to maintain the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) at 27.5 per cent as well as the Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent.\n\nEmefiele, who read the committee\u2019s communiqu\u00e9, further disclosed that the banking industry Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) had reduced to about 4.85 per cent in December, the lowest in about 10 years.\n\nAlso, the CBN governor said Nigerian have no business patronising money lenders otherwise known as loan sharks, adding that the CBN had put in place measures aimed at ensuring that people easily accessed loans from commercial banks without having to influence anybody.\n\nHe was reacting to the alleged excesses on the part of loan sharks in recent times.\n\nIn November 2021, the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) had announced that it was partnering the CBN, and other anti-graft agencies to address multiple potentially dubious conducts of certain money lenders who charge extremely high rates of interest, typically under illegal conditions.\n\nEmefiele, however, vowed to deal ruthlessly with the money lenders if caught, stressing that most operated within rural communities.\n\nNonetheless, the MPC had noted with concern, the slight increase in headline inflation (year-on-year) to 15.63 per cent in December 2021, from 15.40 per cent in November, following seven consecutive months of decline.\n\nHe pointed out that the unexpected increase was attributed to both the food and core components, which rose to 17.37 and 13.87 per cent in December 2021 from 17.21 and 13.85 per cent in November, respectively.\n\nThe committee, however, expressed confidence in the CBN\u2019s sustained intervention programmes, noting that inflation would continue to abate as food supply improves as the seasonal drive in price development associated with the December festive period was largely contributory to the marginal increase in price levels, and as such, believed that the episode of increase may be temporary.\n\nThe committee accessed the balance of risks confronting the domestic economy in the near term as they impact output growth and price stability and noted the unrelenting effort by the monetary and fiscal authorities in mitigating the impact of the virus on the economy.\n\nIt observed the continued moderate recovery of the domestic economy but requires further concerted policy effort by both the monetary and fiscal authorities to improve the momentum and strengthen the recovery.\n\nOn the pandemic, the MPC reviewed its continued impact on the domestic economy as members collectively agreed that the downside risks were still hindering the recovery. In this light, it commended the efforts of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 for procuring vaccines and continuing the drive to ensure that most Nigerians are fully vaccinated.\n\nOn price development, the MPC continued to express concerns about the impact of insecurity in farming communities on food inflation, pointing out that whereas headline inflation had been moderating for several months, its recent uptick was associated with increased demand during the festive season.\n\nIt therefore believed that prices would return to the downward trajectory given the Bank\u2019s ongoing interventions in the agriculture sector.\n\nThe committee applauded efforts of the CBN with the recent launch of the rice pyramids, noting that efforts to increase food supply and stem food inflation were in the right direction.\n\nThe MPC, however, reiterated the key role of the federal government in providing the necessary security around the country, and particularly in the farming communities, to ensure that farmers and their produce remain safe, and food supply is both boosted and uninterrupted.\n\nAlso, members noted the ongoing debate around the removal of fuel subsidy and suggested a robust engagement with relevant groups in the country, and afterward follow a stepwise and gradual approach, to ensure its moderate impact on cost of transportation and energy for individual, households and firms.\n\nAccording to Emefiele, committee also noted the need to encourage the take-off of private refineries across the country to provide alternative competitive local supply source and reduce the need for government intervention to manage fuel prices for domestic consumption.\n\nIt called for the speedy conclusion of the government gas-powered vehicle conversion scheme and other alternative sources of fuel.\n\nMoreover, the committee noted the rising government debt profile and the concentration of the funding sources and its implications for fiscal sustainability and macroeconomic stability, including its impact on financial system performance and growth.\n\nThe MPC urged the government on the need to harness other sources of revenue to reduce its dependence on oil as a single revenue source. In addition, it reiterated the need for government to seek alternative, more viable, and efficient infrastructure financing sources, in order to ease its expenditure burden.\n\nOn exchange rate, the committee applauded the CBN\u2019s efforts at maintaining stability over the short term with increasing demand as the economy continues to reopen.\n\nMembers of the MPC noted the dwindling proceeds from oil sale, despite rising crude oil prices and stressed the need to address the persistent reduction in remittance of oil revenue to the Consolidated Revenue Fund and urging the NNPC to urgently address this anomaly.\n\nThey added that the improved forex supply would thus support the Bank\u2019s demand management strategy in the foreign exchange market and consolidate macroeconomic performance, especially those that promote export, reduce dependence on import and reduce foreign exchange demand pressure.\n\nThe MPC welcomed the improvement in foreign capital inflow through diaspora remittances and urged the Bank to further extend the incentive scope to attract more remittances to official channels.\n\nThe CBN called on the fiscal authorities to take advantage of InfraCorp, the private sector driven infrastructural vehicle and transfer viable infrastructure projects for consideration by the corporation, saying it would ease pressure on the government.\n\nThe committee further commended the CBN\u2019s efforts in ensuring the continued downward trend of NPLs, signifying improving conditions in the banking system and emphasized the need for the bank to closely monitor developments in the sector and swiftly respond to any emerging challenges.\n\nOn the decision to hold all policy parameters constant, Emefiele said the committee decided to tow the path after a careful balancing of the benefits and downsides of each policy option.\n\nHe said the MPC decided to hold all policy parameters constant, believing that a hold stance would enable the continued permeation of current policy measures in supporting the recorded growth recovery and further boost production and productivity, which would ultimately rein-in inflation in the short to medium term.\n\nHowever, commenting on the potential threats which policy normalisation posed to the country, the CBN governor said, \u201cIt is true normalisation will naturally lead to capital flow reversal particularly for the emerging market and developing economies. Some of those funds that were released into the advanced economies during the period of COVID-19, some of them actually flowed into the emerging markets to boost foreign exchange liquidity in the emerging market.\n\n\u201cBut let me say whether you call it fortunately or unfortunately, but I will rather use the word fortunately for Nigeria, when those flows were moving to emerging markets at the time the advanced economies were offering stimulus into their economies, those flows didn\u2019t come into Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cAnd indeed, about two years ago, what we have been doing is to see to the gradual, systematic and orderly exit of foreign portfolio investors out of the country because they feel that yields are not as high as they expect and they also expect that there should be some more hedging instruments to protect them in case they want to go out.\n\n\u201cYou all recall that in the last two years, the MPC adopted a policy of price and monetary stability that is conducive to growth. And if we are talking about price and monetary stability as position of MPC that is conducive to growth, it necessarily means that the CBN had to adopt a somewhat policy of accommodation that brings interest rates to a low level, that would attract borrowers or people who have projects to embark on projects and that\u2019s the reason you would have seen that we have aggressively in the last two years seen an increase in loans whether to households or small businesses, to large companies at no more than nine per cent and for 10 years.\u201d\n\nHe said the objective was to boost manufacturing and agricultural output, pointing out that this had been instrumental in reversing the country out of recession and increasing output growth.\n\nEmefiele added that the CBN had also tried everything possible to moderate inflation.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhat am I saying in essence? The funds that would be leaving as a result of policy normalisation from the advanced economies didn\u2019t come to Nigeria and so as they withdraw them, there is nothing to withdraw out of Nigeria because we are not part of that game. So I\u2019d like to assure us that it is not affecting us.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, what caused the policy normalisation in advanced economies is because of rising inflation. And I must say that it is the truth that inflation has attained an unprecedented level in these economies \u2013 United States of America, Europe \u2013 and I will read some for instance.\n\n\u201cThe US inflation attained 7.08 per cent and this seems to be the highest since 1982, unprecedented. The UK inflation attained 4.2 per cent which is the highest since 2010. In the EU area, inflation attained 5.5 per cent and it is the worse since the European Central Bank and the Euro was created.\n\n\u201cSo you would imagine that if these are the unprecedented levels of inflation in these economies, they don\u2019t have a choice but to really think of how to aggressively rein in inflation because of the liquidity supply they see in their environment and the need to rein in prices to level that is acceptable because most of those governments are already facing a threat of even losing their next elections as a result of rising prices and inflation.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cBut for us in Nigeria, like I read, our challenge is not just inflation but also growth. And this is a policy we\u2019ve been adopting in the last two years. And if we feel this policy is working well, there is no reason for MPC to begin to contemplate a policy of tightening because we see that we are somewhat moderately tightening the liquidity system through our administrative controls using CRR discretionary powers that we have.\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s the reason the MPC feels that we will continue to do what we are doing now because we believe it is giving us the results that we expect and let not forget that as a result of these policies we have adopted that price and stability have contributed to growth.\n\n\u201cWe saw a reversal from recession after two quarters; as a result of the policy stance we have adopted, price stability contributes to growth, we saw inflation moderating consecutively from seven to eight months until we saw inflation uptick in December 2021.\n\n\u201cSo MPC thinks what happened in December is temporary but there is a need for us to look at it again and monitor it because we saw in December 2021 both the core and the food trending upwards.\n\n\u201cWe would have expected that even food should still be trending downwards but of course we are looking at it and we think that it could be reversed because the harvest for 2021 as very good. But we have noticed a few challenges that we will address over time.\u201d\n\nEmefiele added that, \u201cThere is nothing to worry because those countries that are raising rates or even if there are some emerging countries that are following them by raising rates, those economies are indeed facing pressures because they will if they are not already, facing capital flow reversals in their economies.\n\n\u201cSo we are not in that game and that is why we are not following them in that direction. We want to remain where we are right now \u2013 hold, watch because we believe what we are doing is working well.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The family of late Chief MKO Abiola has tackled a former Head of State, General Abdulsalami Abubakar (rtd), over his claims on the death of the acclaimed winner of the 1993 presidential election.\n\nAbdulsalami had in an interview with Daily Trust claimed that Abiola was not killed; and he only died after falling ill, contrary to the popular reports that he was poisoned.\n\nAbdulsalami Abubakar\n\nJamiu, one of the children of Abiola, said the former head of state denied their father proper medical attention, hence his death.\n\nWhile expressing disappointment over the retired military leader\u2019s claims, Jamiu said, \u201cThis incident happened over 24 years ago. Gen Abdulsalami is much older. I used to think that age would come with more honesty, but this is obviously not the case here.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe (Abdulsalami) said that unlike late Gen Sani Abacha, he made arrangements for the family of my father to see him. Can anyone first of all ask him why it took almost a month for any family member to see him? Other political prisoners were being released all along but yet a visit was too much to ask for.\n\n\u201cWhen we speak of death, one can be liable in two ways. If you kill a person directly like in the case of my mother who, as you know, was shot by Sergeant Rogers acting on behalf of the then military government. Or if you kill someone indirectly by allowing the person to die as in the case of my father during Gen Abdulsalami.\u201d\n\nIt would be recalled that Kudirat, one of the wives of late Abiola, was killed on June 4, 1996, by assassins suspected to be military.\n\nJamiu further said, \u201cTrying to pin down my father\u2019s death on poison would be a waste of time since there was an autopsy report and it did not state poison as the cause of his death even though there is still a possibility.\n\n\u201cBut my father did have heart problems and the head of state knew that. The general public knew. Even those who saw him the night before his death said he was not well; so why was he not given proper medical attention?\u201d\n\nReacting to Gen Abdulsalami\u2019s statement that God\u2019s guidance helped him to handle the tense situation in the country at that time, he said, \u201cGod provides guidance to those who seek it, but those who do not will be guided by the devil. In this case, the general was not being guided by God\u2019s guidance.\n\n\u201cIf he was being guided by God, why did he allow the then UN Secretary General, Kofi Anan, to see my father before any family member? Did my father even know who Kofi Anan was?\n\n\u201cMy mother had been murdered in cold blood; would it not have been the priority of a head of state being guided by God to allow her children see their father after such a tragic loss? We were never allowed to see him.\n\n\u201cGen Abdulsalami was more interested in getting diplomats to talk to my father and persuade him to relinquish his mandate so that he (Abdulsalami) could enjoy a more legitimate stay in power.\n\n\u201cThis world might be a circus to the former head of state, but let\u2019s see what the hereafter has in store for him.\u201d",

          "title": "Uber's bike-hailing service makes it way to Ibadan as competition heats up",
          "text": "Most motorcycle ride-hailing startups setting up in Nigeria have historically started from Lagos, the country\u2019s most populated city and its centre of economic activity. That was until February 2020, however, when a ban on motorcycles and tricycles by the Lagos State government put several companies out of business, forcing most players to find other uses for their fleet of motorcycles or seek new cities for operation in the country.\n\nAttention has since turned to other parts of the country as viable markets for bike-hailing services with Ibadan, one of Nigeria\u2019s largest cities with close proximity to Lagos, being the first choice. On Monday, Uber Nigeria announced its two-wheeler service, UberMoto, will commence operations in the city, where it started ride-hailing operations last October.\n\nIn a statement, Uber Nigeria\u2019s country head, Tope Akinwumi, explained that UberMoto is an expansion of the company\u2019s service to offer mobility solutions in Ibadan through motorbikes, known as Okada in the local dialect. Uber charges motorcyclists on its platform a service fee of 3% per trip with a minimum fare set at \u20a6100 ($0.24) for riders.\n\nThe new service is a \u201clow-cost alternative for city people looking to negotiate traffic more quickly and efficiently,\u201d a statement from the company reads. \u201cIt makes sense for us to develop a product that will help passengers get to their destination faster, which is where we can leverage our technology,\u201d Akinwumi said.\n\nUber began operations in Lagos in 2014 and after two years expanded its services to Abuja, Nigeria\u2019s capital. In 2019, it launched in Benin City, the capital of Edo State. It currently operates in more than five Nigerian cities, in which the company has launched a series of products, from UberX to UberConnect.\n\nThe American mobility giant\u2019s entry into the okada market marks yet another product expansion in Nigeria. Uber may be a market leader in the countries it operates but in Ibadan, stiff competition already awaits. Its city of choice puts Uber at loggerheads with other two-wheeler ride-hailing startups currently operating in one of Nigeria\u2019s largest cities by geographical area, chiefly among them SafeBoda.\n\nWhereas players like Opera\u2019s ORide, Gokada, and MAX.ng launched their motorcycle hailing businesses in Lagos, SafeBoda\u2019s expansion to Nigeria from Uganda kicked off in Ibadan back in December 2019, a decision that drew criticism initially but later proved to be an act of genius when okadas were eventually banned in Lagos.\n\nBabajide Duroshola, the startup\u2019s manager for Nigeria, who was hired to launch in the country, told Rest of World that it became apparent a few months into the job that Lagos was not a viable location for the company. While other players in the country struggled and had to alter their primary business model after the Lagos motorcycle ban, SafeBoda thrived in Ibadan.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nSafeBoda is one of the most active bike-hailing players in sub-Saharan Africa and claims to hold more than 80% market share in Uganda and Nigeria. In Ibadan, it had over 2,500 drivers and 40,000 customers as of May 2021. A month earlier, the company said it had completed 1 million rides in the city within a year and two months of operation.\n\nUganda\u2014SafeBoda\u2019s first market\u2014was the initial African country where Uber and Bolt decided to launch their bike-hailing service, uberBODA and Bolt boda. But in spite of the popularity and financial muscle of these companies, they\u2019ve been unable to significantly eat into SafeBoda\u2019s market share.\n\nAccording to Alastair Sussock, co-CEO of SafeBoda, as cited by TechCrunch, the company was recording about 80,000 completed rides a day in Kampala as of May 2021 while Uber and Bolt barely completed 10,000 rides in the country.\n\nGokada, ORide and MaxNG are also players in Ibadan. The former, a popular name in the last-mile logistics space in Nigeria, revived its e-hailing business in Oyo and Ogun states after the Lagos ban. The battle promises to be interesting as Uber enters the fray but will the company be able to compete with SafeBoda and others to capture on-demand mobility market share in the city?\n\n\u201cWe know that we face significant competition across local transportation modes in Africa,\u201d Akinwumi told TechCabal in an emailed response, adding that \u201cwe believe competition makes us better, which improves the service for riders and earners alike.\u201d\n\nCompared to Kampala, things may yet play out differently in Ibadan between Uber and SafeBoda, despite the latter being an already established player there. Also, the race for market share would most likely hinge on whichever player can offer drivers the best terms and riders superior user experience at affordable rates.\n\nSo far, Uber appears to be doing better by those parameters, according to an Ibadan-based user of both UberMoto and SafeBoda, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\n\u201cA \u20a6300 ($0.72) trip on SafeBoda could go for around \u20a6200 ($0.48) on UberMoto. But I think Uber is still significantly cheaper because the service is new,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been using SafeBoda since March 2021 but now, getting matched with drivers is becoming more difficult. Drivers are also often rude, some even start trips without picking me up and there is no way to report issues in-app.\u201d\n\nMoreover, in spite of the presence of several players, there is still ample space for Uber\u2019s bike-hailing business in Ibadan, a city covering a total area of 3,080 square kilometres, home to over 6 million residents with a strong motorcycle transport culture but has only an estimated 80,000 active okadas.\n\nIn addition to a large population and a motorcycle culture, regulatory certainty is another reason bike-hailing startups prefer Ibadan. In Oyo state, conversations about regulating the mobility sector have been simple. Governor Seyi Makinde, in April, gave an assurance that his administration does not plan to ban the operations of motorbikes in the state.\n\nStill, startups should be cautious of regulatory risk, a major problem that\u2019s historically hindered ease of doing business in Nigeria. When quizzed on this, Akinwumi noted that Uber will continue to \u201cactively work with regulators to ensure we comply with the requirements set out by the government in each city we operate in.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "In 2019, a few months after the African Continental Free Trade Area Agreement (AfCFTA) was signed, some African tech and creative industry players were hosted by CcHUB in Kigali, Rwanda, to discuss how the tech and creative ecosystem could leverage the newly signed agreement.\n\nIn that room, among 80 participants from 30 countries, was Tola Onayemi, a young lawyer who was in the middle of everything. Onayemi was the assistant chief negotiator and head of trade remedies at the Nigerian Office for Trade Negotiations. So, at the time of the meeting, he was at the forefront\u2014leading the technical negotiations of the AfCFTA on behalf of Nigeria.\n\nAt the core of the discussion was trade facilitation issues and everybody in the room, big and important in their own right, knew Onayemi as the go-to kid for the subject matter; he was the exact intersection between tech, law, and trade\u2014the three parts that form a successful cross-border business.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nHaving drafted the Nigerian Ease of Doing Business Policy and advised the Nigerian vice president on industry, trade, and investment before moving to lead the AfCFTA, Onayemi had an idea what the continent needed\u2014Africa had to be a \u201ccountry\u201d to win in the global market.\n\nAfter the Kigali meet-up, COVID-19 hit and the momentum died down. But around late 2020 when countries began to ease the lockdown and open their borders, founders began to reach out to Onayemi to help them in their expansion efforts. He handled a couple of these as ad-hoc services and then began to see his idea of \u201cCountry Africa\u201d unfolding like a morning flower\u2014slow but significant.\n\n\u201cPeople would reach out to me and say, \u2018You\u2019re a lawyer and you are also knowledgeable about trade and tech; you\u2019re the perfect advisor and middle person to help us get into any market.\u2019 So I helped them expand,\u201d Onayemi told TechCabal. \u201cAnd then over time, I just realised there\u2019s something here. So, I started discussing it with Tope Obanla, my co-founder, to see if there\u2019s something here we could build.\u201d\n\nFast forward to June 2021, Onayemi and Obanla were finally ready to roll Africa into a country with their tradetech startup Norebase, a one-stop-shop digital platform for African businesses to expand, file trademarks and patent an Intellectual property (IP) across the continent.\n\nTola Onayemi, co-founder and CEO at Norebase. Image credit: Terna Iwar\n\nThe startup handles everything it takes for a business to launch in a new African country. It\u2019s a 360 degree business launchpad: business registrations, opening of business bank accounts, compliances, license acquisition, and further legal requirements\u2014all from one dashboard.\n\nExpansion across Africa can be tedious. Even though there are similar problems across the continent\u2019s countries, there are just too many impediments that frustrate the process. There are issues of legal frameworks, language barriers, smug policies, cultural disparities, and other nuances.\n\nAlthough most of these impediments can\u2019t be erased overnight, Norebase is building a node that at least takes the burden of scaling these brickwalls off the shoulders of business owners.\n\nAt the core, the company is helping African companies expand, but as they take on more businesses they realise they need to do more than just help companies to start in a new market.\n\n\u201cNow, we don\u2019t just want to help businesses launch in a new market; we want to also help them operate and scale across Africa quickly and safely without experiencing all the fractions of doing so,\u201d said Onayemi, who was also the founding legal partner at Future Africa, an Africa-focused early-stage venture fund.\n\nEssentially, Norebase wants to be the partner a business would need to operate in a new African market. All it takes are a few clicks away.\n\nOnayemi believes expansion for most African businesses isn\u2019t a want but a need. Most African countries don\u2019t really have a population size that has the disposable income to fuel a unicorn or a wildly successful business. Hence the expansion into more markets.\n\nTola Onayemi by Terna Iwar\n\n\u201cYou have to be in several markets because there\u2019s a disposable income gap in most markets. In Nigeria, for instance, after you do Lagos, Abuja, and Port-Harcourt, you are kind of stuck thinking of the next place to find your audience. What happens if you can\u2019t find it? Then you\u2019ll start looking into Accra or Nairobi.\u201d\n\nOnayemi also thinks African businesses need to expand to reduce their vulnerability and derisk against unfavourable regulations that may throw them off course. \u201cIt\u2019s a survival strategy and a way to edge against unfavourable markets. For instance, what happens when Nigeria says no more cryptocurrency or motorcycles?\u201d\n\nBig companies that have expanded into different markets have in-house expansion teams and keep their learnings private. This means that other companies, especially smaller startups that are operating on a lean budget, would have to go through the same mistakes before getting it right. Norebase is solving the problem of trial and error due to the information silo.\n\nLike every other company playing in the African market, Norebase has both online and offline solutions. Its online expansion solution covers Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa and Kenya. In addition to these four countries, its offline offer is extended to Senegal, Egypt, Rwanda, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, and more. Onayemi said, while you can only access their expansion offering to select counties for now, you can file trademark and IP across the 55 countries in Africa.\n\nThe company makes money by charging a base fee, depending on the country of expansion. Onayemi said they are constantly making price savings for their customers. As a venture-backed impact company, Norebase\u2019s objective is to first ensure that businesses get into new markets.\n\n\u201cWhat you see happening is that we\u2019re actually constantly pushing down prices so, for instance, our price for Kenya between March and December last year was cut by almost 70%.\u201d\n\nOnayemi said the goal of their pricing strategy is to get to a point where incorporating in any African country will only cost $500. The startup has helped companies like Patricia and Brass, among others, to expand into new markets.\n\nNorebase is tackling a big problem involving multiple government bureaucracies and it wishes to create an environment where founders aren\u2019t restricted to their native countries. Imagine a Kenyan choosing to build in Egypt and the other way round without bothering about running into walls. If AfCFTA wants to create a single African market, think of Norebase as a tool that will power its efficiency. Onayemi believes this will encourage African governments to create policies that support their local businesses.\n\nFor Norbase, the ambition is big and almost sounds impossible because of the precedence set by the present intra-African business and information exchange. But the startup is filled with relentless individuals with an unmatched focus to make this work.\n\n\u201cIn order to accomplish our audacious target, we\u2019re keen on building a culture that attracts talents from the biggest companies in the world,\u201d Onayemi said. \u201cWe hire people with a leadership mindset. People who are founders in their own right.\u201d\n\nAccording to Onayemi, he and his team are building the most significant company in Africa, and when they succeed, the whole African tech and business ecosystem wins. Besides him being a trade leader, his co-founder is an ex-Goldman Sachs associate and a senior engineer at Microsoft.\n\nIn conclusion, even though he didn\u2019t specifically say what they are, Onayemi hinted that the company is launching new products that will \u201cchange the game\u201d, especially fintech startups. The phrase \u201cchange the game\u201d sounds like a founder pitching investors, but it\u2019s Onayemi and his antecedent is enough to take him to be serious and anticipate these products.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Tesla\u2019s African expansion is imminent but is it reasonable to drive one in Lagos?",
          "text": "Every time a picture of an electric vehicle being driven on African soil shows up on social media, a popular recurring sarcastic comment from many Nigerians is that electric cars generally shouldn\u2019t be used on the continent yet.\n\nThis belief was evident in the responses to a recent picture of a Tesla being towed off Lagos\u2019s Third Mainland Bridge. The popular speculation was that the car ran out of power\u2014since, unlike its fossil fuel-powered sibling, it can\u2019t simply be refuelled. Contrary to these speculations, the real cause was a tire blowout.\n\nGranted these remarks hold some merit as many African countries do not have the supporting infrastructure, and very few electric cars are sold in Africa. Tesla, the most renowned electric vehicle (EV) brand globally, sells its vehicles in about 40 countries across 5 continents, except Africa and Antarctica. Other big players in the EV space adopt a similar approach.\n\nBut there are signs this will be changing soon. In November 2020, Hyundai unveiled its first Nigerian electric car named Hyundai Kona. Tesla made its first move on the African continent in October 2021 by installing 4150 kW Supercharging stations at the Tangier Al Houara Hilton Resort and the Onomo Hotel in Casablanca, Morocco. In South Africa, tech company Rubicon recently became the official Tesla partner in the country. The agreement currently only covers the company selling Tesla charging infrastructure.\n\nBased on precedents, establishing charging networks is usually the first step Tesla takes before directly selling cars into a market, setting up showrooms and rolling out service centres. The use of charging stations gives a sense of the general demand for Tesla cars.\n\nTesla, which is currently the market leader, sold almost a million electric cars in 2021. But competition in the EV space is heating up as veteran carmakers, General Motors and Volkswagen, both sold over 200,000 EVs each last year. 118-year-old Ford last year entered the EV race with a rather ambitious target of producing 600,000 EVs by the end of 2023. Rivian\u2014at 9 years\u2014also joined in the race with a market cap of $94 billion, despite having not sold a single car yet.\n\nAnswering the big question\n\nWhile all these moves hint that the expansion of electric car companies to Africa is inevitable, it doesn\u2019t answer the question on many people\u2019s minds: Can electric cars thrive on the African continent?\n\nAlkesh Thavrani, Chief Business Development Officer at fintech startup Bitsika, who owns and drives a Tesla model X around Lagos and neighbouring cities, believes his experience is a testament that electric cars can thrive in Africa.\n\nThavrani\u2019s Tesla Model X, which costs $90,000, was bought in 2019. The addition of shipping and customs fees (about 70% of the value of the car) brought the cost to about $150,000. The car came with a charger (220-volt outlet adapter) and additionally purchased a home wall charger which cost about $500\u2013600.\n\nA front view of the Tesla Model X with one set of doors opened\n\nThavrani drives the Tesla to his office and other functions during the week and typically returns to full charge overnight.\n\n\u201cYou plug it in at night and by morning you have a full battery, just like you do to your phone,\u201d Oluwatobi Ismail, a Nigerian automotive engineer who runs Smile motors which services the Tesla, said.\n\nBreaking down the charging speed and capacity of the different chargers, he explained that the level one, which is the slowest taking from 18\u201340 hours to charge to full capacity when empty, provides about 120 volts. The next is the level two, which provides between 208-240 volts, restoring an empty battery life to full in about 8 hours. The fastest is the level three (supercharger) which handles 400 to 900 volts and charges the battery to full capacity in about 30 minutes.\n\nThe car charging port\n\nThe Tesla wall Connector installed in Thavrani\u2019s house\n\nBattery life and mileage of the car\n\n\u201cAt full charge, the car can go about 500 km,\u201d Ismail said. It\u2019s slightly less if the air conditioner/heater is used. For context, a trip from Lagos to Ibadan is about 125km. This means the Tesla Model X can complete a round trip on one full charge. He points out that there\u2019s also a mobile charger that can be taken around in the car in case plans change.\n\nNigerian roads are notorious for traffic jams, so what happens when the car is stuck in traffic? Fortunately, Tesla cars are equipped with regenerative braking, a feature that uses the excess energy produced by a moving vehicle to charge the batteries, thus slowing down the car. Depending on the speed at which the vehicle moves, it can gain back as high as 80% of the energy generated via regenerative braking.\n\nWhat happens when the battery reaches zero? It\u2019s possible that the car will still drive for a few more kilometers. Different Tesla car owners have reported driving about 16-32km at 0% before their cars come to a final halt\u2014Tesla strongly advises against doing this.\n\nThis is possible because just like your smartphone, battery life percentage is an estimation of how much battery is left based on the rate at which the voltage is discharged\u2014the pressure of voltage output is strong when the battery is full and weaker when it\u2019s low. In addition, there are other factors that influence the estimate, this explains why your phone sometimes lasts longer on 1%.\n\n\u201cTo put things in perspective, driving from Yaba to Ikoyi is less than 15km. Now with all these in place, you have to be reckless to be stranded due to no battery power,\u201d Ismail said.\n\nCost charging and maintenance\n\nThe maximum household rate of power in Lagos is about \u20a632/kWh according to Ikeja distribution company. To estimate how much it costs to charge a Tesla Model X\u2019s battery, we multiply it by the size of the battery: 100 KW. This means the cost of charging the battery fully is \u20a63,200 (~$6). This can take the car for a week or two or even a month depending on your driving habits. For Thavrani, when he\u2019s not travelling long distances, he can go a week or two without needing to charge the car\n\nHow does this stack up against a fossil fuel-powered car?\n\n\u201cNow if you\u2019re driving a similar fossil fuel-powered car as thirsty as this, you\u2019ll be spending at least \u20a615,000 per week on fuel. The tires will wear out faster because it\u2019ll be heavier than this and your car won\u2019t be as fast as this,\u201d Ismail said.\n\nIn terms of maintenance, what Ismail has mostly done is inspection so far. \u201cWe typically just check the air filters, oil, and shock absorbers. We haven\u2019t had to replace anything apart from tires.\u201d\n\nNotably, the car doesn\u2019t come with spare tires, which Babatunde claims is a common trend in many other new cars. The cost of replacing the Tesla\u2019s tire (20-inch rims) is about \u20a6110,000 (~$200) for each tire.\n\nWhen I asked if that wasn\u2019t too expensive, Ismail insisted he thinks it\u2019s fair. He recently bought a tire for \u20a6330,000 (~$600) for an SUV. \u201cThese days I don\u2019t think any tire would cost less than \u20a620,000 (~$36.4) and that\u2019s a cheap brand,\u201d he said.\n\nTobi Ismail driving the Telsa\n\nDealing with accidents and bad roads\n\nAnyone who drives in Lagos knows that it\u2019s nearly impossible to not be hit and scratched by other cars. In the case of Thavrani\u2019s Tesla, most of the incidents have been scratches and dents, which are fixed all at once after they pile up.\n\nMany Lagos roads are notorious for being in bad conditions but Thavrani has found a way to navigate through these bad roads. How? By cleverly adjusting the ride height of the car, a feature that allows the driver to increase or reduce the height of the car from the floor. Bad roads also mean that he\u2019s not able to use the auto-pilot feature except on roads with clearly defined lanes like the Third mainland bridge or Bourdillon, Ikoyi.\n\nAbout a year ago, there was a major incident that affected the car suspension\u2014the system of tires, tire air, springs, shock absorbers and linkages that connects a vehicle to its wheels and allow relative motion between the two. How easy was that to fix?\n\n\u201cFixing is straightforward but we don\u2019t have Tesla parts in Ladipo market [a popular market for buying vehicle parts in Lagos] so we had to order parts from Tesla US,\u201d Ismail said. The process of ordering could often be a hassle, he added.\n\nCompared to a similar fossil fuel car, Babatunde believes it\u2019s cheaper to maintain a Tesla.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say it\u2019s cheaper to maintain. For a car like this that costs about $90,000, we\u2019d change oil at least two times because it\u2019ll have a V8 engine, each time will cost \u20a650,000 (~$90). You\u2019ll change transmission fluid every 2,000km, along the way you\u2019ll have to change the valves and water pump.\u201d\n\nAnother thing that counts in favour of the Tesla is that it has fewer moving parts (about 150 parts) compared to a fossil fuel-powered car which has 30,000 parts if you count all parts down to the nuts and bolts. If you consider large parts such as the engine as one part, it comes down to about 1,800 separate parts.\n\nThe trunk of the Tesla Model X is used as storage space because it doesn\u2019t have an internal combustion engine.\n\n\u201cIn a regular car\u2019s engine you have about 200 moving parts, so if you take this out because it doesn\u2019t exist in a Tesla, that\u2019s 200 less things that can break. When you look at your automatic transmission, that\u2019s another 800 less things that can break. So you\u2019ve reduced your problems by like 1,000,\u201d Ismail said.\n\nWhen I asked him between the Tesla (Electric Vehicles) and fossil fuel-powered cars, which would he recommend, with a straight face before bursting into laughter, he said, \u201cBased on my profession I\u2019ll recommend fossil fuel-powered cars because there are more things to fix and I have to eat.\u201d\n\nA general source of concern for many people about electric cars is the credibility of the technology supporting electric cars, as they aren\u2019t familiar with it. Ismail thinks the technology is nothing new.\n\n\u201cThis technology has been around for a long time. It\u2019s been tried, tested and trusted,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same technology you have in your hybrid vehicles. Those cars have been around since 2005. They\u2019ve worked so well that\u2019s why they\u2019ve been able to be upgraded into fully electric vehicles. All they\u2019ve done is make the battery bigger.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Ismael Belkhayat on his way to building Morocco's first unicorn",
          "text": "Last November, during the Ironman marathon race in Turkey, Ismael Belkhayat\u2014just a few steps to the finish line\u2014excitedly took a minute to kiss his family, then, joyously sang and danced through the finish line.\n\nIronman is one curious endurance competition: there\u2019s no award for finishing ahead of others; everybody who finishes is recognised as a winner. For Belkhayat, who has since adopted Ironman as his alias, competing at the sport can be likened to building a business. It takes guts, grit, and, most importantly, making strategic decisions on how to ration your strengths.\n\nBelkhayat is not an athlete. He only heard about the race a few months before it commenced and decided to participate; that\u2019s all that mattered to him\u2014knowing what you want and going out to get it.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThis was the attitude that inspired him, 8 years ago, to quit his strategy consulting job at Boston Consulting Group (BCG) to become a tech entrepreneur\u2014something he knew little or nothing about.\n\nThree startups later, this shy kid from the streets of Casablanca has not only become one of Morocco\u2019s most revered entrepreneurs but also a notable name in the North African tech ecosystem.\n\nTen years ago, running the Ironman race or founding a startup wouldn\u2019t have crossed Belkhayat\u2019s mind. He was just another man who was going to follow the conventional playbook of life: go to school, finish with good grades, get a well-paying job, and start a family. Even though he\u2019s always had a sharp mind, he never thought he could be the outlier he is today.\n\nThe birth of a serial founder\n\n\u201cI was 27 years old and it felt like I\u2019d been snoozing all my life. I woke up from my slumber when the guys at BCG told me I\u2019d have to work another 10 years to become a partner,\u201d Belkhayat told TechCabal.\n\nBelkhayat grew up in Morocco, where he had his early education before moving to Paris on a state-sponsored education trip when he was 17. After graduating from the university prep school in Paris, he won a scholarship from the Moroccan government that helped him through his education at Cornell University in the US. He then joined BCG\u2019s Paris office and was later transferred to Morocco to help set up the company\u2019s practice in the Maghreb country.\n\nAfter working for BCG for over 4 years, that 10 years time frame given by his senior colleagues jolted him into finding a new meaning to life and his career, so he turned to tech entrepreneurship. The same year he left BCG, he founded VotreChauffeur, a ride-hailing startup operating in Casablanca and a few other Moroccan cities.\n\nThe startup quickly became a household name in the country and, after about four years, was acquired for an undisclosed amount by Avis Car Rental. Belkhayat continues to serve as a board member in the company.\n\nOne thing Belkhayat prides himself in is the ability to quickly focus on the next important thing rather than wallow in the glory or loss of the past. While still running his first startup, he founded another one, Sarouty, a marketplace that facilitates real estate deals in Morocco. Sarouty helps people to discover, buy or rent land and houses across Morocco.\n\nBelkhayat\u2019s core mantra is to grow as fast as possible and overwhelm the competition between the first 2 years in business. So, like his first business, Sarouty quickly became the leading real estate platform in the country. It partnered with PropertyFinder Group, a Dubai-based multinational proptech startup, to scale its tech and expand to more cities. Due to the potential of the business, PropertyFinder opted for acquisition instead of partnership and named Sarouty as its Moroccan operation. Belkhayat then exited to act in the capacity of board member.\n\nWhat\u2019s next after two exits?\n\nThe next idea came during a trip; Belkhayat had chosen to accompany his wife Sophia Alj, ex-strategy consultant at McKinsey, during a business trip. Alj was going to travel across Africa\u2014South Africa, Nigeria, Egypt, Ivory Coast, etc.\u2014to help in the digital transformation of some FMCGs in these countries.\n\nSophia Alj and Ismael Belkhayat, Chari\u2019s co-founders\n\nDuring the trip, Ironman and his wife noticed one common thing across these countries: their mom-and-pop shops struggled to access FMCG products. But what was more fascinating was the rise of an entirely new tech sector building to solve this particular problem at scale.\n\n\u201cWe heard about TradeDepot in Nigeria, Sokowatch in Kenya, and MaxAB in Egypt. And we just thought maybe we could do the same in Morocco,\u201d said Belkhayat.\n\nThe idea stuck and, upon returning to the North-African country, the duo started looking into the local informal retail market. With Alj\u2019s experience in helping FMCGs go digital and Belkhayat\u2019s previous experience in logistics and marketplace, it didn\u2019t take long to figure out the basic things needed to start their next venture.\n\nIn 2020, the couple co-founded Chari, a B2B e-commerce platform for informal retailers in Morocco. They now intend to expand into more French-speaking African countries.\n\nChari and its journey to dominance\n\nChari is currently present in Morocco and Tunisia and has earmarked francophone countries like Senegal, Ivory Coast, Togo, and Mauritania for expansion in the coming years. The startup took part in the Y Combinator\u2019s 2020 Summer batch and raised over $5 million in seed funding last year, despite how difficult it is to raise foreign investment in the region.\n\nLast year the company launched a fintech product to solve a recurring problem merchants faced. Due to the cash-based culture in Morocco, most merchants keep their inventory and sales records with pen and paper; this meant Chari, likewise, was constrained to receiving payments in cash and upon delivery.\n\nIt also meant that Chari was exposed to the insecurity of the cash-based model and that its purpose of digitising the value chain was somehow defeated. The solution? Build a digital payment network. And that is what the startup decided to do.\n\nChari\u2019s warehouse\n\nTo accomplish this, Chari made 3 acquisitions last year, one of them being Karny.ma, a bookkeeping startup that helps over 40,000 stores manage credit arrangements with customers. This acquisition gave Chari access to data on how grocery stores extend credit to their customers. This data, according to Belkhayat, would direct how Chari would structure its buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) services to them.\n\nOn Thursday, the startup announced that it has closed a bridge round led by Saudi-based venture capital fund Khwarizmi Ventures (KV), AirAngels (Airbnb alumni Investors), and Afri Mobility, the venture capital arm of AKWA Group.\n\nBelkhayat said the money will be used to test their BNPL services, and upon successful results, Chari will acquire a local credit company that will enable shop owners to lend money to their end users.\n\nAccording to Belkhayat, Chari currently transacts about $2.5 million monthly. The company has signed over 15,000 merchants with almost half of the number using the platform daily. (There are about 200,000 grocery stores in Morocco.)\n\nGrowing 20% month-on-month, Chari now cumulatively and actively serves over 50,000 users, and its recent raise caps the startup at $100 million.\n\nBelkhayat the strategist\n\nBased on lessons from his previous startups, Belkhayat carved a different operational strategy for Chari, a strategy that rounds up its liability to almost zero. Unlike other e-commerce businesses that own warehouses and logistic vehicles, Chari rents them and partners with truck owners.\n\nThis is how it works: Belkhayat says many vacant warehouses across Morocco can be rented on a per-metre-square basis for cheaper prices\u2014so why buy or build another one? Similarly, he sees no reason to buy delivery vehicles when several truck owners and drivers are looking for gigs.\n\nPrivate truck owners download the Chari app and receive orders every now and then, according to their location. They go to pick up the order and deliver the goods to the merchants. The app provides drivers with seamless road-mapping so they can deliver the goods on time.\n\nChari\u2019s only asset is its app that helps merchants place orders and match drivers for delivery. The stored goods, which could become a liability should there be damages, are insured.\n\nA group of Chari dispatchers\n\nAs much as Belkhayat believes in incentivising users, he also believes in reversed incentives. This means that, if you can be rewarded for achieving something, the reverse should be the case for not meeting up.\n\nThis philosophy was imported from VoutreChaffeur where riders pay according to users\u2019 feedback. A driver pays less finder\u2019s fee when rated 4-5 stars after a trip and pays more if rated below that. At Chari, when a driver delivers successfully and on time, they receive a bonus but would lose money when it\u2019s otherwise.\n\nOn the surface, this might sound problematic, but Belkhayat believes that is the best strategy to ensure quality assurance and create a win-win situation for all stakeholders. Everybody\u2019s happiness is based on the drivers\u2019 service delivery. The drivers are incentivised by bonuses and then, reversely, by the thought of losing money. So far the company has recorded 96% on-time delivery.\n\nE-commerce in Morocco\n\nThe e-commerce space can be divided into 3 sectors. The first one is business-to-business (B2B) where Chari operates; the second is business-to-consumer (B2C); and the last one is quick commerce where deliveries are fulfilled between 10\u201315 minutes.\n\nB2B is a huge market today especially on the grocery side of things. The 200,000 grocery stores in Morocco currently order, on average, about $100,000 worth of goods per day. This puts the total addressable market for grocery products at about $7.3 billion. When you consider that this is excluding tobacco and electronics, it shows that the B2B e-commerce space is huge.\n\nChari\u2019s team at work\n\nMorocco\u2019s B2C sector already has a strong market leader, Jumia, that was reported to be holding about 95% of the market share. So, \u201cthere is no reason why you would move to the B2C space, which Jumia has dominated. However, quick commerce could be an opportunity for us,\u201d said Belkhayat\n\nQuick e-commerce platforms like Glovo, a Spanish swift-delivery startup, are already playing in this sector, and are partners with Chari. Belkhayat says Chari helps Glovo with supplying its dark stores in Morocco. That means Glovo buys from Chari to deliver to their end client.\n\nWith these moves, it\u2019s safe to say Chari is holding down the B2B sector of the Moroccan e-commerce sector and wishes to be an operating system for this sector.\n\nEven though Belkhayat is bullish on expanding in many African countries in the coming months, there are countries he won\u2019t go to.\n\n\u201cBesides the fact that we intend to operate in francophone countries, countries that have heavily funded startups\u2014like Nigeria\u2019s Alerzo and TradeDepot; Kenya\u2019s Sokowatch and MarketForce; and Egypt\u2019s maxAB that acquired a Moroccan competitor Waystocap\u2014aren\u2019t where we intend to play in,\u201d said Belkhayat, jokingly.\n\nThis playful comment explains Belkhayat\u2019s business philosophy: why should you move to become just one of them when you can actually be a king in your area? This might sound like cowardice, but it\u2019s actually about picking the battles you can win. On a more ambitious note, expanding into the francophone region is a plan to gain dominance.\n\n\u201cI know these guys won\u2019t go to the francophone region soon because they don\u2019t speak French, and even when they come, they will probably come in 5 years. In the meantime, Chari would have placed entrance barriers, and they would probably try to buy us out instead of competing and this could be a good exit strategy for us,\u201d Belkayat said, again, jokingly.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

Source: Instagram\n\nWhen foreigners speak or write about Africa, the entire continent is often grouped as one. With 54 countries at the moment, that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s easy to see why they could make that mistake. Eager to free the continent from colonial rule, leaders from several African colonies pushed for a united front, but that never happened.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven after independence, collaboration between African countries has been notoriously tricky such that one is better off travelling or conducting business with countries outside the continent than with those within.\n\nThe desire to collaborate across the continent has not faded, and a few policies have been drawn up to tackle this challenge. The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Agreement \u2014 has come very close to doing this, inspiring Tola Onayemi to build Norebase in the process.\n\nA lawyer, Onayemi\u2019s career has seen him work at the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and as a Technical Adviser to the Office of the Vice President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria on Industry, Trade & Investment.\n\nAs a Technical Adviser to the Nigerian Vice President, he led the negotiations for the AfCFTA agreement, getting familiar with the difficulties of starting and expanding businesses in Africa.

InstaDeep is now one of the few companies showing that Africans can build such companies.\n\nSpeaking to TechCrunch, Beguir said, \u201cWe\u2019ve managed to build a culture of high standards and prove that the talents in Africa are capable of being competitive, working and collaborating with the very best.\u201d\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading\n\nWhat is Financial Fair Play, and how does it work?

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy does a lawyer with a cushy government job decide to go into the stressful world of the startup founder?\n\nYour guess is as good as ours, and Techpoint Africa decided it was time to find some answers.\n\nIn 2015, after a stint in the Office of the Legal Adviser at the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, Tola Onayemi accepted the position of Technical Adviser to the Office of the Vice President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria on Industry, Trade & Investment.\n\nThis position led him to serve as Nigeria\u2019s Assistant Chief Trade Negotiator, where he led parts of the negotiations for the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Agreement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnayemi told us, \u201cThere had been a mandate to negotiate the AfCFTA, but no one had really used it; it had just existed. But given the late Ambassador Chiedu\u2019s [Osakwe] experience, Nigeria started centring the conversation, and in a year, Nigeria had pushed through the AfCFTA. And I worked on that.\u201d\n\nOn a clear, sunny day on July 7, 2019, Nigeria signed the AfCFTA in Niamey, Niger.\n\nFor members of Nigeria\u2019s tech community, signing the AfCFTA resulted in discussions on what it meant for them.\n\nIn August 2019, Onayemi was invited to Kigali to attend the creation of the Africa Technology and Creative Group (ATCG) by the Co-creation Hub (CcHub). Apart from his experience with negotiating the AfCFTA, he had previously advised his classmates who had gone into tech and other clients.\n\n\u201cWe had these very robust conversations, and we started thinking, what are the things that need to happen for tech to take strong advantage of the AfCFTA, and we came up with a bunch of ideas. One of the ideas was the cross-recognition of corporate documents.\n\n\u201cIs there a world where there can be a central registry where I can take my incorporation documents from Nigeria to South Africa, and they are recognised automatically, so I don\u2019t have to start the process all over again? Or how do we use hubs to create a support system of people trying to expand across the continent?\u201d\n\nThis was when the conversation to build Norebase started.\n\nEverything comes together neatly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTola Onayemi, Co founder: Norebase. Source: Instagram\n\nWhat happened between August 2019 and December 2020?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the most part, nothing. 2020 was the year of the pandemic, and with the coronavirus bringing nations and businesses to a standstill, Onayemi\u2019s ideas went on the back burner.\n\nBut, he soon became restless, and by December 2020, thoughts of helping to implement the AfCFTA had begun to fill his head once more. Like he told us, a policy without an implementation framework is akin to a joke.\n\nThe first challenge, however, was deciding what to do.\n\n\u201cThere were a bunch of options, but we wanted to identify something that we could build in the private sector to scale and work. And so we started bouncing a bunch of ideas around and one that kept resurfacing was this idea of a central digital platform that helps businesses to start, scale, and operate across Africa.\u201d\n\nAfter speaking to friends, his co-founder (Tope), and getting data from the data analytics company they hired, it became clear that there was something to build upon.\n\nFrom helping companies get incorporated, it became a platform to help businesses move past the incorporation stage and right into the thick of operations and expansion.\n\nInterestingly, Onayemi told Techpoint that things moved very fast from the very beginning with them already handling clients, even at the ideating and data-gathering stage.\n\n\u201cFor us, there were a bunch of validating signals. One of them was being able to build out a formidable team interested in African prosperity. It was like having customers who were all in. The entire team came together and said, there\u2019s a demand here, and we are building for it\n\n\u201cAnother was that the demand for this solution was high and would only increase. Every potential client we interacted with only validated this point. So, the real question was, what\u2019s the best model you use to build it in a way that makes it sustainable as a tech business?\u201d\n\nThe concept of Norebase\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Instagram\n\nTo help understand, Onayemi painted a picture comparing the US market and the African context.\n\n\u201cAs a businessperson based in the US, you can easily stay in San Francisco alone and build a unicorn. You can stay in one place and have access to lots of disposable income. With most African businesses, you would have to cherry-pick from 54 markets because the disposable income in individual African countries can be low.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, expansion is a survival issue for most African businesses. As of 2020, nine of the ten countries on the world\u2019s poorest countries list were African.\n\nEssentially, the total addressable market size is quite small, even for countries like Nigeria. Although Africa\u2019s projected population growth level is often touted as a blessing, there\u2019re still other attendant issues many developing countries face: poor infrastructure, bad governance, and bureaucracy, among others.\n\nHe also explains that in most of these countries, the problems startups face are pretty similar, with issues such as regulators moving \u201cinteresting\u201d, as he put it.\n\n\u201cThe effect being that businesses have to start their business registration process anew each time, which can be long and tedious. But the thing is, when people try to expand or even set up in their own markets, one of three things happen. Either they find out that registration is very expensive, or that it\u2019s very complicated to understand, or that there\u2019s a trust deficit.\n\n\u201cWhat Norebsase is doing for you is simple \u2014 we are providing you with the digital infrastructure for you to register, start, and scale your business in any African country. The idea is to build a digital infrastructure that ensures that anybody can actually just get into either their own market or another market without too much of a hassle.\u201d\n\nAt the core of this is the need for companies to focus on their business rather than be bogged down by the fine print and extraneous details.\n\n\u201cSo imagine a world where you had previously expanded to Ghana and now need to expand to South Africa, and it is achievable with just one click. In two minutes, you have started the process to have a company in South Africa! That\u2019s where we are going.\u201d\n\nDealing with African \u201canyhowness\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut how do you deal with similar yet different markets?\n\nOnayemi postulates a game theory where countries have to compete for startup attention.\n\n\u201cImagine a world where you say, I\u2019m in Nigeria, but I don\u2019t want to incorporate in Nigeria. I want to go to Kenya. What that does is, you create an incentive where countries now have to compete for who has the better environment.\u201d\n\nThe end goal, with the help of the AfCFTA as a cushion and pressure, is to make starting and scaling so easy that countries have no choice but to change. Some might call this audacious, especially considering the African context, but it would definitely be interesting to watch how this plays out.\n\nThere\u2019s also the fact that building for the African market is quite different in the sense of having to sometimes do everything yourself.\n\n\u201cIf you are building in the US, you can focus on a small facet of the need as others focus on complementary parts because it is a system that works. But what has been our experience so far is that we have to provide an end to end experience for our users as no one else is fulfilling the need. Our users that have registered in some countries still have to stall operations for varying reasons.\u201d\n\nHe also touched on a lawyer\u2019s usual gamble: understanding the rules so well that you find exceptions to them.\n\n\u201cSo the way we basically approach it in each country today is to say, \u2018What is the minimum rule in this country? What are the exceptions?\u2019 And then build around those to ensure that our users do not have to worry about the intricate details.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, he said that an often forgotten side-effect with the current mode of expansion is that helpful information is either lost or rarely available.\n\n\u201cOne big advantage is that we can aggregate learning. So, for instance, we can say, the biggest issue with expanding in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is xxx, and you can solve it and apply it to several people at once and then it\u2019s now a learning that you can apply at scale.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s see the numbers, though. Or maybe not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnayemi speaking at the SOAS Khartoum conference in 2019. Source: Instagram\n\nSo, how much does it cost to set up in different countries?\n\nWell, according to Onayemi, it depends on the market. Nigeria is pretty cheap, but countries like Ghana and Kenya are a bit steep, with C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire a bit higher.\n\nThe price also depends on what the customer wants.\n\n\u201cSo the way to think of it is that there\u2019s a basic business registration product, and there are a bunch of add-ons that you can also buy.\u201d\n\nHe also said that over time, they\u2019ve tried to introduce price reductions. Once they get a price cut, they implement it.\n\nWe can\u2019t tell you the price, though. You\u2019ll have to see for yourself.\n\nWhat we can tell you is what you get. In Kenya, for example, you get a company secretary that provides legal services to you for a year.

We get asked questions ranging from \u201cWhat is the best country to expand to?\u201d to \u201cHow do I know this country can afford my product?\u201d These questions, we believe, should be answered through market research, which is not a service we provide.\u201d\n\nBut there are also policy inconsistencies and trying to choose the best markets based on that. Onayemi, however, sees this as even more reason to expand \u201cand build antifragility into your business.\u201d\n\nHe also believes this would improve with time because the more options businesses have, the better choices they can make, creating a sort of competition to do better among them. In his words, essentially, countries would market themselves.\n\nFor him, the different cycles of how this would play out would start with people expanding to different markets (current situation), people staying in one market and then expanding into different markets, and, finally, Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs), where you have a company that\u2019s not registered in any African market, but with which you can do business in Africa.\n\n\u201cSomeone can say, \u2018Okay listen, I am a business incorporated in maybe the cloud or whatever it is, and I\u2019m supplying a Nigerian businessperson with a service.\u2019 It\u2019s not based in Nigeria; it\u2019s not based anywhere. That changes the entire dynamics of what businesses are or what companies can do.\u201d\n\nWhy DAOs? He believes that giving people the power to make decisions would ultimately lead to higher decision-making capabilities because there\u2019s no third party to make decisions for them. It forces people to scrutinise their decision-making.\n\n\u201cDo I think that there should be centralised regulations? Yes, but we need to strike a balance between how much we strip people of decision-making abilities and how much we just trust that they can make the best decisions for themselves.\u201d\n\nCurrently, Norebase is introducing new features like payment in local currencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

Besides heralding the beginning of app-based on-demand car-hailing in the country, it has witnessed the entrance of popular competitors like Estonia mobility startup, Bolt(formerly Taxify) and inDriver, including other local entrants; it also saw how Chinese-owned OPay gave the model a try with OCar, although it didn\u2019t scale.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWithin the same time, Uber has expanded into five states in the country. The latest is Ibadan and Portharcourt in October 2021. However, despite its slow but calculated expansion rate, it took Uber this long to bring any other vertical asides car-hailing into the country.\n\nMakes me wonder why. A possible reason is if the company planned to do something totally different? Come to think of it; the best time would have been when Lagos was still a hotspot for on-demand motorcycle services. But that would also mean partaking in the loss suffered following the Okada ban in February 2021.\n\nFour weeks ago, it was in the news that Uber partnered with Opibus to deploy 3000 electric motorcycles across the continent. Could this be the plan for Ibadan?\n\nFrom Uber\u2019s country manager, Tope Akinwumi\u2019s comment about the launch, the plan is to provide a cost-effective and quicker transportation option. But there was no mention of electric vehicles.\n\nAlthough UberMoto\u2019s model was not clearly stated, it is most likely going to run like Uber car service, where it taps into the current network of riders, screens and does background checks on interested riders before onboarding them.\n\nMy concerns: If the late-mover disadvantage exists, Uber might have to resort to giving heavy discounts to attract and retain customers, which might be unsustainable in the long run. While UberMoto would rest on Uber\u2019s image, which by the way, is pretty new to Ibadan, we can\u2019t say it will be Uber\u2019s top priority to make it work.\n\nFun fact: Thailand was UberMoto\u2019s first market in 2014. Sadly, this service was halted two years later due to government regulations. In 2018, it was Uganda\u2019s turn to have UberBoda, the first in Africa.\n\nIt\u2019s clearly too early to guess UberMoto\u2019s fate; after all, Ugandan SafeBoda seems to be having a relatively good run in the market. Only time will tell if this was a smart decision. What do you think?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading\n\nRecently, two crypto platforms planned to introduce some new features that caught my attention. It led me to read more about buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) in crypto and taxing crypto transactions.\n\nHow are your new year resolutions going?

          "title": "Nigeria faces higher budget deficit on revived subsidy",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Federal Government budget deficit in 2022, already tipped to top public estimates, will rise further with the revived petrol subsidy leaving Abuja with no choice but to borrow more.\n\nThe drain of the petrol subsidy on the cash-strapped government\u2019s earnings makes the economic case for the removal of the subsidy, but the government is set to maintain the wasteful practice for at least another 18 months when the current administration would have left office.\n\nThe financial burden of the subsidy is fuelling confusion among economists and business leaders who are at a loss on why the government is continuing with it.\n\nFor a start, the government will need to borrow more this year to pay for the subsidy initially planned to be phased out in July.\n\n\u201cWith additional expenditure against the projected revenue, deficit financing will be needed to support the subsidy budget expenditure,\u201d Nigeria\u2019s largest business think tank, the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), said on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe are likely to see the government borrow more than projected to finance the bloated expenditure in the face of revenue mobilisation challenge,\u201d LCCI\u2019s director-general, Chinyere Almona, said.\n\nNigeria is already faced with the risk of recording the biggest budget deficit in history this year if actual revenues continue at the run rate of the past five years, BusinessDay\u2019s analysis of budget implementation data shows.\n\nTaiwo Oyedele, fiscal policy partner/Africa tax leader at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), agrees that the plans to extend the subsidy regime beyond budget provision will put more strain on the government budget, which will, in turn, lead to increased borrowings.\n\nOyedele also notes that as the government seeks amendment of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) in order to sustain the subsidy, the activities of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), which according to the Act is expected to run commercially, may return to status quo, thereby undermining the benefits of deregulation.\n\n\u201cThe government had said the 2022 budget will only provide for subsidy till June and after that, there will be supplementary budget.\n\n\u201cSo that in itself means that we will put more strain on the government budget to fund the subsidy and we will have to borrow more, leading to an increased budget deficit and Nigerians are the ones to pay back all the borrowing,\u201d Oyedele says.\n\nIf the NNPC must run commercially, it can not take on the costs of subsidy, but with the government seeking an amendment, the law will be placed on hold and the state oil company\u2019s profitability will be constrained.\n\nThe 2022 budget targets revenue of N10.13 trillion and a deficit of N6.258 trillion.\n\nHowever, if actual revenues look anything like what they have consistently done in the past five years, which is 55 percent of the budget on average, then Nigeria could be left with only N5.57 trillion in revenues. That then leaves Abuja with a deficit of N10.82 trillion, the highest ever and equivalent to a full year\u2019s entire budget. The budget for 2020, for instance, was N10.8 trillion.\n\nThis means Abuja\u2019s insistence on selling petrol well below half of the actual market price means the budget deficit may hit N13.82 trillion by the end of 2022, according to estimates that factor in rising oil prices, official government\u2019s figures of N3 trillion yearly subsidy spend and the country\u2019s struggling revenue.\n\nThe global benchmark, Brent crude, has gained more than 25 percent to $88 in January, the highest since 2014.\n\nSome in the market now think it is now a question of when \u2014 not if \u2014 oil hits triple digits of $100 per barrel.\n\nHigher oil prices have been a double-edged sword for Nigeria, which higher oil revenue had been swallowed up by the actual cost of importing petroleum products.\n\nA document exclusively obtained by BusinessDay shows that Nigeria spent N270.83 billion to cater for the cost of petroleum shortfall in December 2021.\n\nThis was the highest cost for petrol shortfall in the year when oil prices averaged less than $80 per barrel.\n\nIn November and October, petrol subsidy payments stood at N131.4 billion and N163 billion, respectively, according to findings by BusinessDay.\n\nIn September, it was 149.28 billion. In August, the under-recovery cost of petrol was N173.13 billion. For July and June, it was N103.28 billion and N164.33 billion, respectively. In May, the cost amounted to N126.29 billion.\n\nAlso, in April, March, and February, the under-recovery of petrol amounted to N61.96 billion, N60.39 billion, and N25.37 billion, accordingly.\n\nIn January, there was no record for under-recovery.\n\nThe long-standing recommendations for subsidy removal, which had been echoed by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF), have fallen on deaf ears despite the government\u2019s initial stance to abolish the practice by mid-2022.\n\nOn Tuesday, Timipre Sylva, Nigeria\u2019s minister of state for petroleum resources, said the Federal Government was making plans to extend the subsidy removal implementation period by another 18 months.\n\nRead also: Politics trumps economics as Nigeria sticks with subsidy\n\nThe extension will give all stakeholders time to ensure that the implementation is carried out in a manner that ensures all necessary modalities are in place to cushion the effect of the PMS subsidy removal, in line with prevailing economic realities, he said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t intend to remove subsidies now. That is why I am making this announcement. We also see the legal implication. There is a six-month provision in the PIA that will expire in February, and that is why we are coming out to say that before the expiration of this time, as I said earlier, we will engage the legislature,\u201d Sylvia said at a press briefing on fuel subsidy organised by the Presidential Communication Team at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.\n\nAccording to Sylvia, \u201cWe are proposing an 18-months extension but what the National Assembly is going to approve is up to them. We would approve an 18-month extension and then it is up to the National Assembly to look at it and pass the amendment as they see it.\u201d\n\nLaoye Jaiyeola, CEO, Nigerian Economy Summit Group, a private-sector think tank, condemns the move to extend the fuel subsidy removal, stating that paying so much money to fund subsidy is not sustainable for the Nigerian economy.\n\nAccording to Jaiyeola, the extension will only pave way for more borrowings, as the provisions made in the current budget elapse by July.\n\n\u201cIt is bad that we have chosen to continue to spend on subsidy, it is not sustainable. The removal of fuel subsidy is long overdue, so the earlier we get the political will to dismantle it, the better for us,\u201d Jaiyeola says.\n\nThe fuel subsidy, conceived initially as a short-term support tool, has endured over time, thereby becoming a threat to fiscal sustainability, he notes.\n\n\u201cIn the last three decades, Nigeria has spent substantial government revenue on subsidies, which has become increasingly unsustainable,\u201d he states.\n\nNigeria\u2019s ever-rising fiscal deficit is yet another sign of the government\u2019s ailing finances and makes a mockery of Abuja\u2019s insistence to continue with a petrol subsidy that gulps north of a trillion naira per annum among other overly expensive ventures of a supposedly cash-strapped government.\n\nThe government has often resorted to borrowing to plug its fiscal deficit and the trend seems set to continue in 2022, even though the impact of the borrowings that have increased by over N20 trillion since 2015 has been negligible on an economy that has failed to grow in per capita terms since the same 2015.",

          "title": "How Nigeria failed to lead vaccine production in Africa",
          "text": "As countries that built capacity, particularly in drug/vaccine production, count gains and get recognition in finding solutions to the COVID-19 pandemic, Nigeria, said to be Africa\u2019s giant, is missing out on these benefits.\n\nWhen the World Trade Organisation (WTO) was searching for nations to create regional vaccine manufacturing hubs, Nigeria did not make the list, rather, it selected South Africa, Senegal, and Rwanda due to its existing local capacity.\n\nThe European Union (EU) also snubbed Nigeria in 2021 and considered Ghana as the hub for vaccine manufacturing due to the initiatives already taken by the government of Ghana towards the domestic manufacturing of vaccines. The EU intends to invest about $1.2 billion to build vaccine manufacturing hubs in Africa.\n\nAlready, South Africa\u2019s Aspen Pharmacare assembles the Johnson and Johnson (J&J) COVID-19 vaccine. The plant has a capacity of 220 million vaccines per year and is selling them in South Africa and to other African nations. This is in addition to the Biovac Institute in Cape Town, which works in partnership with Pfizer-BioNTech to produce 100 million of its vaccine doses annually.\n\nOnly recently, the founder of NantWorks, a multinational biotechnology firm, Patrick Soon-Shiong, launched a new vaccine manufacturing plant that is hoped to boost Africa\u2019s capacity to make vaccines and other pharmaceuticals. The new plant aims to reach a goal of producing 1 billion vaccines annually by 2025.\n\nWith the right partnerships, Nigeria has all it takes to lead in the production of vaccines in Africa, said Obi Adigwe, director-general, National Institute for Pharmaceutical Research and Development (NIPRD).\n\nAt the onset of the devastating COVID-19 pandemic, the Nigerian government had mouthed commitment to revamp vaccine and drug production after the devastating pandemic exposed the desperate need for a local facility for Africa\u2019s giant, which depends on imports for all its inoculations. But not much has been heard about those plans.\n\nNigeria has so far spent N122 billion to purchase 29 million doses of the J&J vaccines, making several experts argue that Nigeria could have prioritised finding a local solution or ramping up capacity so that the country can maximise the economics of the pandemic and count gains like other nations. Such investments experts say are both profitable and would enhance epidemic preparedness. Pharmaceutical giants are already raking in billions in profits and still counting.\n\nFor instance, BioNTech expects to make revenues of nearly \u20ac16 billion (\u00a313.5bn) from the vaccine this year, as its first-half net profit jumped to almost \u20ac4 billion from \u20ac142 million a year earlier.\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) has reiterated that vaccines remain the best bet in managing the pandemic, including the emergence of new Variants of Concerns, hence vaccines or efficacious drugs will continue to be in demand for as long as possible.\n\nSenegal is already building the first vaccine manufacturing hub in Africa with the capacity and equipment to produce COVID-19 and other vaccines.\n\nThe manufacturing hub is estimated to cost $200 million and will be financed in part by the EU and US government and institutions. The plant is expected to produce 25 million vaccine doses a month by the end of 2022, the European Commission said.\n\nMany are raising concerns that the Nigerian government has only focused on containing the pandemic, but care less about building the much-needed health system for resilience against even future pandemics.\n\n\u201cIf Nigeria matched its commitment with the desired action, Nigeria could have made appreciable progress even if not in mass vaccine production or sales. The country\u2019s pharmaceutical capacity to produce vaccines could have set Nigeria on the path of becoming a leading manufacturing giant,\u201d Adaobi Onyechi, a public health expert and virologist told BusinessDay.\n\nIn the 1990s, Nigeria produced much of the vaccines needed in the country and other nations in Africa. Those vaccines were produced at the Federal Vaccine Production Laboratory, Yaba in Lagos State \u2013 the first vaccine institute established in the country.\n\nThe Laboratory was created from what was left of the Rockefeller Yellow Fever Laboratory that had been in existence in Yaba, Lagos, since 1925. In the 1930s, it started to produce vaccines against smallpox, then rabies, yellow fever, for not only Nigeria but also neighbouring countries like Cameroon, Central Africa, and others on the continent.\n\nThis laboratory was said to have contributed tremendously to the elimination of smallpox from West Africa. Smallpox is the only human infectious disease to have been eradicated. Its eradication is a major historical triumph of global healthcare.\n\nBut it was shut down in 1991 by the government, which said it wanted to reactivate and upgrade the facility, which is yet to commence vaccine production three decades later.\n\nExperts believe Nigeria could have done the same. \u201cIf Nigeria had sustained the capacity, the country could have been a destination point for vaccine manufacturing hub and would have attracted the much-needed investment and partnership,\u201d Onyechi said.\n\nNigeria\u2019s preference for foreign solutions is also evident in the manner it handled the search for traditional alternatives. In 2020, the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) said the pandemic would lead to the emergence of indigenous pharmaceutical companies in the country and began screening local firms for the production of herbal drugs that could possibly treat or cure COVID-19. The agency received several applications from local practitioners.\n\nHowever, that process crawled. Zainab Shariff, director, Traditional Complementary and Alternative Medicine (TCAM), told BusinessDay that the Federal Government was simply not interested in finding local solutions, and thus shifted focus to what other countries were developing.\n\nRead also: What to know about billionaire opening vaccine plant in South Africa\n\nIn the same vein, the Nigerian government released N10 billion in 2020 for a vaccine production company. But, the Ministry of Health could not come up with a clear plan on how the fund would be utilised, which prompted the National Assembly to halt action on the use of the funds.\n\nWhen BusinessDay contacted the Ministry of Health on the fund, an official said the ministry was no longer in charge of the mandate for local vaccine production.\n\nThe government is in talks with the World Bank\u2019s private lending arm and other lenders to raise about N12.3 billion ($30m) to help finance a vaccine plant, three decades after the vaccine production facility was shut, he said.\n\nBiovaccines Nigeria Limited, which is 49 percent owned by the Nigerian government with the balance held by May & Baker Nigeria plc, is targeting to begin construction of the plant in the first quarter of this year. There are however lingering bottlenecks on agreements on intellectual property and technology transfer on COVID-19 manufacturing.\n\nIn addition to the missed vaccine opportunity, health analysts believe that Nigeria has not learned from the pandemic. \u201cGovernment relied on foreign countries to pursue her vaccination programme and did not build the much needed resilient health system. We did not leverage private sector support to expand funding support, remember during the pandemic private sector threw in support,\u201d Obinna Ebirim, national coordinator, New Incentives \u2013 ABAE Initiative said.\n\n\u201cWe missed the economics of the COVID-19 pandemic. Even smaller countries realised early and started producing medical supplies, commodities, tools and equipment. Welfare for health workers did not improve, human resources decreased,\u201d he said.\n\nOlufemi Babalola, president, Guild of Medical Director, said even the achievements touted by the Nigerian government in the areas of increased diagnostic, laboratory capacity as well as capacity for genomic sequencing were inadequate.\n\n\u201cWe still need to strengthen our genetic analysis capabilities which are still rather too narrow at the moment,\u201d he said.",

The fact that you are in government for a while does not mean that your activities while in government will not be looked at; you have to be very cautious of the decisions you make.\n\n\u201cMost Nigerians don\u2019t know that even after you retire, you are still liable and culpable for your activities during your time in office. I am pleased to inform you that you will be inheriting a vastly improved system of governance; we will continue to work on our systems so that you can deliver effectively to our people.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will continue to build human capacity, and train and retrain our civil and public servants. We are equipping and investing in the John Odigie-Oyegun Public Service Academy to make it second to none in this part of the world,\u201d the governor noted.\n\nOn the administration\u2019s plans to launch its e-governance platform, the governor stated: \u201cEffective February 1, 2022, I, the governor, would switch over to e-governance platform, which effectively means I will now approve memos and send mails to you via the e-platform.\n\n\u201cWe have introduced the Edo State Civil/Public Service Transformation and Enhancement Programme (EdoSTEP), through which we are pursuing a deliberate programme to identify weak points in the civil service and strengthen them.\n\n\u201cThat explains why we have had to bring people from outside to come in to help us strengthen the areas of weaknesses that we have seen in the civil and public service; we will continue to do so because we have seen that the civil service as it is today needs a lot of strengthening,\u201d he added.\n\nObaseki continued: \u201cSo far, we are very glad with the accomplishments that we have made today in the EdoSTEP programme. Under this programme, we have found out that the number of vacancies in the civil service is quite enormous.\n\n\u201cFirst, we started with the hiring of 1,600 graduates into the service at the bottom level, but they don\u2019t have the experience and skill to take us to where we want. We will now continue hiring from the top and also see how we can train the middle corps that we have in the civil service and give them the tools for effective delivery.\n\n\u201cWe are working extremely hard to bring back the civil and public service to those days when it was respected. To the new permanent secretaries, I will like to admonish you, you all have been appointed based on merit, not by any godfather.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not seek popularity; you are not politicians, leave that to us. Ensure you do things the way it ought to be done,\u201d he charged.\n\nThe newly sworn-in permanent secretaries include Mr. Anelu Osemen, Mrs. Felicia Edwards, Mrs. Grace Aihie, Mr. Egwakhide Gilbert, Mr. Iserhienrhien Efe and Mr. Aikhuomobhogbe Uidia.\n\nOthers are Mr. Asibor Lucky, Mrs. Igbinobaro Joy, Mr. Washington Abbe, Mr. Asemota Uyi, Mr. Toritseju Onaiwu, Mrs. Ifueko Alufokhai, Mr. Osikhena Ojior and Mrs. Barbara Osobajo.\n\nOsemen, on behalf of the new permanent secretaries, pledged to reciprocate the confidence reposed on them, contributing effectively to the progress and development of the state.\n\n...",

          "title": "Ogoni land: Effect of oil spill persists three decades on",
          "text": "By OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nThe wordings on a project signboard mounted by Nigeria\u2019s federal government at Kegbara Dere (K-Dere) community in Gokana local government area of Rivers State in 2016 to announce the official take off of Ogoni land clean up have faded, riddled with dust over time, and so has the hope of the community and indeed the entire Ogoni nation which must have swelled when the government first installed the signboard.\n\nEveryone has returned to default. The clean up campaign which formed part of the main planks of the President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s presidential campaign prior to 2015 election, and which was launched with fanfare in 2016, had been a charade, just another avenue, it seems, for the well connected to make money off the system.\n\n\u201cOur people are still suffering,\u201d said Mr. Barigboma Marshall Bie, an indegene of the community. \u201cThe government never did any clean up. All our agitations have been ignored. Our lands are polluted. Sometimes, oil would come out from the ground and destroy farmlands.\u201d\n\nOn August 7, 2017, Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, on behalf of President Buhari, launched a $1billion Ogoni land Clean-up and Restoration Programme, announcing that financial and legislative frameworks had been put in place to begin implementing recommendations made by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) after its report of 2011.\n\nBut walking through K-Dere last week, the only visible sign of clean up is the fading project signboard.\n\n\u201cThey just put the signboard there and left,\u201d said another resident who gave his name as Michael. \u201cSince then, we have not heard anything. I can confirm that there is no clean up anywhere. But I\u2019m also saying that if the government wants to do clean up, it should do proper clean up, not bringing sand to heap on the ground.\u201d\n\nOur roughly one hour journey to Ogoni from Port Harcourt where we had arrived from Lagos in the morning hours of Thursday, January 13, was seamless. Beyond Eleme, the road became smooth and even some of the inner community roads are well tarred.\n\nThe Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) started exploration in Ogoni land \u2013 a sparsely populated, vast landscape comprising of agrarian communities surrounded by green vegetation \u2013 in 1958, drilling a total of 96 wells to bring nine oil fields on-stream. By the end of 1992, Ogoni production was about 29, 000 barrels of oil a day, which at the time was about 3 percent of SPDC\u2019s total production\n\nBut the people, who had been mostly farmers and fishermen, would soon be jolted by what gradually became of their environment. Exploration gave rise to numerous problems such as gas flare, oil well-head blow-out, oil pipe leakage, crude oil spillages, manifold fires explosion and emission of offensive gases with adverse environmental consequences in the area.\n\nThis prompted a violent agitation led by the Movement for Survival of Ogoni People (MOSOP) then headed by the late Ken Saro-Wiwa in the early 90s, which finally brought exploration to a halt in 1993. SPDC stopped production in Ogoni land and withdrew from the area as the activities of MOSOP become more violent.\n\nAlthough Ogoni land continued to serve as a transit route for pipelines transporting both SPDC and third-party oil production from other areas. The violence, regardless, continued and in May 1994 four prominent Ogoni leaders were murdered by a mob. Saro-Wiwa and eight others, who came to known as the Ogoni Nine, were accused of complicity in the murders, tried by military tribunal in 1995 under General Sani Abacha, found guilty and executed, an event that generated global outrage.\n\nOvertime, the environment seemingly restored itself. Today, grasses have grown, the locals have cultivated their farms, planting mostly cassava and banana, and at first glance, the effect of oil exploration is hardly visible. The people went about their daily lives as in everywhere else, and little children probably fascinated by the sight of police officers, waved and screamed \u201cofficer!\u201d at our Hilux security escort as we drove around the communities.\n\nBut beneath the surface are lands ruined by oil. This became more visible as we made our journey deep into Gbeneol, to a site where there is an oil spill in Kegbara, an agrarian community with population of about 30,000 which had hosted over 80 percent of all SPDC\u2019s facilities in Bomu oil field, one of the largest manifold in Africa and over 40 oil wells.\n\nDeep into the interior areas, the effect of crude on farmlands became quite clear. Cassava stems had stunted growth and leaves looked yellowish.\n\n\u201cThese are all effects of oil,\u201d said Mr. Bie who had accepted to be our guide. \u201cYou can see that the grasses have dried up. Sometimes oil comes out from beneath the soil and pour into farmlands. When that happens, there will be no farming on the land for many years.\u201d\n\nAt the request of the then government of the late Umaru Musa Ya\u2019Adua, UNEP in 2009 began carrying out a thorough assessment on the impact of oil extraction in Ogoni land. The report found, among other things, that there had been severe and widespread contamination of soil and ground water across Ogoniland. According to it, in a number of locations public health was severely threatened by contaminated drinking water and carcinogens.\n\nThe report further noted the Delta ecosystems such as mangroves had been utterly devastated and that institutional control measures in place both in the oil industry and the Government were not implemented adequately.\n\nThe report which was released in August 2011, examined over the course of two years the environmental impact of oil industry operations in the area since the late 1950s. It found that oil contamination in Ogoniland is extensive and is having a grave impact on the environment, with pollution penetrating further and deeper than previously thought. It therefore, proposed the establishment of a Restoration Authority with an explicit mandate to clean up Ogoniland and restore the ecosystems.\n\nThe report also recommended the establishment of an Ogoniland Environmental Restoration Fund with an initial capitalization of $1 billion to cover the clean-up costs. The government of Goodluck Jonathan, then vice president who had become president after the dead by Yar\u2019Adua in 2010, could not act on the report, and it became part of the APC and Buhari\u2019s campaign promises ahead of the 2015 presidential election which Jonathan lost to Buhari.\n\nBut seven years down the road, nothing has been done beyond committees, official launch and press releases. However, in a sense, walking around the communities, it is hard to see how such clean up as recommended by UNEP can be realistically accomplished. The locations where oil spills are very visible are few and far between.\n\nA proper clean up would therefore entail excavating soil from a vast areas of land and importing soil for replacement. The question that then arises is where such amount of soil that would be required will be gotten and how communities would be evaluated and their homes probably demolished for such wholesale clean up to be done. Indeed, going round Ogoni land it\u2019s easy to see that for the foreseeable future, the cleanup will remain a topic for politics and political settlement for the boys.\n\nPerhaps basking on the euphoria of the clean up campaign that never took place, the Buhari government had over the last couple of years, made attempts to resume oil production in Ogoni land, but the attempts had thus far fell through on account of staunch resistance from the people who are ever resolute in their opposition.\n\nIndeed, as our team would learn, accessing the locality was a dangerous undertaking, as armed youths often mounted roadblocks and demanded heavy bribes from anyone who wanted to access the spill sites.\n\n\u201cThese boys don\u2019t fear rifle,\u201d one of our police escorts had remarked to emphasis how helpless we all were. \u201cIf you fire at them, bullets won\u2019t penetrate. They have defied even the federal government.\u201d\n\nOur concern grew when our guide, unsure of what would come to him for his effort, began to demand that we go through what he called \u201cnormal protocol,\u201d which according to him, meant meeting with the community leaders and meeting their demands. In any case, the matter was eventually settled.\n\nWe had arrived Port Harcourt at exactly 8:14 am for an on-the-spot assessment of the impact of oil exploration in Ogoni, and indeed Rivers State. The Rivers capital had been in the news for its soot problem, and Mr. Nyesom Wike, governor of the state had declared war against operators of illegal refineries blamed for the soot.\n\n\u201cThe soot is a big problem for us,\u201d lamented Clinton, a taxi driver who drove us from the airport. \u201cIf you park your vehicle at night, by the time you wake up in the morning, the soot would have covered it completely.\u201d\n\nClinton further lamented that rain water turn black and accessing potable water is a huge challenge. As we would find out, from Port Harcourt to Ogoni and elsewhere in the state, the people have become accustomed to black rain.\n\n\u201cWe are suffering here,\u201d said Mr. Paulinus Nsirim, the state commissioner for information. \u201cThe effect of oil exploration is ruining our environment, and our cries have been ignored by the federal government.\u201d\n\nNsirim regretted that even the Ogoni clean up launched by the Buhari government has failed to take off, while also blaming security agencies who he said are conniving with owners of illegal refineries in the state for the soot pollution.",

          "text": "By OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nThe Lagos Chamber of Commerce & Industry (LCCI) has called for gradual withdrawal of fuel subsidy, noting that it understands the concerns that total withdrawal will inflict more economic hardship on Nigerians.\n\nThe chamber which made the call in statement by Dr. Chinyere Almona, its Director-General, in response to the decision of federal government to suspend its plan to remove fuel subsidy on Monday, noted that the government cannot afford to continue to pay N1.5 trillion on subsidy, while conceding the concerns of Nigerians about the implications of it withdrawal are genuine.\n\nIt therefore, asked the government to pursue phased withdrawal while gradually developing critical infrastructure to enhance economic productivity.\n\nThe chamber also asked the government to ensure that the recently signed Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) is implemented fully.\n\n\u201cThe signing of the Petroleum Industry Bill into law by President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR on the 16th of August 2021 was well-received by all major stakeholders and seen as a commendable act by the government. The political will to sign the Bill into law was highly applauded because of the expectations of many on the full exploitation of the inherent potentials of the oil and gas sector,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cThe Chamber had earlier issued a statement commending the Federal Government and made a strong case for best practice in the implementation of the Petroleum Industry Act 2021. Less than a year into the signing of the Act, the implementation has suffered a flip-flop as some of the provisions of the Act are being suspended.\n\n\u201cWhile we support the full implementation of the PIA and the total deregulation of the oil and gas sector, we are not insensitive to the plight of the masses that may feel the pains of some of the provisions like the removal of fuel subsidies. Since the announcement of the planned removal of fuel subsidies, there have been numerous reactions expressing displeasure and readiness to stage protests against the planned action. The government on the other hand had expressed its concerns about the unsustainable subsidy payment which has become a strain on government revenue.\n\n\u201cWith a monthly payment of about N250 billion to subsidize fuel consumption, the implication is that an additional N1.5trillion expenditure has to be provided for in the 2022 federal budget. With additional expenditure against the projected revenue, deficit financing will be needed to support the budget expenditure. We are likely to see government borrow more than projected to finance the bloated expenditure in the face of revenue mobilization challenge.\n\n\u201cIn the face of this dilemma, we recommend that the removal is phased and with a complement of heavy investment in critical infrastructure that supports production in the economy. More production means more job creation, poverty reduction, and improved economic growth.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government must consider doing all that is possible not to truncate the implementation of the PIA 2021 which has already brought so much hope for industry watchers as a big game-changer for the oil and gas sector. There is a need for stakeholders\u2019 consultations on addressing the implications of lapsed provisions of the Act and forging the way ahead towards the full implementation of the Act.\u201d\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "title": "CBN Meeting in focus, Spotlight shines on Fed",
          "text": "By Lukman Otunuga\n\nIt is not only the Federal Reserve that will be under the spotlight this week.\n\nFor those with an interest in Africa\u2019s largest economy, all eyes will be on the Central Bank of Nigeria which is widely expected to conclude with interest rates left unchanged. Back in November, the central bank decided to leave interest rates unchanged at 11.5%. Since then, nothing much has changed economically with the same key themes still in play.\n\nWhile other countries across the globe are experiencing untamed inflation, Nigeria\u2019s inflation continues to slow. Although the annual inflation rate rose to 15.63% in December, after eight straight months of declines \u2013 the trend still points south. This continues to provide the CBN enough breathing room to leave interest rates unchanged in an effort to promote economic growth.\n\nBut the key question remains for how long? As the Fed and other major banks tighten monetary policy, the CBN may be forced to act \u2013 especially if interest differentials widen between the Naira and other currencies. Domestically, pre-election spending ahead of the general elections in 2023 could rekindle inflationary pressures \u2013 possibly forcing the CBN to take action. While the first MPC meeting of the CBN may be a non-event as the central bank sticks to the script, 2022 promises to be eventful for the bank and the Nigerian economy.\n\nMarkets Cautious Ahead Of Russia-Ukraine tensions and Fed Meeting\n\nAsian stocks flashed red on Tuesday morning, alongside U.S futures after an explosively volatile session on Wall Street.\n\nGlobal equity markets were flung on a chaotic rollercoaster ride as investors grappled with Fed hike fears and mounting geopolitical tensions over Ukraine. In the currency space, king dollar edged higher despite the slight retreat in Treasury yields while gold glittered amid the risk aversion.\n\nEuropean markets are catching up on the strong US close this morning, but the caution in Asia has cast a cloud over sentiment as investors would prefer to shrug off the intense volatility that rattled global markets on Monday.\n\nAlthough Wall Street swung back toward positive territory yesterday as investors exploited the selloff to snatch discounted shares, US equity bulls are certainly not out of the woods. Should inflation concerns, Fed hike fears, and geopolitical tensions fuel risk aversion in the days ahead, this could spell trouble for risk assets across the globe.\n\nOvernight, Australia\u2019s inflation jumped to 3.5% in the fourth quarter of 2021 amid rising petrol and housing costs. The Australian dollar pushed higher during early trading as expectations rose over the RBA adopting a more hawkish tone at its next monetary policy meeting on February 1. Traders are currently pricing in a 58% chance of a rate hike by May 2022, with June fully discounted.\n\nSpotlight swings on Fed meeting\n\nAlthough monetary policy is widely expected to remain unchanged, the FOMC meeting could provide some key insight into how aggressive the Fed intends to tighten policy throughout 2022. Markets expect the central bank to signal on Wednesday that it plans to hike interest rates in March, with a total of four 25 basis point interest rates increases expected by the end of this year. While the Fed may stick to the script, any hesitancy on future rate increases or a more dovish tone could breathe life back into riskier assets. Alternatively, a hawkish Fed may deal another blow to stock markets, injecting equities bears with fresh confidence.\n\nCommodity spotlight \u2013 Gold\n\nGold kicked off the week on a firm note as geopolitical tensions accelerated the flight to safety.\n\nThe slight retreat in Treasury yields also helped zero-yielding gold, as prices ventured towards the $1845 resistance level. There is no doubt that this will be a big week for gold with its near-term outlook likely to be influenced by the Fed meeting.\n\nA hawkish Fed that signals multiple rate hikes could dampen the appetite for gold, resulting in prices sinking back towards $1831 and $1810. If the Fed surprises markets by deviating from the script and shows hesitancy in future rate hikes, this may push the precious metal higher towards $1870.\n\nLukman Otunuga is a Senior Research Analyst at FXTM\n\nFor more visit: FXTM",

Now that you have 28 children, you have two more to go.\u201d\n\nResponding, Ado-Doguwa said, \u201cYes, between now and 2023, before the election comes, if you allow that, then I will have a polling unit within my home.\u201d\n\nThe Speaker said, \u201cCongratulations, Leader of the House.\u201d\n\nThe Majority Leader replied, \u201cThank you so much, Mr Speaker.

Now that you have 28 children, you have two more to go.\u201d\n\nResponding, Ado-Doguwa said, \u201cYes, between now and 2023, before the election comes, if you allow that, then I will have a polling unit within my home.\u201d\n\nThe Speaker said, \u201cCongratulations, Leader of the House.\u201d\n\nThe Majority Leader replied, \u201cThank you so much, Mr Speaker.

          "text": "A complaint challenging the competence of Governor Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the All Progressives Congress has been dismissed by a Federal High Court in Port Harcourt, Rivers State.\n\nDelivering judgement on the suit no: FHC/ABJ/857/2021, Justice Pheobe Msuen Ayua struck out the name of the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, the APC National Working Committee, and the National Secretary, CECPC, sued as second, third and fourth Defendants, respectively, for being non-juristic persons.\n\nA Delta State High Court, had on October 15, 2021, struck out an action filed by Elvis Ayomanor and others, challenging the APC Ward, LGA and State Congresses.\n\nAnother Delta State High Court, presided over by Justice G.B Briki-Okolosi, had also, on December 22, 2021, struck out Suit No: A/139/ 2021, between Chukwusa Edafe Matthew and 14 others Vs. APC and others, to set aside the APC Ward, LGA and State Congresses in Delta State.\n\nThe Court held that the action was non-justiciable and incurably incompetent, noting that the substratum of the matter bordered on the internal affairs of the APC.\n\nThe Federal High Court ruling has, therefore, put to rest issues surrounding the legality of the Buni-led Caretaker Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee.\n\nThe ruling corroborates a Supreme Court judgement, which held \u201cthat the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party is empowered to create, elect and appoint Committees (including the instant CECPC) or any other committee it may deem necessary to act in any capacity.\u201d\n\nRecall that the ruling party has been enmeshed in crisis, with leaders divided into power blocs, as the struggle for the control of the party structure hots up, ahead of the 2023 elections.\n\nHowever, a chieftain of the party and Commissioner for Information and Communications in Kogi State, Kingsley Fanwo, has dismissed the notion of a crisis in the party.\n\nFanwo, who made the clarifications while speaking to the media on Friday, said what was happening in the party should be expected.\n\n\u201cThe party is not in any form of crisis. What we have is an attrition of interests, which is normal in a ruling party that many believe, will continue to lead Nigeria beyond 2023.\n\n\u201cThe Mai Mala Buni leadership of the party has done very well in stabilising the party and attracting political heavyweights into the party. PDP is saying there is a problem in APC, and their Governors, Senators and other heavyweights are dumping their party for the ruling APC. Who is in crisis here?\n\n\u201cCrisis ridden parties are not naturally attractive, so Nigerians know which party is struggling and lamenting. If they think Nigerians have forgotten how they destroyed this country, they will know better in 2023,\u201d he stated.",

We have also always recommended what we consider as the ways out of the unprecedented security challenges facing us.\n\n\u201cIn this respect, we strongly call on the present administration under President Muhammadu Buhari to ensure the introduction of state police equipped with requisite means to enhance security in the states and that of the federation ultimately.\n\n\u201cThe performance of Amotekun Security Network in the South West in conjunction with the Nigerian Police has shown clearly that all the criticisms against state police are unfounded and self-serving.\u201d",

          "text": "Major players in the security circle and top government functionaries at both the federal and state levels Tuesday gathered in Abuja to brainstorm on arresting the trend of insecurity in the North-east and fashion a way out for a robust future for the region.\n\nAt the consultative meeting codenamed North East Stabilization and Development Master Plan (NESDMP), were Federal Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) as well as security agencies.\n\nThe attendees were Borno state Governor and Chairman North East Governors Forum Professor Babagana Umaru Zulum, Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Hajia Sadiya Umar Farouq, Minister of Communications and Digital Economy Professor Isa Pantami, Chief of Defence Staff General Lucky Irabor, Inspector General of Police Baba Usman Alkali and National Security Adviser Major-General Babagana Monguno(retd), among several stakeholders.\n\nZulum speaks\n\nSpeaking at the meeting held at the Congress Hall of Transcorp Hilton, Governor Zulum said the state government had initiated a 25-year master plan to rebuild the North East.\n\nHe said: \u201cLet me start by thanking President Muhammadu Buhari and the minister of Humanitarian Affairs for their interventions in ensuring that there is peace in the North East. We all understand the crucial role that consistency can play in bringing back peace, stability and prosperity in the North East in particular and Nigeria in general. This is where this plan becomes cardinally important. Who is not in a hurry for peace? Who is not impatient with poverty? That is why this plan must be ambitious, broad, brave, comprehensive to cover the whole scope of issues in the Northeast.\n\n\u201cThe plan will outlive our regimes. It will be a reflection of our doggedness to rise from the ashes of destruction into the bright and welcoming place of peace and development. Our aspirations, as governors and people of the region, therefore, are to be deliberate to build back better everything that we lost and much more. The work may appear to be daunting, but rest assured that the bulk will be made easier than we can imagine through the unflinching support you will receive from the leadership in the northeast as a whole. Given the dreams to build back, the yearning of our people to see practical result within a short period of time, our respective states in the North East will make available plans for the purpose of alignment and synergy that will deliver better quality service to the people of the northeast.\n\n\u201cUsing Borno state as an example, we will make available our 25-year development plan as starting point on our own side. My colleagues will provide that as well. It is important that we are not starting from ground zero. Building on efforts already on ground, we will ensure that we are not just making plans that don\u2019t talk with one another. We will make plans, we will review plans and integrate plans all targeted towards achieving a common purpose governed by good leadership and commitment to finish whatever we start.\n\n\u201cThis is not a political plan. It is a people\u2019s plan. A strategic direction to bring back peace in the North East. I implore everyone involved to help us bring back the lost glory of the north east. The need to have a strong coordination mechanism in the North East cannot be overemphasised. Borno state has already established Agency for Sustainable Development Partnership and Coordination, with the main objective of ensuring coordination of all humanitarian interventions.\n\n\u201cThe North East needs all horizontal and vertical coordination to ensure and sustain the coordination mechanism of the region. Without this, we cannot achieve a lot. It is not a bookshelf plan nor an academic paper, but a strategic, trusted master plan for the development of the northeast. The start of this project will not be the end of it, so I charge my fellow governors and leaders to see through the entire process. Good thinking produces great product. Once a plan is good, implementing it becomes a routine that any leader after us can pick up and practise without much stress.\u201d\n\nSadiya Farouq\n\n.\n\nAlso speaking, Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development Hajiya Umar Farouq said the meeting was in obedience to the directive of President Muhammadu Buhari for a lasting peace to be found to the issue of insecurity in the North East.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe North East Development Commission (NEDC) came into existence on 25 October 2017, when President Muhammadu Buhari assented to the NEDC (Establishment) Act, 2017. This was in fulfilment of the pledge of the Buhari Administration to fast track the development of the region, following the devastation suffered as a result of insurgency.\n\n\u201cOn 8th May 2019, on the sidelines of the FEC meeting, President Muhammadu Buhari inaugurated the Governing Board of the NEDC and directed the board to take over the activities and structures of all federal government funded agencies working in the sub-region. Prior to the establishment of the NEDC, various organizations set up by the Nigerian government were involved in the reconstruction, rehabilitation and provision of humanitarian action to the people of the north east.\n\n?\n\n\u201cWith the establishment of the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs Disaster Management and Social Development on the 21st of August 2019, with my humble self as the pioneer Minister, the NEDC was one of agencies placed under the supervision of the ministry.\n\n\u201cThe necessity for a North East master plan is stated in SECTION 8 (1C) of the NEDC Act, which lists as one of the functions of the NEDC to \u2018develop a Master Plan based on the needs assessment of the zone to be known as the North East Stabilisation and Development Master Plan (NESDMP), which shall contain programmes and schemes that promote and facilitate the physical and socio economic development of the North East Zone and the estimate of the time and costs for implementing such programmes and schemes.\n\n\u201cThe convening of this consultative session is in compliance with both Section 8(1c) of the NEDC Act, as well as the presidential directive to the NEDC Board. I wish to therefore commend the NEDC Board for sticking to the plan and following due process in its implementation.\n\n\u201cDespite being in the process of developing the Master Plan, I am pleased to state the NEDC has not been static and continue to leave its footprints across all the North East states with life changing projects and programmes for our citizens. I have personally commissioned several projects that have received positive feedback from Governors of North East States.\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that our strategic focus at the Ministry now is the provision of coordinated sustainable humanitarian action centred on the global best principle, the \u2018Triple Nexus\u2019 approach. This is anchored in a home-grown National Humanitarian-Development-Peace framework developed through a consultative process aimed at reducing vulnerabilities to support and promote peace and stability in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe are also pushing for the principles of localisation through institutional strengthening and capacity building of local stakeholders including affected communities, civil societies, non-governmental organisation and of course national government. This is guided by the National localization framework developed and validated, which is focused on making all humanitarian interventions as local as possible.\u201d\n\nIrabo\n\nOn his part, the Chief of Defence Staff, General Lucky Irabor, who was represented by Commander Defence Headquarters\u2019 Garrison, Major-General Preye Fakrogha, said prosecution of arrested terrorists will go a long way in assuaging the feelings of Nigerians and bringing justice to the grassroots, advocating for judicial reforms.\n\nHe said: \u201cI consider it a privilege to be here today to interact with this distinguished audience on the development of the North-East Stabilisation and Development Master Plan (NESDMP)- this owing to my field experience in the North East and coming to terms with the stark reality of the situation.\n\n\u201cAs you are aware, the NEDC was established with the responsibility to assess, coordinate, harmonise and report on all intervention programmes, and initiatives by the Federal Government or any of its Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), States; and other Development Partners and for the implementation of all programmes and initiatives for the North East states.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, in 2019, His Excellency President Muhammadu Buhari inaugurated the North East Development Commission Board for rebuilding the zones ravaged by Boko Haram insurgency. To this end, it would be recalled that in July 2021, the NEDC initiated a NESDMP to transform the North East region.\n\n\u201cThe primary objective of the master plan was to create a thriving region with the capacity to develop and support productive citizens while the main target of the Commission was to empower about 70 per cent of the population to be productively engaged in the economic activities of the region.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the NEDC Stabilisation Development Master Plan for the region was to be completed and validated by December 2021, while implementation was to commence in January 2022. You will agree with me that this task is herculean, but not impossible, as such, it has necessitated the birthing of this gathering.\n\n\u201cI will like to leverage my first-hand experience in the Theatre of Operations in the North-East to humbly say that at least, I am familiar with the diverse challenges, sufferings and devastations that have accompanied the war against terrorism in the region. To this end, I enjoin that our contributions and inputs be focused on the evolution of a master plan hinged around the development of infrastructure, social amenities and activities to win the hearts and minds of the populace in the North East region.\n\n\u201cThe NEDC master plan should inculcate the provision of health care facilities through the development of health care infrastructure and delivery services in the region. Again, of utmost importance is the upgrade and expansion of educational facilities and standards to achieve an educated populace. Furthermore, the development of purposeful and holistic infrastructural upgrades would expand the entrepreneurial base and increase productivity by eliminating trade barriers in the region.\n\n\u201cTherefore, it is my hope that with these critical areas adequately accommodated in the Master Plan, we would be on our way to assuredly guarantee the attainment of stability, development and prosperity for all in the North-East and Nigeria in general towards enhanced national security.\n\n\u201cI believe that the current leadership of the North-East Development Commission is adequately motivated to effectively implement the Master plan when adopted to achieve the desired results. More so, it has been established that for peacebuilding and stabilization plans such as NESDMP to be successful, there is the need for a whole-of-society approach involving local communities.\n\n\u201cThus, it is envisaged that the Commission would need to diligently carry along the local communities particularly religious and traditional leaders for the reconstruction programmes to be successful.\n\n\u201cGoing further, it is my candid belief that the implementation of capacity building programmes is integral to the development and recovery of the North East. It is essential to articulate a policy that integrates donors and other relevant stakeholders to support the government in the design of long-term, multi-sector capacity building programmes. In addition, the necessity for judicial reforms to fast-track the speedy dispensation of justice of arrested terrorists should be considered. This would bring justice to the grassroots and portray Government in positive light.\n\n\u201cI will like to add that all these initiatives proffered for the NEDC are critical towards building trust amongst the populace in the North East. This will ultimately have a multiplier effect on military operations as the populace would be more receptive to the AFN. I would like to state unequivocally, the AFN is ready to support the NEDC recovery efforts as may be encapsulated in the master plan.\u201d\n\nNEDC\n\nSimilarly, Managing Director/CEO North East Development Commission (NEDC) Mohammed G. Alkali said since the inception of the commission, it had executed modest projects necessary for humanitarian assistance, recovery, stabilization, and peace building in the region, but solicited more cooperation to achieve the objectives for its establishment.\n\nHe said: \u201cTowards producing a holistic Master Plan that can be implemented diversely and comprehensively in the North East, the Commission has consulted relevant Stakeholders in a bottom-up approach. So far, engagements on the Master Plan were held at Grassroots level in all the 112 LGAs in the Region, as well as with Humanitarian, Development and Peace building (HDP) Actors, representatives of all Member States, CSOs/CBOs, the private sector and federal legislators from the region.\n\n\u201cThe event we are witnessing today is one of the high points of such consultations because all the Federal MDAs and Security Agencies execute priceless and impactful interventions in the North-East Region. Both the Localization Framework of the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, DM&SD, and the general mandate of the NEDC as the Federal Coordinating Agency in the North-East Region make it imperative that Federal MDAs are actively involved in evolving a comprehensive Master Plan, which when approved, will serve as a compendium of relevant, demand-driven, viable and sustainable schemes, programmes and projects, which all Stakeholders can key into.\n\n\u201cIn today\u2019s interaction, the Commission will present an overview on the current status of the Master Plan Project and seek to harness inputs from the MDAs and Security Agencies for inclusion in the Plan. I am happy to report that so far, Baseline Surveys for needs assessment of the NE Region have been completed. Also, the Draft NEDC and North-East Region Strategy Documents and proposed Pillars of the ten-year Master Plan are ready.\n\n\u201cSince the inception of the Commission, we have been executing modest projects that are necessary for humanitarian assistance, recovery, stabilization, and peace building in the Region under the inspirational guidance and invaluable support of the Honourable Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, DM&SD, Hajiya Sadiya Umar Farouq.\n\n\u201cWe have also been enjoying maximum cooperation and support from all the 6 Member State Governments in the Region. On this note, I wish to express our deep appreciation to the Chairman of the North-East Governors\u2019 Forum, His Excellency Professor Babagana Umara Zulum, FNSE, mni, the Executive Governor of Borno State, and all his colleagues for their relentless patronage. We hope that this collaboration and understanding will continue to wax stronger with time.\u201d",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nNigeria may have to continue to borrow due to the suspension of the removal of fuel subsidy, the Presidency said on Wednesday.\n\nThe President\u2019s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, stated this during an interview on Channels Television\u2019s breakfast programme, Sunrise Daily.\n\n\u201cHead or tail, Nigeria will have to pay a price,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s either we pay the price for the removal in consonance and in conjunction with the understanding of the people, but if that will not come, the other cost is that borrowings may continue, and things may be difficult fiscally with both the states and the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cYou know how much could have been saved if the subsidy was removed and how it could have been diverted to other areas and spheres of national life. But if you do not go that way now \u2013 and I agree that it may not be auspicious to go that way, then we have to pay a price.\u201d\n\nLast year, the Senate approved some loan requests by the government. This included the approval of $6.1 billion, as well as the $16,230,077,718 and \u20ac1,020,000,000 loan requests in July and November respectively.\n\nAccording to Adesina, oil prices have been fluctuating globally for years as a result of one reason or the other, particularly due to COVID since 2019.\n\nHe stated that the price witnessed a decline as low as $30 per barrel, but later rose above $80 per barrel.\n\nREAD ALSO: NLC Suspends Planned Nationwide Protest\n\nAn initial announcement to remove fuel subsidy in June was rejected by individuals and groups accusing the government of inflicting more suffering on Nigerians.\n\nOn Monday, the Minister of Finance, Budget, and National Planning, Mrs Zainab Ahmed, said removing fuel subsidy at this time would be problematic, thus the decision has been suspended.\n\nBut many, including the President of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Olumide Akpata, believe the suspension of the fuel subsidy removal has to do with the coming elections in 2023.\n\n\u201cIt is a valid thing [to do],\u201d Adesina said of the government\u2019s suspension of the removal, adding, \u201cbut is this done because of elections next year? No.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is done because as the minister (of finance) stated, the timing is not auspicious, inflation is still high. In the past eight months, we saw inflation reducing but the last month, it went up again; further consultations need to happen with all the stakeholders.\u201d\n\nFor the President\u2019s spokesman, the government across the world is always mindful of its actions and decisions in a pre-election year, citing the developments in the United States and their impacts on the country\u2019s poll.\n\nHe also debunked claims that the present administration\u2019s proposal to extend the removal of fuel subsidy by 18 months was intended to booby-trap the next president.\n\n\u201cThat was not the intention, the intention was also stated \u2013 the timing is not right, it will exacerbate the hardship of the people and the President genuinely cares,\u201d Adesina said.\n\n\u201cPolitics is a part of our lives, but elections will just be one event in the life of the country. When elections come, they go, the country continues. This fuel subsidy, whether it stays or goes, is going to have a serious impact on the economy.\u201d",

          "text": "The Federal Government is proposing to extend the period for the implementation of the removal of subsidy on Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), popularly known as petrol, by 18 months.\n\nThe Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Mr Timipre Sylva, announced this on Tuesday while briefing State House correspondents in Abuja.\n\nHe disclosed that the government has concluded plans to approach the National Assembly to amend the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA).\n\nREAD ALSO: FG Moves To Suspend Removal Of Fuel Subsidy\n\n\u201cWe are proposing an 18-month extension but what the National Assembly is going to approve is up to them,\u201d the minister said. \u201cWe would approve an 18-month extension and then it is up to the National Assembly to look at it and pass the amendment as they see it.\n\n\u201cWith assent by the President on August 16, 2021, the PMS subsidy removal was therefore expected to take place effective February 16, 2022. However, following extensive consultations with all key stakeholders within and outside the government, it has been agreed that the implementation period for the removal of the subsidy should be extended.\n\n\u201cThis extension will give all the stakeholders time to ensure that the implementation is carried out in a manner that ensures all necessary modalities are in place to cushion the effect of the PMS subsidy removal, in line with prevailing economic realities.\n\n\u201cThe President assures that his administration will continue to put in place all necessary measures to protect the livelihoods of all Nigerians, especially the most vulnerable.\u201d\n\nSylva, who chairs the PIA Implementation Committee, stressed that the decision of the executive arm of government to seek an amendment of the law was not politically motivated.\n\nRather, he explained that such a move has become necessary to halt the potential suffering of the vulnerable in the society.\n\nThe minister believes other measures such as the Dangote refinery, the Port Harcourt refinery, and other modular refineries will have significantly come on stream by the end of the year.\n\nAccording to him, the new PIA provides for unrestricted market pricing for PMS from the effective date.\n\nSylva, however, stated that the PIA also envisaged the potential for supply disruption with its resultant effect on the economy.\n\n\u201cConsequently, it provides for a window of six months from the effective date for the government to request the services of NNPC Limited as the supplier of last resort.\n\n\u201cThis is to forestall supply disruptions and guide market readiness preparatory to migration to the deregulated pricing regime,\u201d he added.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, he stated, has assured Nigerians that his administration would continue to put in place all necessary measures to protect the livelihoods of the citizens, especially the most vulnerable.",

          "text": "Sadio Mane scored as Senegal beat nine-man Cape Verde 2-0 in the last 16 at the Africa Cup of Nations, but was immediately forced off with concussion.\n\nMane curled in off the underside of the crossbar soon after keeper Vozinha had been dismissed over a nasty clash of heads with the Liverpool forward.\n\nMane continued despite appearing to be briefly knocked out in the incident.\n\nAfter celebrating his goal he lay down on halfway, and before the game restarted he was led off the field.\n\nCape Verde midfielder Patrick Andrade had been shown a straight red card midway through the first half, while Bamba Dieng added Senegal\u2019s second in second-half injury time.\n\nThe match in Bafoussam was preceded by a minute\u2019s silence for the victims of the crush at the Olembe Stadium on Monday.\n\nSenegal will face either Mali or Equatorial Guinea in the last eight on Sunday.\n\nTournament organisers the Confederation of African Football may have questions to answer about their concussion protocols after Vozinha and Liverpool striker Mane were both floored in the 53rd minute.\n\nThe Cape Verde keeper rushed out of his box in an attempt to intercept a long kick downfield by Senegal keeper Edouard Mendy, and collided head-first at pace with Mane, who had got to the ball first and headed forward.\n\nAfter a lengthy stoppage a clearly groggy Vozinha was about to be substituted but, following a video assistant referee review, deserved to receive Cape Verde\u2019s second red card for his reckless challenge.\n\nSomehow Mane was deemed fit to continue and, after having a shot saved by substitute keeper Marcio Rosa, the forward then broke the deadlock from the resulting corner.\n\nSenegal manager Aliou Cisse said Mane had been taken to hospital following the game.\n\n\u201cHe felt faint, his head was spinning and he had to go there,\u201d said Cisse.\n\nMane later posted a picture from his hospital bed of himself and Vozinha on his Instagram account, adding that everything was well.\n\nMane\u2019s head clash was really uncomfortable to watch. It was clear that the Liverpool forward was knocked out as he fell and hit his head again on the turf \u2013 he looked like a defeated boxer.\n\nMeanwhile, the Cape Verde keeper couldn\u2019t walk straight before being ushered away by his team-mates following his red card.\n\nBut it\u2019s the aftermath that raises questions. Why wasn\u2019t Mane substituted straight away?\n\nYes, he scored not long after the collision but the decision not to take him off looked even more unwise when he laid down on the pitch following his goal and clearly looked in distress, before eventually being replaced.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a good look and you just hope Mane is OK.\n\nMore red cards in knock-out stages\n\nSenegal had topped their group despite scoring once in just three matches, and spurned several more chances in front of goal.\n\nMane hit the right-hand upright in the first minute, and the Teranga Lions had a man advantage 20 minutes later when Andrade was dismissed following a VAR consultation.\n\nHe had caught Pape Gueye on the top of the ankle with his studs and his initial yellow was upgraded to red, meaning all five last-16 ties at the tournament have had at least one sending-off.\n\nTwo men down, Cape Verde had few forays forward and Julio Tavares had their best chance with five minutes left but tamely flicked a cross straight at Mendy.\n\nDieng, who had earlier sent two attempts wide, wrapped up the game from a counter-attack as the islanders pushed for a late equaliser.\n\nSenegal were runners-up in 2019 and remain among the favourites to win the Nations Cup, but coach Aliou Cisse will need further improvements in the final third if the West Africans are to lift the trophy for the first time.",

          "text": "US President Joe Biden says he would consider personal sanctions on Vladimir Putin if Russia invades Ukraine.\n\nMr Biden said there would be \u201cenormous consequences\u201d for the world if Russia made a move on the nation, which sits on its south-western border.\n\nHis comments came as other Western leaders repeated warnings that Russia would pay a heavy price for invasion.\n\nRussia has accused the US and others of \u201cescalating tensions\u201d over the issue and denies planning to enter Ukraine.\n\nHowever, Moscow has deployed an estimated 100,000 soldiers near the border.\n\nThe Kremlin has said it sees the Western military alliance Nato as a security threat, and is demanding legal guarantees that it will not add new members further east, including neighbouring Ukraine. But the US has said the issue at stake is Russian aggression, not Nato expansion.\n\nFears of invasion have prompted Western embassies in Kyiv to withdraw some personnel.\n\nDiplomats from Russia, Ukraine, Germany and France will gather in Paris on Wednesday for talks about the ongoing tensions.\n\nTaking questions from reporters on Tuesday, Mr Biden replied \u201cyes\u201d when asked whether he could see himself imposing sanctions on the Russian president personally in the event of an invasion.\n\nSuch a move across Ukraine\u2019s border would mean \u201cenormous consequences worldwide\u201d and could amount to \u201cthe largest invasion since World War Two\u201d, he said.\n\nIn the past the US has imposed sanctions on foreign leaders including Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Venezuela\u2019s Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. Measures included blocking property and transactions related to the leaders\u2019 respective countries.\n\nMr Biden added that he would feel obliged to beef up Nato\u2019s presence in eastern Europe if Russia invaded. But he repeated that there were no plans to send US troops to Ukraine itself.\n\nOn Wednesday UK Foreign Minister Liz Truss echoed Mr Biden\u2019s words, telling the BBC\u2019s Today programme that the government has \u201cruled nothing out\u201d \u2013 including sanctions against the Russian leader \u2013 and said the UK is looking to \u201ctoughen up\u201d its sanctions on people, banks and businesses.\n\n\u201cWhat is important is that all of our allies do the same. It is by collective action. By showing Putin we\u2019re united, we will help deter a Russian incursion,\u201d she said.\n\nRussia responded angrily to Mr Biden\u2019s remarks. Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of the Russian parliament, posted on social media site Telegram: \u201cFinally, the US leadership has openly said what it wants: Washington wants a loyal Russian president.\u201d\n\nThe country has also accused the US and NATO of \u201cflooding\u201d Ukraine with weapons and Western advisers.\n\nThe US has already put 8,500 combat-ready troops on alert to deploy at short notice \u2013 partly to help reinforce Nato allies \u2013 which Russia said caused it \u201cgreat concern\u201d.\n\nWashington has also warned Russian ally Belarus that it would \u201cface a swift and decisive response\u201d if it assists in an invasion.\n\nDuring crisis talks on Monday, Western powers agreed to \u201cunprecedented\u201d sanctions against Russia if it were to invade.\n\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Tuesday that the Western allies would respond to any incursion with \u201csevere\u201d economic sanctions, adding that Britain was prepared to deploy troops to protect Nato allies in the region.\n\nHe raised the issue of banning Russia from the Swift international payments system, a move which senior Russian officials said meant Europe would not be able to pay for and receive Russian products.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron meanwhile said dialogue with Moscow would continue.\n\nHe would speak by phone to Mr Putin on Friday, he added, and seek clarification about Russia\u2019s intentions towards Ukraine.\n\nSeparately, Mr Biden\u2019s administration said it was working with oil and gas suppliers around the world to boost shipments to Europe in the event of Russia cutting off supplies, the New York Times reports.\n\nRussia currently provides about one-third of the crude oil and gas imported by the European Union.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky tried to reassure his nation in a TV address on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThere are no rose-coloured glasses, no childish illusions, everything is not simple\u2026 But there is hope,\u201d he said. \u201cProtect your body from viruses, your brain from lies, your heart from panic.\u201d\n\nRussia seized Ukrainian territory before, when it annexed Crimea in 2014. After Russian forces seized control, Crimea voted to join Russia in a referendum the West and Ukraine deemed illegal.\n\nRussian-backed rebels also control areas of eastern Ukraine near Russia\u2019s borders. That conflict has cost an estimated 14,000 lives, with a 2015 peace deal a long way from being fulfilled.",

          "title": "Nigeria to Amend Oil Law as Buhari Suspends Fuel Subsidy Removal for 18 Months",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government finally failed in its efforts to remove the highly contentious subsidy on petrol on Tuesday when it disclosed plan to recommend an 18-month extension of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) to the National Assembly.\n\nThis clearly means that the burden of the policy which has been described as a major drain and waste of resources would be shifted to the next administration from May 29, 2023, if the National Assembly approves an extension of the PIA\u2019s implementation.\n\nThe government\u2019s inability to take the tough decision on the subsidy issue is bound to have massive consequence on the overall implementation of the PIA.\n\nThe implementation of the PIA which stipulates the removal of petrol subsidy ought to be in February 2022 and was later shifted to July 2022. However, due to pressure and threats of protests by the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and the Trade Union Congress (TUC), the decision was on Monday suspended.\n\nSpeaking with journalists in Abuja, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, who spoke after a closed-door meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari, said the president graciously okayed the suspension of the removal of fuel subsidy until further notice.\n\nBut the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Tuesday reiterated the need for Nigeria to remove subsidies on petrol and channel such funds to health, social development and other critical sectors of the economy.\n\nThe Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) also announced the suspension of its nationwide protest.\n\nThis was just as the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) has advised the federal government to adopt a phased removal approach to the dilemma it was facing over the subsidy issue and the Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA) called for wider consultation on the matter.\n\nAccording to Sylva, the executive would propose 18 months extension to National Assembly for the implementation of the PIA.\n\nOn the possible legal implications after the assent to the PIA by President Buhari, Sylva said: \u201cWe also see the legal implications. There is six months provision in the PIA which will expire in February and that is why we are coming out to say that before the expiration of this time, as I said earlier, we will engage the legislature.\n\n\u201cWe believe that this will go to the legislature, we are applying for some amendment of the law so that we would still be within the law.\n\n\u201cWe are proposing an 18 months extension but what the National Assembly is going to approve is up to them. We would approve an 18 months extension and then it is up to the national Assembly to look at it and pass the amendment as they see it.\n\n\u201cWe are going to see how to rejig the law, this is not going to be the only amendment to the PIA. A few months ago, the President already proposed an amendment to the law. Mr. President already proposed some amendment.\n\n\u201cNow we are going to propose this amendment. There might be other amendments that will be proposed because that is the way the law is; we will continue to adjust it as we see fit, as we operate it.\u201d\n\nThe minister explained that the suspension of the subsidy removal was to give all stakeholders time to ensure that the implementation was carried out in a manner that guarantees that all necessary modalities are in place to cushion the effect of the planned removal.\n\nThe modalities, he said, included getting the refineries to work, introducing an alternate fuel for cars in form of auto gas and possible palliatives for Nigerians.\n\n\u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari has agreed to an extension of the statutory period for the implementation of the removal of subsidy on petrol in accordance with extant laws.\n\n\u201cHowever, following extensive consultations with all key stakeholders within and outside the government, it has been agreed that the implementation period for the removal of the subsidy should be extended.\n\n\u201cThis extension will give all the stakeholders time to ensure that the implementation is carried out in a manner that guarantees that all necessary modalities are in place to cushion the effect of the petrol subsidy removal in line with prevailing economic realities.\u2019\n\n\u201cAll those structures are not right now in place. One of those is to ensure that the refineries are working and you\u2019re all aware that steps are being taken for all the refineries to be functional very soon. The Dangote Refinery is expected to come on stream at the end of this year.\n\n\u201cAll our refineries, the Port Harcourt Refinery is expected to be performing at a certain capacity, not full capacity, by end of this year. There are some modular refineries that are also going to come on steam later this year.\n\n\u201cOf course, you\u2019re also aware that the rehabilitation of the refineries are ongoing, I already said that. Dangote Refinery is already on, we are hoping that by the end of this year, the refineries will be functional, at least to a great extent, not necessarily the nameplate capacity, Port Harcourt Refineries especially, will be producing. We are also expecting that Dangote Refinery will also have come on stream,\u201d he explained.\n\nSpeaking further he said: \u201cAlso, there is discussion of introducing an alternate fuel for cars in the form of auto gas and somebody asked, what has happened since launching. A lot has gone on there, in fact, even today, if you had noticed, I briefed Mr. President on the progress that has been made on auto gas. We are hoping that in March or April, the conversion processes will begin.\n\n\u201cWe promised that one million cars will be converted initially, and of course, the corresponding amount of gas filling stations will also be built. That is in progress and I want to assure you that it will happen very soon. That also has to be in place before we say okay, we want to take out subsidies.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also looking at palliatives. The Minister of Finance and her team are looking at possible palliatives for Nigerians as well. So, because all these have to converge before we announce the complete removal of subsidy, because Mr. President, especially wants us to ensure that this doesn\u2019t have too much impact on the people, we are now extending the time for subsidy removal.\n\n\u201cI will not want to specifically mention the time of extension because that will be a product of a discussion with the National Assembly, because it is likely to involve an amendment of the PIA to extend extended time and I always do not want to preempt what timeframe the National Assembly will allow. But definitely at this moment, fuel subsidy removal is not on the card.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the likely effect of the subsidy removal on livelihoods of the poor, the Minister said: \u201cThe President assures that his administration will continue to put in place all necessary measures to protect the livelihoods of all Nigerians, especially the most vulnerable.\u2019\u2019\n\nOn queues at petrol stations that had resurfaced, he advised Nigerians to stop hoarding fuel nor engage in panic buying as government has no plans remove subsidy, Sylva said: \u201cWe don\u2019t intend to remove subsidy now. That is why we are making this announcement.\u201d\n\nAsked if the suspension has anything to do with 2023 general elections, he said: \u201cOf course not. It\u2019s just the human face of the government, Mr. President especially wants certain structures in place. And he insisted if we want to remove subsidy, we must make sure that we put every measure in place to protect the suffering masses of Nigeria. That is the President\u2019s insistence. So we are now taking steps to ensure that these processes are in place.\u201d\n\nThe minister also assured that government would continue to engage the labour unions on the fuel subsidy issue saying, \u201cwe are already talking with labour, and our discussion with labour is also around this palliatives and mitigations.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cEngagement with labour, of course, this will continue. This is an ongoing process; we want to start. We\u2019ve been engaging labour for a long time, if you are aware and that engagement will be ongoing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a development process and maybe by July 2022, we\u2019ll be able to get back to you and give you additional developments from here.\n\n\u201cSo all these will have to come together. That\u2019s why we decided at this time, especially since we are running against time, with the legal timeframe approaching very quickly, we thought we should come to you and let you know that we are taking steps to amend the law and to ensure that we are within the law.\u201d\n\nOn the possibility of gradual increase in fuel price the, Sylva said: \u201cGradual or increment in whatever guise is not on the table.\u201d\n\nA THISDAY\u2019s analysis of documents from the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) showed that between January and December 2021, the federal government spent over N1.43 trillion on what it terms under-recovery on petrol.\n\nA breakdown of the various payments last year, indicated that the subsidy burden has increased progressively, growing from N24.3 billion in February 2021, to N60.3 billion in March and N61.9 billion in April this year.\n\nFurthermore, in May, the NNPC removed N126 billion as subsidy, while June came next with N164.3 billion. In July, the analysis showed that N103.2 billion was spent on under-recovery.\n\nHitherto, August had last year\u2019s lion\u2019s share of N173.1 billion, but was overtaken by the deduction in November of N200 billion, while September\u2019s deduction stood at N149.28 billion and the October figure was N163.709 billion, before the highest deductible amount yet of N270 billion in December.\n\nNigeria has not been able to reap the full benefits of rising international oil prices, which is now about $88 per barrel because it doesn\u2019t refine a drop of the fuel it consumes locally.\n\n\u201cOur refineries, the Port Harcourt refinery, is expected to be performing at a certain capacity, not full capacity by the end of this year. There are some modular refineries that are also going to come on stream later this year,\u201d Sylva stated.\n\nIMF Urges Nigeria to Remove Subsidy, Channel Funds to Health, Social Devt\n\nThe IMF has stressed the need for Nigeria to remove petrol subsidy and channel such funds to the health and social development sectors.\n\nThe Washington-based institution gave the advice in response to a THISDAY question during a media briefing on its latest World Economic Outlook (WEO).\n\nThe IMF however left its 2022 economic growth projection for Nigeria at 2.7 per cent, but raised the country\u2019s 2023 growth projection from 2.6 per cent to 2.7 per cent, which represented a 0.1 percentage points increase.\n\nThe Division Chief, Research Department, IMF, Mr. Malhar Nabar, said: \u201cIn terms of subsidy, we have for long not just for Nigeria, but for many low-income countries that have these programme of subsidy schemes in place, called for scaling back of poorly targeted subsidies to create fiscal space that can then be repurposed for meeting vital health and social spending needs. That recommendation applies in the case of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on Nigeria\u2019s growth projection, he said: \u201cWe have an unchanged growth projection for Nigeria for 2022 and this reflects offsetting effects that we had a slightly stronger outcome in the second half of last year, especially in the non-oil sector and this this momentum is expected to continue into 2022.\n\n\u201cBut now with the external headwinds with the impacts of Omicron, we do expect some drag going forward which will counterbalance a strong momentum going into this year.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, he noted that Nigeria\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio was low which if properly harnessed could put the country on a path to sustainable recovery.\n\nNabar added: \u201cIn terms of the debt situation, among low-income countries, Nigeria in terms of its public debt to GDP ratio, is actually relatively on the low side compared to other low-income countries.\n\n\u201cSo, going forward, that is certainly providing a little bit more space to provide the needed support for combating the health emergency and also putting Nigeria on the path to a sustainable recovery.\u201d\n\nNLC: Why We Suspended Protest\n\nThe labour movement said it\u2019s decision to suspend the protest was based on the policy reversal by the government which was formally communicated to it on Monday.\n\nAddressing journalists shortly after a virtual National Executive Council (NEC) meeting of the NLC yesterday, its President, Mr. Ayuba Wabba said: \u201cNEC after vigorous debates took a decision to suspend the planned nationwide protest scheduled for 27\u2033 January 2022 and the national protest scheduled for 2\u2033 February 2022.\u201d\n\nHe said NEC met Tuesday morning virtually to consider the new position of the government and that at the end of the meeting, it resolved to suspend the protest and to direct the state chapters and all affiliates to discontinue mobilisation for the protest.\n\nHe said: \u201cAt the peak of very rigorous mobilisation of Nigerians by the NLC and a host of her civil society allies, the government through the Minister of Finance yesterday, 24\u201d January 2022 made a public announcement reversing the plans to increase petrol pump price.\n\n\u201cThe position of the government was also officially communicated to the Congress with calls for further engagement. Following the reversal and reapproach by government, the National Executive Council of the Nigeria Labour Congress met this morning virtually to consider the new position of the government.\u201d\n\nWabba said going forward, labour would continue to engage with the government on the very critical issues of ensuring local refining of petroleum, creation of sustainable jobs and affordable price of petrol for Nigerian workers and people.\n\nWhen asked about the steps labour would take to ensure that federal government does not renege on its pledge to shelve the policy on removal of fuel subsidy, Wabba said organised labour has a traditional of holding authorities accountable to their words, adding that NLC and its allies would use all instruments available to them to ensure that no policy measure that is injurious to workers and their families is allowed to go unchallenged.\n\nLCCI Calls for Phased Removal of Fuel Subsidy\n\nThe LCCI urged the government to do all it could to avoid truncating the implementation of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), which it said has suffered a flip-flop as some of its provisions are being suspended.\n\nThe Director General of the LCCI, Dr. Chinyere Almona, who expressed the chamber\u2019s reaction yesterday in a statement titled: \u201cLCCI Statement on the Suspension of Fuel Subsidy Removal,\u201d said: \u201cIn the face of this dilemma, we recommend that the removal is phased and with a complement of heavy investment in critical infrastructure that supports production in the economy. More production means more job creation, poverty reduction, and improved economic growth.\n\n\u201cThe federal government must consider doing all that is possible not to truncate the implementation of the PIA 2021, which has already brought so much hope for industry watchers as a big game-changer for the oil and gas sector.\n\n\u201cThere is a need for stakeholders\u2019 consultations on addressing the implications of lapsed provisions of the Act and forging the way ahead towards the full implementation of the PIA.\u201d\n\nAlmona pointed out that the major implication of the suspension was that it would increase the 2022 national budget\u2019s deficit by N1.5 trillion and constrain the federal government to borrow more than it has projected within the fiscal year.\n\nShe said: \u201cWith a monthly payment of about N250 billion to subsidise fuel consumption, the implication is that an additional N1.5 trillion expenditure has to be provided for in the 2022 federal budget.\n\n\u201cWith additional expenditure against the projected revenue, deficit financing will be needed to support the budget expenditure. We are likely to see government borrow more than projected to finance the bloated expenditure in the face of revenue mobilization challenge.\u201d\n\nThe LCCI stated that while it supported the full implementation of the PIA and the total deregulation of the oil and gas sector, \u201cwe are not insensitive to the plight of the masses that may feel the pains of some of the provisions like the removal of fuel subsidies.\u201d\n\nNACCIMA Calls for Wider Consultation\n\nNACCIMA has described the federal government\u2019s suspension of the implementation of fuel subsidy removal as a welcomed development, adding that it was not surprised by the development.\n\nIt said: \u201cWe acknowledge government\u2019s dilemma and difficulties for an enduring solution to the issue of removal of petroleum subsidy especially the prices of PMS. This decision to move the date and suspend subsidy removal beyond June is therefore not surprising. It appears as kicking the can down the road again. It is a welcome development.\n\n\u201cOn one hand is the issue of problem of relieving itself of the onerous burden of a burgeoning petrol subsidy. On the other hand, is how to come up with commensurate benefits to cushion the effect of removal of subsidy on the people or economy at large.\u201d\n\nThe Director General of NACCIMA, Ambassador Ayo Olukanni, said yesterday that, \u201cit is absolutely necessary to consider a practical and acceptable implementation plan in the quest to gradually weaning the public off petrol subsidy and cushion the impact with appropriate palliatives.\n\n\u201cThis can only be done in consultation with organised labour and other stakeholders including the private sector. Such an implementation plan must take into account appropriate timing aligned with the MTEF of government, as well as other concerns related to security.\n\n\u201cIt is equally important that all efforts must be made not to overheat the polity either by commission or omission especially as we move ahead to an election year. We need a peaceful Nigeria for businesses to thrive, and attract foreign investment. The decision to temporise on subsidy removal, such as contemplated by government, deserves support and we hope this step will give the required time for extensive and wide consultation.\u201d\n\nDeji Elumoye, Onyebuchi Ezigbo, Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja and Nume Ekeghe and Dike Onwuamaeze in Lagos",
          "summary": "The implementation of the PIA which stipulates the removal of petrol subsidy ought to be in February 2022 and was later shifted to July 2022.\nHowever, due to pressure and threats of protests by the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and the Trade Union Congress (TUC), the decision was on Monday suspended.\nThe Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) also announced the suspension of its nationwide protest.\nThis decision to move the date and suspend subsidy removal beyond June is therefore not surprising.\n\u201cOn one hand is the issue of problem of relieving itself of the onerous burden of a burgeoning petrol subsidy.",
